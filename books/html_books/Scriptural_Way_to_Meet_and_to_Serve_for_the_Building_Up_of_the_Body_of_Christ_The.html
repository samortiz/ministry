<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:23; 3:19; 1:10; 5:25b; Acts 20:28b; 1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10a; John 20:17; Heb. 2:11-12</h1>
<p>Prayer: Father, we do worship You. We worship You for Your economy; we worship You for Your Son; and we worship You for the Spirit. We worship You for choosing all of us. Thank You that we could have another training to look into Your Word, to get into Yourself, and to enjoy all the riches You have in Your Son for our portion. Lord, do cleanse us. How much we need Your cleansing! How we need, even the more, Your anointing. Anoint each one of us. Anoint the entire congregation. Lord, fill this hall with Yourself that we may be gathered into Your name, into Your Person, into Your presence. Lord, thank You for Your constant presence. We live in this presence. Now we gather in this presence. We speak in this presence, and we listen to Your word in this presence. Thank You that You are so available, so rich, and so much to us. Even now, while we are gathering, we enjoy You. Lord, do speak Yourself into each one of us. While we are speaking, Lord, speak in our speaking. Do something for Your move, for Your up-to-date move. Show us Your way. Show us what is within You, Your heart&rsquo;s desire. Lord, cover us from the attacks of the enemy. Destroy him. Put him into the corner. Put him to shame. As the church, we bind him in Your mighty name. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">To Have a People to Be the Body of Christ for<br />
a Corporate Expression of the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the God-ordained way to meet and to serve as revealed in the holy Word. First, we need to be impressed that the meetings of the believers should always be linked to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to have a people to be the Body of Christ for a corporate expression of the processed Triune God (Eph. 1:23; 3:19). The processed Triune God refers to God who has gone through so many processes. The Triune God came down from the heavens and passed through incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<p>The first process He went through was incarnation (John 1:14). Following this He passed through human living. Our God became a man in His incarnation, and as a man He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. In His first thirty years He lived as a poor Nazarene in a poor carpenter&rsquo;s home in the despised village of Nazareth. For us as men to live on this earth is commonplace, but for the infinite God, the eternal God, the unlimited God without beginning or ending, the Creator of all things, to live among human beings and work as a carpenter is wonderful. We may think that He lived in Nazareth all that time for nothing. But His living there was very meaningful. If the President of the United States were to move to a small locality to live, many people would be investigating to see what he was doing there. Nobody would believe that he was doing nothing in this place. Everyone would think that he was doing something so crucial, secret, important, and strategic. Do you think that the Lord Jesus lived in a poor home in Nazareth for thirty years without doing anything? His living in a carpenter&rsquo;s home for thirty years day after day, week after week, month after month, and year after year is a wonderful mystery. Our God, the Triune God, the infinite God, the eternal God who created the heavens and the earth, became a man and lived purposefully on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. His human living was the second step of the process He went through.</p>
<p>The third step of this process was the all-inclusive crucifixion, the all-inclusive death that Christ passed through. By His death every negative thing in the universe was dealt with (Rom. 8:3; 6:6; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; Eph. 2:15), His life was released (John 12:24), and the church was redeemed (Eph. 5:25b; Acts 20:28b). Following this step was the step of resurrection. By His resurrection, He was glorified (Luke 24:26), He became the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33; John 20:17), making all of us His brothers (Rom. 8:29), and He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) breathed into us to be with us forever (John 20:22; 14:16-20).</p>
<p>The fifth step was His ascension, in which He was made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and given to be the Head over all things to the church, which is His Body (Eph. 1:22-23). Through His ascension, He went back to the heavens. He came down from the heavens as God, but He went back to the heavens as both God and man. He came only with divinity but He went back with both divinity and humanity. Before His incarnation, He was in the heavens merely as God. Now that He has gone back to the heavens, He is sitting on the throne not merely as God but as God and as man (Matt. 26:64; Heb. 1:3, 13; Ezek. 1:26). The wonderful Person on the throne is the God-man. Our God today is not merely God; our God today is the very God-man.</p>
<p>This God-man desires an expression on this earth. The church should be the corporate expression of the processed Triune God. We must keep this in mind whenever we come together to have a Christian meeting. Our meeting must be linked to this expression, the expression of the processed Triune God. In our meetings, all the items of the Triune God&rsquo;s process should be fully covered and fully realized. We are meeting here with His incarnation, with His human living, with His all-inclusive death, with His resurrection, and with His ascension. We need this kind of message, this kind of teaching, this kind of revelation, and this kind of vision.</p>
<p>We need to come into the meeting with a vision of God becoming a man and in human living passing through all kinds of trials and suffering all kinds of hardships. We should come to the meeting with a vision that He has accomplished an all-inclusive death to terminate all the negative things. We should come to the meeting with a vision that we have been terminated. Our self, our flesh, our natural man, and all that we are as descendants of Adam have been crucified on the cross. We also need to come to the meeting with a vision that He is now in resurrection, and in Him and with Him we are also in resurrection (Eph. 2:6). Furthermore, we should come to meet with the saints in ascension (Eph. 2:6). We are not only in the heavens but also in ascension. We need to keep in mind that whenever we come together, we are linked to all these things.</p>
<p>Moreover, we should have the realization that we are coming to the meeting not only as men. We are coming to the meeting in incarnation as God-men, as those who have been mingled with God (John 1:12-13; 2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17) and who have God living in them (1 John 4:15; 2 Cor. 13:5; Rom. 8:9; Eph. 4:6). While we are meeting, we are not Germans, Africans, Chinese, or Americans. We are meeting as God-men. If we have this vision, we will see that each one of the saints in the meeting is a God-man. There is no Chinese, no American, no German, and no French, but all are God-men! Can we meet this way? We have to say a strong &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; We meet as God-men! If we have this vision when we come to meet, we will be full of praises. When we assemble with the saints, we will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! I am a God-man coming here to meet with other God-men!&rdquo; Our meeting is not a meeting merely of Christian believers but of God-men. The vision of this one item will send us to the heavens. Our meeting is altogether linked with the processed Triune God, and we are in the meeting as a corporate expression of the processed Triune God according to His divine economy.</p><h2 class="head2">For the Heading Up of All Things in Christ<br />
through the Church as the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is for the heading up of all things in Christ through the church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:10). As we meet we are taking step after step to lead all the created things toward one direction, that is, to be headed up in Christ. Do we have such a consideration when we come into a Christian meeting? Our meeting today directs us toward the goal of all things being headed up in our Head, Christ. While we are singing, praising, and testifying, we declare that we are taking the lead as the firstfruit of His creatures (James 1:18) to lead all the creatures to the point of everything being headed up in Christ. Today the whole universe is in disorder and chaos, with no heading up. But one day the church will bring all the created things to one direction, that is, to the heading up of all things in Christ. If we repeat the following sentence five times, we will be different persons: the Christian meeting takes the lead to bring everything to the direction of all things being headed up in Christ.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for a young lady, after being married, to submit herself to her husband, taking the male as her head. Quite often the wives may argue with their husbands and say, &ldquo;Why do you have to be over me?&rdquo; They may not know the answer, but we know the answer. God created us this way. Paul tells us that &ldquo;the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God&rdquo; (1 Cor. 11:3). Between the wife and the husband, one must be the first. No one can change God&rsquo;s invention. All the sisters should say &ldquo;amen&rdquo; to their subjection. But today in the whole universe there is no such &ldquo;amen&rdquo; in God&rsquo;s creation. God is waiting to lead all His creatures into such a subjection through the church.</p>
<p>In our meeting have we been led into such a subjection to have all of us headed up in our Head, Christ? By His mercy and grace, we all have to say, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Are you dear saints who are the members of the church in your locality headed up in Christ? If you say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; how do you express your being headed up? We express this by our meetings. Look at our meetings. Our Christian meeting is a meeting altogether headed up into our Head, Christ. Every time we meet, we must have a clear understanding that our meeting today is linked to the heading up. The day will come when the entire universe is the same as our meeting today. Our meeting is a model, a miniature, of that day when all the created things in this universe are headed up in Christ for the believers&rsquo; universal meeting in the new heaven and new earth. Our Christian meeting is not a small thing. It testifies and declares that we are taking the lead in all of God&rsquo;s creation to reach the goal of the heading up of all things in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO HAVE THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being Redeemed<br />
by the Death of Christ</h2>
<p>In order to have the church meetings, we must first see that the church has been redeemed by the death of Christ (Eph. 5:25b; Acts 20:28b). The church is a group of extraordinary, peculiar people (Titus 2:14), a people privately possessed by God as His peculiar treasure (Exo. 19:5), His own possession (1 Pet. 2:9). We have been redeemed but the worldly people have not. To be redeemed is a particular characteristic of the church. We are the redeemed people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being Produced<br />
in the Resurrection of Christ</h2>
<p>As descendants of Adam, we were born in our natural birth into Adam. But as the church, we all have been produced in the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6). We are now a group of people in resurrection, not in our natural being. We have been redeemed and produced.</p>
<p>In the resurrection of Christ, we are no longer merely the descendants, the sons, of Adam. In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, we believers have been made the sons of God (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10a). This changes our nature, our being, our status, and our position. We are not merely the sons of man. Today we are the sons of God, not according to our natural birth but in the resurrection of Christ. We are a group of resurrected people. We are the descendants of God in resurrection. The Body of Christ is not composed of different races such as American or Chinese, but it is an aggregate of the sons of God. Every time we meet, we need to remember that we are coming to meet as sons of God. Then we will begin our meeting with the sonship in resurrection. In some so-called Christian meetings, people were fighting with one another. I heard of one meeting where a person threw his Bible at someone. They were fighting because they were meeting there not only as the sons of Adam but also as the sons of the Devil. We need a vision that we are meeting as the sons of God.</p>
<p>Today we have God as our Father with His life and nature, just as Christ has (John 20:17). When Christ was walking on this earth, He was walking as one who had God the Father in Him, with His life and nature. Thus, whatever He did was a manifestation of God the Father. Whenever He spoke, He spoke out God the Father (John 14:10, 24). We must come to the meeting with such an understanding. We are coming to the meeting as sons of God, having God the Father with His life and with His nature; therefore, whatever we do in the meeting should express our Father. Some brothers may have quarreled with one another in some meetings because they forgot that they were meeting as sons of God. They forgot their status.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Meeting with His Brothers in the Church</h2>
<p>The church was redeemed by the death of Christ, the church was produced in the resurrection of Christ, and now Christ meets with His brothers in the church (Heb. 2:11-12). Do we have a full realization that when we come to a meeting, Christ is meeting with us? It may be that not many of us have this realization. After Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, He came to meet with His brothers. We have to put John 20 and Hebrews 2 together. When He came back to His brothers, He not only breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples (John 20:22), but He also met with them and declared the Father&rsquo;s name to them (Heb. 2:11-12). We need to have the inner realization that when we meet, He is meeting with us (Matt. 18:20).</p>
<p>In the early days of the church life, I heard a message given by Brother Watchman Nee on this point. Suppose there were fifty brothers and sisters meeting together. He would ask how many of us were meeting together. Some said that there were fifty meeting there, but Brother Nee disagreed. At that time hardly any of us understood. Eventually he said, &ldquo;Is the Lord Jesus not here?&rdquo; We all said, &ldquo;Yes. He is here.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;So we have fifty-one meeting here.&rdquo; He continued by asking us, &ldquo;Where is He? You can number Him, but you cannot see Him.&rdquo; We said that He was among us, and Brother Nee responded by saying that He was not only among us but also in each one of us, the fifty attendants. He went on to tell us, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize that when you praise, He praises the Father in your praising? When you speak, He speaks in your speaking. Whatever you do, He does in your doing because He is meeting with us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to realize that whatever we do in the meeting, Jesus, the Son of God, is doing in our doing. He makes Himself one with us. In this sense, we all have a &ldquo;double character.&rdquo; In the Christian meeting, I am not one, but I am two. In my speaking, Jesus Christ is speaking. Whenever we count the number of persons in our meeting, we must add one. If there are one thousand people meeting together, we have to say that there are one thousand and one. All the churches who keep statistics should add one to their number. If we do not add one to our meeting number, we forget about the Lord Jesus Christ, who is really meeting with us.</p>
<p>All the points we have fellowshipped so far will transform us in the meetings. The meetings should be linked with such a resurrected Christ, who is now both in the heavens and in us to make us persons in resurrection. This vision and realization changes the condition of our meeting and transforms the nature of our meeting. We are having a meeting in resurrection because He is here. The resurrected One is here meeting with us to bring us all into His resurrection. The new way to meet implies this point. In the traditional way, we were never helped to realize that the Christian meetings should be linked with the resurrected and ascended Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is meeting with His brothers in the church in resurrection to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers (Heb. 2:12). We need to ask what it means for the Son to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers. For the Son to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to us is to make us know that in the whole universe there is the Source, and this Source is the eternal Father, the begetting Father. All of us believers were begotten of Him to be the sons of God. He is the Source of all us sons. The Son would also make us realize that God&rsquo;s economy is His arrangement or plan to have a group of sons to express Him.</p>
<p>Peter, James, John and the other disciples, except for Judas, were Jews who came from Galilee (see note 42 in Matthew 10&mdash;Recovery Version). They knew God as their Creator, and they knew Jehovah as their Lord, but they did not know that this very Jehovah God in the resurrected Christ had become their Father and that they were the sons of this begetting Father. This meant that they were persons with God&rsquo;s life (1 John 5:11-12) and God&rsquo;s nature (2 Pet. 1:4), that they were the family of this one Source, this one Father, and that they were all one in this Father. Before the resurrection of Christ, the disciples&rsquo; relationship with God was nearly the same as the other creatures. God was their Creator and they were His creatures. But Christ&rsquo;s resurrection changed their status, making them not only creatures of God but also sons of God.</p>
<p>As an illustration of what it means to declare the Father&rsquo;s name, let us suppose that there is a certain family with a father and eight children and that this family owns a dog, a cat, a bird, and some fish. When this family gathers together with all their pets, these creatures are not related at all to the father in life or in nature. The eight children, however, are related to the father in life and in nature, and they are of the same source. These little children may have never picked up this kind of understanding. So their big brother comes in to declare the father&rsquo;s name, to tell them, &ldquo;Brothers, Hallelujah! We all have our father&rsquo;s life and nature, and we all came out of him as our one source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is it to declare the Father&rsquo;s name? It is to make all the saints know what kind of relationship they have with God and where they are today. They are in the sonship. They are no longer merely creatures. They are the sons of God. They are of the same source, the eternal Father. They have the eternal Father&rsquo;s life, and they have the eternal Father&rsquo;s nature. In life and in nature they are exactly the same as the Father, and they are even one with the Father.</p>
<p>Christ meets with His brothers in the church to praise the Father with and in the brothers in the midst of the church (Heb. 2:12). When the Son meets with His brothers in resurrection, whatever He does is a kind of praise. The very intrinsic nature of praise is to manifest the Father. When the Lord Jesus is speaking within me, when He is speaking in my speaking, this speaking is a praise to the Father. It is a praise to the Father because this speaking magnifies God, expresses God, manifests God. Whenever you pray, praise, read the Bible, or speak the word and Jesus is the contents of what you do, whatever you do is a magnification, a manifestation, an expression, of the Father. Thus, what you do is a praise to the Father. We may come to the meeting and speak in a natural way: &ldquo;The weather is too cold, the world situation is a mess, and the oil is so cheap that it affects the Texas economy. Let us ask the Father to be merciful to us Texans by reducing the oil production of the Arabs that our oil may sell more.&rdquo; Do you think this is a praise to God? In many so-called church buildings they talk about things like this. The Christian bookstores are full of books that talk about things such as how to have a modern marriage life and other secular and worldly topics. Sometimes we could fall into this category in our meeting life. But if we have the revelation that our meeting is linked to the resurrected Christ, we would never talk about things like this. Whatever we say and pray that is linked to the resurrected Christ is a praise to the Father. It is a praise with Christ to the Father because it is a manifestation, a magnification, an expression, of the very unique Source in this universe.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE OF THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Meeting with the Believers</h2>
<p>Now we want to see the governing principle of the church meetings. The number one principle is that Christ meets with the believers. If we do not have Christ meeting with us, this is not a real Christian meeting. To have a real Christian meeting, we must have Christ meeting with us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Reality of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection&mdash;<br />
In the Spirit and Life of the Resurrected Christ</h2>
<p>We must also have our meetings in the reality of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;in the Spirit and life of the resurrected Christ. We must have our meeting in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. The very resurrected Christ must be the Spirit and life in our meeting. This is a deeply subjective matter; it is not a doctrine. We need to come together in the Spirit of the resurrected Christ and in the life of the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>We may feel that this matter is hard to understand. The best way to know this matter is to realize the following principle: as long as we pray or speak in our natural life, in ourselves, we are neither in the Spirit nor in the life of the resurrected Christ. It may be hard for us to know when we are in the Spirit, but it is easy for us to realize when we are not in the Spirit. If a person were to stand up in a meeting and tell the brothers and sisters that he did not like them, he surely would not be speaking in the Spirit and life of the resurrected Christ but in his natural hatred. When we realize that we are not speaking in the Spirit and life of Christ, we have to drop this kind of speaking.</p>
<p>Perhaps the same person mentioned above could say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Naturally speaking, I could not love you all. But today in Christ I love you and I love all the brothers.&rdquo; This kind of speaking comes from the source of the Spirit and life of the resurrected Christ. It is easy to realize when we are speaking in ourselves, in the natural life, and in the flesh. When we realize this, we know that we are not in the Spirit and life of Christ. We have to change our way of speaking until we have the assurance that we are not speaking according to our natural life. If we are not speaking by our natural life, then undoubtedly we are speaking by the Spirit and life of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Make God&rsquo;s Economy in His Fatherhood<br />
Known to the Believers<br />
for the Praise of the Father</h2>
<p>The Christian meetings are to make God&rsquo;s economy in His fatherhood known to the believers for the praise of the Father. God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s arrangement, His desire to carry out what He loves. This economy is in the fatherhood. When I use the word <em>fatherhood,</em> I mean the very Being of the Father with all His intentions, desires, purposes, and wishes. As an illustration, we can say that there is a fatherhood with a father who has seven children. This fatherhood denotes his being as a father. It also denotes whatever is involved in his being a father and implies all his wishes for his children, including his desires, his intentions, his purposes, and his goal that he could accomplish for all his children. Likewise, the divine fatherhood is the Father&rsquo;s Being and implies all of His intentions, purposes, desires, and will to accomplish something for His children. The Son declaring the Father&rsquo;s name implies that the Son tells His brothers not only that the Father is the begetting Source but also that this begetting Source has many intentions, purposes, wishes, and desires to accomplish many things for His sons.</p>
<p>The fatherhood includes all that our Father God has done, is doing, and will do for us. The New Testament tells us that this begetting Father first selected us according to His plan, His economy (Eph. 1:4). Before the foundation of the world, He chose us, and then He marked us out, predestinated us (1:5). In time He came to call us, to grasp us, to gain us, while we were busy in worldly affairs or involved in sinful things. Perhaps we wanted to enjoy ourselves where we were and put off believing in the Lord Jesus for a number of years. But the Father came into our situation and called us to go with Him. Eventually, we called, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and the Father with the Son entered into us as the Spirit. He has forgiven us, redeemed us, justified us, and regenerated us. He is now indwelling us, sanctifying us, and transforming us. He is going to conform us and glorify us. Eventually, He will bring us into Himself as an immense glory. We and He will be an enormous glory in the whole universe! We will be glorified with Him, and He will be glorified within us. Then we will be in the Father&rsquo;s glory, gathered around Him to always praise Him, to manifest Him forever and ever. These items of God&rsquo;s full salvation are some of the intentions, purposes, desires, and wishes that the Father wants to work out in us, and they are included in the fatherhood. The firstborn Son, Jesus Christ, comes to His brothers to explain all these things.</p>
<p>Whenever a brother speaks with God&rsquo;s utterance in the ministry of the word, the Son makes the fatherhood known to the believers. A number of us can testify that the Son has made the fatherhood known to us for the past twenty-five years in the United States through the ministry of the word, the divine speaking in the New Testament ministry. In conference after conference and training after training, our big Brother, the firstborn Son, was making God&rsquo;s economy in His fatherhood known to us. Within the proper minister of the word there is a wonderful One telling us many marvelous things about the Father: He is the choosing Father, the predestinating Father, the redeeming Father, the regenerating Father, and the transforming Father who has many good intentions toward us. He has many purposes in His economy for us in order to make us a group of praising sons to manifest Him.</p>
<p>This revelation of the fatherhood will make us full of &ldquo;hallelujahs!&rdquo; We are the sons of the divine Father, and we are enjoying the fatherhood! We may not understand the fatherhood fully, but we enjoy it and taste it. We are in this fatherhood, and we will be in it more and more. Today we are enjoying a miniature of the fatherhood, and one day we will be in the full taste of the fatherhood. We need to declare, &ldquo;God is my Father, and I am one of His sons expressing Him, manifesting Him. Hallelujah!&rdquo; Our story and our song should be that we are praising Him all the day long. Our Christian meeting should make God&rsquo;s economy in His fatherhood known to the believers. Today in our meeting we are the divine sons to express the begetting Source, to manifest Him, to magnify Him, to express Him, which is altogether a divine praise rendered to Him.</p>
<p>In ancient times, not only the Chinese race but also all the races had big families. In China it was considered good to have a family of five generations. The Bible reveals the great family of Abraham. Abraham had two sons: Ishmael who was eventually excluded from Abraham&rsquo;s family and Isaac who was Abraham&rsquo;s unique seed. The New Testament tells us that Abraham&rsquo;s family comprises us today. We are the sons, the descendants, of Abraham, and he is surely our father in the faith (Gal. 3:7, 29).</p>
<p>When I was young in China about sixty or seventy years ago, there were families with a great father living with his fourth generation. If he had five sons, they had children of the third generation. These third generation children had children of the fourth generation. On the birthday of this great father, all the sons, grandsons, great grandsons, and great great grandsons came together to talk about what they had inherited from their great father and what they were going to inherit. They would talk about what they were doing at that time and about all their interests and possessions, such as properties, houses, lands, schools, etc. They would talk about these things in front of their great father. As the father was listening to them and watching them, he was so happy. The more they talked about these things, the more they gave praises to that great old man and the more they expressed him and manifested him.</p>
<p>That birthday meeting is a model of our meeting today. Our Father&rsquo;s birthday is eternity, and our meeting today is the birthday meeting of our Father. When we come together, we talk about all that the Father is, all that the Father has done for us, all that the Father has given us, all that the Father is intending to do for us, and about what we have inherited of Him. What we talk about includes whatever the Father has done, is doing, and is going to do. The more we talk about these things in our meeting, the more praise we give to our Father. This kind of speaking makes our Father happy.</p>
<p>The Scriptures reveal that the Father is the very source of the divine Trinity, the Son is the course of that source, and the Spirit is the flow within the course (2 Cor. 13:14). Then this flow reaches us. This fatherhood includes whatever the Father as the source is, whatever the course is, and whatever the flow is. The ultimate picture of this fatherhood is the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem, God the Father is in the Son as the Lamb, and the Spirit as the flowing river spirals its way through all the contents of the holy city (Rev. 22:1). Thus, all the redeemed saints of God as the constituents of this city are under the watering of this flow of the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. Everything in the New Jerusalem is the fatherhood.</p>
<p>When we come together, we should never have nothing to say. We should have a great deal to say. We can say, &ldquo;The Father begot me. This begetting Father is the very source of the Triune God, whom I enjoy. The source goes through the course, the course goes through the flow, and the flow as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaches me to saturate me and water me. How wonderful!&rdquo; If we all see this vision of the fatherhood, everyone will have something to say when they come to the meeting. We are coming to our great Father&rsquo;s birthday! Look at Him. How ancient He is! How wonderful He is! This great Father has done great things for us. All the spiritual blessings we have received come from our great Father. We all have something to say. We all can speak of the spiritual blessings with which we have been blessed by our wonderful Father (Eph. 1:3).</p>
<p>This fellowship shows us the rich store, the rich provision, that we have for our meetings. How could we come together with other saints with nothing to say? If I came to the meeting as a son of God, redeemed, regenerated, indwelt, and being transformed by Him, and He is with me all the days, how could I come without anything to say? This would be pitiful. It is not good enough just to say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! O Lord Jesus! Amen!&rdquo; We have to tell others what we are saying hallelujah for. We can say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! our Father is the begetting Father! Hallelujah for His divine life! Hallelujah for His divine nature! Hallelujah for His divine presence! Hallelujah for His course, who is the Son! And hallelujah for the Son&rsquo;s redemption, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.&rdquo; We have so much to say.</p>
<p>Degraded Christianity has made us so poor. It has robbed us and annulled all our functions. This degraded system robbed our divine riches and made us inactive, passive laymen listening to the clergy. Perhaps we listened to someone from the clergy every Sunday for fifty-two weeks of the year. We went week after week to listen to speaking that was a waste as far as our development in life and function was concerned. Recently the big denominations in the United States came together to talk about how to evangelize the entire world by the year 2000. They said that one of their problems was a shortage of manpower. How could they say that they are short of manpower when they have millions of people? Christians compose about half of the population in the United States. More than half of these Christians are Protestants and most of the others are Catholics. According to statistics on religious bodies in the United States, there were approximately one hundred twenty-six million Christians in 1986. Does Christianity have the manpower? They do have the manpower, but they have annulled everyone&rsquo;s function, making the members of the Body of Christ paralyzed to the extent that they do hardly anything and know hardly anything. Today our intention is to revive the saints and get them out of that condition. We must learn to speak. We must learn to celebrate our great Father&rsquo;s birthday. Whenever we come together, we should link our meeting to that great Source, the very begetting Source. He not only has begotten us but He also has done many wonderful things for His begotten sons. Now we are in His fatherhood enjoying Him in every way and in every aspect. But we must learn to speak.</p>
<p>Let us consider again the illustration of the great father in China with four generations. Suppose that over two hundred of his family came to celebrate his birthday and everybody came silent. How would this great father feel with two hundred silent people sitting in front of him? This great father would probably be angry. He might say, &ldquo;What happened to you? I did not beget dumb children. Are you my sons? Do you have my life? Do you possess my nature? Why are you so dumb? What happened to you all?&rdquo; If our heavenly Father came to a Christian meeting where His children did not speak, He might feel to rebuke them in the same way. He might say, &ldquo;I did so many things for you, and I am so much to you. Why don&rsquo;t you have anything to say about Me? Who killed you? Who annulled all your functions? Who shut all your mouths? Christianity did this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What about us today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? Are we bubbling Christians? When we come to the meeting, are we bubbling attendants? I cannot stay in a meeting for a half hour without speaking. I like to bubble. I have something to say. We should not merely say &ldquo;hallelujah,&rdquo; but we have to say &ldquo;hallelujah&rdquo; for something. We can say, &ldquo;I was begotten of our Father about two thousand years ago, and God&rsquo;s only begotten Son has become my big Brother! I am one of the many brothers of this big Brother!&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in the United States for twenty-five years, and we have published hundreds of messages. Regrettably, many of these messages remain on our bookshelves. We need to spend time to get into them so we can learn the many things concerning our divine family. This will enable us to speak with boldness and assurance. Even to speak concerning the Triune God as the source, the course, and the flow is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>We have seen that after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came back to His brothers. Before His resurrection when He was on this earth, the Lord did not have brothers. According to John 15, He only had friends (vv. 13-15). He considered the disciples as His friends. But immediately after His resurrection, He told Mary, &ldquo;Go to My brothers&rdquo; (John 20:17). Immediately the friends had become brothers. In His resurrection, His friends were begotten of His Father. That is why the Lord told Mary in John 20:17 that His Father was their Father and that His God was their God. Then on the evening of His resurrection, He came back to His brothers (John 20:19). According to Hebrews 2:11, the Son as the big Brother came back to His brothers to declare the Father&rsquo;s name, which implies the Father&rsquo;s Person, the Father&rsquo;s Being, with all His intentions, wishes, desires, and purposes regarding His begotten children. The Son revealed this great fatherhood to His brothers who were participating in the fatherhood. The Christian meeting is a meeting in and for the fatherhood.</p>
<p>Now we are meeting in this fatherhood which comprises so much. We meet in the Son&rsquo;s name (Matt. 18:20) to declare the Father&rsquo;s name. Whatever we do and say in the meetings should declare the Father in order that the Father may be praised, magnified, manifested, expressed. Our meeting is for the praise of the Father&mdash;for the magnification and glorification of the very source of the divine Trinity. The very source of the divine Trinity is the begetting Father. Our meeting is just for the praise of this begetting Source, and our praise is our magnification, our glorification, our expression, of Him to the uttermost.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE BELIEVERS<br />
FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:26; Eph. 5:18-21; Acts 10:46; 1 Cor. 14:22, 5, 13; Acts 13:52; Rom. 8:4; Col. 3:16; Acts 8:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TO MEET AS ORDAINED BY THE APOSTLE</h2>
<p>In this message we will consider the requirements on the believers for the church meetings. In order to have the church meetings, we attendants must meet the requirements. The way to meet is ordained by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:26. This verse should be considered as Paul&rsquo;s ordination of the way for us to meet.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not with a Definite Speaker</h2>
<p>According to this verse, our meetings should not have a definite speaker. To set up a definite speaker annuls the functions of all the attendants in the meeting. In the past, especially on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, our meetings were arranged with a definite speaker. Knowing that a particular brother was going to speak, all the saints would come to the meeting to listen and relax. For the speaker, however, every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning was a time of suffering. Whoever was selected and assigned to speak on the Lord&rsquo;s Day might have worried for three days. Saturday was a &ldquo;sad day&rdquo; for him. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day this speaker came to the meeting under a heavy burden, while all the other believers rested and relaxed.</p>
<p>To meet by assigning a particular speaker kept all the other saints out of a job. If this type of meeting had taken place only three months a year, there would have been nine months left for the saints to practice speaking. But this kind of meeting with a definite speaker continued all year long. After a year&rsquo;s time, the saints who attended these meetings hardly learned anything. Although the saints undoubtedly receive some help from the speaker for their nourishment, meeting in this way throughout the entire year, year after year, paralyzes the members of Christ.</p>
<p>When we began to practice the biblical way to meet, the way ordained by the apostle, certain ones became concerned. They said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you have to be merciful with us. You are the expert in speaking, but we are not. We really don&rsquo;t know what to speak. We like the feeding. Be merciful to us and keep the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting. Otherwise, we will not have any place to get some spiritual food.&rdquo; I reassured such ones that this meeting would be preserved for their sakes, and asked them to continue to come. However, I told them that at the same time they had to learn to speak in the meetings and that trainings would be set up to train them how to speak. We should try our best to learn to speak. Many nursing mothers teach their little babies to say &ldquo;ma&rdquo; and &ldquo;pa.&rdquo; After a certain time, without a dictionary, the baby knows that &ldquo;ma&rdquo; is the mother and &ldquo;pa&rdquo; is the father. He understands by listening. Word by word the baby will grow to be a good speaker. On the one hand, a church has to be a teaching church, and on the other hand, it must be a speaking church. A proper church is always teaching, and it is always speaking. A good mother will teach and speak to her baby all day long. Whenever she feeds it, she will also teach it. When the baby says &ldquo;ma&rdquo; one day, the mother is very happy.</p>
<p>We may teach the young believers to firstly say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Then we may teach them to say, &ldquo;Lord, I love You&rdquo;; &ldquo;O Lord, how good You are&rdquo;; and &ldquo;O Lord, I just worship You and want to speak You.&rdquo; Then charge them to speak these things and to learn to practice speaking in their homes. Later, you may teach them something further, as a teacher teaches a child, lesson by lesson. Do not take the old way, speaking messages to them for fifty-two weeks out of the year. Then the function of the listeners will become annulled, and spiritually speaking, they will lose the ability of their speaking organ.</p>
<p>If a baby never heard any speaking and never practiced speaking, he would grow up to be dumb. A little babe needs to hear his parents speaking for a period of time before he can make the appropriate sounds. The mother may say &ldquo;ma&rdquo; for one month without this response from the child. But one day the child says &ldquo;ma&rdquo; to his mother, and the mother is so happy. Following this she may teach the baby to say &ldquo;pa,&rdquo; and after a period of time the baby will begin to call his father &ldquo;pa.&rdquo; A child has its organic function to speak by birth, and this organic function needs development. If this development is by English, the child will always speak English. If this development is by Chinese, the child will always speak Chinese. If we develop all the new ones with the heavenly language, after two or three months, they will speak the heavenly things and know the heavenly language. It is not a small thing to drop the old way of meeting. On the one hand, this way helps to a certain extent. But on the other hand, it annuls and kills. We must build up another category of help that not only helps but also develops. Even when I minister the word in a ministry meeting, I believe that my speaking feeds the saints and also develops them.</p>
<p>I went back to Taipei in 1984 to bring the church there fully into the scriptural way of meeting and serving. In 1985 I encouraged the church to use the <em>Truth Lessons.</em> The church in Taipei has twenty-three halls, and I was staying in Hall One. When I first went to visit their Lord&rsquo;s Day morning truth lesson meeting, I was fully disappointed. One brother was directing the saints by assigning them certain portions to read. The meeting was full of deadness and routine. According to my feeling they were in the meeting as robots, not as living members. Close to two years later, I heard people highly appraising the way Hall One was practicing their truth lesson. They said it was so wonderful, living, refreshing, new, and high. I went back to visit this meeting, and I was surprised at the saints&rsquo; livingness. They read by repeating and by emphasizing. Their reading was so living. Sometimes one saint would read only half of a sentence, and another saint would spontaneously continue this sentence. There was a good flow and continuation in their reading. They pray-read in a living way. This confirmed to me that our organic functions need to be developed.</p>
<p>In the church we must learn to develop the saints&rsquo; organic function, and we need to charge the saints to be patient in learning how to exercise their function. We need to be like the mothers who teach their little ones to exercise their function which they received at their birth. They have the function to see, to hear, to speak, to crawl, and eventually to stand, walk, and run. The mothers need to help develop these functions in their children. Eventually the little ones learn how to develop their own functions.</p>
<p>The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are presently in a transitory period. We should not think that we can immediately close the door of the meeting hall on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, send all the saints to their homes, and expect them to have good home meetings. I observed that when the brothers did this, the home meetings were dumb meetings. The meeting hall was closed and everybody was sent to their homes to sit there. Eventually, refreshments were brought out of the kitchen and the saints began to talk about things other than Christ. Everyone became disappointed with this so-called meeting. We should not close the meeting hall abruptly and tell the saints to meet in their homes instead. We still need to keep the meeting in the hall. Use the entire meeting hall to teach the saints so that they can practice and learn to develop their organic function. We need to do everything we can by the Lord&rsquo;s grace to change our way of meeting to the scriptural way.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee said that this old way to meet with a definite speaker and the others listening had become a strong habit. Because this old way was too heavy for one person to remove, Brother Nee said that we needed many brothers to push. A certain object may be very heavy and difficult to remove from the way, but if many of us push against it, we will be able to push it out of the way. However, just to push away our old habit is not sufficient. We need something to replace it. If we push away our old habit and we have nothing to replace it, we are left with nothing, vanity. Vanity cannot help people. Thus, we need to build up something to replace our old way, our old habit. What is this something? Speaking! We all must learn to speak Christ. Even the young sisters need to learn to speak.</p><h2 class="head2">Each Attendant Having Something<br />
to Minister to the Others in the Meeting</h2>
<p>All of us should learn how to have something to minister to others. Every day in the morning we should read and pray-read two or three verses. Then during the day we can practice speaking these verses. We should learn to speak even if no one is with us. We can speak to the desk, the window, the table, and the entire creation. We need to speak again and again what we have read and pray-read in the morning. We must learn to speak. The more we learn to speak, the more we will have to speak. If we do not speak throughout the day, we will have nothing to speak when the meeting time comes. The time to prepare ourselves to speak is not merely right before the meeting. We must prepare ourselves throughout the day in the easy way by speaking the verses we read in the morning during the entire day. If this becomes our practice, we will have something stored within us when we come to the meeting.</p>
<p>You do not need to speak too long when you share in the meeting&mdash;about one to three minutes at most is sufficient. It is not sufficient for you to stand up and say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; and sit down. Occasionally this is acceptable, but not frequently. Learn to take the verses you have enjoyed in the morning as a base for your speaking. You do not need to memorize the verses. Just speak according to their content. I believe you will have something to speak if you put this into practice. Suppose the verses you have enjoyed in the morning are the first two verses of Matthew 1. Verse one says, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.&rdquo; If you would speak this verse during the day, you will have something when the time for the meeting comes in the evening. In the meeting you can say, &ldquo;Dear saints, our Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of David and the Son of Abraham. I love Him because He is the Son of David and the Son of Abraham.&rdquo; By doing this you have begun to learn how to speak in the meetings.</p>
<p>Try to practice this for four weeks and see how much improvement you will receive in speaking. If you speak well, some may appreciate it. Do not be proud of that. If you speak poorly, some may shake their heads. Do not be disappointed. When you are listening to others, on the other hand, learn not to overly appreciate anyone nor to despise anyone. Practice speaking together with all the saints. Through your practice you will become a different person, a useful person. Formerly you may have been dumb. Now you will be so bubbling. Formerly you had nothing to say. Now you will have much to overflow.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Psalm for Both Singing and Speaking</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 14:26, the saints may have five categories of items to minister to others in the meeting: a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. A saint may have a psalm for both singing and speaking in a Christ-filled spirit, not only to praise and thank God the Father but also to edify and build up the attendants. According to Ephesians 5:18-21, psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing but also for speaking. We should learn to speak the hymns. Hymn #501, &ldquo;O Glorious Christ, Savior Mine,&rdquo; is a wonderful hymn for singing and speaking. We should read and study this hymn and learn to speak it privately in our homes. Then we can come to the meeting and speak this hymn with others. This one hymn will become a marvelous message full of nourishment, revelation, and edification if we speak it properly. But we have to learn not merely to read but to speak. We have to sing or speak either a psalm, a hymn, or song in a Christ-filled spirit. We must come to the meeting with a spirit filled with Christ to praise and thank God the Father and to edify and build up the attendants.</p><h2 class="head3">A Teaching to Minister Christ<br />
and the Things Related to God</h2>
<p>A saint may also have a teaching to minister Christ and the things related to God for the edification of the believers and the building up of the Body of Christ. Learn to give a teaching. A proper teaching can take from two to five minutes to present. Our teaching is mainly to minister Christ. Do not teach concerning other things. The saints come to the church meetings to learn to know, enjoy, and receive Christ and the things related to God. To teach in the way of ministering Christ is for the edification of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Revelation to Unveil the Economy of God</h2>
<p>When we come to the meetings, we may also have a revelation to unveil the economy of God concerning Christ and the church as the Body of Christ for the corporate expression of the Triune God. Some sisters in certain places may come to the meetings to teach others how to eat vitamins, take herbs, and get the proper exercise. Do not do this. You have to limit your speaking and concentrate your speaking on Christ, the church, and other things related to God. Speak words that edify the Christian life and that build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:29). We have many books that can help us and provide us with the proper utterances with which to speak. We have the Holy Bible in our hands and publications such as the Life-studies and <em>Life Lessons</em> that open up the Bible. We should not say that we do not have time to get into this material. We all have time. If we spend time in these life-giving publications, we will discover that we do have the time. If we will not exercise to do this, we will always feel that we are too busy. Even a person without a job may feel that he is a busy man. We need to pick up the burden to learn how to be a speaking Christian at all times. We should learn to speak God, speak Christ, speak the word of the Lord, speak salvation, and speak the life supply to the young believers. Then whenever we come to the meeting, we will be bubbling with much to say.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Tongue to Magnify God or an Interpretation<br />
to Make a Tongue Understandable</h2>
<p>In the Christian meeting, a believer may have a tongue to magnify God for a sign to the unbelievers and for the building up of the church (Acts 10:46; 1 Cor. 14:22, 5) or an interpretation to make a tongue understandable to the attendants (1 Cor. 14:13). When we come to the meeting, we should have something of the Lord to minister to others from the items listed in 1 Corinthians 14:26. If all the attendants have something of Christ to share, the meeting will be full of mutuality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE BELIEVERS<br />
FOR THEIR MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">To Be Filled with the Spirit and with Joy</h2>
<p>Now we need to see the requirements on the believers for their meetings. The first requirement is to be filled with the Spirit and with joy (Acts 13:52). We should not think that it is hard to be filled with the Spirit. To be filled with the Spirit is easy and normal. In the past, Christian teachers made a mistake by telling people that it is very difficult to be filled with the Spirit. Some taught that one must fast and pray for a certain period of time and fulfill other requirements in order to be filled with the Spirit. Over fifty years ago, I believed all these things. But gradually through the years, I have learned that it is not that hard to be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>When I was a young Christian, I was also told that it was not so easy to be regenerated. The inner life people called regeneration the first blessing. After a person was regenerated, they said that he must have the fullness of the Spirit, which was the second blessing. If someone had the first blessing, they would rejoice over him, and if someone had the second blessing, they would rejoice even more. Eventually, I found out that both regeneration and the fullness of the Spirit are very easy to receive and are normal experiences.</p>
<p>Brother Nee illustrated by snapping his fingers to show how instant and easy regeneration is. He said, &ldquo;To be regenerated is just like this,&rdquo; and he snapped his fingers. When a sinner hears the gospel, repents of his sins, and calls on the name of the Lord, he is instantly regenerated. An unbeliever may pray a short prayer such as, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I love You. I take You as my Savior. Lord, thank You for dying on the cross for my sins.&rdquo; At a certain point in his prayer, something &ldquo;clicks&rdquo; like the click of a camera taking a picture, and the divine scenery of Christ gets into him. The living Christ comes into a person instantaneously like the click of a camera or the snap of one&rsquo;s fingers. Although regeneration is instant, it is also miraculous.</p>
<p>D. L. Moody said that regeneration was the biggest miracle in the universe, but he also illustrated that it was instantaneous. After one of his gospel preaching meetings, he came down from the platform to talk to a lady who was a new one. Right at the critical juncture when the &ldquo;click&rdquo; was about to occur, someone made a disturbance. Moody said that he did his best to bring that lady back to that critical juncture, but he could not. I have experienced the same thing in the preaching of the gospel. In our training of the full-time young people, we train them how to go out with <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> We teach the trainees to watch and observe the one with whom they are speaking, to look for the critical juncture when they will receive the Lord. Right at that juncture, the trainees are charged to ask them to pray. They are instructed not to ask the new ones to pray earlier or later than this juncture. They must watch for the appropriate time when the &ldquo;click&rdquo; of regeneration can occur. The camera has to take the picture at the right time.</p>
<p>In 1958 I bought a good camera with the intention of taking pictures during a trip I was taking to England and Denmark. Before that time, I had never used a camera. I happily took many pictures on my trip, but when I received the film back from the developer, every picture was blank. At first I did not know what had happened, but then I recalled that I had never taken the lens cover off of the camera. We should not go out to use <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> in the way that I tried to take those pictures. In our speaking to the unbelievers, we must try to remove their lens cover. When we realize that the cover is off, we should immediately ask them to pray. When the cover is still there and you ask them to pray, they will not receive the Lord.</p>
<p>To be filled with the Spirit and with joy is also miraculous but easy and normal. This requires a thorough confession of your sins, failures, wrongdoings, defeats, shortcomings, bad points, and mistakes, great or small. Make a thorough confession. As a rule it will usually take about twenty minutes. As long as you have finished a thorough confession of your sins, you have to realize that you have been filled with the Spirit. The Spirit is not far away from you today. He is within you (Rom. 8:9), and He is waiting to fill you up. He is like the air waiting to fill an empty vessel. As long as the vessel is full, the air is unable to fill it. The extent to which the vessel is empty is the extent to which the air can fill it. When you empty yourself thoroughly, the Spirit fills you thoroughly. This filling does not depend upon your feeling. As long as one really repents and believes into Jesus Christ, he will be regenerated by the Spirit. Likewise, as long as you confess all your failures and sins, you will be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>One of the top signs of being filled with the Spirit is that we have joy and peace. Before we make a thorough confession, we may not have that much joy and peace. But if we would confess all of our failures and make a thorough confession, we will immediately have joy and peace within. Acts 13:52 says that &ldquo;the disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; As long as we can rejoice in the Lord, that is a sign that we have the infilling of the Spirit. Whenever we come to a meeting, we must come with the infilling of the Spirit.</p>
<p>To be filled with the Spirit also requires faith in the Triune God according to the word of the Scriptures. Since we have cleared up our situation with God, we have the ground to have faith in Him, believing with full assurance that He is within us and that He is our everything. We must have this kind of faith in God and come to the meetings with such a faith.</p><h2 class="head2">To Live and Walk according to the Spirit</h2>
<p>Another requirement on the believers for their meetings is that they must live and walk according to the spirit&mdash;to live a victorious life (Rom. 8:4). After making a thorough confession, we have to begin a new life. We should not fall back into our old life about which we have just confessed thoroughly. We must begin to have a new life, and this new life is to have our being absolutely in the spirit day after day and all day.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Let the Word of Christ Dwell in Us Richly</h2>
<p>We also need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly (Col. 3:16). This is not only to read the word but also to receive the word and give it the freedom to act and operate in us. We must give ourselves to the word. We must let the word take us as its home so that it can work and operate within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Speak the Lord at All Times</h2>
<p>For our meetings, we also need to be those who speak the Lord at all times to all kinds of people on any occasion (Acts 8:4). We need to learn to speak. Paul told Timothy, &ldquo;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:2). Regardless of the situation or circumstances, we have to speak the Lord at all times to all kinds of people on any occasion. &ldquo;In season and out of season&rdquo; means opportunely or inopportunely, whether the opportunity is convenient or inconvenient, whether we are welcome or unwelcome.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Become Acquainted<br />
with Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs</h2>
<p>For our meetings, we must become acquainted with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs for teaching and admonishing one another (Col. 3:16b). We all have to learn the hymns in our hymnal. We may not be able to remember that many, but we can choose to remember the better hymns and learn to speak them. Sometimes we need to speak a hymn or a verse of a song to a certain person. We can do the same thing when we come to the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Pay the Price to Prepare to Speak</h2>
<p>The meetings also require us to pay the price to prepare to speak, not only to listen, in the meetings. This preparation is not like the preparation of a student who has been asked to give a speech. This might frighten most of us. We do not need to pay that kind of price. But day after day we must get ourselves prepared to have something. In the old way of meeting, one speaks and the rest listen. There is no need for the ones who listen to get themselves prepared. Today the way of meeting has been changed so that everybody has to speak. Thus, whenever we come to the meetings, we must get ourselves prepared. We should not prepare only instantly. We have to prepare constantly every day, every week, and every month. Then we will have an accumulation of the riches of Christ that we can speak of and with.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Endeavor to Make the Meetings<br />
Full of Mutuality</h2>
<p>We also need to endeavor to make the meetings full of mutuality. Many different persons should speak in the meetings. The more mutual the meeting is, the better it is. Suppose that fifty saints came together, and everybody wanted to speak at the same time. I wanted to speak before you, and you wanted to speak before me. That meeting would be in the third heavens. Suppose that the same fifty persons came together and all of them were dumb. Even the three elders among them could only look at one another with nothing to say. None of them could speak something to meet the need. That meeting would be a dead meeting. It would be dead to the uttermost. Instead of sitting there in dumbness, if everyone would open their mouths to speak something of Christ one after another, the meeting would become a living, uplifted meeting, full of the divine riches.</p>
<p>With only one speaker, there is only one course of food. Is a one course feast rich? When fifty saints come together, though, and everyone speaks, there is a fifty course feast full of riches. There will be exhortations, admonitions, revelations unveiling Christ, and other divine things. That is a meeting that is not only living but also rich. Some may say that the new way is too hard, but if we would try to speak, it is easy. If we do not speak, it is hard because everybody is dead. We must try to be living in the meeting, not dead. It would be good if we would make a pledge to speak for at least forty seconds whenever we are in any kind of meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Exercise the Spirit and to Be Energetic in Life</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we need to exercise the spirit and be energetic in life that the meetings may be high, rich, living, fresh, full of Christ, and enjoyable. If we are energetic in life, we may come to the meeting and say, &ldquo;Brothers, do you realize that I am a God-man? All of you are God-men too! Amen!&rdquo; We should not be in the meetings in our weak self. We must learn to exercise our spirit and be energetic. Then we will experience mercy reaching us and grace supplying us. This kind of exercise and energy in life will make the entire meeting very enjoyable. This is the way to fulfill the requirements of the proper meeting of the believers so that we can give praise to the Father. Then whatever we do will be a praise to the Father.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE CHARACTERISTICS<br />
OF THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 18:20; Heb. 10:24-25; Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TO BE GATHERED INTO THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Gathered by the Lord</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the characteristics of the believers&rsquo; meetings. The first characteristic of a Christian meeting is that the believers are gathered into the name of the Lord. Matthew 18:20 says, &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; The word <em>gathered</em> is passive; when we meet, we actually are gathered. We do not gather ourselves together; we are gathered by the Lord. Thus, the Lord initiates our gathering. Day by day, the Lord gathers us into His name which denotes His Person. Whenever we come together, we have to be gathered by the Lord into Himself. If we come to the meeting outside of Him, we come dead, empty, and without anything to minister to others as a praise to the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Gathered out of All Kinds of<br />
Occupations and Frustrations<br />
into the Living Person of the Lord,<br />
Signified by His Name</h2>
<p>Whenever we come together, we come into a Person; therefore, we must be gathered out of our occupations and frustrations. Day after day we have a lot of things that occupy us and often frustrate us from going to the meetings. If we keep ourselves in fellowship with the Lord, He will surely rescue us from these occupations and frustrations. The Lord will save us from many things other than Himself, and He will save us into His Person. This aspect of the believers&rsquo; meeting is very critical, yet it has been lost through the years.</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:20 the word <em>into</em> is used, not <em>in.</em> These are two different prepositions in Greek. We are gathered <em>into</em> the name, not <em>in</em> the name. We are gathered into the name, into the Person of the Lord, rather than <em>meeting</em> in the name. The Lord gathers us out of so many other things into Himself. When we meet in such a way, we not only have the Lord, but also are in the Lord. The Lord as a Person, the all-inclusive and extensive Person, is our meeting. Our meeting is the Lord Himself. Thus, whatever we do must be with the Lord and in the Lord. We do everything as one person with the Lord. In the eyes of God, the entire congregation of those who are meeting is one enlarged person. Whether there are fifty or fifty thousand, there is still just one person. The meeting should be in a person, and all things other than the Lord Himself should be kept away, left behind, or dropped. We are meeting in the Lord alone; therefore, our meeting becomes one enlarged person. We are gathered out of all the occupations and frustrations into the living Person of the Lord, signified by His name. Our coming to the meeting should not be initiated by us, but by the Lord. He is the gathering One.</p>
<p>Because we are all busy, it would be difficult to attend the meetings without the Lord&rsquo;s gathering; His gathering rescues us from so many other things. Often the night of the meeting seems to have the most frustrations and obstacles. Suppose the meeting is on a Tuesday night. It seems that every other night of the week is free from problems or frustrations except Tuesday night. On this evening, your wife may suddenly have a cold and not be able to cook dinner. You may also have two young children who need care due to your wife being sick. It seems that you have a &ldquo;legal excuse&rdquo; and can &ldquo;escape&rdquo; the gathering of the Lord.</p>
<p>Other times because a particular night does not seem to be so good for meeting, a decision is made to shift the meeting to another night of the week. When this happens, Satan seems to shift all the troubles to that night. Frequently, this trouble may be in the form of phone calls which come right before we are leaving to go to the meeting. For this reason, we often need to determine not to answer any phone calls close to the time of the meeting in order to cooperate with the Lord who gathers us. The Lord is our Rescuer and He can rescue us from every kind of frustration and occupation, but He needs our cooperation.</p>
<p>As the meeting people of God, we are accustomed to having as many as four meetings a week&mdash;twice on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and two other times during the week. The worldly people may not have the capability to come to meetings as often as we do. However, regardless of how good the meetings might be, we occasionally lose our taste, and become tired or disinterested. When the time of meeting comes, we may have the excuse that we are tired. This is something of the enemy. We must realize that the proper Christian meeting is always a battle. This is because the subtle one, God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, knows that every proper Christian meeting defeats him. Satan is always defeated, not by our individual spirituality but by our meeting in a proper way. Therefore, every meeting is a battle. Whenever we feel tired, disinterested, or reluctant to go to the meetings, this indicates that we have been defeated by the enemy. What shall we do? We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, rescue me. Gather me out of this weary condition.&rdquo; If we would pray in this way, the Lord would immediately strengthen us, stir us up, and give us an appetite to go to the meeting. Actually, it is not that we go to the meeting; rather, it is that the Lord rescues us from being absent from the meeting.</p>
<p>Even when you go to the meeting, the meeting itself is still a battle. If you do not sense that there is a battle while you are in any meeting, you are wrong. When I come to the meeting to give a message, I often pray, &ldquo;Lord, You know that there is a battle. I am going, not merely to speak, but to fight.&rdquo; In every meeting, there is a battle; therefore, a certain amount of fighting is needed. The Lord is ready to rescue you from defeat, but you have to cooperate with Him. You have to be watchful and on the alert. Because there is a constant battle, the Lord Jesus told us to watch and pray (Matt. 26:41; Mark 13:33; Luke 21:36). If we are at home away from the meetings, we may not feel that we need to watch or pray. We need to realize that day by day, the Christian life and the meeting life are a battle.</p>
<p>Particularly, the prayer meeting is a battle. Nearly everywhere among the churches today, the prayer meeting is the meeting with the smallest number in attendance. This is a bad sign indicating defeat. We all must endeavor to defeat the enemy by being gathered into the Lord out of ourselves. If we go to the meetings in this way, we will certainly function. If we come to the meeting in an indifferent manner, however, it will be hard for us to function. The old way keeps us in a dormant situation, and the Lord&rsquo;s new way is always to stir us up, making us alive. If you come to the meetings in a living way, I assure you that you will function, that you will not be lazy, that you will have an interest and a taste for every kind of meeting, and that you will always be watchful and on the alert, knowing that all the meetings are battles.</p><h2 class="head1">TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ASSEMBLING TOGETHER<br />
OF THE BELIEVERS THEMSELVES</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:25 says, &ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&rdquo; The Apostle Paul wrote the book of Hebrews to encourage the hesitating, backslidden Hebrew believers to go forward within the veil and to go outside the camp (6:19; 13:13). To go &ldquo;outside the camp&rdquo; was to go outside of the old Jewish religion, and to enter &ldquo;within the veil&rdquo; was to enter into the Holy of Holies, where Christ is.</p>
<p>We must realize that our proper meeting is the Holy of Holies. To be gathered together in a proper way is to meet in the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies is wherever the Lord Jesus is. The Lord is dwelling in the heavens (Rom. 8:34). The Lord is also dwelling in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) which is the Holy of Holies (Heb. 4:12, 16; see note 4:16<sup>1</sup>, Recovery Version). Since the Lord is in the third heavens today, the third heavens is the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:12; cf. v. 24). Since He is now in our spirit, our spirit is the Holy of Holies. Because the Lord Jesus is in our meeting whenever we meet together, our meeting is also the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:22, 25). For the Hebrew believers to forsake their Christian meeting was for them to forsake the Holy of Holies and go back to their religious camp.</p>
<p>The book of Exodus shows us that after the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf (32:8), they became a camp. They had the Lord in name, but in reality they worshipped something else and hence became a religious camp among whom it was impossible to have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Moses knew that God, according to His holiness, would no longer stay among the people for the camp had become idolatrous. Therefore, Moses took his tent, which formerly had been in the camp, and pitched it outside the camp. This tent then became the tent of God, the tent of meeting (33:7&mdash;ASV). If the people would not go out of the camp but would remain in it, they would not have the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord was no longer in the camp but in the tent (33:9).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, there was a separation between the Jewish religionists, the camp, and the Lord Himself, the real tabernacle (John 1:14; 2:19, 21). The Lord Jesus was the very embodiment of God, and the real Holy of Holies was wherever He was. Outside of and around Christ, there was a religious organization, an old religion, a camp, which did not have God&rsquo;s Holy of Holies. In that religious organization of Judaism, God was not there. At the time the Lord Jesus walked upon this earth, the proper worship was always held in the temple according to the rituals ordained by God. Yet we must ask ourselves who the Lord Jesus is. Actually, He is the very God, the One whom the children of Israel worshipped in their temple.</p>
<p>One day Jesus entered into the house in Bethany (John 12:1-11). He was in that home, yet the Jewish priests still worshipped God in the temple in Jerusalem. During that time, where was God? Was He in the Holy of Holies within the temple at Jerusalem or in the small home at Bethany? No doubt, He was in the small home in Bethany. Because God was in that home in Bethany, that home became the very Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies in the temple was forsaken by God because it had become a part of the camp (Matt. 23:38&mdash;24:2). At that time, if anyone desired to worship God, they had to forsake the temple and go to that little home in Bethany. That little home was the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The principle is the same today. In order to worship God, you have to go outside of the camp of religion and enter within the veil to enjoy Christ in the Holy of Holies. The Lord Jesus as God is not in the old, religious, human organization which is just a camp. In Hebrews, Paul charged the hesitating, wandering, backsliding Hebrew believers to forget about their old religion, old temple, and old ritual worship, and to go forth outside of the camp to enter into the Holy of Holies to enjoy Christ (Heb. 6:19; 10:22; 13:13). This Holy of Holies is the proper Christian meeting.</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies in Hebrews denotes three things: the third heavens, our spirit, and the Christian meeting. Whenever we come together properly, our gathering is the Holy of Holies. Of the three, which do you prefer, the third heavens, our spirit, or the Christian meeting? The heavens are difficult to reach, and we are often unable to remain in our spirit all day long, day and night. But according to my Christian experience, the meetings keep me in the Lord, in His Holy of Holies. I do not enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence elsewhere as much as I do in the meetings. It is enjoyable to be in our spirit, but the meeting as the Holy of Holies is much better and higher.</p>
<p>After some of us attend a ten day training or a conference, and we are returning to our localities, we may feel that we are in the outer court and not in the Holy of Holies. We may long for the time when we can gather together again. This experience illustrates the reason Paul urged the Hebrew believers not to forsake the assembling of themselves together. If they forsook their assembling together, it meant that they went back to their old religion, their former camp. Thus, Paul charged them to go outside the camp and to enter within the veil. To enter within the veil includes three things: to enter into the heavenly Holy of Holies, to enter our spirit which is linked to the heavenly Holy of Holies, and to enter into the Christian meeting. The Christian meeting is the best because it nourishes, strengthens, edifies, and enlightens us, becoming a great spiritual benefit to us. The meetings are wonderful!</p>
<p>The meeting in the New Testament is referred to as a gathering (Matt. 18:20) and an assembly (Heb. 10:25). The assembling together of the believers, the meetings, should not be in the nature of fulfilling mixed purposes. Frequently, in Christianity, the meetings are not pure in their purpose. The meetings of the believers should be purely in the nature of carrying out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. If we hold a meeting which is not pure and which has a mixed purpose, it would be difficult to have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The proper Christian meeting must be pure in its purpose. The essence, the nature, of the meeting must be purely to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to get a people through Christ to be the church that God may have a corporate expression in His fatherhood. Every Christian meeting must be pure in nature to carry out this economy of God that God may express Himself as a great Father in all of His children. To have a meeting with such a motive and purpose is really pure.</p><h2 class="head1">TO HAVE THE FULL MUTUALITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In Speaking</h2>
<p>The Christian meetings should be full of mutuality in speaking (Eph. 5:19). To fill the Christian meetings with mutuality is not very easy, but to have the mutuality is wonderful! Whether we come together with fifty, one hundred, or one hundred-fifty, everyone should function. This creates a mutuality which fills up the entire meeting. One speaks for one minute, another speaks for half a minute, another speaks for five minutes, someone may speak for eight minutes, and someone else may speak for ten minutes. By this practice of everyone speaking according to their measure, we all would produce a meeting that is full of mutuality.</p>
<p>I hope that we would improve, grow, and advance to a condition where many would speak. Some would speak for forty seconds, others for four minutes, and another for thirty minutes. We not only need the short speaking; we also need some longer speaking. There may be a meeting in which many speak in a short way and one would speak in a new, living, refreshing, and high way for perhaps forty minutes. This would be wonderful! The first chapter of Luke illustrates this. In this chapter, there are three different kinds of speaking. The record of Elizabeth&rsquo;s speaking is the shortest (vv. 42-45). Mary, the mother of Jesus, spoke for a longer time (vv. 46-55). Finally, Zachariah, full of experiences, spoke the longest (vv. 68-79). Zachariah&rsquo;s speaking in Luke 1 contains no wasted words, and it is full of riches. How long you should speak depends upon your age and experience. Your experience and knowledge of the word of God constitute the content and the length of your speaking.</p>
<p>If everyone in the meeting speaks for a short time, and the meeting is full of mutuality, the new ones who come to the meeting will be convinced (1 Cor. 14:24-25). They may be shocked at first, asking what kind of meeting this is. They may have been Christians for many years, but they may never have seen a meeting with such mutuality&mdash;with everyone speaking.</p>
<p>We should also learn not to speak lightly. We must speak with weight. Otherwise, some may say that our speaking does not have much content. Our speaking must be with content. This needs the proper learning, practice, and training; therefore, the churches should train the saints to speak with content. If we all learn to give living and weighty words whenever and wherever we speak, we will surely be welcomed by all of the churches. On the other hand, if we go to the meetings and only sit without saying anything, we will not be appreciated that much. Learn to speak, but do not speak lightly. This needs our daily practice. Every morning we should contact the Lord, reading a few verses to enjoy the Lord by enjoying His Word. We should pick up something from the Word and practice speaking the Lord the entire day. This will enrich our being, our person, and this will constitute the proper speaking. Then wherever we go, we will not only have the boldness, but also the practice and habit of speaking. If I go to visit a church and stay for a few days, I cannot refrain from speaking. I am addicted to speaking. Wherever I go, I must speak&mdash;the more, the better. Build up a habit and taste for speaking.</p>
<p>When you speak, you get the firstfruit of the benefit. While I am speaking, you get some benefit, but I get the firstfruit of the benefit. This is why I am so strong. Learn to speak. To merely listen weakens you. On the one hand, listening nourishes you. On the other hand, if you only listen to others&rsquo; speaking, it does nourish you but it does not allow you to grow. The more help you receive in this way, the more you will eventually die. We must learn to speak, speak, speak.</p>
<p>It would be marvelous if we would learn to speak every item of the contents of chapter one of this book. We can tell others, &ldquo;The Christian meeting is linked to the processed Triune God. It is linked to Christ who has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.&rdquo; We should learn to speak these things. Chapter one of this book is enough for the saints in the churches to speak on for one year, day by day and in every meeting. The contents of all my writings are embodied in this chapter. The husbands should speak concerning these things to their wives and the wives to their husbands. I have been speaking concerning God&rsquo;s economy and the processed Triune God for nearly twenty-five years in the United States, and I have not yet exhausted this subject. Speaking concerning the Triune God is like cooking American beef in many different ways. The beef is the same, but the ways of cooking and serving it are many. Learn to speak concerning the processed Christ all the time. In other words, learn to speak the same thing all the time (1 Cor. 1:10). In order to fill the meeting with mutuality, the primary thing is speaking. When everyone speaks, the meeting is always full of mutuality.</p><h2 class="head2">In Considering One Another<br />
and in Exhorting One Another</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:24 says, &ldquo;And let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works.&rdquo; &ldquo;Considering one another&rdquo; indicates mutuality. I take care of you, and you take care of me&mdash;this is mutuality. Exhorting one another in verse 25 also indicates mutuality. In the New Testament, exhortation is mutual; it is not just in one direction. With exhortation there should be a two-way traffic as indicated by the words &ldquo;one another&rdquo; in verse 25. In the meetings of Christianity, exhortation is usually from one direction&mdash;from the pastor to the congregation; there is no exhortation which goes back to the pastor. However, when we meet, our exhortation must be among ourselves; it must be mutual.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Teaching and in Admonishing</h2>
<p>Teaching and admonishing is also in mutuality (Col. 3:16). We speak to one another, teaching and admonishing one another. Sometimes, the sisters could admonish the brothers. The sisters should not say that because they are not teachers, they cannot speak. They should not teach (1 Tim. 2:12), but they should admonish. We admonish one another because we love each other. We are members of the same Body, so I admonish you and you admonish me.</p>
<p>When I was young, I discovered that some Christian teachers said that females could teach in the church meetings, but others said that they could not. One day in Los Angeles in 1963, a brother who was knowledgeable of the Bible attended our meetings. When he observed that the sisters spoke in the meetings, he asked me why we allowed the sisters to speak. He said that the sisters should be silent. I responded by asking him whether or not the sisters were silent in his meetings. He said that they were. I then asked him if the sisters sang in his meetings. He affirmed that they did. Then I asked him whether or not singing was a kind of speaking. In other words, as long as the sisters were singing in his meeting, they were not actually silent. Then I asked why the sisters were allowed to sing and were not allowed to pray.</p>
<p>How strange this was! It is strange that the sisters were qualified to sing hymns, but not qualified to pray. According to 1 Corinthians 11:5, however, women may pray and prophesy in the meeting, but they must do this under the covering of the brothers. The sisters must be emancipated to speak in the church meeting. They must be encouraged to speak, but not in terms of teaching. The sisters should not teach, but they can exhort and admonish. Many times, mothers can admonish their children better than fathers; likewise, the sisters are usually very skillful in admonishing. This is because the sisters are fine, not rough or coarse. Brothers, on the other hand, may be rough and coarse. When the brothers say &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; it can be very rough. However, when the sisters say &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; it can be like music, very pleasant to our ears. Since admonishing is a fine work, it is sometimes very difficult for the brothers to admonish. As a brother, teaching is very easy for me. But I may not be as qualified to admonish as some of the sisters. When the brothers admonish, the saints may not listen very much. But when a dear sister comes and admonishes, everyone may listen and obey. This illustrates why we need the sisters to speak. As long as they would speak and not teach, everything is fine.</p>
<p>All the sisters should be encouraged to speak. Many of the sisters need to be &ldquo;emancipated,&rdquo; not from man&rsquo;s control but from their own control. Many sisters control themselves too much. It is always good for a sister to be quiet, gentle, and meek. I agree with and appreciate this. But I do not agree that the sisters&rsquo; mouths would be shut in the meeting. The sisters need to be gentle and meek, but speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING A HIGH PRICE TO REACH THE STANDARD</h2>
<p>To reach the standard of these characteristics of the believers&rsquo; meetings requires that we pay a high price. We must endeavor to reach this highest standard so that our meetings could be revolutionized, bearing the proper characteristics. Once our meetings are converted from the old way into the new way, the Lord will have something according to His New Testament economy.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TRADITIONAL WAY<br />
TO MEET AND TO SERVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 17:8 (NASB)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the traditional way to meet and to serve. Although the fellowship in this chapter is concerning a negative and degraded situation, it is very necessary. Especially to us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, it is extremely crucial. The Scripture reading for this chapter is only the first half of 2 Kings 17:8 according to the New American Standard Bible, which tells us that the children of Israel sinned against the Lord by walking &ldquo;in the customs of the nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been among us for sixty-five years since 1922, but today some part of the traditional way to meet and to serve still remains among us. This traditional way remains in our cells and in our blood because it has been existing on this earth for over nineteen centuries. In chapter two we saw that we needed to meet according to the way ordained by the apostle in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Whenever we come together each one has something&mdash;either a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. We have studied church history and the practices of the denominations, but we could not find anyone who entered into the full reality and experience of 1 Corinthians 14:26. In the nineteenth century the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in England to recover many of the truths in the Bible. They were famous for knowing the Bible and for practicing according to the Bible, yet even they did not recover the full practice of 1 Corinthians 14:26 or Hebrews 10:25.</p>
<p>The biblical way to meet and to serve, the way ordained by God and declared by the Apostle Paul, is difficult to practice because it is against our natural man. According to this way, whenever we Christians come together, we must come with something. Everyone should have something of the Lord or for the Lord to minister, to present, to the meeting for the mutual enjoyment of the attendants. I minister something for your enjoyment, and you offer something for my enjoyment. We all minister something for each other to enjoy with God. This is like the feast of tabernacles in ancient times, to which each of the Israelites brought something. They were commanded not to come to the feast empty-handed (Deut. 16:16). Everyone was required to have something, so they brought all the surplus of the rich produce of the good land to the feast, and there they enjoyed these riches with each other. At the same time their mutual enjoyment was also with God, and their enjoyment with God and before God was the real worship.</p>
<p>In chapter one we illustrated that the Christian meeting is like the birthday of a great father with hundreds of descendants. Suppose that on his birthday all of his children would kneel down before him for twenty minutes. Surely that would shock him. He might say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see you kneeling down like this. I like to see you all enjoying my provision.&rdquo; To enjoy this great father&rsquo;s provision is the real &ldquo;worship&rdquo; to him. In John 4, the Samaritan woman brought up the subject of worship, and the Lord told her that the proper worship is the exercise of our spirit to contact God the Spirit (v. 24). To contact God the Spirit with our spirit is to drink of the living water (vv. 10, 14), and to drink of the living water is the proper and real worship of God.</p>
<p>I was born into organized Christianity, and from my youth I attended the Sunday morning services and other weekday meetings. The ones who attended those meetings were so silent. According to their feeling, those silent services were the best worship that Christians could render to God. If we look at these kinds of meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s light, we have to believe that God is not happy with them. In one of these meetings, the Lord might say, &ldquo;Is your silence a worship to Me? I don&rsquo;t like this. I like everybody speaking something about Me, about My Being, and about My doings. I would even like to hear you making a joyful noise in talking about this. You don&rsquo;t need to speak in order. All that matters is that everybody speaks.&rdquo; If all of us would speak forth the riches of the processed Triune God in our meetings, God would be happy, and that would be the best worship we could render to our Father.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRADITIONAL WAY BEING NATURAL<br />
AND ADOPTING THE WAY OF HUMAN SOCIETY<br />
FOR RELIGION&mdash;&ldquo;IN THE CUSTOMS OF THE NATIONS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The traditional way of Christianity is the opposite of this scriptural way. When I attended my mother&rsquo;s church service in her denomination, I never prepared myself because I realized that I did not need to do anything and that nearly everything would be done by our pastor. Fifty years ago in 1937, Brother Watchman Nee began to see that the traditional Sunday morning meeting is absolutely of the Gentiles. He pointed us to 2 Kings 17:8 and said that the traditional way of meeting was according to the customs of the nations, the Gentiles. The Gentile way of worship is to be silent. But the Psalms tell us to make a joyful noise unto God, Jehovah (66:1; 81:1; 95:1-2; 98:4, 6; 100:1).</p>
<p>In mainland China we had a time with Brother Nee to study the book &ldquo;The Song of Songs&rdquo; in the vicinity of a certain lake where there were many idol temples. I went for a walk at this lake and observed the situation. Each one of these worshippers was dumb. The dumb idols are worthy of dumb worship. These idol worshippers may have been very talkative in their homes, but when they came to the idol temple everyone had to be dumb. Paul&rsquo;s thought in 1 Corinthians 12 is that the dumb, voiceless idols make their worshippers dumb and voiceless (v. 2; Psa. 115:4-8), but the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit (v. 3). Paul said in 12:2 that when we were of the nations, we were led away to dumb idols. When we worshipped the idols, we were dumb. But now we are not worshipping a dumb God but a speaking God. All of His speaking is compiled together in the Holy Bible, a great volume of sixty-six books.</p>
<p>It is strange that when the Christians come together in Christianity, they are all made to be silent, dumb. Mainly, only one professional in the meetings of Christianity is talkative, speaking and speaking throughout the year, year after year. There is the feeling that the Christians who are &ldquo;laymen&rdquo; do not know what to speak and they may speak wrongly. Thus, it is better for them not to speak and to let one professional speak. This practice started shortly after the early apostles departed to be with the Lord at the end of the first century.</p>
<p>This traditional way began to exist and it gradually became very prevailing because this way to worship God without speaking is very natural. It fits our natural habit and taste. When you bring an unbelieving Gentile to the Lord and ask him to speak immediately after his salvation, he may be frightened. He may especially be frightened to speak to a big audience. He may say, &ldquo;In my entire life, I never spoke to more than fifteen persons at one time, and now you are asking me to speak in a meeting of one hundred and fifty persons. This will compel me to withdraw from Christianity. I don&rsquo;t want such a speaking religion that forces me to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you set up a nice hall with good seats, some singers to either sing solos or to sing in groups, and an eloquent, learned, and polished speaker, everyone will like it. According to their natural thought, people feel that this is the proper way to worship God. They enter quietly into the cathedral or place of worship. Then the choir may sing a song or someone may sing a solo that is pleasant, relaxing, and comforting. A busy banker who has been working hard all week may feel that this place of worship is the best place for him to be relaxed. Even a mother with many children may feel that the cathedral is a calm, silent place where she can escape from the noise and crying at home. After the singing, a certain pastor or reverend would offer a prayer and take care of the Scripture reading in a professional manner. The pastors are the experts, the professionals. Then another pastor may stand up to give a message with much eloquence and much knowledge. This kind of speaking pleases and comforts everyone.</p>
<p>The content of our meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is wonderful. But regardless of how wonderful the content is, our way to practice the meetings is somewhat similar to the practice of Christianity. Not many among us pray to prepare ourselves for the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. The saints may only ask, &ldquo;Who is going to speak?&rdquo; When they hear that a certain brother will speak who is a good speaker, they are happy. They do not get themselves prepared because they do not need to do anything. They just come to the meeting to enjoy the speaking. Sometimes the brothers and sisters may criticize the brother who is speaking. They may say, &ldquo;Who put this man on the podium? His illustrations are not very good, his voice is too low, he is not so eloquent, and he does not know the Bible very well.&rdquo; If another brother speaks the following week, some may say, &ldquo;This brother is better than the one last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely we received some feeding from this kind of meeting because the word of God was always spoken. We did get some feeding from the word of God. In this kind of meeting, however, there was hardly any exercise on the part of the saints for them to have the development in the divine life. In order to maintain our physical life, we need to eat, but in order to develop properly, we must also exercise. Basically speaking, the children in the United States have grown so big and have been so healthy because of good eating and good exercise. In the traditional way of meeting, there may be some eating, but there is hardly any exercise.</p>
<p>About thirty years ago in Manila, a group of brothers among us went to visit a person who was sick in the hospital. These brothers all prayed for him in the presence of some of his relatives, who were also Christians. After listening to the brothers&rsquo; prayers, they were shocked. They asked them if they were a group of pastors, and the brothers told them they were not. Then they asked the brothers how they could pray so well. They told the brothers that they had been Christians for years, but they did not know how to pray. They did not know how to pray after having been Christians for years because they did not have any practice.</p>
<p>In the traditional way of Christianity there is no need for the &ldquo;laymen&rdquo; to pray. The professionals take care of the major parts of the service. They read the holy Word, pray, and speak on the Word. This traditional way annuls the organic function of the living members of Christ. I was born into Christianity, and I was compelled to go to Sunday school every Sunday morning, but no one there taught us the practice of prayer. I never prayed until I was born again at the age of nineteen. Before that time I had been in Christianity for years, but there was no one to help or instruct me to pray. Generally speaking, hardly anyone learns how to pray when they are in the traditional way of meeting and serving.</p>
<p>This traditional way which has been existing for over nineteen hundred years still, at least in part, remains among us. Brother Nee saw this matter fifty years ago, and he spoke concerning this (see chapter four of <em>Church Affairs</em> and chapter nine of <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> by Watchman Nee, published by Living Stream Ministry). He asked me to share one of his messages on this subject when he was ill. Brother Nee talked with me at length concerning the traditional way of meeting versus the scriptural way. He pointed out that the scriptural way to meet was in 1 Corinthians 14:26, but we did not find a way to carry out what he saw. Brother Nee also pointed out that this traditional way had become a strong habit, a strong custom, deeply rooted in the believers&rsquo; hearts.</p>
<p>Whenever a human being would turn to God, they naturally would like to worship God not by speaking but by coming together to hear something about God. This is according to their natural thought, fits their habit and taste, and does not cost them anything but rather renders them some relaxation, comfort, and enjoyment. In the New Testament, however, especially in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we are charged to worship God by speaking. A psalm is not only for singing but also for speaking. A teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation are also by speaking. For 1 Corinthians 14:26 to be realized everyone needs to speak. It is very hard for anyone to speak in a public place. People&rsquo;s disposition by nature is not to speak anything publicly. People would rather listen and look than speak publicly.</p>
<p>This traditional way of not speaking is deeply rooted in man&rsquo;s disposition. It has become a strong habit. The Hebrew word for &ldquo;customs&rdquo; in 2 Kings 17:8 is also used in other places in the Old Testament, particularly in Leviticus where it is translated as &ldquo;statutes&rdquo; (18:5, 26; 19:19, 37; 20:8, 22; 25:18; 26:3, 15, 43, 46). Brother Nee pointed to 2 Kings 17:8 to say that having a meeting like the Sunday morning service in Christianity was according to &ldquo;the customs of the nations.&rdquo; A custom is a kind of habit. When a habit exists for a long time, it becomes a custom that is popular in society. When this custom is practiced for a long period of time, it becomes a written regulation, even a statute. In other words, after a period of time a habit becomes a custom, and after another period of time a custom becomes a statute. We like to quote the New American Standard Bible which uses the word &ldquo;customs.&rdquo; The traditional way of worship is not only a habit but also a custom.</p>
<p>Most of the unbelievers know how the Christians in Christianity worship God. They know what the edifices of worship look like. They also know that a pastor will be speaking with the audience sitting in pews to listen to him. The people in China say &ldquo;to listen to the preaching&rdquo; is &ldquo;to worship&rdquo; because this traditional way of meeting is not only the Christians&rsquo; habit but also their custom. To have a pastor speak while the rest sit and listen is a very strong custom throughout the world. This kind of realization and understanding of the way to meet has been sown into our blood. It is in the cells of anyone who has been a Christian for a number of years.</p>
<p>Brother Nee firstly said that this traditional way to meet was a habit, a custom, and he secondly said that we do not have anything to replace it. If we took away the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting, with what could we replace it? Even though he saw this matter as early as 1937, there was no attempt to practice the scriptural way of meeting for eleven years. The last chapter of <em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em> entitled &ldquo;The Organization of Local Churches,&rdquo; talks about the church meeting according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26. The English edition of this book was published in 1939. In 1948, Brother Nee had a training for four months at Mount Kuling, China, and during this time he came back again to this matter of the traditional way of meeting versus the scriptural way. The messages on this subject are printed in the book <em>Church Affairs.</em> In this book he strongly pointed out that the Sunday morning meeting according to the practice of the denominations, the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting, is a waste and is not worthy of maintaining (pp. 67-70, 81-82). In 1949, the year after Brother Nee released this word, mainland China was lost into the hands of the Communists. Then Brother Nee was put into prison for twenty years until he died. Thus, there was no time for Brother Nee to do something to bring us into the practice of this vision.</p>
<p>By 1984, I realized that the situation and the condition of the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery both in the West and the Far East was nearly at a standstill. There was very little increase and very little spread. The saints migrated to Orange County, California in 1974 and within ten years up to 1984 the churches there had very little increase. This situation bothered me and burdened me. After much consideration, I felt that we needed to have a proper start to establish the scriptural way of meeting and serving in the churches. I realized that the right place and even the best place for me to help the saints to have such a new start was in Taiwan. However, a few still prefer to have the kind of meeting in which one speaks and the rest listen. Most agree with the scriptural way, but deep within them they still have a preference for the traditional way of meeting. Despite this, we can declare that the Lord has gained a victory in Taipei. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day there are over four thousand three hundred saints meeting together in eighty-six places. These meetings are called district meetings (see chapter seven entitled &ldquo;District Meetings&rdquo; in <em>Church Affairs</em>). These saints are taking the scriptural way and making good progress.</p><h2 class="head1">FITTING MAN&rsquo;S NATURAL AND FALLEN CONDITION</h2>
<p>The traditional way to meet and to serve fits man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition. When people attend the traditional and natural worship service, there is no need for them to have any preparation. I had a classmate who was a Christian. After our graduation from school, we both went to work. Then the Lord raised me up to establish the church life in my hometown, and we had the Lord&rsquo;s table in my home. My classmate felt that since we had the Lord&rsquo;s table in my home, he could do the same thing in his home. The table in his home that they used for the Lord&rsquo;s table was used for three purposes. On Sunday they used that table to eat breakfast and lunch. In between breakfast and lunch, they used the same table to have the Lord&rsquo;s table. Then in the afternoon they used that table to play mah-jong. So that one table was used for three purposes: for dining, for having the Lord&rsquo;s table, and for gambling. This way of meeting fit their fallen condition.</p>
<p>In the Sunday morning meeting of today&rsquo;s Christianity, there may be many persons in attendance who are living in a sinful condition. They may come to the Sunday morning worship service in peace despite having quarreled with their spouse or having done some evil things the previous night. Some might have even gained some money in an unrighteous way and they would give some of it to the church as a gift. They could worship God in the traditional way in their fallen condition. There is no need of any kind of change in the attendants&rsquo; lives for the traditional way of meeting. But if we Christians are going to take the biblical way as seen in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we all have to get ourselves prepared. We have to confess our sins and pray to receive the infilling of the Spirit. We have to accumulate some experiences from enjoying the Lord through the Word. Otherwise, when we come to the meeting, we will not be able to speak because our conscience will bother us. Even if our conscience does not bother us, we still will not have anything to speak if we do not get ourselves properly prepared.</p>
<p>To have Christian meetings according to the biblical way requires a revival. We have to live a victorious life. Some of the saints often may not function in the meetings because they quarreled with their spouse at home. A brother&rsquo;s small quarrel with his wife is good enough to kill his functioning spirit. If a brother quarrels with his wife without confessing to the Lord and to her concerning his sin, his conscience will condemn him, and he will not be able to utter anything of Christ. He will not have the peace, the joy, and the anointing within him that gives him the boldness to say something for the Lord. He may have something to say about the Lord, but he will not have the peace within until he makes a thorough confession. After this confession, he will be released. He will have the peace, the joy, the anointing through the cleansing of the blood, and thus the freedom in the Spirit to speak. To meet in a natural way does not require us to repent or be filled with the Spirit; we do not need the blood, the anointing, the word, or even the Lord. But if we want to worship God in the biblical way, we have to be dealt with, cleansed, washed, forgiven, and filled with the heavenly wine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT REQUIRING MAN<br />
TO BE LIVING AND IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The traditional way to meet and to serve does not require man to be living and in the spirit. A person can be dormant and dull and still come to a traditional meeting. But to come to a biblical meeting which is the very Holy of Holies requires us to be living and in the spirit. We need to be forgiven, cleansed, and washed. We need to make a thorough confession to receive the infilling of the Holy Spirit. We need to accumulate the experience of the enjoyment of the Lord through His holy Word. We have to accumulate this experience day after day; then we will have a storage of the riches of Christ that we can speak in the meetings. The natural way to meet does not require anything. A person could steal during the week, and still come to a natural worship service on Sunday.</p><h2 class="head1">RELIGIOUS</h2>
<p>The natural way of meeting and serving is also religious. I was in Jerusalem in 1958, and I saw the Muslims worshipping at the great mosque built on the site of the old temple. They seemed so godly. They prostrated themselves on the ground and remained there for awhile. They were very silent. Many were worshipping God in that way in orderly rows. Because that mosque was a holy place to them, they were required to take off their shoes. Their worship was absolutely natural. As long as it is natural, it is also religious. No Spirit, no life, no experience of Christ, no salvation, no redemption, and no blood are needed. Such natural, religious worship is highly appraised by the Muslims. Many Christians today are still taking the natural way to worship God religiously.</p>
<p>When I first came to minister in the United States in 1962, my messages were focused on the human spirit. Some among us who had been missionaries and pastors and were theological school graduates thanked me for what I shared with them concerning the human spirit. They said that they never knew that they had a human spirit. No one had ever told them that they had a human spirit for the purpose of worshipping God. For worshipping God we have a spirit. The Lord Jesus said that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit (John 4:24). Before coming into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, many of us did not know that we had a human spirit, an organ created by God for His worship. If we do not know that we have a spirit, how can we worship God properly? If we want to walk, we must know that we have two feet with two legs with which to practice walking.</p>
<p>In the beginning of my ministry in the United States, I also stressed the worship of God in a proper way by the exercise of our spirit. Many came to me and said that they did not know how to exercise their spirit. I asked them how they exercised their legs, and they said by walking, running, and jumping. Then I told them that to exercise our spirit we need to pray and call on the name of the Lord. We can exercise our spirit by calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Due to my age, I cannot run too fast or jump too high, but I can exercise by walking. I try to walk every day for an hour, and this exercise is very healthy. In like manner, it is not necessary for us to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; in a thunderous way to exercise our spirit. We can say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, I love You. Lord, I love Your church. Lord, I love to contact You. I love to dwell on Your Word. I love to enjoy You, and I want to enjoy You right now.&rdquo; After praying by calling on the Lord for twenty minutes, we will have a strong spirit. If we would pray for a longer time every day, our spirit would be very strong.</p>
<p>The unique way to exercise your spirit, to make your spirit so living and strong, is to pray. Nothing can replace your prayer. If you are weak in your spirit, it is because you are short of prayer. Some may feel that they do not know how to pray or what to pray for. If you do not know how to pray, just say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; If you say &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; twenty times, the Lord will have a way to set you on fire, to make you burning in spirit (Rom. 12:11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRADUALLY PRACTICING THE NEW WAY<br />
UNTIL IT IS FULLY ABLE TO REPLACE THE OLD WAY</h2>
<p>After reading the fellowship in this book, a brother should not tell the elders in his locality to immediately stop the kind of meeting where one speaks and the rest listen and establish a meeting in which everybody speaks. It would be correct for the elders to respond, &ldquo;Dear brother, if we stop that kind of meeting, we will not know how to meet.&rdquo; You have to listen to your elders in this matter. Do not go too fast. You have to be patient. Go along with the elders, but try to help the situation. The elders in the churches want to practice the new way, but they need some time to pick up the new way themselves and to learn how to help the saints practice the new way.</p>
<p>I have been in Taipei for the last three years. It was not until recently that we directed the church in Taipei into the full practice of the new way. We realized that we had to help all the saints to practice the new way until they reached a certain level where the new way could fully replace the old way. When this level was reached, we dropped the old way. While you are learning a new way of cooking, you will still not fully know how to cook in this new way. If you stop your old way of cooking at this juncture, the people for whom you cook will go hungry. At this time the churches should keep the old way. The old way is still needed for some time. Use the old way to serve the saints. Meanwhile, the leading ones should do their best to teach, to train, and to help all the saints to practice the new way. Gradually they will learn the new way to the extent that they will have something to replace the old way. That will be the time for the church to practice the new way in full.</p>
<p>One local church closed the meeting hall on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning and sent the saints to meet in small groups in the homes. Most of the saints sat in these small groups without knowing what to say or do. I fellowshipped with the leading brothers to let the saints come back to the hall. It is not easy to change an old habit and to replace it with something new. This takes time. A transitory period of three or more years may be needed for the churches to fully enter into the new way. We all have to exercise our wisdom and patience with the church in our locality. Do not impose something on others who have not yet practiced the truth concerning the scriptural way to meet and to serve.</p>
<p>We need to pray for the full recovery of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. The leading ones need to do their best to help the church by teaching and training the saints so that they can be fully brought into the new way. The old way is the traditional way, the natural way, and the Gentile way. The new way is biblical, and this way is a way of life and a way in the spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TRADITIONAL WAY<br />
TO MEET AND TO SERVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:6; Eph. 4:12b, 15-16</h1>
<p>In the last chapter we considered several points concerning the traditional way to meet and serve. These points include the following: the traditional way adopts the way of human society for religion&mdash;&ldquo;in the customs of the nations&rdquo; (2 Kings 17:8, NASB); the traditional way is natural, fitting man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition; the traditional way does not require man to be living and in the spirit; and the traditional way is religious. In this chapter we shall consider some other points concerning the traditional way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCOMMODATING THE DEAD MAN&rsquo;S TASTE</h2>
<p>The traditional way of meeting accommodates the dead man&rsquo;s taste. Many of us who were in the traditional way in Christianity for a number of years can recall what we saw there. I attended Christianity services from my youth. I saw many people who were dead spiritually. The so-called church service just accommodated these dead people. Many of them were happy because they had a kind of social life which they called the church. Week after week, Sunday after Sunday, a certain portion was read from the Bible as a subject, yet year-round there was no change in the people. They simply attended services every Sunday.</p>
<p>That is the situation of Christianity, and we came out of it. But I observed that gradually, unknowingly, unintentionally, and unconsciously, we were drifting back to a similar situation. By 1984 I fully realized that our meetings were somewhat accommodating the dead situation of the traditional way. The saints came to the meetings with little exercise. The ones who gave the messages were nearly in a similar situation. I observed how the leading ones discussed and decided who was to give the message in the Sunday morning meeting. Eventually, someone was selected as a &ldquo;victim&rdquo; and charged to share the message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. That day became a sad day for the one selected. Was there a burden for the Sunday morning meeting? Quite often the one selected really did not have a burden. Why did the speaker speak? Why did the church have that meeting? Those meetings were held as a routine. We felt that we had to have this kind of meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to maintain the church&rsquo;s situation. Not many had a real burden for the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting, and most of the attendants came to the meeting as a matter of routine.</p>
<p>Some places may have been different, but many of the elders admitted that the church where they were had entered into a dormant situation. The church had become dormant, yet they still kept certain meetings. All of the meetings had become, to a large extent, a kind of routine. The attendants went in a routine way, without much burden. This corresponds to the dead situation. Yet this kind of situation existed among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States after twenty-two years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WAY OF MIXTURE</h2>
<p>The traditional way is also a way of mixture, mixing the fleshly with the spiritual and the heavenly with the earthly. Look at the situation of the Sunday services in Christianity today. Too many fleshly activities are merged into the spiritual things, and quite an amount of earthly element is blended with the heavenly things. Such a mixture began with Catholicism since Constantine the Great made Christianity a universal religion in the Roman Empire, as prophesied by the Lord Jesus in the parable of leaven in Matthew 13:33. This kind of contaminating and corrupting leaven has never been purged out in all the Protestant denominations, and the sad thing is that no denomination has the sincere intention to purge it out.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT PREVAILING IN THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Another aspect of the traditional way to meet and to serve, which looks very good but is not so encouraging, is the preaching of the gospel. The preaching of the gospel in the Christianity way is not prevailing. Its way of preaching the gospel also accommodates the poor situation and dead condition of the function-annulled and life-choked Christians. The main factor of the old way in preaching the gospel is to set up a meeting with an eloquent speaker and invite people to attend the preaching meeting to listen to the speaker. In this way, there is no need of the development of the spiritual function of all the members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>One thing that concerned me to the uttermost was the low rate of increase among the churches. In Orange County, from 1974 to 1984, there was very little increase. We did baptize some new ones, but as a whole the balance showed a debit that was greater than the credit. This indicates that our gospel preaching has not been very effective or adequate.</p>
<p>By studying these matters, I realized that we needed to have a new start in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In principle, we should not try to gain people from the denominations, but we should try to help people from among the Gentiles to be saved. Based upon this realization, I began to study how to preach the gospel. At this time the matter of visiting people by knocking on their doors came to my understanding. There is no other way that is as effective in contacting people as door-knocking. However, in order to carry out the practice of door-knocking, everyone who was burdened had to pay a price.</p>
<p>Although we had somewhat practiced visiting people in their homes in the past, it was not so effective because we did it in a natural, untrained way. After returning to Taiwan, we set up a training. The first point we studied and investigated thoroughly was how to be effective in visiting people by knocking on their doors. We formed our discoveries into instructions, which became a part of the training. We practiced our discoveries and we found out the way which was the most effective. I never expected to baptize as many as we have baptized. In less than two years, we baptized thirty-eight thousand people in Taipei.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BINDING AND ANNULLING THE ORGANIC FUNCTION<br />
OF THE LIVING MEMBERS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The traditional way has bound and annulled the organic function of the members of the Body of Christ for many centuries. This has been done under a very pleasant covering. Some would say that we need to have a meeting not only to help the sinners get saved by preaching the gospel to them, but also to help the new ones get fed and edified. This sounds very good, and everyone would say that this is needed, but the subtlety of the evil one is present here.</p>
<p>The denominations have millions of members, but very few of these members are useful. On the one hand, the clerical class, the professionals, may help their so-called churches to be increased. But on the other hand, they annul the function of the members of the Body of Christ. There may be a great number among them, but most of them are annulled in their function. Many remain in this condition for their whole life. With this kind of situation, where is the possibility for the saints to be built up in an organic way&mdash;where their spirit has been regenerated, their souls are being transformed, and they are growing in spirit by the transformation in their souls together with other fellow members? Where are the saints experiencing the all-inclusive Christ and growing with Him, having the freedom and opportunity for their spiritual, organic function to be developed, and being built up together in the spirit so that not only a local church but also the whole Body of Christ can be built up as the full expression of God?</p><h2 class="head1">CHOKING AND KILLING THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The traditional way has not only bound and annulled the spiritual function of the members of Christ but also has choked and even killed the living members of Christ for all the time in the past history of the church. On the one hand, the traditional way feeds people, but on the other hand, because of the clerical class, in many aspects it frustrates the believers from growing in life and even chokes them to death. Hence, most of the believers are spiritually dead in their church services. Although we have left organized Christianity, its traditional way to meet and to serve still influences us to quite an extent, and we are even under its bondage, without any awareness of its damage to the Body of Christ, which we are endeavoring to build up by all its members functioning in each one&rsquo;s measure (Eph. 4:16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING NO POSSIBILITY<br />
OF BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>According to Ephesians 4:11-12, Christ, the Head, has given us the gifted persons, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. Verses 15 and 16 say, &ldquo;But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; &ldquo;Out from whom&rdquo; means from Christ, the Head. &ldquo;All the Body&rdquo; includes all the members of the Body, not just the gifted ones. The &ldquo;operation in measure of each one part&rdquo; means that each member has a measure for God&rsquo;s operation. &ldquo;Each one part&rdquo; refers to every member of the Body. Every member of the Body of Christ has its own measure which works for the growth of the Body. In the traditional way, can we see the building up of the Body of Christ mentioned in verse 12 or particularly in verse 16? In the traditional way of Christianity, we cannot see the function of every joint of the supply or the operation of each one part. On the contrary, the clerical class does their job while all the other members do nothing. Can we see any proper building up of the saints in life and in their spirit according to the traditional way? Can we see anything of the building up through every joint of the supply and according to the measure of each one part which causes the growth of the Body that the Body might build itself up? It is impossible for these things to be realized in Christianity&rsquo;s traditional way of meeting and serving.</p>
<p>Although we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must admit that we have not realized very much of the building up of the Body of Christ. I have seen many local churches set up since 1962 when I came to the Western world. Since that time, mainly through the publications of this ministry, I have seen six to seven hundred churches raised up. Many local churches have been set up in South America, Central America, and in the Philippines. The number of churches has increased, but the number within the churches is relatively small. Very few churches exceed one hundred members. There are twenty churches in California and the number of churches has increased, yet I did not hear that the numbers had increased in most of the churches. The number of churches has increased because people were helped to take this way through the publications of the ministry and stand in a locality to be the church. But where is the proper preaching of the gospel among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? A certain number of churches have been raised up on six continents, but the preaching of the gospel has not been effective or adequate in any place.</p>
<p>Actually, the way we adopted to preach the gospel was the way we inherited from Christianity. In the past two years, we studied the statistics of all the major denominations in the United States and England. Many denominations have been decreasing in numbers. The Southern Baptists have been increasing, but the rate of increase among them has been very low. In 1964, the Southern Baptists had approximately eleven million. By 1986, more than twenty years later, they had only gained about four million. Their rate of increase has been less than two percent a year. If there had been a yearly increase of only ten percent among them, within this same period, they could have had nearly a seven-fold increase to about seventy-four million members. The big denominations in England have been more greatly reduced than those in the United States.</p>
<p>In our fellowship in this chapter, we have seen that the traditional way to meet and to serve is accommodating the dead man&rsquo;s taste. It is a way of mixture, mixing the fleshly with the spiritual and the heavenly with the earthly. It binds and annuls the organic function of the living members of Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 12:6). It also chokes and kills the members of Christ (cf. Eph. 4:15), leaving no possibility of building up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The old traditional way surely does not work well. If we use it, it will kill us. Why would we not endeavor to use the biblical way, the way ordained by God? It is hard, but I believe that there is a way. If we would cooperate with our able God, He will surely carry out His recovery. I believe that within ten years something will be accomplished. Let us all endeavor. Together we all must push the old way aside by endeavoring in the new way. When we do this, we must do it wisely. We must exercise wisdom and patience, so that we do not lose very much. But we also must realize that in changing anything, we do lose something. There must be a transitional period. During the transition, we must walk slowly, carefully, and wisely so that we do not lose too much. We must try our best to reduce our losses. Gradually, we will arrive at our destination.</p>
<p>Changing our way is like preparing a meal. While the meal is being prepared in the kitchen, there is a mess; so it is best not to go into the kitchen. It is better to wait in the living room until the meal is prepared and set upon the table perhaps with a very colorful arrangement. Then we will admire the feast. I have been in the &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo; in Taipei for these past three years. Unfortunately, some dear saints have crept into this kitchen and have seen the situation. Today, however, I would invite you to go and see something else in Taipei. In the United States, the mess of the kitchen is still here. Do not be disappointed or bothered. Simply go back to your place and endeavor wisely, slowly, and with much grace and patience. The Lord will be with you.</p>
<p>We must know the real situation, the real hardship, and the real thing that we must do. We must endeavor positively with full assurance, knowing that nothing can frustrate us because this scriptural way is something of the Lord that He will carry out. As long as we cooperate with Him, He surely will use us to carry it out. We must have the full assurance with much faith and be exercised in our spirit. We need to pray that the Lord will have a way through us to accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE SCRIPTURAL WAY<br />
TO MEET AND TO SERVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 13:52; Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL,<br />
FITTING THE TASTE<br />
OF THE LIVING AND SPIRITUAL MAN, AND<br />
REQUIRING MAN TO BE LIVING AND IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The scriptural way to meet and to serve is in contrast to the traditional way. In chapter four we saw that the traditional way to meet and to serve is natural, fitting man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition, not requiring man to be living and in the spirit, religious, and adopting the way of human society for religion. In contrast to this, the scriptural way to meet and to serve is spiritual, fitting the taste of the living and spiritual man, and requiring man to be living and in the spirit. It requires him to confess his sins, failures, and wrongdoings thoroughly and to deal with all negative things, and it requires him to be filled with the Spirit (Acts 13:52), living and walking in and according to the spirit (Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4). Furthermore, it is against the religious and social way of meeting and service and is unpleasant to the natural man.</p>
<p>When we were in the denominations, we attended meetings in the traditional way. As long as we were either not saved or saved but deadened in our spirit, we felt good about those meetings. Within us was no dissatisfaction or expectation of anything further. We felt that everything there was good, including the silence. However, once we were saved or revived, our spirit was quickened and stirred up to seek the Lord. After this, whenever some of us attended this kind of traditional meeting, we were offended. This way of meeting did not fit our condition. When we were deadened, this way of meeting fit our condition, but once we were made alive, became living, and sought to live a life of seeking after Christ, this way of meeting began to offend us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS AND<br />
SOCIAL WAY OF MEETING AND SERVICE</h2>
<p>The scriptural way to meet and to serve surely is against the religious and social way of meeting and service. The religious and social way, as we have seen, is natural, fitting man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition and not requiring man to be living and in the spirit. The scriptural way is just the opposite. As we have seen, this way is spiritual. It fits the taste of the living and spiritual man and requires man to be living and in the spirit. To take this way we need to be revived, to live a victorious life, and to walk by and according to the spirit. For this way to be prevailing in our meeting and in our service, we also need to have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord daily and hourly. We need to contact the Lord from the beginning of each day by calling on His name and pray-reading His Word that we may enjoy Him and be supplied with His riches. We need to speak Him to people all day long whether in season or out of season. To live such a life for the scriptural way to meet and to serve surely requires us always to pay a price. It is absolutely against our natural desire and tendency. It is also against the religious life and social customs. For this we need to pray much and receive grace from the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">UNPLEASANT TO THE NATURAL MAN</h2>
<p>We have seen that the traditional way to meet and to serve fits man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition. It is surely pleasant to the natural man. But the scriptural way, since it is against the religious life and social customs, could not be pleasant to the natural man&rsquo;s feelings. It is only pleasant to the spiritual man who is living in the spirit to live Christ pleasantly toward God. This does not only change our Christian life and family life but also our church life to overcome fully our natural man in all its aspects.</p><h2 class="head1">CHANGES NEEDED IN TAKING THE SCRIPTURAL WAY</h2>
<p>Since the scriptural way to meet and to serve is opposite to the traditional way in which we have been for quite some time, to take the scriptural way we need to have some changes in our meeting and service.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Changing the Way of Meeting</h2>
<p>Consider what our situation would be if we all had a proper daily living. Early in the morning after rising, we should call on the name of the Lord and feed on two or three verses, not only reading and pray-reading them but dwelling upon them to enjoy the Lord. Then throughout the whole day we should continually abide in the Lord, live the Lord, and walk and move according to the spirit. Whenever we meet anyone, we should speak the Lord to them through His Word, in season and out of season. This practice will cause something to be continually accumulated within us. We will become rich with Christ. Furthermore, we should let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, making its home in us. If this is our living, then surely we will desire to meet, either with our family, our neighbors, in a small group meeting, or in a bigger meeting. It will be so easy for each one of us to spontaneously release something of Christ in any kind of meeting. Everyone, young or old, the least or the greatest, brother or sister, will have something to say. If this is the condition of our meetings, they will be filled with Christ. They will be living, rich, uplifting, refreshing, enlivening, and releasing. This will change our meeting from the traditional way to the scriptural way. Actually, it is not difficult to have such a meeting. But even such an easy matter needs to be built up.</p>
<p>Changing our way of meeting may be compared to changing to a new language. To speak is not difficult, but if we did not practice speaking from the first year of our life, waiting instead until we were fully grown, it would be very difficult. After one is grown, for him to change to a new language is very hard. For years all the saints have been speaking our &ldquo;old language.&rdquo; Now we are changing to a &ldquo;new language,&rdquo; and many do not know what to do. I have the deep feeling that we must teach our brothers and sisters in the same way that a mother teaches her baby to speak.</p>
<p>The saints among us have been in a certain practice, a habit, a custom, for years. If we suddenly changed our ways, they could not endure it. The habit, the custom, we have practiced for so long has become a special taste to us. If we take away that for which we have a taste, some will not feel good about our situation.</p>
<p>You must understand and care for the situation today. Do not neglect the needs of the saints. You must be clear about this, and you must steadily take the scriptural way and endeavor to accomplish something. At the same time, do not neglect any needs or offend anyone. This is not easy, but I know that it can be worked out. On the one hand, we endeavor to do everything we can to carry out what we have been charged to do, and on the other hand, we must do our best to take care of every fine point in our situation. Then the Lord will have a free way to go on within a short period of time to build up a new habit in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel<br />
by Visiting People in Their Homes</h2>
<p>To take the scriptural way to meet and to serve, there is also the need to change our preaching of the gospel by taking up the way of visiting people in their homes. From the beginning I had no intention to ask all the attendants in the meetings to go out to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes. I only expected that one-fourth of the meeting brothers and sisters would do this. If there are one hundred saints meeting together, it would be adequate for twenty-five to go out. This will bring in fifty or one hundred percent increase yearly.</p>
<p>I heard that in some places, those who were &ldquo;hot&rdquo; in the matter of door-knocking encouraged everyone to go out in this way. We do not need to push this way, but we must endeavor to carry it out in a proper way. I believe that the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and His grace are with us. As we are endeavoring to carry this out, He will do something to get twenty-five percent of the man-power of the saints to pick up the burden to visit people by knocking on their doors and to make door-knocking a habit built up in the church. In the past, we did not have such a habit built up in the church. Therefore, we did not have the adequate way to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>After much study of the Bible, of church history, and of biographies, we have concluded that there is no other way for the gospel to be so prevailing, so effective, and so thorough as with door-knocking. In the past year, I have received many letters giving reports concerning this matter. They are very encouraging and exciting. One month ago, a cable came from Liberia, Africa, telling me that eighteen saints went out to knock on doors. After about twelve hours, they knocked on over two hundred doors and baptized one hundred forty-six people. Something similar happened in Ghana, Africa. A brother who went back to that country reported that not only was the door-knocking effective, but also the church meetings were very good. Many reports have said the same thing: wherever there was the practice of door-knocking, there was a revival. One brother who had been in the church for over thirty years was formerly so silent and cold. However, recently he became excited and shouted that he was happy, not only because sinners were saved, but also because the saints had been revived. Many others have testified in a similar way. Favorable letters have come to me from every continent.</p>
<p>In Taipei, after only three terms of training of four months each, we have baptized thirty-eight thousand people. Because we did not have enough workers to care for each one of them, we were only able to care for about six thousand of these new ones. Out of this number we now have over three thousand meeting together at least once a week, and over two thousand others meeting occasionally. In such a short period of time, we gained six thousand people.</p>
<p>In the summer training of 1987, we went out in Orange County to knock on people&rsquo;s doors. The trainees baptized about thirty-seven hundred people. Gradually, these newly baptized ones brought in another eight hundred people. Out of this forty-five hundred, over seven hundred regularly meet once or more a week, and over another seven hundred meet occasionally.</p>
<p>In September of 1987, the Chinese-speaking saints were burdened to have a gospel festival in the San Gabriel Valley in California. Through that festival, a little over one thousand new ones were baptized. Out of this number, two hundred are regularly meeting with us now.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO PAY A PRICE</h2>
<p>The foregoing statistics prove that the way of preaching the gospel by knocking on people&rsquo;s doors is prevailing. We could not find another way so prevailing. However, our success depends on whether or not the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would sacrifice and pay the price. We must pay a price, for this way is not easy. If you go out to visit people in a natural way, you may gain no one, even after knocking on two hundred doors. You must take the way of prayer. Before going out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors, you must pray to confess your sins, failures, and wrongdoings. Confess that for a long time you have not lived Christ, you have not lived to God. Make a thorough confession to receive the infilling of the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:52). Then exercise your faith to believe that the ascended Christ is with you as the One who has been given all authority in heaven and on earth. You will be able to tell the whole universe, &ldquo;I am going out, not by myself, but with Him who is sovereign over the heavens and the earth. Formerly, when I went without Him, my arms and legs were shaking with fear. Now I am different. I am coming to knock on this door with Christ, the Lord of lords. I have the boldness.&rdquo; When the occupant opens the door, you may say, &ldquo;I have a grace to pass on to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assure you that you will be successful. Formerly you might have knocked on two hundred doors without finding one son of peace (Luke 10:6). But if you go out in this way, you will find many sons of peace. To go out in this way makes a difference. However, you must be prepared to sacrifice yourself. Forget about your face. Some may scold you and slam the door on you. You must be prepared to joyfully receive all manner of persecution.</p>
<p>Do not criticize those who go out to knock on doors in this way. They are sacrificing much. They have paid a high price. If you do not go out to visit people by knocking on their doors, it may be that you are not so willing to sacrifice. Thank the Lord that some are willing. Stay at home to pray for them. Support them with your prayer and even with material things. I love these young saints who have paid such a price. I have watched them and have seen their sacrifice. Some young sisters have knocked on the door of university professors. On first meeting these sisters and the brothers who accompanied them, the professors somewhat despised them. But when the sisters opened their mouths, the professors were subdued and became as little lambs. When the sisters told them to change their clothes to be baptized, they did it. When the sisters told the professors&rsquo; wives to prepare the water for baptism, they did it. Within only fifteen minutes, the whole family was subdued.</p>
<p>Could you do this? It is conditional. Without such a dealing before the Lord, with the Lord, and in the Lord, we could never go out in such a strong way. Some in one denomination knocked on sixteen hundred doors but did not baptize one person. How we go out makes a big difference. If we pay the price and sacrifice much, we will surely go out with Christ, with the Triune God, and full of power, authority, and boldness. We will be afraid of nothing. This kind of boldness in a young sister will subdue everyone. This way of knocking on doors will not be in the common way. Rather, we will be desperate to knock on doors and tell people that we have a heavenly commission to pass on to them the Triune God. This way of presentation will shock people. They will surely invite us in and receive our word. The way in which we go out makes a great difference.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE SCRIPTURAL WAY<br />
TO MEET AND TO SERVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:6b; Eph. 5:29; 4:15, 12, 16</h1>
<p>This chapter may be considered as a conclusion of the last three chapters. In chapters four and five, we presented a clear picture of the old way, the traditional way, to meet and to serve. There is nothing in this traditional way but the annulling of the organic functions of the living members of the Body of Christ and the binding and killing of the living members of the Body of Christ. The traditional way of practice is full of mixture because this old way fits the natural man&rsquo;s taste. This way is full of the mixture of the heavenly things with the earthly things and of the fleshly things with the spiritual things. The result, or the issue, of this kind of old, traditional way is that the members of the Body of Christ have lost their function and have become useless. The scriptural way, the Lord&rsquo;s way, is altogether the opposite of the traditional way. This new way is really able. It is able to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and it is able to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABLE TO ENLIVEN MAN</h2>
<p>The ancient but newly found way to meet and to serve is able to enliven man (2 Cor. 3:6b). If we all endeavor to get into the practicality of this new way, there will be life and enlivening whenever we come together, either in a home meeting, a group meeting, or a much bigger meeting. Whoever comes into this kind of meeting will be enlivened.</p>
<p>In 1978 I was burdened to bring all the saints back to life and truth, and I told them that to endeavor to gain the increase is to run a risk. If we seek to gain the increase in a worldly, natural way, that will bring in a real mixture which will kill the Body. After what happened among us in 1978, I spoke strongly that we have to come back from all these natural things to the pure truth and the pure life. Six years later, I checked the result of our coming back to life and truth. To my observation, the result was not satisfactory.</p>
<p>In John 15 the Lord told us that He is the true vine and that we are His branches (vv. 1, 5). As branches of the true vine, we should have much life, but how do we know that we have an abundance of life? The evidence of life is fruit. The Lord said that we have to bear fruit; otherwise, we will be cut off from the vine tree and thrown away to be burned (vv. 2, 6). Thus, to not bear fruit, to not have the evidence of an abundance of life, is really risky. When the Lord says that we can be cut off from the vine, this does not mean that we will perish. To be cut off from the vine is to lose the enjoyment of the rich Christ. If we say that we are enjoying life, we must have the fruit-bearing evidence of life.</p>
<p>By 1984, I was bothered about the fruit-bearing evidence in the churches. Generally speaking, the years from 1978 to 1984 were years of barrenness. Within those six or seven years, very few of us bore fruit. Because of our situation, I was compelled to study and restudy to find the best way to bear fruit. Then I discovered the way of preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes. When we knock on people&rsquo;s doors, we visit them in their homes to bring God, Christ, the gospel, grace, and even a meeting with full salvation to their homes. This is the biblical way.</p>
<p>We have experimented and studied the way to carry out this preaching by visiting people and have found that it is more than successful. In less than two years in Taipei, we baptized thirty-eight thousand people, as I have mentioned already. During this time, we learned many things concerning how to preach the gospel effectively. Probably in the next term of training, we will improve our way even more. Even while we were in this transitory period of learning how to spread the gospel effectively, we bore much fruit. I have been serving the Lord for over fifty-five years, and I have never seen so many baptisms within such a short period of time. During one weekend in Taipei in which all the full-time trainees went out to preach the gospel day and night, over three thousand were baptized.</p>
<p>Some negative ones said that the reports concerning these numbers were false or not reliable. But we have records of all the people&rsquo;s names and addresses that were baptized. Then they said that probably many of the baptisms were not real since they were baptized so quickly. But time does not regenerate people. Only the regenerating Spirit regenerates people. Regeneration may be likened to taking a picture with a camera. At the instant the shutter opens, all the scenery enters into the camera and gets on the film. Likewise, at the instant people opened to the Lord to receive Him, He came into their spirit. It is absurd to say that a person cannot be regenerated within fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>I am not saying that all of the thirty-eight thousand we baptized in Taipei are real. Only the Lord knows who is real and who is not. According to the parable of the wheat and the tares in Matthew 13, the tares are sown in the midst of the wheat (vv. 24-30, 36-43). The tares are false believers and the wheat are genuine ones. No one can discern the tares from the wheat until they are fully grown and the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow but that of the tares is black. Before the fruit is produced, no one can tell whether or not someone is a real believer. Only the Lord knows; we do not. But what we should do is to exercise our spirit to preach the genuine and high gospel to stir up people&rsquo;s faith. Then we can ask them to call on the Lord to receive Him as their Savior. As long as they have called on the Lord and have believed into Him, we can say according to the Scriptures that they have to be baptized (Mark 16:16; John 3:5). Then we baptize them. This is all that we can do in fulfilling our commission to go to the nations and baptize them into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). According to our observation, however, we have seen a great number of positive ones among the thirty-eight thousand baptized in Taipei.</p>
<p>We need to pay our attention to life, but we also need to realize that life needs exercise. After eating, I have a habit of walking for about five to ten minutes. This helps me digest my food and helps my physical well-being. I must eat and exercise in order to maintain my health. Again I say, life needs exercise. From 1978 to 1984 we talked about life week after week. We emphasized life, but we had very little activity. Even physically, if we eat much food and do not exercise, we may become sick. In 1984 I studied our situation in the light of the Bible, church history, and our past experience. I found out that we need the proper activity. But I do not mean that when we pay attention to the matter of preaching the gospel by door-knocking that we drop the matter of life.</p>
<p>In the summer training of 1987 in the United States regarding the new way, I fully emphasized the matter of life. Those training messages are in a book entitled <em>The God-ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy.</em> In that training I shared something that I had never shared before, that is, that Christ today is the completed Christ (chapter one). We see that He was completed in the four Gospels and propagated in the book of Acts. I gave another three messages in that training that were unique. They were entitled &ldquo;The Apostles&rsquo; Teaching and Fellowship&rdquo; (chapter seventeen), &ldquo;The New Testament Ministry and Ministers&rdquo; (chapter eighteen), and &ldquo;The Leadership in the New Testament Ministry and Among the New Testament Ministers&rdquo; (chapter nineteen). In the final message, I pointed out that the leadership in the New Testament ministry is really not merely a matter of a person taking the lead but a matter of the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The leadership is produced, strengthened, and also limited, restricted, in the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>What we have fellowshipped concerning the new way should show us that we are taking the new way, which includes door-knocking, according to the New Testament economy based upon the very divine life. When we charged the full-time trainees to visit people by knocking on their doors, we charged them with life. We told them that before they went out, they had to spend twenty minutes to pray, making a thorough confession that they could receive the infilling of the Spirit. Surely this is something of life. Do not think that by picking up the new way we are only taking care of activities. That is absolutely not the case. Even our fellowship in this book from the winter training of 1987 stresses the matter of life. We cannot go on to take the new way without paying full attention to the matter of life. What is the new way? The new way is a reviving way. It is a way that demands that we live a victorious life.</p>
<p>To come to meetings every week to listen to messages on life again and again without the proper activity as an outlet for life actually bored many of us. The brothers who gave the messages in their locality had to study things that were already printed in Brother Nee&rsquo;s books and my books. Then they may have given messages concerning the cross, resurrection, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. These are big subjects among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The saints went to the big meetings again and again, week after week, Lord&rsquo;s Day after Lord&rsquo;s Day, to hear these things repeated again and again. Many times the nourishment the saints received from these meetings was minimal.</p>
<p>We need to ask how much all of us have grown in life in the traditional way of meeting and serving. At least we need to admit, in general, that we were barren for many years, that we hardly bore any fruit. One brother testified that he had been a leading one in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for twenty years without bringing anyone to the Lord. After he was trained in Taipei and returned to the United States, he baptized about ten within two weeks. Time testifies, time tests, and time proves everything. Thus far, the old way has been tested, and it did not work very well. We need the increase not only for the growth of the Body of Christ but also for our own growth in life.</p>
<p>In many places around the globe in the past three years, the saints who went out to visit people by knocking on their doors became excited and happy. Some saints who went to Taipei from the United States told us that they became addicted to door-knocking. They wanted to go door-knocking every evening. You may not have baptized anyone for years, but if you go out to visit people in their homes and baptize three, you will be in the third heavens. These baptisms will make you &ldquo;crazy.&rdquo; A leading brother in San Francisco told me that about one hundred and thirty Chinese-speaking saints from San Francisco went to the San Gabriel gospel festival. After they came back to San Francisco, it was apparent that everyone was revived. They were excited and full of joy. I do not think that any kind of revival could revive people so fast as going out to preach the gospel in the God-ordained way. Again, do not think that we neglect the matter of life when we preach the gospel in this way. We depend upon life to carry out such an activity.</p><h2 class="head1">ABLE TO NOURISH MAN IN HIS SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The scriptural way to meet and to serve is also able to nourish man in his spirit (Eph. 5:29). If we endeavor to have the proper meeting according to the New Testament way, every meeting will be not only nourishing but also cherishing. Cherishing is included in nourishing. Without cherishing, it is hard to have the sweet nourishing. Many mothers who serve dinners to their children always want to make them both nourishing and cherishing. The mother may attempt to make her dinners colorful. She may put some leaves on the dish so the children will see the color green. To make the dinner pleasant to the children in this way is to make it cherishing to them. When they look at the dinner prepared for them, they will feel cherished, warmed up. Then when they eat this pleasant meal, they will be nourished. A proper meal is first cherishing and then nourishing. If the mother were to give her children a dinner that was very nourishing but not cherishing, the children would not be warmed up to receive it. If we meet in the proper way, our meeting will be nourishing and cherishing.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:29 tells us that Jesus Christ, our Head, nourishes and cherishes His Body, the church, but how does He do this? Christ nourishes and cherishes us as members of the Body not mainly by our individual pray-reading and calling upon His name but by the proper meeting. This nourishing and cherishing is not present in the traditional way of meeting in Christianity. When we practiced the old way of meeting, our meeting could hardly cherish people or nourish them. In the proper way according to God&rsquo;s eternal economy, all of the believers are growing in the divine life, meeting in the Spirit, and coming together to speak something from their experience of Christ as the life supply by exercising their spirit. This kind of meeting will be both cherishing and nourishing.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have experienced this at times. Occasionally, we were in a meeting where we had the sense that we were nourished and cherished. When we were meeting at Elden Hall in Los Angeles from 1969 to 1972, every meeting was a cherishing and nourishing meeting according to my feeling. These meetings warmed people up and supplied many spiritual vitamins. But the situation among us today is different. Even though we talked about life again and again, there was not that much life ministered to the attendants in our meetings. Only the way to meet according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is able to cherish and nourish people in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABLE TO RAISE THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST<br />
IN THE GROWTH OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The scriptural way of meeting and serving is able to raise the members of Christ in the growth of life (Eph. 4:15b). I use the word <em>raise</em> in the sense of parents raising their children, which is the unique thing for the parents of a family to do. According to the old way of meeting, there is not much raising of the members of Christ in the way that parents raise their children. This is because there is not much life supply in the old way of meeting. You cannot raise your children without feeding them. As long as you can feed your children adequately, that lays a foundation and gives you the opportunity to do anything with your children. The parents cannot do anything with their children if their children are famished. The traditional way of meeting does not render the adequate life supply to people. So we may have meetings every week yet very little raising rendered to the members of the Body of Christ. All we will have is mostly a kind of religious worship service.</p>
<p>If we turn to the new way of meeting according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, everyone will speak, and their speaking will be with the life supply. What they speak will not just be repeated messages but personal, fresh, and new experiences. If you enjoy the Lord in two verses in the morning, what you speak from your enjoyment of the Lord will be very refreshing and very new. It is not merely a repeating of messages from the printed ministry. Those repeated messages are &ldquo;leftovers.&rdquo; According to our past experience, what we received in the old way of meeting was basically leftovers. If you serve your children leftovers for dinner every evening, you will not be able to raise them adequately. They will get tired of eating leftovers all the time. All of us like something fresh. We all need to endeavor to present a fresh dish in every meeting that is refreshing to the attendants. If fifty are meeting together, everyone should have a way to present a fresh dish. Even if only fifteen of the fifty offer something fresh of Christ, that meeting will be a very refreshing dinner. It is this kind of meeting that cherishes and nourishes people for them to be raised as members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Most of the saints have the habit of meeting in the old way, and it is not easy to change this habit. But the elders should endeavor to minister to the saints adequately in the way that I have done in this training. For half a year or for one year the leading ones should minister in the line of the scriptural way again and again all the time. Gradually through the help of the leading ones&rsquo; ministry, one by one the saints will begin to realize that the old way is not that good. They will eventually realize that the old way binds, annuls, and kills people. Then they will be brought into a new realization of the proper way to meet and to serve. This is the right way for the churches to take.</p>
<p>I do not expect the local churches to be instantly converted to the new way. To be regenerated is instantaneous but to change an old habit is not. For the last three years in Taipei, I was very busy working on the Chinese Recovery Version. My time was nearly ninety percent occupied by this project, but I still found time to labor to bring the saints into the scriptural way. I labored for three years despite some &ldquo;cold winds.&rdquo; One co-worker told me that he believed that every item of the new way is scriptural, but he could not believe it could be worked out. Probably he thought that I should not pick up such a heavy burden at my age. When I began to endeavor to bring the Lord&rsquo;s recovery into the new way starting in Taipei, do you think I was always encouraged from every direction and in every aspect? A number of times words of discouragement came to me. At these times, I was reminded of the story of Columbus when he was sailing from Europe to America, the new land. When the environment and his crew were very discouraging, he declared, &ldquo;Sail on! Sail on!&rdquo; This story helped me a lot. Humanly, it helped me in my being, and it helped me in the Lord&rsquo;s work. This is why I have rarely been discouraged in the past fifty-five years. I have the &ldquo;sailing on&rdquo; life. Sail on, brothers! Sail on, sisters! We will reach our &ldquo;America&rdquo;; we will land at our &ldquo;new land.&rdquo; Let us all sail on together.</p>
<p>Even at my old age, I am not discouraged. In the Lord&rsquo;s work today, I am actually much younger (2 Cor. 4:16). I did not do as much in the Lord&rsquo;s work when I was young in age as I am doing today. Before one particular meeting, two brothers who are doctors checked my blood pressure. My wife, who was concerned for my health, asked them if it was all right for me to go to the meeting and speak. One of the brothers said that speaking was the best dose of medicine for me. Within me I felt that after speaking in the meeting that evening, I would be stronger, and this was exactly my experience. Regardless of the adversity, we all need to sail on together in the new way until we arrive at our destination, at the place where 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 are fully recovered. Then the church will be built up and the Lord will have a way to return.</p><h2 class="head1">ABLE TO DEVELOP THE ORGANIC ABILITY<br />
AND FUNCTION OF THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST<br />
AND ABLE TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The scriptural way to meet and to serve is able to develop the organic function and ability of the members of Christ and is able to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12, 16). Ephesians 4:12 tells us that the gifted persons do their work to perfect the saints that the saints may carry out the work of the ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ. Verse 16 follows to tell us in detail how the perfected saints build up the Body directly. The Body is built up directly &ldquo;through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part.&rdquo; Every joint of the supply refers to the specially gifted persons, and each one part refers to every member of the Body. After we are perfected by the gifted persons, we have to function. One who is a joint, a gifted person, has to render the supply to the Body. Furthermore, as long as you are one part among the many parts of the Body of Christ, you also have a measure of ability, a measure of function. If we all do our duty to function in the Body, there will be an operation in measure of each one part. This operation will cause the growth of the Body for its building up.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:12 and 16 can only be realized and accomplished in the proper meetings. As one part of the Body, how could you have your measure operating to render something to the Body of Christ? It is in the proper meeting that we all can render our portion of Christ. When everyone renders his portion, there will be a rich building up. By this way the saints, one by one, will be built up to grow in life. Regardless of how good a message is given by the speaker in the old way of meeting, there cannot be much growth in life for building up. The old way of meeting does not work in the way to render some particular help in life to each one part of the Body for its building up.</p>
<p>When we meet according to the biblical way, everyone functions. This way of everyone functioning renders the supply in a particular way to each member. By this way each individual believer will grow in life. As long as each part grows in life, this will cause the Body to grow for its building up. Actually, the growth of the Body is the totality of the growth in life of all the members. You have a little bit of growth. I have a little bit of growth. We all have some amount of growth. When we add all this growth together, that is the growth of the Body. Through this growth, the Body is built directly by itself in love. There is no other way to carry out such a building. Ephesians 4:16 can only be fulfilled by the proper meeting according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We all have to endeavor to reach Ephesians 4:16 by the proper meeting, so we all have to endeavor to drop the old way and to practice the new way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE MAJOR CONTENTS OF THE MEETINGS<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURAL WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42; 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:4b; 1 Tim. 1:3-4, 7; Col. 2:2b; Eph. 3:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING ACCORDING TO<br />
THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the major contents of the meetings according to the scriptural way. First, the contents of our meetings according to the God-ordained way must always be according to the teaching of the apostles. In the approximately six thousand years of human history, human society has invented many cultural and philosophical things. Christianity, including both Catholicism and Protestantism, has been on this earth as a religious system for nearly two thousand years and has picked up many pagan things from human society. Some of these things seem very good and seem very close to the teaching of the Bible, but they are not according to the teaching of the apostles. In the cathedrals, chapels, and other meeting places in Christianity, many teachings are taught that are different from the apostles&rsquo; teaching concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Since we practice meeting according to the truth of the Bible, we do not like to have only one speaker. We desire to have all the saints learning to speak. Some Christian groups do not like to have more than one speaker because to have one speaker is the most effective way to control their congregation. To them it is a great risk to allow everyone to speak. If there are one thousand members and everyone speaks, a thousand different ideas and philosophies could come into the church. To have every attendant speaking in all the meetings opens the door wide to any kind of false teaching, false doctrine, or heresy. Apparently this is true, but we have the confidence that our meeting is not a meeting in human society. Our meeting is a meeting of the saints who live in the spirit and only live Christ. We have the confidence that whenever saints like this come together, they would not speak anything other than what was taught by the apostles.</p>
<p>Acts 2:42 tells us that the three thousand saints who were saved on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles. The word <em>teaching</em> in this verse is singular not plural, indicating that the apostles did not have many kinds of teachings. They only had one kind of teaching, and this kind of teaching is the content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The apostles&rsquo; teaching is concerning God&rsquo;s eternal economy, or dispensation, and we need to realize what this economy comprises.</p>
<p>The Triune God has an eternal plan, an eternal economy, to get a people to be His corporate expression, and for Him to do this He has to be the very Christ. This Christ was completed in the four Gospels. The completion of Christ involved the Triune God plus humanity. He became incarnated to bring the Triune God into humanity and to make humanity a vessel that He might be a man and might live on this earth to accomplish His all-inclusive redemption, that is, His all-inclusive death. Then He came out of death in resurrection, and in resurrection this very Christ became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Today this life-giving Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, the planning Father, the accomplishing Son, and the applying Spirit. This wonderful One, this marvelous One, this excellent One, is the embodiment of the Triune God. Before His incarnation, the Trinity had not been consummated. Through the processes of incarnation, human living, death on the cross, resurrection from the dead, and ascension to the heavens, the Triune God has been consummated to be the Spirit. The Spirit is the very embodiment and realization of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>This dear One is the One in whom we believe, whom we worship as our God, and whom we take as our Savior. It is this dear One who imparts life into us, who has regenerated us, and who is still sanctifying, transforming, and conforming us to His very Being. When we received the Triune God, we became the Father&rsquo;s sons and the Son&rsquo;s brothers to be His Body for a corporate expression on this earth of the Triune God. This expression is the church as the Body of the all-inclusive Christ, and this Body is the fullness of this wonderful One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22b-23). These are the contents of God&rsquo;s economy, which is also the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>I hope that especially the young people will spend more time to get into all the details of God&rsquo;s economy. These things have to enter into your being, and you have to enter into these things in order to make these things one with your being. Week after week and year after year we teach people this divine economy based upon the sixty-six books of the Bible and even more upon the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</p>
<p>I hope that all of us would practice to spend time on two or three verses in the New Testament every morning for two or three years. Get these verses into you and get yourself into them. I advise not going to the Old Testament until you finish the New Testament. Labor day after day on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. When you get into these two or three verses, do not forget to get into their accompanying notes in the Recovery Version. This will help you to reach one goal, that is, the New Testament economy of God, which is the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching comprises the twenty-seven books of the New Testament in four main parts. The first part of the New Testament was spoken by the Lord when He was in the flesh on this earth. The second part was spoken by the Apostle Peter as a continuation of the Lord&rsquo;s word in the four Gospels. The third part was spoken by the Apostle Paul in portions of the Acts and in his fourteen Epistles. The fourth and final part of the speaking in the New Testament was given through the Apostle John. Besides these four main parts of the New Testament, there are also James and Jude, but these dear saints did not have as important a role as the three apostles mentioned above in the composing of the New Testament.</p>
<p>In the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, there are many different teachings, but these teachings are subordinate to the teaching of the apostles. Foot washing is in John 13 and head covering is in 1 Corinthians 11, but subordinate things like these are not that crucial. A person can lose a fingernail and still live, but if he loses his heart, he will lose his life. I have said in the past that four short books composed by the Apostle Paul&mdash;Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians&mdash;are the heart of the divine revelation. I noticed that many good Bible students and Bible scholars wore out these four books. A good reader and student of the Bible will be one who wears out these four books. The most worn-out part of the Bibles I have used is the part from Galatians through Colossians. This part of our Bible should be worn out since these four books are the very heart of the divine revelation.</p>
<p>Because every meeting in our new practice of the church life is open to us, do not consider that this affords you a good opportunity to express your philosophy. Today on this earth, everyone has his philosophy. Divorces are the result of the husbands&rsquo; philosophies and the wives&rsquo; philosophies conflicting. If all the wives and husbands would drop their philosophies, there would not be divorce or separation. Separations and divorces come through philosophies. The church has been divided today into thousands of divisions due to different philosophies. A teaching is a philosophy. Try not to bring your philosophy into the church meeting. You have to stick yourself to the teaching of the apostles. Your teaching, your speaking, should be absolutely governed, limited, ruled, and controlled by the teaching of the apostles.</p><h2 class="head2">A Psalm</h2>
<p>Our speaking in the apostles&rsquo; teaching according to the practice at Paul&rsquo;s time can be by a psalm, a teaching, a revelation (1 Cor. 14:26), an exhortation (Heb. 10:25), or an admonition (Col. 3:16). Paul lists a psalm, a teaching, and a revelation in 1 Corinthians 14:26. A psalm is a poetic piece according to the teaching of the apostles. A part of the apostles&rsquo; teaching put into poetry by the saints is a psalm. Psalms are long poems, hymns are shorter ones, and spiritual songs are the shortest. In our hymnal, a few hymns may be considered as psalms (#187 has twenty-six verses and #188 has twenty-two verses). The longest psalm in the Bible is Psalm 119, which is composed in twenty-two sections according to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Each letter covers eight verses for a total of one hundred and seventy-six verses. Our singing a psalm is called psalming. We need to learn to psalm a psalm.</p>
<p>Many saints have composed poetical pieces, but we must remember that in composing a psalm, hymn, or spiritual song we are not trying to say something strange or funny. We must compose poetry full of dignity and full of weight that takes care of the rhythm and rhyme. Poetry without the proper rhyme is unacceptable. I composed over two hundred hymns in our hymnal, but since 1964 I have written hardly any hymns. I hope that some of the saints would be raised up and burdened by the Lord to continue to write hymns. Since 1964 we have received much new light from the Word, and there are many new points that need some hymns to express them.</p>
<p>In our meetings, we must have some psalms, not only for psalming but also for speaking. I hope that in every meeting at least one-fourth of the speaking would be speaking on psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. A hymn, like the cream of milk, is the cream of a certain composition. The best way for us to learn how to speak is to learn how to speak with the hymns. We should learn to use a hymn like &ldquo;O Glorious Christ, Savior Mine&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #501). That hymn will help us in speaking, but we have to learn to speak in a living way, in a very refreshing way, and in a very inspiring way. We should not just read the hymns, but speak in a Way to stir up the saints and inspire every attendant of the meeting. We need to practice speaking the hymns in this way again and again. Then we will be equipped to render much help to the meeting. We can have a very good Lord&rsquo;s table meeting just by speaking one hymn. After speaking this hymn, we can sing it, and after singing it, we can speak it again. We would not need to call another hymn. By singing, speaking, singing, and speaking one hymn, the riches of Christ will be released into the meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Glorious Christ, Savior Mine&rdquo; has seven verses with many rich and high points. How could we express something of these points by our instant speaking? It is impossible. That hymn was written with much consideration in the spirit, and it was improved and recomposed again and again. I wrote this hymn in 1961 in Taipei, and many can testify that it is really hard to make any improvement to the Chinese version. The expressions have been refined to the uttermost. If we could get ourselves into these expressions and learn to speak them, that would be marvelous. How good it would be if we could speak with the language of such a hymn in the meeting rather than speaking our own word.</p>
<p>I have rarely seen a meeting with good speaking on certain hymns because we have not spent the time to teach and train the saints in this practice. All the saints in the churches have to learn to speak with the hymns and on the hymns. I am planning to study this matter when I return to Taipei. We hope to find out all the secrets concerning the speaking of hymns. Then we will present what we have found to all the saints. The New Testament through the Apostle Paul tells us twice that we need to speak the hymns to each other (Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16).</p><h2 class="head2">A Teaching</h2>
<p>We may also speak in the meetings according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching by presenting a teaching. Teaching covers a broad field, but we should not go beyond the limit of the teaching of the apostles. We always should be limited and controlled by the teaching of the apostles. We should not try to invent new kinds of teachings. We must always stick ourselves to the New Testament in our teaching concerning any matter. Even concerning a matter like our dress, we have to give a teaching based upon what is taught in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Many of us may be deeply stirred up and very burdened to carry out the God-ordained way. But we should not claim too much freedom in what we speak. We have no liberty to speak anything in the meeting that crosses over the limiting line of the apostles&rsquo; teaching. We must be within this line and should always keep this in mind. Otherwise, we will be the creators of all kinds of confusions and divisions. This is why I am setting the limits in this chapter. We are open to any speaking within the limit of the teaching of the apostles, but we want to bury anything that does not correspond with this unique teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Revelation</h2>
<p>We may also present a revelation in the proper Christian meeting. Any revelation today must be within the limit of the apostles&rsquo; teaching because the divine revelation from Genesis to Revelation has been fully completed. This means that God&rsquo;s divine oracle has been fully completed. There are not any other new points or new thoughts outside of this divine oracle. If a so-called Christian revelation is beyond the teaching of the apostles, that revelation is not from God but is heresy. Whatever revelation we receive should be compared with the apostles&rsquo; teaching and should be limited by it. Mrs. White, the chief leader of the Seventh Day Adventists, fell into error by claiming that she received new revelations from God. Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormons, also claimed that he received new revelations, but the so-called revelations received by him were great heresies. Our revelation must be limited and controlled by the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>The first amendment to the Bill of Rights concerning freedom of speech stands out in the United States. Those of us who live in the United States may feel that we have the right to say anything. When we open our meeting in the new way to all the saints, this opens the door to all kinds of things. The New Jerusalem has a great and high wall (Rev. 21:12), but it may seem that there is no wall in our meeting. I am concerned that some &ldquo;free speechers&rdquo; will come in to speak whatever they think is a revelation. They may say that they have received a revelation based upon what Paul teaches in 1 Corinthians 14:26. This is why Paul says in the same chapter that when two or three prophets speak, the others should discern (v. 29). When a prophet speaks, we have to be sober and learn how to discern. If a brother opens the Bible, reads a verse, and speaks based upon this verse, there is no danger of any heresy. But if a person stands up and claims he has received a new revelation, we have to be careful to discern his revelation according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. In this way we can guard our meeting from being invaded by different revelations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">An Exhortation and an Admonition</h2>
<p>In the apostles&rsquo; teaching, exhortation is also included (Heb. 10:25). Thank the Lord that in the apostles&rsquo; writings, that is, in the New Testament, there are many adequate exhortations. We do not need to invent new exhortations. All the exhortations we need are already in the New Testament. We may also speak an admonition in the meeting according to the teaching of the apostles (Col. 3:16). We do not need to invent new admonitions, but we should always adhere to the New Testament teaching.</p><h2 class="head2">Ministering Christ<br />
for the Edification of the Believers<br />
and for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>We must minister Christ. The apostles&rsquo; teaching does mainly one thing&mdash;it ministers Christ to us. If we need any exhortation, that exhortation must be related to Christ. Actually, Christ, the Person Himself, should be our exhortation. Even our admonishing should be Christ, the living Person. Whatever we say, whether it be a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, an exhortation, or an admonition, in essence and in totality must be the ministry that ministers Christ to us. Christ must be the center, the centrality and universality, the element, the essence, the substance, and altogether every part of what we speak.</p>
<p>We exhort others because we want to minister Christ to them. We may realize that there are certain aspects in the saints&rsquo; family life or daily living that are void of Christ and short of Christ. Thus, we may exhort the saints, not just with some ethical or moral teaching but with Christ Himself. We may point out to the saints that they are short of Christ in a particular area and fellowship with them so that they can mend their situation with Christ.</p>
<p>This is the proper exhortation and admonition, and this kind of ministering of Christ is for the edification of the believers. The word <em>edification</em> in the Bible includes ethical and moral instruction and building up. Mainly, to edify is to build. Many of the Chinese understand the word <em>edification</em> strictly in an ethical and moral sense. But the goal of whatever we minister of Christ to the saints is not only to give them some ethical and moral instruction but also to build them up.</p>
<p>Our speaking according to the teaching of the apostles is ultimately for the building up of the church. Whatever we speak in the meetings&mdash;a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, an exhortation, or an admonition&mdash;should be for the goal of building up the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT TEACHING THINGS DIFFERENT<br />
FROM THE APOSTLES&rsquo; TEACHING</h2>
<p>Paul tells us in 1 Timothy 1:3-4 that we are not to teach things different from the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The different things listed by Paul are in three categories: myths, unending genealogies, and the law (1 Tim. 1:7). The law is the basic and fundamental teaching and thought of the Old Testament. In nature and in function, the law is good (Rom. 7:12). To teach the Old Testament in the way of teaching the law, essentially speaking, is not wrong. But dispensationally speaking, it is altogether wrong. The law belongs to the old dispensation. It has nothing to do with the New Testament dispensation. Thus, the Apostle Paul did not allow for the teaching of the law even though it was according to the Old Testament. The law is scriptural essentially but not dispensationally.</p>
<p>Genealogies are extensions of the Old Testament. Some Jewish scholars, in their overstudy of the Old Testament, liked to dig out things contained in the genealogies. This kind of genealogical study can create many debates. A teaching concerning genealogies is not as basic or fundamental as the teaching of the law and it is an extended understanding of the Old Testament. Myths are even further extensions of the Old Testament and refer to words, speeches, and conversations concerning such things as rumors, reports, true or false stories, and fictions. They might include Jewish stories of miracles, rabbinical fabrications, etc.</p>
<p>We may not teach the law or the genealogies of the Old Testament, nor would we fabricate stories as myths. But we still can teach things that are different from the apostles&rsquo; teaching today. The keeping of the Sabbath as taught by the Seventh Day Adventists is a different teaching. They say that the believers in the New Testament age should still keep the law, and one of the commandments of the law is to keep the Sabbath. They claim that if we do not keep the Sabbath, which is on Saturday, we break the law. Surely the Sabbath is mentioned in the Bible but this is not the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The apostles&rsquo; teaching tells us that the feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are shadows, but the reality, the body, of these shadows is Christ (Col. 2:16-17). Christ today is our Sabbath (Matt. 11:28-30).</p>
<p>In the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus took the lead to purposely break the Sabbath. On two consecutive Sabbath days He purposely broke the Sabbatical regulation, offending the Pharisees to the uttermost (Luke 6:1-11). He declared to the Pharisees that He was the Lord of the Sabbath (v. 5). He was the One who set up the regulation of the Sabbath, and He was also the One to cancel it. As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the authority and the right, the full position, to establish the Sabbath day. He also had the full right in the Gospels to discard the Sabbath. When He said to keep the Sabbath, the Sabbath should be kept. Now that He has discarded the Sabbatical regulation, why should we keep it?</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus took the lead to break the Sabbath because the Sabbath was a shadow. The reality of a person&rsquo;s shadow is the person himself. Christ is the reality of the shadow of the Sabbath. Before He came, there was the need of the Sabbath day to typify Him, to foreshadow Him. Now that He is here, the shadow is not necessary. I may send you a picture of me before I come to visit you. When I arrive, would you still pay all your attention to the picture and forget about me? That would be wrong. Now that Christ Himself is here, we can discard the picture, the Sabbath day. He is the Sabbath day. Now we have a new day called the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the day of the Lord, in the New Testament (Rev. 1:10; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:2).</p>
<p>This shows us that a teaching may be seemingly according to the Scriptures, and yet be altogether not a part of the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Certainly what we teach that is natural according to our culture or tradition is not according to the teaching of the apostles. We should not teach Chinese, British, French, German, American, Japanese, or Korean things in our church meetings. But even if we teach something in the Old Testament dispensation, this teaching is not according to the teaching of the apostles. We cannot teach things that belong to the old dispensation set up by God because we are now in the new dispensation. What we teach in our Christian meetings according to the God-ordained way should be absolutely within the limit of the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOCUSING ON THE ECONOMY OF GOD</h2>
<p>What we speak in the church meetings should focus on the economy of God (1 Tim. 1:4b). This economy is altogether concerning two items: Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2b) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). The focus and the crucial center of whatever we speak must be Christ and the church. We have to fully learn the truth concerning Christ and the church so that our meetings will never get outside the teaching of the apostles. Our speaking in the meetings should always be focused on Christ as the definition, the explanation, and the fullness of the very God and the church as the definition, the explanation, and the fullness of the very Christ. God is embodied in Christ and Christ is fully expressed in the church&mdash;this should be our central vision in all of our teaching and has to be the focus, the very crucial center, of all our speaking.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF A CLEAR VISION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 2:9; John 1:1, 14; Col. 2:2b; Eph. 3:8; 1:23; 3:2-4; 5:32; Col. 1:25-29</h1>
<p>In order to practice the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need a clear vision of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. For this reason, this chapter is a very, very crucial chapter in this book. The word <em>economy</em> is an anglicized word from the Greek word <em>oikonomia.</em> Some English translations of the Bible translate <em>oikonomia</em> into &ldquo;dispensation&rdquo; (see 1 Tim. 1:4 of Darby&rsquo;s New Translation, the American Standard Version, and the Recovery Version). Many readers of the Bible do not know what this word means. Dr. C. I. Scofield said that there were seven dispensations in the Bible concerning God&rsquo;s dealing with man from the time Adam was created to the end of the millennium. According to this usage, the seven dispensations are understood as seven ages. These seven ages are the ages of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and the kingdom. According to Dr. Scofield these dispensations are the seven different ways that God deals with man. Although this understanding is right, the Lord has shown us something further concerning the word <em>economy.</em></p>
<p>This Greek word <em>oikonomia</em> is composed of two words: <em>oikos</em> meaning house or household and <em>nomos</em> meaning law. Thus, <em>economy</em> refers in the scriptural sense to a household law, or household administration. This administration is a plan, an arrangement, or a dispensation. According to today&rsquo;s common usage, the word <em>economy</em> is used for financial matters or the financial situation. But according to the biblical usage in the Greek language, God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s eternal plan, God&rsquo;s eternal arrangement for His administration according to His heart&rsquo;s desire. In the Old Testament there was God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy, God&rsquo;s old arrangement. Now in the New Testament there is a new arrangement, that is, the New Testament economy of God. In order for us to understand the divine revelation, we must understand God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Since the Lord&rsquo;s recovery began among us in China in 1922 through Brother Watchman Nee, the Lord has used us to recover a number of truths from the Word. But the expression <em>the New Testament economy</em> was not used among us in mainland China nor was it used in our work on the island of Taiwan. I did not pick up the term <em>God&rsquo;s economy</em> until we had a summer conference in Los Angeles in 1964. The fellowship from this conference is contained in a book entitled <em>The Economy of God.</em> That was the first time we used the word <em>economy</em> in our publications. Then in 1984, I made a thorough study of this matter. First I went to Brazil and gave a series of messages contained in a book entitled <em>The Divine Economy.</em> Then I went to Stuttgart, Germany and several localities in the United States to release a series of messages contained in the book <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy.</em> Now that the messages in this book have been released, I believe that the all-inclusive truth concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy has been fully recovered. On pages 12 and 13 of this large volume is a chart of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This chart shows that in the Gospels is the Son with the Father and by the Spirit; in Acts and the Epistles is the Spirit as the Son and with the Father; and in Revelation is the seven Spirits out from the Eternal One and of the Redeemer. In other words, the content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is a wonderful Person, and this Person is the Triune God. I recommend that we study this chart and read this book. This book is an extension of this chapter and thoroughly covers the truth concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>In my speaking, I cannot stay away from the Triune God because the Triune God is the basic element in the construction of the Bible, especially of the New Testament. Nearly every book is constructed with the Triune God as the basic element, the basic factor. If we take the Triune God out of the Holy Bible, the Holy Bible will become empty. The real essence of the content of the Bible is the Triune God. The first chapter of the Bible reveals the Triune God (vv. 1, 26). Books such as the Gospel of John, Ephesians, and Revelation are absolutely constructed, composed, and constituted with the divine Trinity as their elements and factors. No one can fully understand the Gospel of John without understanding the Triune God. In John 14:16 the Lord says, &ldquo;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&rdquo; In this short sentence, the Triune God is revealed. The Son asks the Father to give the disciples another Comforter, who is the Spirit of reality (v. 17). Each of the six chapters in the book of Ephesians reveals the Triune God (1:4-14; 2:18; 3:14-19; 4:4-6; 5:19-20; 6:10, 11, 17). Note 14<sup>1</sup> of 2 Corinthians 13:14 in the Recovery Version presents a birds-eye view of the divine Trinity throughout the Holy Scriptures.</p><h2 class="head1">TO HAVE THE TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is first to have the Triune God embodied in Christ (Col. 2:9). God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, the divine Three, are embodied in Christ. Christ is not only divine but also human. Because He is human, He has a human body. His being the embodiment of the Triune God indicates that He had a solid, physical, touchable body. Before God became incarnate, He was invisible, untouchable, and even unapproachable. But this God was embodied in Christ. He was made solid, physical, touchable, and visible. John 1:18 tells us that no one has ever seen God, but the only begotten Son has declared Him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Colossians 2:9 says that Christ is the embodiment, not only of the Godhead but also of the fullness of the entire Godhead. <em>Fullness</em> in the usage of the New Testament means the expression of the riches. Christ was not only the embodiment of the riches of the Godhead but also the fullness of the Godhead, implying all the riches of the Godhead expressed in Christ. The Godhead was made visible, touchable, and physical by God putting Himself into a human body. Whatever the Triune God is was put into a human body. The Triune God put Himself into a human Person who had a physical body, and this Person was Jesus Christ. This Man, Jesus Christ, had a body exactly the same as our body. Since Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way, and in His glorified body (Phil. 3:21) now and forever it dwells. Thus, the Triune God embodied Himself in Christ, and this embodiment was the first step for the completion of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">For the Incarnation of Christ</h2>
<p>In eternity past, Christ was anointed and appointed by God to be the Christ, the commissioned One, the anointed One, the appointed One (Heb. 1:9; Dan. 9:26; 1 Pet. 1:20). Although He was appointed, He still needed to be completed. Although Christ was eternally perfect, He was not complete because he was still short of the human nature. By what way was Christ completed? Firstly, by incarnation. The first item in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy was to have the Triune God embodied in Christ for the incarnation of Christ (John 1:1, 14). For Christ to be God&rsquo;s commissioned One to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, He needed to become a man. The divine Person alone, God Himself alone, could not accomplish or carry out His eternal plan.</p>
<p>In His eternal plan, His eternal economy, one item was needed: human blood was needed to redeem fallen humanity. To redeem the fallen human race, there was the need of human blood. Neither the angels nor God in his divinity alone has blood. Blood is in the human life. In the Old Testament, before the incarnation of Christ, the blood of the animal sacrifices was used and that blood was a type of the blood of Christ. The blood of these sacrifices could not wash away man&rsquo;s sins, but this Man, Jesus Christ, died on the cross and shed His blood for us. His blood is surely human blood. Yet in Acts 20:28 this blood is called the blood of God. How could God have blood? God could have blood because He became a man.</p>
<p>This Man&rsquo;s blood is reckoned as God&rsquo;s blood, and it is also referred to in 1 John 1:7 as the blood of God&rsquo;s Son. Although the Son of God is divine, He has blood. The blood of Jesus, the Son of God, cleanses us from all sin, but the divine Son of God without humanity could not possess blood. Thus, the One who accomplished God&rsquo;s commission needed to have the human nature so He could shed His blood for fallen man. Before His incarnation, Christ did not have humanity, so Christ had been anointed but not completed. The incarnation of Christ is the first step in the completion of Christ. His incarnation brought the Triune God into a human body to produce a God-man.</p><h2 class="head2">For the Completion of the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>The Triune God was also embodied in Christ for the completion of the mystery of God (Col. 2:2b). Christ is the mystery of God, and the mystery of God as God&rsquo;s very expression has been completed by Christ&rsquo;s being incarnated. Before the New Testament times, it would not have been possible to talk to Abraham or David about the mystery of God. One day God was incarnated to be a man. Paul invented this term <em>the mystery of God</em> to describe this God-man. Jesus Christ on this earth was the mystery of God. The mystery of God was completed in Christ&rsquo;s incarnation. God is altogether a mystery. At Abraham, David, and Malachi&rsquo;s time God was a mystery, and this mystery was not known by the sons of men until one day God was incarnated to be a man. This Man is the mystery of God. Paul described the event of the incarnation with the expression <em>the mystery of God.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">TO DISPENSE THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br />
INTO GOD&rsquo;S CHOSEN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is also to dispense the riches of Christ into God&rsquo;s chosen people (Eph. 3:8). The riches of God became the riches of Christ. Before the incarnation, the riches of God were not the riches of Christ. Regardless of how rich God was before His incarnation, He did not possess humanity among His riches. After the incarnation, another item was added to His riches&mdash;humanity. The riches of God became the riches of Christ because Christ has humanity. Today the very God, who has both divinity and humanity, is Christ.</p>
<p>God is different from what He was before His incarnation. Hebrews 13:8 tells us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever. Some opposers have used this verse wrongly to say that Jesus Christ does not change. But we have to remember that Paul wrote this verse after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, that is, after He had passed through the necessary processes to be completed. When Christ was being completed, He took two major steps, which were two major changes. John 1:14 tells us that the Word <em>became</em> flesh, and 1 Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam <em>became</em> a life-giving Spirit. The word <em>became</em> indicates a change and is applied to Christ twice. As the very God, He became flesh, and after thirty-three and a half years in the flesh, He became a life-giving Spirit. These are two wonderful changes. God changed to be the flesh, and the flesh changed to be the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>If God had not changed to be the flesh, we could not have been redeemed. God became flesh and died on the cross, shedding His human blood to redeem us, to take away our sin. After this, He entered into the tomb and Hades, entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for the purpose of imparting life into us. The flesh was for redemption and the Spirit is for the impartation of life. As the life-giving Spirit, Christ can impart His unsearchable riches into God&rsquo;s chosen people. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to have Himself embodied in Christ to dispense the riches of Christ into God&rsquo;s chosen people for the producing of the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23) and for the completion of the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4), which is the church as Christ&rsquo;s fullness and expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STEWARDSHIP OF GRACE</h2>
<p>The Greek word for economy, <em>oikonomia,</em> is translated as &ldquo;stewardship&rdquo; in Ephesians 3:2. The stewardship of the grace of God was given to Paul for the saints. A stewardship is an economy because a stewardship is an arrangement to carry out an administration. Paul was appointed to be a steward under God&rsquo;s arrangement to accomplish God&rsquo;s New Testament administration. A stewardship is a service. It is not a common service but a particular service. The stewardship is God&rsquo;s divine arrangement to carry out His New Testament administration. We may also say that the stewardship of grace is the economy of grace to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is His plan, and the stewardship is a service arranged by God to carry out His administration, that is, to carry out His eternal economy. God gave the Apostle Paul an economy, or a stewardship, which is an arrangement to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, His New Testament administration.</p>
<p>The stewardship of grace is to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy by God&rsquo;s grace, which is the processed Triune God to be our life and energy. Paul was one who carried out God&rsquo;s economy, not by his energy or talent but by the grace of God. We have to realize that today our meeting, which is according to God&rsquo;s ordained way, is a service, and this service is the very stewardship God assigned to us. Not only did the Apostle Paul receive such an assignment, but also all of us as members of the church have received the same assignment. We are not different from the Apostle Paul in this matter. He has received a stewardship and we have too.</p>
<p>We need to be brought into a high realization of our Christian meeting. Our meeting today is a stewardship, a service, to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. We carry out our stewardship by meeting. We are continuing to do the work of the Apostle Paul to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Whenever we meet, we serve. Whenever we meet, we are taking care of our stewardship to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This means that our meeting dispenses all the riches of Christ into the attendants, who are God&rsquo;s chosen people. In this book, we are talking about the scriptural way to meet and to serve. I use the words &ldquo;to serve&rdquo; because our meeting is a service which is really the divine stewardship assigned to us to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Whenever we as the attendants in a meeting dispense the processed Triune God into others, actually our meeting dispenses.</p>
<p>Our meeting must come up to this standard. Because I have seen a vision of all these things, I cannot go along with fallen Christianity. I must point out the degradation of today&rsquo;s Christianity so that we can be brought out of it. We must admit that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there are still things that belong to this degradation. At present nearly all the churches are below the standard. Thus, we must endeavor to build up a meeting that dispenses the riches of Christ to all the attendants. Then our meeting will be uplifted to the standard of the genuine stewardship to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. The Lord has not recovered this meeting life to such a standard in the nearly two thousand years of church history. We do not want to continue to disappoint Him. We must endeavor to build up the meeting life until every meeting is the stewardship of God&rsquo;s economy to dispense all the riches of Christ into His chosen people. One day He will fully recover this matter, and this will be a real glory to the Triune God. Each of us has received the stewardship of grace, and in our localities, we must accomplish our stewardship. The economy of God has become our stewardship, and our stewardship is to carry out God&rsquo;s economy in a corporate way by meeting. We must count on the meetings for the carrying out of our stewardship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Paul said in Ephesians 3:3 that the mystery of God&rsquo;s hidden purpose was made known to him by revelation. The mystery of God is Christ (Col. 2:2b), the mystery of Christ is the church (Eph. 3:4), and the great mystery is Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul completed the word of God in the mystery of God, which is Christ, and in the mystery of Christ, which is the church, to give us a full revelation of God&rsquo;s economy (Col. 1:25-29). This completing word is to announce Christ, to warn every man by Christ in all wisdom, and to teach every man with Christ in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ (v. 28). We grow into Christ, and Christ is constituted into our very being to make us real Christ-men. We carry out our stewardship by laboring and struggling according to Christ&rsquo;s operation, which operates in us in power (v. 29).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE MINISTRY OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:7-9; Eph. 3:8; Rom. 12:5; Eph. 1:23; 3:3</h1>
<p>This chapter may be considered as the conclusion of all the foregoing chapters. The ministry of the New Testament is the ministry of the riches of Christ; this ministry ministers the riches of Christ. Strictly speaking, throughout all the dispensations in the Bible, God has had only two ministries, the Old Testament ministry and the New Testament ministry. The Old Testament ministry is the ministry of law, and the New Testament ministry is the ministry of grace; the ministry of the New Testament is versus the ministry of the Old Testament. The word <em>ministry</em> in Greek may also denote a service. The portion of the service to God which one renders is called his ministry. Everyone can render service to God; these services are our respective ministries. In the Bible, especially in the New Testament, there is the ministry in the singular number, denoting the unique ministry of God, and there are ministries in the plural, denoting the various services of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT<br />
VERSUS THE MINISTRY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The ministry of the New Testament is the ministry of the Spirit, which is versus the ministry of death in the Old Testament (2 Cor. 3:8, 7). In 2 Corinthians 3, the Spirit is in contrast to death because the Spirit is the Spirit of life, and life is versus death. The Old Testament ministry was a ministry of death, but the New Testament ministry is a ministry of life, which is altogether realized in the Spirit.</p>
<p>The ministry of the New Testament is also the ministry of righteousness, which is versus the ministry of condemnation (2 Cor. 3:9). Because justification is in contrast to condemnation, righteousness here denotes justification. In the Old Testament there was one ministry which brought in condemnation. This condemnation issued in death. The New Testament brought in justification which is unto life. Romans 5:18 says that we have justification of life, that is, we are justified to receive the Spirit which is the very divine life. In the Bible are these two ministries: the ministry of condemnation unto death and the ministry of justification unto life, which is embodied in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The ministry of the New Testament is the ministry of the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). The ministry of the New Testament does not minister the law, but the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are the riches of God, but because the riches of God today are in Christ, they are called the riches of Christ. The New Testament ministry is for ministering the riches of Christ to God&rsquo;s chosen people for the producing of the members of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5). The riches of Christ are ministered to us that we may be regenerated by the Spirit with the divine life. Through regeneration we become the living members of Christ for the constitution of the Body of Christ. This is not a matter of religion but a matter of life.</p>
<p>The riches of Christ are ministered that the Body of Christ might be formed (Eph. 1:23). All the riches ministered to us are for the Body of Christ, and the riches of Christ are the source and the elements of the Body of Christ. The church as the Body of Christ functions in a way to produce new and more members of the Body for the increase of the Body.</p>
<p>The increase of the Body of Christ is very much related to the church meetings. The church meeting is to dispense the Triune God, and the very processed Triune God in reality is all the riches of Christ. When we minister the riches of Christ to God&rsquo;s chosen people in the meeting, we minister, or dispense, the very Triune God to them. Then the recipients of this dispensing become the members of the Body of Christ. Eventually, the Body is formed. The Christian meeting should issue in the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ should come out of our meeting. We do not come together merely to serve God or receive grace or salvation; our meeting should issue in one thing&mdash;the Body of Christ. We come together to meet to dispense the Triune God into His chosen people, that is, to minister the riches of Christ to the believers that the Body may be formed. Every time we meet, the issue should be the increase of the Body of Christ. The church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, comes out of the dispensing of the riches of Christ. The more we dispense the Triune God into people, the bigger the Body of Christ will be. This is a high concept.</p>
<p>The ministry of the riches of Christ is according to the revelation of the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:3). The mystery of Christ is simply the church as the Body of Christ, which is constituted with all the divine elements which have been ministered into people by the church. These divine elements are the riches of Christ, and all the riches of Christ are the processed Triune God. We minister and dispense the Triune God to people by meeting together to speak. We all come to the meeting to speak. When you speak, you minister, and when you minister, you dispense the processed Triune God, who is all the riches of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Many years ago I studied the book of Ephesians very much. However, I did not pay attention to the phrase, &ldquo;the riches of Christ.&rdquo; One day when I came again to Ephesians, these key words stood out. I paid my full attention to them and asked myself what the riches of Christ might be. I began to see the riches of Christ around 1954, and for over thirty-three years I have studied this one category of divine matters. After much study, I began to find out what the riches of Christ are.</p>
<p>The first major item of the riches of Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the complete Godhead (Col. 2:9), not only the fullness of the Godhead of the Father, the Godhead of the Son, or the Godhead of the Spirit alone, but the fullness of the Godhead of the complete Triune God. Several conferences would not be adequate to cover this point alone.</p>
<p>Another item of the riches of Christ is the incarnation (John 1:14). Do you really understand what the incarnation is? Incarnation is God becoming one with man. This is the mingling of divinity with humanity and was the initiation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Incarnation is much greater and more meaningful than God&rsquo;s creation. In Christianity, the incarnation is mostly considered in terms of the Lord as the Savior. Christians like to tell people at Christmas time that &ldquo;a Savior was born to you today in David&rsquo;s city&rdquo; (Luke 2:11). This is not wrong. However, some have reduced the denotation of incarnation to a Christmas celebration. This is the celebration of a &ldquo;mass,&rdquo; not of Christ. Few take care of the proper meaning of Christ&rsquo;s birth. Christ&rsquo;s birth was an incarnation that brought God into man to make God and man one. It was not only to produce a Savior but also to produce a God-man. It was God and man becoming one in one life and living, while possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively.</p>
<p>Christ being a man in perfect humanity (Phil. 2:7-8a) is also an item of the riches of Christ. When you receive Christ as your life, you receive this item of the riches of Christ; you receive a man in perfect humanity. This Man had a thorough human living (Isa. 53:2-3). He lived the human life thoroughly on the earth, and this human living is also an item of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>Another item of the riches of Christ is His all-inclusive death (John 19:34). First, His death was a redeeming death (1 Tim. 2:6); we were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ. Second, His death was the death that deals with all negative things. It deals with sin (Rom. 8:3), the old man (Rom. 6:6), the old creation, Satan&mdash;the Devil (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31b), the satanic world (John 12:31a), and the separating ordinances among different peoples (Eph. 2:15). All these negative things have been dealt with by Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death once for all. Third, this death is also the life-imparting death (John 12:24). All these aspects of Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death are one item of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s riches include resurrection (Eph. 1:20a; 2:6a; Phil. 3:10a), ascension (Eph. 1:20b; 2:6a), and His enthronement (Acts 2:36; 5:31a). After Christ ascended to the heavens, God enthroned Him with authority (Heb. 12:2) and crowned Him with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9). Christ&rsquo;s second coming is another item of His riches (Phil. 3:20-21; 1 Thes. 4:16-17). The second coming includes many things. It will bring us glory; Philippians 3:21 says that our body of humiliation will be transfigured into a glorious body at Christ&rsquo;s coming. Christ&rsquo;s second coming will bring us into God Himself for us to enjoy God as our glory. The kingdom, in which we will enjoy Christ&rsquo;s kingship and Christ&rsquo;s priesthood for a thousand years is also an item of the riches of Christ (2 Pet. 1:11; Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<p>The divine attributes and human virtues of Christ are a great aggregate of Christ&rsquo;s riches, including a multitude of items. The divine attributes refer to the characteristics of Christ in His divinity, while human virtues refer to the characteristics of Christ in His humanity. The divine attributes are first God&rsquo;s love, then light, then hundreds of items including righteousness, holiness, power, authority, knowledge, and wisdom. Today we are enjoying our God&rsquo;s attributes. He is so good, kind, and merciful; goodness, kindness, and mercy are divine attributes. He is whatever we need. We need life, and He is life. We need wisdom, and He is wisdom. We need righteousness, holiness, power, and authority, and He is all of these items. He is everything that we need. We enjoy Him all day as many attributes, and the divine attributes produce in us the human virtues. We enjoy His love as a divine attribute, and this attribute produces within us our love toward others. This love toward others becomes our virtue. We do not have humility, but God does. One day God humbled Himself, lowering Himself to come from the heavens to be a lowly man on the earth. This is His humility as a divine attribute. When we enjoy this humility, a humility toward others is produced in us. Our Christian humility is a Christian virtue produced from the divine humility as a divine attribute. We cannot exhaust speaking of all the riches of Christ. Paul said that he received grace to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel (Eph. 3:8). Paul preached the riches of Christ as the gospel to produce the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOR THE EXHIBITION OF THE PRODUCE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Eventually, through our experiences of the riches of Christ, these riches will become an exhibition, a show, of the produce of Christ. Our meetings must always be an exhibition to show forth what Christ is, what Christ has, and what Christ does. If we do not experience the riches of Christ, there will be no way for them to be exhibited. If we experience many items of the riches of Christ during the day, we will come to the meeting in the evening with the divine attributes which we have experienced. When we all bring something which we have experienced and put our experience of Christ&rsquo;s riches together, there will be an exhibition of Christ. In this way every meeting will be a show of Christ. Hymn #864 in our hymnal is concerning the exhibition of Christ. Such a hymn is very good for speaking to one another (Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16). After speaking such a hymn, you will receive a message. There are many points in this hymn concerning the riches of Christ. Verse one and the chorus say,</p>
<p class="hbody">Whene&rsquo;er we meet with Christ endued,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surplus of His plenitude<br />
We offer unto God as food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus exhibit Christ.<br />
Let us exhibit Christ,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us exhibit Christ;<br />
We&rsquo;ll bring His surplus to the church<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus exhibit Christ.</p>
<p>To speak such a hymn to one another will enrich the meeting very much because we have experienced the riches of Christ and have offered this Christ both to God and man through our speaking.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST<br />
FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:15-16; 6:48; Eph. 3:8; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Phil. 1:19; John 6:57; Eph. 6:17-18; John 6:63; Rev. 2:7, 4-5, 17, 15; 3:20, 15, 18</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters of this book we have seen much concerning the riches of Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. The purpose for seeing these things is that we may enjoy Christ. Our enjoyment of Christ is for the church meetings. Many Christians attend church services, but few know the relationship between the enjoyment of Christ and the Christian meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>In the United States twenty-five years ago, I discovered that the words e<em>njoy, dispense,</em> and <em>practice</em> were not used in regard to the Christian experience. I have used such words in order to minister what I have seen of the Lord concerning the experience of Christ. One day in Los Angeles in 1964, several of the leading ones came together to draft a statement which described the purpose of our meetings. The brothers also asked me to compose a part of this statement. This statement required the use of the word <em>practice;</em> therefore, I included this word in the phrase, &ldquo;the practice of the church life.&rdquo; Today this phrase is very common among us, but in those days, it was not a very familiar term. One of the leading brothers was a high school teacher in English. When he read my composition, he questioned the use of the phrase &ldquo;the <em>practice</em> of the church life.&rdquo; He felt that this phrase was not good English, so I asked him to improve it. After trying for a period of time to find a better way to say it, he said that he could not think of anything better and that we should use the phrase I composed. From that day until now, the word <em>practice</em> has been accepted for use in our church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST</h2>
<p>We also use the word <em>enjoy</em> to describe our experience of Christ. Christ is enjoyable. He is even eatable and drinkable. Our eating and drinking is our enjoyment. Since 1958 I began to use the word <em>eat</em> concerning the enjoyment of Christ. Today I use it very emphatically. In 1958 before I visited England, I held a conference with the church in Taipei. During that conference, the term <em>eating Christ</em> came to me. The burden concerning this matter was quite heavy. One night after a strong message on eating Christ, a learned brother, who was a professor from a prominent university in Taiwan, came to see me. He said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, the message was very wonderful. But the word <em>eat</em> seems to be too wild. Could we really eat the Lord Jesus?&rdquo; He asked this question because to eat someone up in Chinese slang has a very poor meaning. I said, &ldquo;Brother, this word <em>eat</em> is not my invention. The Lord Jesus Himself spoke this word in John 6:57&mdash;&lsquo;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&rsquo;&rdquo; When I pointed out this verse to him, he said, &ldquo;I have nothing to say because the Lord Jesus said this.&rdquo; Then I responded, &ldquo;Since the Lord Jesus said to eat Him, surely we also have to say the same thing.&rdquo; We all have to learn to say that Jesus is eatable. He is the bread of life (John 6:35, 48, 51). If we have a piece of bread, is it not right to say that the bread is eatable?</p>
<p>Some Christian groups may speak about and stress that Jesus is the bread of life, but very few have told people to eat Christ. In John 6:48 the Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life, and in John 6:57 He said, &ldquo;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&rdquo; In Greek the word for &ldquo;eats&rdquo; in verse 57 is literally &ldquo;masticates.&rdquo; To masticate is to eat finely, thoroughly, and absolutely. Jesus came not only to die for our sins but also to be our daily bread, our food. Christ being the bread of life and the matter of eating Him are mentioned together in the same chapter. This is logical. The Lord Jesus told us that He is the bread of life, and He must also show us how to take Him as the bread. The bread is not for our appreciation outwardly; it is for our eating.</p>
<p>Years ago I put out a series of messages entitled, &ldquo;Eating, Drinking, and Enjoying God.&rdquo; This may sound very rough and wild to some. When John the Baptist was preaching in the wilderness, everything about him seemed wild. His eating was wild, his clothing was wild, and his way of living was wild. He denounced the entire culture at that time. Then the Lord Jesus came to tell people to eat Him. This may also seem wild, but in reality we must eat Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. The more we eat Christ, the better. The best way to eat Him is to masticate Him. When we taste Him in such a way, we will surely testify that Jesus is eatable and delicious (Psa. 34:8; 1 Pet. 2:3; Heb. 6:4-5).</p>
<p>At the start of God&rsquo;s relationship with man in Genesis 2, God placed man in front of the tree of life (Gen. 2:9). Immediately, God brought this man out of His creating hand to the tree of life. This indicates that what God wanted man to do was to eat the tree of life. The tree of life is a sign, signifying that the creating God is the life supply to His created man. Then in Revelation 2:7 the Lord Jesus says that he who overcomes will be given to eat of the tree of life. At the end of the Bible there is the holy city with the river flowing with the living water (Rev. 22:1). In the flow of the living water grows the tree of life (v. 2).</p>
<p>This tree of life is the Lord Jesus. In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine (John 15:1, 5). The description in Revelation 22 indicates that the tree of life is a vine tree. Verse 2 says that the tree of life is &ldquo;on this side and on that side of the river.&rdquo; What tree, other than a vine tree, can grow in this way? It does not grow upward like a pine tree&mdash;tall and stretching toward the heavens; but it grows like a vine close to the earth on the two banks of the river. If the tree of life were tall like a pine tree and its fruit were at the top, its fruit would be too high for us to reach without difficulty. But the tree of life as a vine is lower than we are; thus, it is so easy to obtain its fruit.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine, and He also told us that He is the life (14:6; 11:25). Putting these two things together&mdash;the vine tree and the life, we can see that Jesus is the tree of life. The vine tree must be the tree of life. As the tree of life He is a fruit tree for eating, not a pine tree for building materials. He is a vine full of life for eating. For eternity, we are destined to eat Christ as the tree of life, which is the fullest expression of Jesus Christ. The riches of Christ are not for us to study; they are for us to eat and enjoy. Before 1958 there was very little realization concerning this matter in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. To eat Jesus is a new term among the Lord&rsquo;s children today.</p><h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST BY PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>The best way to eat Christ is to pray-read His Word (Jer. 15:16). To pray-read is to masticate Him. This compound word <em>pray-read</em> was also invented by us. We knew very little about pray-reading before 1966. Although we did not have this term among us until 1966, some of the saints in the past centuries at various times did practice the reading of the holy Word in the same way as what we call pray-reading. The churches on the island of Taiwan first began to practice pray-reading in 1966. The news of it reached the west coast of the United States, and the church in San Francisco was the first church in the United States to practice it. The church in Los Angeles soon followed. One night in a prayer meeting of the church in Los Angeles, the saints pray-read all six chapters of the book of Ephesians. I was not in the meeting, but I heard the news while I was away visiting another city. I was told that the saints were very excited and that the meeting was quite high. They really enjoyed the Word through pray-reading. To pray-read the Word is to enjoy the Triune God who is embodied in the Word (John 1:1, 14; Col. 2:9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST TO MINISTER CHRIST<br />
IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Today the new way to meet and to serve is to minister Christ to people, which is to dispense the processed Triune God into His chosen people to enlarge the Body of Christ, that is, to make the Body of Christ bigger and bigger. How could we have this kind of meeting? The way to have this kind of meeting is to come with our rich enjoyment of the riches of Christ and to speak this enjoyment. Then there will be an exhibition, a display, of all the riches of Christ. To do this we must enjoy Christ every day and all day. Then whenever we come together, each one will have something of Christ to present by speaking (1 Cor. 14:26). Nothing can replace this kind of meeting. In order to have the new way to meet and to serve, there is definitely the need of the enjoyment of Christ. To merely listen to messages without eating Christ for our enjoyment will result in death.</p>
<p>Many Christians today are starving for spiritual food. This is the reason that some of the churches in the United States attracted many &ldquo;church travelers.&rdquo; These &ldquo;church travelers&rdquo; are people who may have been in a particular denomination, but they became dissatisfied with it and began to travel from church to church seeking spiritual nourishment. Eventually, a number of these &ldquo;church travelers&rdquo; reached Elden Hall in Los Angeles as well as other meetings of the local churches in other places, and they were gained by the Lord, not by teaching but by feeding. They testified that the church life was what they were searching for; formerly they had been hungry, and now they were full. Their experience was like the testimony of the blind man in John 9:25: &ldquo;One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.&rdquo; Many people came into the meetings in Elden Hall around 1970 and were fed. There was something in the meetings which was good for food; it was something which fit their inner taste, making them happy. This is the kind of meeting we need and the kind of meeting the Lord is going to recover. Therefore, we must be stirred up to be an enjoyer, a good eater, of Jesus Christ. We must be very healthy in our eating. All the eaters of Jesus will be speakers of Jesus in the meetings. We will speak Jesus, speak out Jesus, and speak forth Jesus. Then we will have rich meetings that feed the hungry people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT FAITH</h2>
<p>The first basic element of the New Testament faith is that Christ is life to His believers (John 3:15-16). Christ is also the life supply to His believers as the bread of life (6:48). Since Christ is our life and life supply, we need to enjoy Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must learn to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). The riches of Christ are not for theological study; the riches of Christ are for our enjoyment. We must learn to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ as the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; Phil. 1:19). When we study the Bible with our mind alone, the unsearchable riches of Christ are just words printed in black and white. But when we exercise our spirit to enjoy what is mentioned in the Bible, the riches of Christ get into us. When the word of the Bible gets into us, it becomes the Spirit. In the beginning, it is simply the printed word, but when we exercise our spirit to pray-read this word, taking and receiving it by means of all prayer in our spirit (Eph. 6:17-18), it immediately becomes the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is all-inclusive and bountiful. When the word is outside of us, it is simply the word; when it enters into us, it becomes the Spirit. When we speak the word to others, it becomes the word again and when others receive the word that we speak, it becomes the Spirit within them. Outside of us it is the word; inside of us, it is the Spirit. This is our experience. If you dwell on Ephesians 3:8 by pray-reading it for only three minutes, this word will become the life-giving Spirit within you, making you so refreshed, happy, and full of peace.</p>
<p>The best way to stir people up and gain them for the Lord&rsquo;s move is not to teach or preach too much to them, but to ask them to pray-read with you. Do not argue or debate with them; pick up some &ldquo;golden&rdquo; verses and simply practice pray-reading with them. At first the practice of pray-reading may seem strange to them. If they do not pray-read, do not be bothered. Let them sit, listen, and watch as you and the others with you pray-read in a living, refreshing, strengthening, and energizing way. Perhaps, after the first or second time, they may be stirred up and say that they would like to enjoy Christ by pray-reading with their family in their own home. This is the best way to help people to pray-read.</p>
<p>We receive Christ as the life supply by eating (John 6:57). The way to eat is by exercising our spirit through the word by pray-reading (John 6:63; Eph. 6:17-18). To merely exercise our mind is insufficient; we need to exercise our spirit in the depths of our heart. When we lose our temper, we often exercise and release our spirit, but in a wrong way. If we do not know that we have a spirit, or we do not know how to exercise our spirit properly, we may simply exercise our mind to pray without touching our spirit at all. As a result of not exercising their spirit, some may even fall asleep while they are praying. In order to exercise our spirit, we need to know that we have a human spirit. The New Testament reveals that we must exercise our spirit (1 Tim. 4:7; Rom. 1:9; 8:4; 12:11; Gal. 5:16, 25; Eph. 5:18; 6:18). Ephesians 6:18 emphatically states that we must pray at every time in spirit. When we pray by exercising our spirit, we are unable to fall asleep. Rather, the more we pray in this way, the more stirred up we become.</p>
<p>When you pray exercising your spirit, you may feel after kneeling down for five minutes that you cannot remain kneeling any longer; you must stand up to shout, &ldquo;Lord Jesus. Hallelujah! O Lord Jesus! Hallelujah!&rdquo; You may simply become crazy with joy. You may stand up or jump up saying, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; The way to enjoy Christ is to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ as the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit by receiving Him as the life supply. We receive Him as the life supply by eating, and we eat by exercising our spirit through the word by pray-reading.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST AS THE TREE OF LIFE<br />
IN THE PARADISE OF GOD</h2>
<p>The enjoyment of Christ for the church meetings includes eating Christ as the tree of life in the paradise of God (Rev. 2:7). The paradise of God refers to the New Jerusalem which will be enjoyed as a foretaste by the overcomers in the coming millennial kingdom. The church life today is a foretaste of the paradise in the millennium. We have the Lord Jesus in the church life today as the tree of life, and in a very positive sense, the church life is a paradise. The church life is a most pleasant place; therefore, it is today&rsquo;s paradise. In this paradise of the church life, Jesus Christ Himself is living as the tree of life for our daily supply. Therefore, we must eat Him as the tree of life.</p><h2 class="head2">To Recover the First Love to the Lord</h2>
<p>We may lose our first love toward the Lord, but by eating Jesus we recover our first love toward Him (Rev. 2:4). The more we eat Him, the more we will appreciate Him, the more we will love Him, and the more we will say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are one with me and I am one with You. I love You, Lord.&rdquo; Eating Him is the best way to recover our love for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Keep the Church as the Lampstand</h2>
<p>Eating Christ as the tree of life is also the way to keep the church as the lampstand (Rev. 2:5). The lampstand is the bright, shining testimony. If the saints in a locality do not know how to enjoy Christ, to eat Christ daily, sooner or later the lampstand, the testimony of the Lord, will be removed from that locality. If on the other hand, the saints enjoy the Lord Jesus, eating Him by pray-reading in a rich way, there will be a bright shining lampstand as the testimony of Jesus in that locality.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus warned the church in Ephesus to &ldquo;repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent&rdquo; (Rev. 2:5). The way to keep the lampstand and recover the first love toward Him is to eat Jesus as the tree of life. This eating will keep the testimony of Jesus so living and bright in your locality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST AS THE HIDDEN MANNA</h2>
<p>John 6:31-35 shows that the manna in Exodus 16 was a type of the Lord Jesus being the bread of life. The manna, which came as the daily food supply for the children of Israel, was a type of the Lord Jesus as our daily food. In Revelation 2:17 the Lord Jesus promised to give the overcomers in the church in Pergamos, the worldly church, to eat of the hidden manna. The hidden manna signifies the hidden Christ as a special portion reserved for the Lord&rsquo;s overcoming seekers who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. The way to overcome all kinds of degradation in the church life is to eat and enjoy Jesus as the hidden manna, which was a special portion of manna preserved in a golden pot concealed in the ark (Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4). While the church goes the way of the world, the overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply. This promise is fulfilled today in the proper church life and will be fulfilled in full in the coming kingdom. If we seek the Lord, overcome the degradation of the worldly church, and enjoy a special portion of the Lord today, He as the hidden manna will be a reward to us in the coming kingdom. If we miss Him as our special portion today in the church life, we will surely lose the enjoyment of Him as a reward in the coming kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Overcome the Teaching of the Nicolaitans</h2>
<p>If we eat Jesus in a hidden way, we will overcome the practice and teaching of hierarchy signified by the deeds and teaching of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:6, 15). The teaching of the Nicolaitans is the teaching of hierarchy, which creates two distinct classes&mdash;the clergy and the laity. This was undoubtedly the hierarchy followed and established by Catholicism and Protestantism. This hierarchy creates a wide gap between the clergy and the laity. The way to overcome the practice and teaching of hierarchy is eat the hidden Jesus. As we eat Jesus in a hidden way, He becomes our energy of life within to overcome the deeds and teaching of the Nicolaitans.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, God has made all the believers in Christ priests (Rev. 1:6; 5:10; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). As believers, we all are priests and are not members of the clergy or of the laity. We are New Testament priests serving God with all the members of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">To Produce the White Stone for God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>Revelation 2:17 says, &ldquo;I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.&rdquo; If we eat Jesus in a hidden way as the hidden manna, we will grow and be transformed into a &ldquo;white stone.&rdquo; A &ldquo;stone&rdquo; in the Bible signifies material for God&rsquo;s building (Matt. 16:18; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Cor. 3:12). In our natural being we are not stones, but clay. Because we have received the divine life with its divine nature through regeneration, we can be transformed into stones, even precious stones, by enjoying Christ as our life supply (2 Cor. 3:18). If we do not follow the worldly church, but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life, we will be transformed into stones for the building of God. God&rsquo;s building, the building of the church, depends upon our transformation, and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST AS A FEAST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">To Overcome Lukewarmness</h2>
<p>Revelation 3:20 speaks of enjoying Christ as a feast. This is the Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Laodicea, which had become lukewarm. The lukewarm saints are very self-contented, so they have become proud. The best way to help these saints overcome their lukewarmness is to help them open their hearts to the Lord in order to let the Lord come in to dine, to feast, with them (Rev. 3:20). To feast with the Lord is to eat Jesus in a richer way, like the children of Israel enjoying the rich produce of the good land of Canaan, which included many items. All the riches of the good land were their enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Gain the Faith in Christ, the White Garments,<br />
and the Eyesalve</h2>
<p>To overcome lukewarmness is to gain the faith in Christ, the white garments, and the eyesalve. The Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Laodicea in Revelation 3:18 is to buy from Him &ldquo;gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.&rdquo; Our working faith (Gal. 5:6) is likened to &ldquo;gold&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:7). &ldquo;White garments&rdquo; refer to conduct approved by the Lord, which is the Lord Himself lived out of the church. The &ldquo;eyesalve&rdquo; needed to &ldquo;anoint&rdquo; their eyes refers to the anointing Spirit (1 John 2:27), who is the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The enjoyment of Christ as a feast (Rev. 3:20) will cause us to gain the faith in Christ, the white garments, and the eyesalve (3:18). As we experience Christ in such a way, we recover our faith in Christ signified by the gold, the Lord Himself is our approved conduct signified by the white garments, and we receive our sight to see the deep things of God and the spiritual things concerning Christ indicated by the eyesalve.</p>
<p>The people of God in the Old Testament were supposed to eat the tree of life in the garden, they ate the hidden manna in the wilderness, and they enjoyed the good land with all of its riches as a feast. Today we can enjoy Christ as the reality of the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast. When we enjoy Christ in all these ways, we will be nourished and fully supplied with the riches of Christ. Then when we come together, we will have something to speak about, something to offer. The riches of Christ will be exhibited in our meetings, issuing in the Body of Christ. The exhibition of the riches of Christ will produce, increase, or enlarge the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE AVAILABILITY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 2:9; John 14:16-20; Rom. 8:9; Eph. 3:8; Phil. 1:19; Rom. 10:6-10, 12-13; 8:11, 16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the availability of Christ. Christ is so available and ready for us to enjoy Him at any time and in any place. The chorus of hymn #539 in our hymnal says:</p>
<p class="hbody">O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!<br />
 How dear and near to me!<br />
How I admire Thy marvelous<br />
 Availability!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED<br />
IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>The processed Triune God is embodied in Christ (Col. 2:9). The processed Triune God is a new expression that we use to describe or unveil what we have seen and what we have experienced of our God. The divine Trinity is not for our theological study but for our experiential enjoyment. In order for God to be our enjoyment, He needs to be triune. The doctrine of the Trinity has been a matter of great debate among Christian teachers since the second century. Strictly speaking, it is very hard for any Christian to have an adequate, unbiased, fully balanced, perfect, and complete apprehension, understanding, or realization of the divine Trinity. I have been studying the Bible for over sixty years, and much of this time has been occupied with the study of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Through my study, I have discovered that the divine Trinity is the basic structure of the composition of the Bible. The Bible may be considered as a building, and the divine Trinity is the structure within the building. Most of this structure is not so manifest. If you look at the hall that we built in Anaheim, you will be able to see only stones and wood. But the main and basic structure of the inside of the building is steel. The columns of the building are actually steel pillars covered with stone and wood, and these pillars support long steel beams. In the same way, the underlying structure of the Bible is the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>From eternity according to His revelation, God had the intention, the desire, and even the good pleasure to be enjoyed by His chosen people. What He had in view was that He could have a thorough mingling with this people, making Himself one with them and making them altogether like Him. His good pleasure, which became His desire and intention, was to make His people His expression. In order to do this, He had to be triune. He is one unique God, yet three.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries, theologians have used different expressions to describe the Triune God. Many times I could describe the Three of the Godhead only with the term <em>the divine Trinity.</em> To say that the Three of the Godhead are three persons is not wrong, but to extend this description too far can lead one astray in his understanding. The Three of the divine Trinity are distinct, but They are not separate or divided. We may say that They are three distinct persons, but They are distinct to a certain point and then They are one. No one can say to what extent the three Persons of the Godhead are distinct.</p>
<p>We may illustrate this fact by considering a tree with one trunk and three branches. No one can tell where the three branches end and the trunk begins. Even to use the adjective <em>three-in-one</em> to describe this tree is not fully accurate. Actually this entity is <em>three-one.</em> Because God is three, He uses plural pronouns such as we, us, and our to refer to Himself. In Genesis 1:26, God said, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image.&rdquo; God is really three, yet He is uniquely one. On the one hand, God is three, but on the other hand, He is one. No one can tell to what degree the one God is three and to what extent the Three are one. Our God is three-one.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1 shows us the purpose of God&rsquo;s being three-one. The Father chose us (v. 4), predestinating us, marking us out (v. 5). Following the Father&rsquo;s choosing, the Son came in to redeem us (v. 7). Redemption implies regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. When the Lord Jesus comes, we will be glorified, and that glorification is the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). Our being glorified is the ultimate consummation of Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive redemption. Following the Son&rsquo;s redemption, the Spirit came in to seal us and to be our pledge (vv. 13-14).</p>
<p>The Father&rsquo;s predestinating and the Son&rsquo;s redeeming were actions, or doings, but these actions do not imply that the Person of the Father or the Person of the Son have been given to us and dispensed into us. The Spirit, however, seals us and becomes a pledge within us. The sealing and pledging of the Spirit are not only actions but also a Person. In other words, the Person of the Spirit is the action of the Spirit. The sealing of a piece of paper is not only an action, because the seal itself gets onto the paper, and is even dispensed into the paper. In the action of sealing, the seal comes to the paper, stays on the paper, and becomes one with the paper to be a part of the paper. In the sealing, the seal mingles itself with the paper because the seal penetrates into the very essence of the paper. Thus, the essence of the paper and the essence of the seal are altogether mingled as one entity. The Spirit was also given to us as a pledge. As the pledge, or the foretaste, of what we shall inherit of God in full, the Spirit was pledged into our being. The Father acted to choose us, predestinating us, the Son acted to redeem us, and the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God put Himself into our being as the sealing and the pledge. This is the full salvation of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>The Spirit is an all-inclusive Person, including the Father and the Son, and this one Person, the divine Three, becomes the seal. The seal is the divine Trinity as our full salvation. This all-inclusive, ultimate, consummate Person comprises selection with predestination, redemption, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. All these items&mdash;along with the Father, the Son, the Spirit, divinity, and humanity&mdash;are included in this one ultimate and consummate Person, who is the complete seal.</p>
<p>This seal, which is also the divine sealing ink, has come to reach us, that is, to put Himself on us and into us. The ultimate, consummate, divine Person Himself with His action comes to reach us, the paper. Then He stays with us in a thoroughly mingled way. The Spirit as the seal and the sealing ink penetrates the essence of our being to be one with us. He penetrates into us to become our very intrinsic element and essence; He remains in us even to become us, our very being. The divine, full salvation is the processed Triune God with all His doings and His Being becoming our essence, our element, and even our very being. Over sixty years ago, I was a piece of unsealed paper. But today I am a piece of sealed paper. We believers have been sealed with the processed Triune God. Just as sealed paper cannot be separated from the seal, we cannot be separated from the processed, sealing Triune God.</p>
<p>Our God today is the processed Trinity. He is not the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God but the &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; God. To say that God is the cooked God means that He is the processed God. The raw groceries that we buy need to go through the process of cooking. After being cooked, these raw groceries become a cooked meal. Our God really went through a cooking process. He entered into the womb of a human virgin and remained there for nine months to fulfill the principle in His creation. After being born, He lay in a manger. He went to Nazareth and lived there for thirty years. As the Passover Lamb, He was &ldquo;roasted with fire&rdquo; (Exo. 12:8-11) on the cross and burned with the divine fire of God&rsquo;s judgment. These are some of the processes our God passed through. He passed through a long period of cooking. Our God is no longer raw. He is the cooked God, the processed God. New York steak is very good, but no one would want to eat it raw. We eat cooked beef. In like manner, our God today is the processed Triune God ready for us to enjoy as our spiritual food.</p>
<p>This processed Triune God can be seen in the Gospel of John. The Lord said that He came in the Father&rsquo;s name in 5:43. This means that the Son came as the Father. When the Son came to be a man, He came with the Father. The Son told us in 16:32 that He was not alone because the Father was with Him. This is why He told Philip in 14:9, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus told us that He did everything out from the Father (5:19), that He did the Father&rsquo;s work (4:34; 17:4), that He spoke the Father&rsquo;s word (14:10, 24), that He sought the Father&rsquo;s will (5:30), and that He sought the Father&rsquo;s glory (7:18). Furthermore, the Son told us that the Father would send the Spirit in His name in 14:26. This means that the Spirit came as the Son. The Son also told us that He would send the Spirit &ldquo;from the Father&rdquo; in 15:26. The Greek word for &ldquo;from&rdquo; is <em>para,</em> and the sense here is &ldquo;from with.&rdquo; The Spirit is sent not only by the Father in the Son&rsquo;s name but also by the Son and with the Father. These verses in John reveal the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Our God today is enjoyable. As the processed Triune God, He is the cooked food on the dining table. Everything is ready for us to come and eat. In Luke 15, Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, likened Himself to a fattened calf who was ready to be killed for feeding the returned prodigal son. In His process the Triune God became a &ldquo;fattened calf,&rdquo; and He was killed on the cross so that we might feed on Him. This calf has been killed and roasted for us to enjoy.</p>
<p>We experience the processed Triune God when we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When we say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we have the deep sensation of the indwelling Spirit. When we call on the name of the Lord, the Spirit comes. If we do not call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we will not have the deep sensation that the Spirit is within us. When we call a person&rsquo;s name, that person will come because the name denotes the person. The name is the Lord Jesus and the person of that name is realized in the Spirit (John 14:16-20). We call on the second Person of the Trinity, but the third Person comes. Furthermore, when we call on the Lord Jesus, the Spirit comes, and we have the sensation that the Father is here who loves us so much. This is the processed Triune God embodied in the name of the Lord Jesus for our enjoyment. All three of the divine Trinity are embodied in this name. Some may not have much assurance that the processed Triune God is within them, and they may not know how to touch Him. We need to realize that we can call on the name of the Lord&mdash;&ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;anywhere and anytime. The entire processed Triune God is embodied in this name. When we touch this name, something happens. When we call on this name, a wonderful One comes.</p>
<p>We have to be those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ at all times and in every place (1 Cor. 1:2) so that we can be brought into the proper way to meet. While we are coming to the meeting, we need to be calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; If we are driving, we can call on the Lord&rsquo;s name in the car until we get to the meeting. After entering into the meeting place, we should continue to call. If we are this kind of meeting persons, what will our meeting be like? Our meeting will be filled with the processed Triune God. In this kind of atmosphere or situation, everyone will speak something, and the meeting will be a feast full of the Triune God. Such a meeting will feed people, and this feeding will issue in the building up of the Body of Christ, the enlargement of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>This kind of meeting cannot be seen in today&rsquo;s Christianity. What they have is a religious service with a little speaking of God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit, but without the rich speaking, realization, experience, and enjoyment of the Triune God. Our meeting has to be a meeting full of the enjoyment, the experience, the realization, and the speaking of this very processed Triune God embodied in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. My burden in the new way is not just to see the saints knocking on doors for gospel preaching and setting up home meetings for Christian edification. We have to drop the entire traditional way of Christianity. We have to open up ourselves, our entire being, to this processed Triune God that we may experience Him, enjoy Him, realize Him in full, and learn to speak Him. Until we reach such a level, such a standard, we have not reached the goal. We all have to endeavor to reach such a standard. When we reach this point, we will have the best replacement for the old way.</p>
<p>I want to see not only the increase in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery but also the exhibition of the processed Triune God in the meetings. We may have a big congregation without the exhibition of the processed Triune God. We need the increase of numbers but we also need the content of the meetings, which is the full exhibition of the processed Triune God whom we have experienced and enjoyed and whom we are now realizing and speaking. The meeting needs such content.</p>
<p>We have to see what the new way is. It is not just door-knocking or home meetings. The new way is the processed Triune God experienced, enjoyed, realized, and spoken by us. We all need to receive such a vision. We should be able to testify to the angels, the demons, the Christians, and the entire universe that we know what the new way is. This way to meet and to serve is the God-ordained, scriptural way for the building up of the Body of Christ. This scriptural way is what the Lord is seeking today and has been seeking for centuries. He is in the process of getting what He is after among us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST REALIZED IN HIS SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The all-inclusive Christ is realized in His Spirit (Rom. 8:9). The Spirit, as the realization of the all-inclusive Christ, consisting of the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) with the bountiful supply for the believers&rsquo; life and work (Phil. 1:19), indwells the believers&rsquo; spirits (Rom. 8:11, 16). This is the processed Triune God becoming one with His enjoyers. When we experience the all-inclusive Christ as the Spirit and speak Him in the meeting, that meeting is according to God&rsquo;s economy in His fatherhood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT EMBODIED<br />
IN THE LIVING WORD OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Triune God is embodied in Christ, Christ is realized in and as the Spirit, and the Spirit is embodied in the living word of Christ. The processed Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ, and the Spirit are invisible, but the Word is visible and can be pray-read by us. When we pray-read the Word, we are pray-reading the processed Triune God, we are pray-reading Christ, and we are pray-reading the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit. Our God is pray-readable, Christ is pray-readable, and the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit is pray-readable. The Word is composed of the bountiful supply of Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>The living word is also available in our mouth and even in our heart (Rom. 10:6-10). The word talked about in Romans 10 is not the word in letter. This word is living, and it must be the Spirit. Otherwise, how could the word be in our mouth and also in our heart? Sometimes we may not need a Bible to enjoy the living word because we can pray-read some verses we have memorized. This is why it is good to keep some verses in our memory. When we pray-read the printed Word, the word gets in our mouth and in our heart. At that time, the word becomes the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO PARTAKE OF AND ENJOY<br />
THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The way to partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ is to confess with our mouth, &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; (Rom. 10:9-10), calling upon the name of the Lord (vv. 12-13), and to pray-read His Word. The very Christ today is available in His name and in His Word. We can call on His name in any place, on any occasion, and at any time. His name is so available, and this name simply denotes Himself, His very Person. Moreover, all the content of this Person is condensed and embodied in the written Word. We have a name and a book. We can call on His name at any time, and we can pray-read the Word all the time. When we call on His name, we get Him. When we pray-read His Word, we enjoy Him. We have to practice calling on His name and pray-reading His Word daily at all times. When we pray-read the Word, we are actually pray-reading the processed Triune God with all His unsearchable riches. Hallelujah for the availability of Christ!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE MIRACULOUS NORMALITY<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:3, 5-6; Acts 13:52; Eph. 3:19b; 5:18; Acts 4:8, 31; 2:17-18; Luke 24:49</h1>
<p>According to my study of the Bible and my Christian experiences, I realized that in my Christian life the things that I experience of Christ, of the Triune God, of the Spirit, and of the divine life with the divine nature, are altogether normal to me. They are a normality. At the beginning of my Christian life, I read the writings of some inner-life teachers who taught that all these spiritual and divine things were great miracles that were not easy to attain. They indicated that a number of requirements had to be fulfilled for us to reach a point where we were qualified to receive these miracles. I tried to experience these things according to the instructions given in their books. Eventually, I found out that the experiences of the Spirit in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy were not according to what they taught. Actually, all the spiritual and divine things that are provided by God for our enjoyment are altogether normal. They are normalities. But I also found out that these normalities are miraculous to the uttermost.</p>
<p>About six months ago, I had a burden to release the truth concerning this matter. As I was writing an outline for my message, I was considering what term I should use to describe my experiences of these spiritual and divine things according to the holy revelation. I realized that what I had experienced was really normal but that it was also miraculous to the uttermost. Thus, I picked up the words <em>normal</em> and <em>miracle</em> to come up with the phrase <em>miraculous normality.</em> If we desire to properly and adequately visit people by knocking on their doors for gospel preaching and have the proper home meetings, we must have the experience of the miraculous normality. We must know what the miraculous normality is to be adequately qualified to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive the processed Triune God. To open up our mouths and call is most normal. It is normal to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; We can call on the Lord&rsquo;s name in any way, at any time, and in any place. Thank the Lord for the normality of calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; But when we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; do you realize what we get? We get the processed Triune God! This is miraculous. To get the processed Triune God is the top miracle, the greatest miracle among all the miracles. In order to receive Him, there is no need for me to dress up, make myself extremely neat, and be reverent by kneeling down in a proper way to pray in a formal way. There is no need for me to &ldquo;wait on the Lord&rdquo; for a number of days before I can contact, receive, and enjoy Him. All that I need to do is call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and I get the processed Triune God for my enjoyment. This is the greatest miracle in this universe and the totality and absolute aggregate of all the miracles throughout all the generations. This is altogether miraculous, yet it is so normal. We can call on the Lord&rsquo;s name while we are driving or before we go to bed. Quite often when I go to bed at night, I call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; right before I go to sleep. What an enjoyment! This is both normal and miraculous, a miraculous normality. Calling on the name of the Lord is a normality that transpires with me all the time, yet it is miraculous that when I call I receive the totality of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>According to my Christian experience, in God&rsquo;s entire economy, all the Christian experiences such as salvation, redemption, justification, sanctification, transformation, renewing, conformation, glorification, and speaking with the authority of the Lord in the power of the Spirit can be classified into three categories: regeneration, being filled with the Spirit essentially, and being filled with the Spirit economically.</p><h2 class="head1">REGENERATION</h2>
<p>Regeneration is a miraculous normality. Some inner life teachers said that it was not so easy to be regenerated, and they called regeneration the &ldquo;first blessing.&rdquo; I read a number of writings in an attempt to understand what regeneration is, but I could not find the answer until I read an article by Brother T. Austin-Sparks. He said that regeneration was to receive God&rsquo;s divine life in addition to our human life. I was happy when I read that definition. From that day I understood what regeneration is. To be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit in our spirit (John 3:3, 5-6), thus obtaining God&rsquo;s divine life to become the sons of God (John 1:12-13).</p>
<p>When I checked with my experience and the experiences of other believers, I found out that regeneration is not difficult to experience but that it is a very normal experience. Regeneration is instantaneous. It is like taking a picture with a camera; at the appropriate time a &ldquo;click&rdquo; captures all the scenery onto the film. This &ldquo;click&rdquo; takes less than one second. After we began to preach the gospel by visiting people, some wondered how people could be regenerated within fifteen minutes. But regeneration takes place instantly. We instructed the full-time trainees in Taipei to use the booklet entitled <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> in their preaching of the gospel. This booklet talks about God&rsquo;s creation, man&rsquo;s fall, Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and God&rsquo;s dispensing. After reading a portion of this booklet to a person, we can say, &ldquo;Please follow me to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; After leading him to call on the Lord in a strong way, we can read Romans 10:13 to him to assure him of his salvation&mdash;&ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; Then we can read Mark 16:16&mdash;&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; When we preach the gospel like this in a proper way, we are &ldquo;taking the lens cover off of the camera.&rdquo; Then we can lead this one to the water of baptism, and when we are baptizing him, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord, we baptize this one into the Triune God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is such a person genuinely regenerated? Actually, only the Lord Himself knows who is genuine and who is not, who is real wheat and who is a tare (Matt. 13:24-30, 36-43). It is impossible to discern the tares from the wheat until the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow but that of the tares is black. When they sprout, blossom, and bear fruit, everyone can discern the difference between them. Our responsibility is to get the camera ready by pointing it toward the scenery and taking the lens cover off. This is all that we can do, and this is all that we have to do. We leave the actuality and reality to the Lord. We have observed, however, that many have been genuinely regenerated instantly. This is miraculous yet normal. It is a miraculous normality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
ESSENTIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY</h2>
<p>To be filled with the Spirit essentially (Acts 13:52) is to be filled in our spirit (Eph. 5:18) for our spiritual living. To be filled with the Spirit economically (Acts 4:8, 31) is by the outpouring of the Spirit of power (Acts 2:17-18), clothing us with power from on high (Luke 24:49) for our spiritual work. Some inner-life teachers said that after being regenerated, a person had to receive what they called &ldquo;the fullness of the Spirit.&rdquo; This terminology is not so accurate. Fullness is the expression of the riches. But they used the word <em>fullness</em> for the infilling. What they meant by this term was the inward filling of the essential Spirit. They referred to this matter as the second blessing. They did not differentiate the infilling of the Spirit from the outpouring of the Spirit. The infilling is within us, and the outpouring is upon us.</p>
<p>The disciples received the Holy Spirit within when the Lord came back to them on the day of His resurrection and breathed the essential Spirit into them (John 20:22). On the evening of the day of resurrection, the disciples received the inner Spirit of Christ essentially. Later the Lord charged them to wait in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high. To be clothed is different from drinking of the inner Spirit as revealed in 1 Corinthians 12:13. To drink is to take the water into us, and to be clothed is to put the clothes upon us. To drink of the water is something related to the inner life, whereas to be clothed is related to our outward work in our duty or position.</p>
<p>Forty days after the disciples had received the inner Spirit, the Lord charged them to wait for the promised Spirit, which would come in another ten days. At that time they would receive another aspect of the Spirit, the economical aspect. The essential aspect of the Spirit is for our life and living and the economical aspect of the Spirit is for our ministry and work. The Spirit entered into the disciples essentially when the Lord breathed into them, and on the day of Pentecost, fifty days later, the Spirit came upon them economically (Acts 2:2-4,14-18). The economical Spirit of power equipped them to accomplish their commission.</p><h2 class="head1">PETER&rsquo;S EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE MIRACULOUS NORMALITY</h2>
<p>It is difficult to determine when Peter and the other disciples who followed the Lord in His earthly ministry were regenerated. Bible teachers hold different opinions on this matter. Some say that Peter received the Lord Jesus when he first came to Him. Others say that Peter was regenerated when he saw the Lord Jesus transfigured on Mount Hermon. Still others say that Peter was not regenerated until the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection when the Lord breathed the Spirit into him. Another school maintains that Peter was regenerated on the day of Pentecost when the Spirit came upon him, and he stood up to speak. In considering this matter, we need to realize that Peter was in a transitional period. When Peter called on the Lord in this transitory period, he was on the way to being saved. There was a period of transition for the Lord to accomplish and to complete Peter&rsquo;s regeneration. Peter&rsquo;s regeneration began at the time of his calling on the name of the Lord and was completed on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. On the day of resurrection, Peter was actually and practically regenerated, not only positionally regenerated.</p>
<p>Today we are not in a transitory period like Peter was. We did not need to call on the name of the Lord and wait three and a half years for our regeneration to be completed. We did not even have to wait three and a half seconds. When we called, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we immediately received the Spirit within. Our calling on the name of the Lord and our regeneration transpired at the same time.</p>
<p>Soon after Peter&rsquo;s regeneration was completed on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, he was tested concerning the need of his living. Peter and his colleagues were full-timers who had been called by the Lord to give up their occupations and follow Him (Matt. 4:19-20; Luke 5:3-11). Due to the trial of the need of their living, Peter returned to his old occupation and some others followed him, backsliding from the Lord&rsquo;s call (John 21:2-3). Peter was called by the Lord when he was fishing on the sea of Galilee, but after the day of resurrection, he told the others that he was going fishing, and they followed him. They might have lacked a sufficient supply of food and were very concerned about it. Do you believe that while Peter and the others were fishing the entire night that they were filled inwardly with the Spirit? Do you believe that before going fishing, they knelt down and prayed for twenty minutes to make a thorough confession of their sins and failures to the Lord? If they had prayed in such a way, they surely would have been filled inwardly with the Spirit and would not have gone fishing. Despite fishing for the entire night, they caught nothing. They did not get any fish, but they did get Jesus. Jesus appeared to them (John 21:4-14).</p>
<p>However, there was a great difference with these same disciples when they were in the upper room in Jerusalem as part of the one hundred and twenty. They prayed for ten days in one accord, and Peter stood up to expound some verses in the Psalms (Acts 1:14-20). Surely by that time all of them were filled inwardly with the Spirit. Without the inward filling of the Spirit, how could they have prayed together for ten days in one accord and how could they have withstood the opposition and persecution of the Jews in Jerusalem? Although the Jewish leaders were persecuting the followers of Jesus, they stayed together to pray for ten days in one accord. Surely all of the one hundred and twenty were completely filled with the Spirit inwardly during those ten days.</p>
<p>They were filled inwardly with the Spirit, but they still had not received the outpouring of the Spirit. The Spirit had not yet fallen or descended upon them economically. After the ten days were completed, the Spirit in the economical sense came down from the throne of the ascended Christ to descend upon them. This was not the inward filling of the Spirit of life but the outward outpouring of the Spirit of power (Acts 2:16-18). The outpouring of the Spirit in Acts 2 was the disciples being clothed with power from on high (Luke 24:49). It was then that the Spirit became their uniform, their authority for their work.</p>
<p>If a policeman attempted to direct traffic or do any of his work without his uniform, he would not command the respect of the people. But when a driver sees a policeman in his uniform, the driver is full of a fearful respect. The uniform of the policeman signifies the authority, power, position, duty, and responsibility of the policeman. We realize that we have to respect and regard a man in a police uniform because he is a man in authority, in his position, and in his responsibility. He is a man who, doing his duty, has the power to enforce the law.</p>
<p>When Peter and the eleven stood up on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14a), they were clothed with the economical Spirit of power, the power from on high, as their uniform. They stood there with authority. The heavens, the earth, and all the demons respected them because these were the men in the universe who had the power and the authority of the ascended Christ. This was not the inward filling of the Spirit essentially but the outward clothing of the Spirit economically.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE MIRACULOUS NORMALITY</h2>
<p>These three items&mdash;regeneration, being filled with the Spirit essentially, and being filled with the Spirit economically&mdash; cover the entire Christian life. Justification, redemption, forgiveness of sins, and the washing away of sins are included in regeneration. Sanctification, transformation, renewing, conformation, and glorification are included in the inner filling of the Spirit. The authority of the Lord, the position in the ascended Christ, the clothing of the Spirit of power as the uniform for ministry, the miraculous gifts such as speaking in tongues and healing, and all the activities of power are included in the outpouring of the Spirit upon us.</p>
<p>Regeneration, the infilling of the Spirit, and the outpouring of the Spirit, though miraculous, are very normal. If a sinner would be regenerated, he merely listens to the gospel and believes every item of the gospel. Then based on his believing, he calls on the Savior&rsquo;s name. Romans 10:9 says, &ldquo;That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.&rdquo; One minute before, this person was an unregenerated sinner, but the next minute, he is a regenerated saint. One minute ago, he was a son of the Devil, but the next minute he is a son of God. Although regeneration is normal, it is also a great miracle. D. L. Moody said that regeneration was the greatest miracle among all the miracles. Regeneration is a great miracle because a devilish man becomes a divine man, that is, a son of the Devil immediately becomes a son of God. Regeneration is the greatest miracle, yet it takes place in such a normal way. Thus, regeneration is a normality that is miraculous. It is a miraculous normality in our Christian life.</p>
<p>To be filled with the Spirit is also very normal. In order to be filled with the Spirit, we just need to fulfill the conditions, or terms. We need to make a thorough confession of our sins, pray to the Lord, and exercise our faith. When we believed in the Lord and were regenerated, we received an allotted faith (2 Pet. 1:1). This faith is within us and we must use it. We must exercise our faith. I usually eat a very nourishing breakfast every morning that supplies me with much energy. But during the day I have to energize, that is, I have to exercise my energy. A starving person could not exercise his energy because he has no energy with which to exercise. The food that we have taken in is converted to the energy that we exercise. In like manner, we all have received the God-allotted faith. We have faith within us, so we can exercise this faith.</p>
<p>We need to make a thorough confession of all our failures, defects, shortcomings, mistakes, and sinfulness to be filled with the Spirit. Even something small between a husband and wife is good enough to frustrate them from being filled with the Spirit. We have to confess in a detailed way. A husband may need to apologize to his wife. We must be a clear person inwardly with the Lord and outwardly with others. I believe that the one hundred and twenty in the upper room in Jerusalem were cleared up people. This is why they had the faith to pray and even to claim from the Lord what He had promised them.</p>
<p>If we are going to visit people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, we have to pray and make a thorough confession of our defects, shortcomings, mistakes, wrongdoings, failures, defeats, and sinfulness from within and without to get ourselves completely cleared up. Then we can say, &ldquo;Lord, here I am under Your blood. Through Your washing, I am clean. Now I have the full position to claim and enjoy Your infilling.&rdquo; Standing on what the Bible says, we can claim the infilling of the Spirit by exercising our God-allotted faith. Then we can go to preach the gospel with faith. We can say, &ldquo;Lord, I am going with You, and I have the confidence and the assurance that You are going with me. I believe that not only I but also You will be there knocking on the doors.&rdquo; Formerly, we may have been afraid when we knocked on people&rsquo;s doors; some of us may even have been shaking. But when we pray and exercise our faith in a proper way, we will never shake. Our hand will be like steel, and our arm will be like brass. When we knock on the doors, we will say, &ldquo;Devil, get away. Door, open to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you are filled with the Spirit, you will not talk to people in a routine way. When someone comes to open the door and face you, you will surely have something from the Spirit to say to him. When you say something to this man, you will be under the outpouring of the Spirit. Under the outpouring of the Spirit, you have the freedom to speak and the boldness to speak. You have the utterance and the assurance that you are under the Lord&rsquo;s authority. You are speaking things to people with the authority of the ascended Christ. This is so normal, but it is also so miraculous.</p>
<p>How marvelous it is that we can experience the miraculous normality in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy! We are regenerated persons who can be filled with the Spirit essentially and economically. We can go out to visit people with the heavenly, ascended Christ, with the very Christ who is sitting on the throne and who has received all the authority in heaven and on earth. We can exercise our God-allotted faith to believe that we have received the infilling and the outpouring of the Spirit. When we are filled inwardly and outwardly with the Spirit, we have the assurance that we are not speaking with our words but with Christ. This makes a great difference.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for us to fast for three days to experience the infilling and the outpouring of the Spirit. These are normal experiences but miraculous. My drinking of the living water is normal, but the transpiration of such a thing is the greatest miracle. The Triune God is the water of life. In order to receive the miraculous infilling and outpouring, we do not need to do miraculous things. All we need to do is fulfill the normal requirements and conditions in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Then we will receive these miracles. Whatever we receive is a miracle that is normal in our experience, so it is a miraculous normality. Let us exercise to experience this kind of normality under God&rsquo;s miraculous power.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE RESULT AND MANIFESTATION<br />
OF THE INFILLING AND OUTPOURING<br />
OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 13:52; Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 12:7-8, 10; Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:22-23; Acts 2:4; 10:45-46; 19:6; 1 Cor. 12:9-10; Acts 4:8, 31; 13:9</h1>
<p>The two aspects of the filling of the Spirit have been a perplexing and troubling matter among Christians for many years. Even among the Brethren, who knew the Bible quite well, this matter was not as clear as it is to us today. We need to be clear about the difference between the infilling of the essential Spirit and the outpouring of the economical Spirit (see <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy,</em> chapters seven through ten). It would also be helpful to learn to sing or speak a hymn such as #271 in <em>Hymns.</em></p>
<p>The New Testament clearly reveals that with the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God there is the essential aspect for life, existence, and living, and the economical aspect for working, power, and authority. The one Spirit has these two aspects. Nearly all the basic truths in the Bible have two aspects. With the Triune God there is the aspect of three and the aspect of one. It is wrong to realize God only in the aspect of three without also realizing Him in the aspect of one. To emphasize only the aspect of the three Persons can lead to tritheism, the concept of three Gods. Actually, the Bible tells us that God is Triune&mdash;with Him there is the aspect of three and there is the aspect of one.</p>
<p>With the Spirit there are the two aspects of essence and economy. The Lord Jesus was conceived with and by the Spirit, and He was born of the Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20). From the time of His conception, the Spirit was within Him. However, at the age of thirty when He came out to accomplish His ministry, He was baptized, and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him as a dove (Matt. 3:16). Actually, even before the Spirit descended upon Him economically, the Spirit was already within Him essentially. These are not two Spirits, but one Spirit in two aspects. Cerinthus, the ancient heretic, mistakenly taught that Jesus and Christ were two persons. According to his teaching, the descending Spirit was Christ. This Christ remained with Jesus for three and a half years until the crucifixion, at which time He left Jesus. This was a great heresy. The Triune God has been consummated to be the one unique Spirit, and with this Spirit are the essential and the economical aspects. The essential aspect refers to His substance, His very essence. This Spirit in His essence is for life, for existence, and for living. The economical aspect refers to God&rsquo;s operation, God&rsquo;s economy, and God&rsquo;s work. The essential aspect is inward and the economical aspect is outward. We must be clear about this. Otherwise, we will be confused when we read the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ESSENTIALLY, IN THE ASPECT OF INFILLING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Filled with Joy</h2>
<p>If we are filled with the Spirit essentially, we will be filled with joy (Acts 13:52). Joy is the very essence of the Spirit because the essential Spirit is the Spirit of joy. Acts 13:52 tells us that when the disciples were filled with the Spirit essentially, they were filled with joy. Joy cannot be separated from the Spirit. Joy is the essence of the inner Spirit and is one of the attributes of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking the Word of Praise,<br />
of Teaching, and of Exhortation</h2>
<p>Speaking the word of praise, of teaching, and of exhortation is also the result and manifestation of the infilling of the Spirit (Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16). According to Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3, when a saint properly and adequately speaks a word of praise or gives a word of teaching or a word of exhortation in a meeting, he bears the sign of the inward infilling. When one can speak the word of praise to God, the word of teaching to others, or the word of exhortation to the saints, his speaking is a strong manifestation of the infilling of the essential Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Speaking the Word of Wisdom and of Knowledge<br />
and the Prophetic Word</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12 shows us that speaking the word of wisdom and of knowledge and the prophetic word are the result and the manifestation of the infilling Spirit (1 Cor. 12:7-8, 10 and notes 8<sup>1</sup> and 10<sup>2</sup> in the Recovery Version). The word of wisdom is deeper than the word of knowledge. It is mainly of our spirit through revelation. In the one who is filled with the Spirit inwardly, this revelation becomes an utterance, which is the word of wisdom. The word of knowledge is mainly of our understanding through teaching, yet even this word from the mind is inspired; it is something that comes out of the infilling of the Spirit. The word of knowledge helps the saints to know the heavenly, spiritual, and divine things, and is mainly concerning Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4).</p>
<p>Chapters twelve through fourteen of 1 Corinthians are very much related to Christ and the church. First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ.&rdquo; Verse 13 continues, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body.&rdquo; The one Body is the church. These two verses concerning the Body and concerning Christ, the Head of the Body, are the governing verses for chapters twelve through fourteen. What is covered in these chapters is altogether related to Christ as the Head and the church as the Body. It is unfortunate that many readers of these chapters have never considered that they are concerning Christ and the church. Most readers consider that these chapters merely deal with problems in the church. One exposition of 1 Corinthians written among the Brethren points out that this book deals with eleven major problems in the church in Corinth, but it does not speak much concerning Christ and Christ crucified (1 Cor. 2:2) and the Body, the church. If we get into the depths of chapters twelve through fourteen, we will see that they deal with the things concerning Christ and the church. On the one hand, there is the need for the word of wisdom to reveal these things to us, and on the other hand, there is the need for the word of knowledge to teach us these things. I believe that this is exactly what we are doing now in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Quite often we have the word of wisdom, and even more we have the word of knowledge.</p>
<p>The prophetic word is the word directly inspired by the Spirit for speaking for God and speaking forth God. We may receive a word through the inspiration of the infilling Spirit to speak Christ or to speak forth Christ. The word of prophecy also includes foretelling, prediction, to tell things before they happen. However, prophecy is not used much in this sense in the New Testament, particularly in 1 Corinthians. In 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 the word <em>prophecy</em> refers not mainly to prediction but to speaking Christ and speaking forth Christ. To speak Christ and speak forth Christ is the proper prophesying, the prophetic word. This is not the ordinary word of wisdom. It is something very divine, coming from the direct inspiration of the indwelling Spirit. The word of prophecy is a strong sign that the speaker is filled with the essential Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living by the Spirit<br />
and Walking according to the Spirit</h2>
<p>The result and manifestation of the infilling Spirit includes living by the Spirit and walking according to the spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4). In Galatians 5:25 living by the Spirit differs from walking according to the spirit. We Christians are not so simple. As human beings, we have three parts: spirit, soul, and body. Sometimes we live by our soul, and sometimes it seems that we are just living by our body. Although we cannot live without the soul, a person may sometimes live as if he only had a body. Not only does such a one live without his spirit, it seems that he is living even without his soul. He does not care about politics, education, or ethics. He just lives to eat, drink, and have a good time. There may also be a person who lives neither in his spirit nor for his body. This kind of person is very strong in his soul and may be a professor with a Ph.D. in psychology or philosophy. Such a one will always lead you into the &ldquo;forest&rdquo; of his thoughts. After talking to him for ten minutes, you will be lost and confused.</p>
<p>We do not want to be persons who live by our body or soul. We should be persons living in the spirit. When we live in the spirit, we are filled with joy, and we speak the word of praise, the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, and the prophetic word, full of teaching and full of exhortation. If anyone is to exhort, he must be sober in his mind, his thinking. Yet he can speak out from his spirit. This is the living in the spirit.</p>
<p>Walking in the spirit is more than living in the spirit. To walk is to take action. When you take any action, you cannot avoid walking. According to Galatians 5:16 and 25, there are two kinds of walk in the Christian life. The first is the walk in our ordinary living referred to in verse 16. We still have to maintain a job, to be educated, and to care for our house and our children. This is the walk of our daily life. However, we also need another kind of walk referred to in verse 25, a walk in a regulated line with a definite goal. This may be illustrated by the life of a proper student in college. At the same time every morning this student must rise up and drive to school. In the afternoon he returns home, eats, and does his homework. This illustrates the second walk, not the ordinary walk of daily life, but a walk with a goal. You must walk in the regulated way in order to reach a goal. We all must have these two kinds of walks in our Christian life. We must walk daily and regularly for our living, family, housing, and transportation, and we must also walk with a certain direction day by day. These two kinds of walks are also signs that we are filled with the Spirit. Today many do not live by walking properly. They have no goal; they walk irregularly and in an unregulated way. If we would walk by the Spirit in the way of the ordinary daily life and also in a regulated way with a certain goal, this would be a strong sign that we are persons filled inwardly with the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Bearing the Fruit of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Bearing the fruit of the Spirit is also a result and manifestation of the infilling of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23). In Galatians 5 there are nine items listed, including love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control. Actually, there are many more Christian virtues. Paul only listed nine for illustration. These are all signs of the infilling of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ECONOMICALLY, IN THE ASPECT OF OUTPOURING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking in Tongues, Prophesying, Healing Sickness, and Doing Miracles</h2>
<p>The economical filling of the outpoured Spirit is the outward aspect. Speaking in tongues, prophesying, healing sickness, and doing miracles are clear evidences of the outpouring of the Spirit (Acts 2:4; 10:45-46; 19:6; 1 Cor. 12:9-10). As we have seen, prophesying in the sense of speaking Christ and speaking forth Christ is related to the inward filling of the Spirit. However, prophesying to predict something is a sign belonging to the outpouring of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking the Word of God with Boldness</h2>
<p>Speaking the word of God with boldness is a genuine and necessary sign of the outpouring of the Spirit (Acts 4:8, 31; 13:9). The most important aspect of visiting people by knocking on their doors is to speak the word with boldness. Even a little weakness in our speaking is a sign that we are not under the outpouring of the Spirit. We must exercise our faith in God, in the ascended Christ, and in the word of the Bible. Then we will have the assurance to say what we want to say. We will have the boldness, not to shout in an empty way, but to speak. To speak with boldness means that in our speaking there is something solid in content and in authority. People will recognize that this is not ordinary speaking. Even a learned professor will recognize this boldness in a young sister.</p>
<p>This boldness in speaking is seen in Acts 4:31. At that time the apostles had been threatened not to teach in the name of Jesus Christ in Jerusalem. However, when they came back together, they prayed to such an extent that the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they began to speak the word of God with boldness. If we go out to knock on doors with fear, nothing positive will result. This shows that we have been defeated and plundered by the enemy already. We must pray until we are filled with assurance and then go out with the outpouring of the Spirit. The outpouring will be upon us. This is something miraculous, but to our feeling it will be so normal. We all have to exercise such a faith with full assurance. Then we can speak with boldness. When we exercise our spirit to speak, we speak in boldness. To speak with boldness is a strong sign of being under the outpouring of the economical Spirit. Our praying or speaking in any meeting must be with boldness. This is not just to shout, but to speak with something in our spirit which cooperates with the Spirit that rests upon us.</p>
<p>We have to believe the Lord&rsquo;s word. Regeneration, the infilling of the Spirit, and the outpouring of the Spirit are normal things to us because they have already been accomplished. Because my wife prepares breakfast for me, I can simply sit down and eat it. Not only have all the groceries been purchased, they have also been cooked. What is placed on the table is ready for me to eat. I do not need to worry or do anything; I simply eat. To come to breakfast is so normal to me. The infilling and the outpouring are also normal to us because our God, who has gone through all the processes, has done everything for us.</p>
<p>We can enjoy the outpoured Spirit because Christ became a man, lived on this earth, went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death, rose from the dead, ascended to the heavens and was enthroned there, received the promised Spirit, and finally poured out this Spirit upon His Body. Today this Spirit is upon His Body. As long as we are a part, a member, of His Body, we are under this Spirit. Because the descending Spirit is now resting upon the Body of Christ and we are a part of the Body, we are under this resting Spirit. The Spirit is here, so we may apply Him. We do not need to do anything but exercise our faith.</p>
<p>We know with full assurance that the resting Spirit is upon us, and we go out to preach the gospel with this reality. We should not be afraid of anything; we do not need to tremble. Even a shy, young sister should not be afraid to visit people with the gospel because she should have the full assurance that the descending and resting Spirit is upon her. If I did not have any money, I could not walk into a restaurant and sit down in a normal way. I would worry about my lack of money to pay the bill. I could not even talk to the waiter in a normal way. Eventually, I would excuse myself and leave. However, if I had one thousand dollars in cash in my pocket, I would walk into a restaurant without any anxiety. I could enter in normally and sit down to order in a normal way. We can go out to preach the gospel with boldness because we are filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p>We can be regenerated, filled within with the Spirit, and apply the outpoured Spirit so normally because all things have been done for us. In the gospel there is an invitation which says, &ldquo;All things are ready; come to the marriage feast&rdquo; (Matt. 22:4). Incarnation is accomplished, human living is accomplished, the all-inclusive death is accomplished, resurrection is accomplished, and the ascension and enthronement are accomplished. Even the outpouring of the Spirit upon the Body of Christ is accomplished. We do not need to accomplish anything. We simply exercise our faith and come to receive and apply whatever has been accomplished.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE EXERCISE OF THE REGENERATED SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 1:7; Eph. 6:18; Acts 6:10; Rom. 8:4</h1>
<p>The exercise of our regenerated spirit is a crucial matter in our experience. God is triune to reach us, not as the Father or as the Son, but as the Spirit. In order to reach us, He has passed through many processes so that He could be ultimately consummated as the Spirit. The Spirit today is the very consummation of the Triune God; He is the consummated Triune God. It is by, through, and in this Spirit that God reaches us. To receive the Son and the Father requires that we touch the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the consummation and completion of the Son and of the Father, that is, the consummation of the Triune God. Although there may not be such terms as the completion of God or the consummation of God in today&rsquo;s Christian theology, there is such a reality according to the divine revelation. Our God has been completed, consummated, and this consummating work results in a Person, the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit as the very consummation of the Triune God reaches us. God is with us as the Spirit. In this Spirit is all that God is. When you have the Spirit, you have the Son and the Father. Both the Father and the Son are in the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God for us to touch Him.</p>
<p>God is triune, and we are tripartite (1 Thes. 5:23). We consist of three parts: the outermost part, the body; the middle part, the soul; and the inner part, the human spirit. When demons come to possess man, they always come upon his body, but when God comes to us, He comes into our spirit. On God&rsquo;s side, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and on our side, our human spirit is the very center of our being. The very center, the most intrinsic part, of our being is our spirit. Initially, God does not come into our body or our soul but into our very center, our spirit, the most intrinsic part of our entire person. When the consummation of the Triune God, the Spirit, comes to touch us, He touches our most intrinsic part.</p>
<p>This truth has been neglected in Christian theology. Many real Christians do not know that they have a human spirit. When they hear the word <em>spirit,</em> they think of the Spirit of God. Some theologians do not even admit that we have a spirit. They say that what the Bible refers to as the spirit is actually the soul and the heart. Some translators of the Bible also have confused the spirit with the soul, the heart, and even the mind. Many Christians today do not pay any attention to the human spirit. However, if you do not know how to differentiate between the human spirit and the soul, you cannot have the proper spiritual experiences. To have the proper spiritual experiences requires that we realize that we have a human spirit in which the Spirit dwells.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE SPIRIT AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In both the Old and New Testaments, there are two spirits. One is capitalized and the other is not; the <em>Spirit</em> refers to God, and the <em>spirit</em> is our human spirit. John 3:6, John 4:24, and Romans 8:16 are three crucial verses in the New Testament which refer to the two spirits. John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; The divine Spirit regenerates our human spirit. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God touches, reaches, and even enters our very inner being to regenerate our human spirit with the divine life. After this, the Holy Spirit remains and even dwells in our spirit. This produces a union, or mingling. Regeneration is the coming of the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God into our human spirit to mingle Himself with our inner being. The Spirit mingles Himself with our spirit to be one spirit (Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17). This is what transpires when we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Within our spirit we have a union of the ultimate consummation of the Triune God with our inner being. What a miracle this is!</p>
<p>The New Testament stresses the two spirits very much. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.&rdquo; Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo; The Spirit regenerates our spirit, our spirit worships the Spirit, and the Spirit is now working together with our spirit. By the begetting, worshipping, and witnessing, God and man are joined, united, combined, and mingled together.</p>
<p>Not too long after I was saved, I read some books by Jessie Penn-Lewis concerning our human spirit, including one which dealt with the difference between our spirit and our soul. We received much help from her related to the human spirit. Later, Watchman Nee published <em>The Spiritual Man,</em> in which he also differentiated between our human spirit and our soul.</p>
<p>When I came to the United States, I began my ministry with the two spirits. In the summer of 1969 we had a conference in which we spoke of the seven Spirits (published in <em>The Stream</em> magazine&mdash;Vol. 7, No. 4 and Vol. 8, No. 1 and No. 2) and a training in which we spoke concerning the human spirit. These messages are contained in the book <em>Our Human Spirit</em> (chapters one through six). We have also published a small booklet entitled <em>The Key to Experiencing Christ&mdash;the Human Spirit.</em> In the summer training of 1969, we also studied how much our human spirit is related to the divine life (the messages concerning the divine life from this training are contained in the book <em>The Crucial Revelation of Life in the Scriptures</em>). Without a proper knowledge of our human spirit, we could never have the adequate experiences of Christ as our life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When a baby is born, he first exercises his body. After a period of time, the child learns to exercise his mind and to speak. Eventually he is able to argue. This is the exercise of the soul. Athletics helps people to exercise their body, and schools help people to develop the exercise of the soul. Philosophy and psychology are a product of the exercise of the soul. Today every school stresses the exercise of the body and the exercise of the soul. The athletic grounds are for bodily exercise and the classrooms are for the exercise of the soul. There is nothing for the exercise of the spirit. The exercise of the spirit cannot even be found in the Jewish religion or in most of Christianity. No school or religion covers this matter. But in the Bible, the development of the spirit is greatly stressed.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 1:7 says, &ldquo;For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind.&rdquo; Our spirit is related to the three organs of our soul. In our soul we have the will, the emotion, and the mind. The spirit of power relates to the will, the spirit of love relates to the emotion, and the spirit of a sober mind relates, of course, to the mind. All family, social, and national problems are due to the fact that people use their mind, emotion, and will but not their spirit. They think with their mind apart from their spirit. They love and hate with their emotion without touching their spirit. They make decisions, not exercising their spirit. It is as if they do not have a spirit. Jude 19 says, &ldquo;These are those who make separations, soulish, not having spirit.&rdquo; Actually, they do have a spirit, but it is dead, dormant, and altogether neglected. They only exercise a strong will, unruled emotions, and an unbalanced, biased, and reprobate mind. Such ones are able to do many evil things related to their own person and to their family, society, and nation, for they have no relationship with their human spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that in God&rsquo;s salvation the first and central matter is for God to touch our spirit. This is to be regenerated in our spirit with the Spirit (John 3:5-6), to have our dead and dormant spirit enlivened by the Spirit (Eph. 2:5). The first word of the New Testament gospel is &ldquo;repent&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2; 4:17). Repentance is related to the conscience. If our conscience has never been touched and enlightened, we could never repent. Repentance comes from the touching and enlightening of our conscience. When our conscience is enlightened through the preaching of the gospel, repentance issues forth. The more we repent with the confession of our sins before God, the more our conscience is enlightened. The conscience is the greatest part of our spirit (Rom. 9:1; cf. Rom. 8:16). In our human experience, the conscience nearly equals the spirit.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we committed sins quite often. As a young boy, when I participated in wrongdoing, there was something in my conscience condemning me and telling me clearly that I should not be doing that. Even though there was no one to catch me, there was a deep fear within me. That was the function of the conscience created by God in my spirit. Romans 2:15 says of the nations, &ldquo;Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing joint witness, and their reasonings accusing or else excusing one another.&rdquo; Even when we were unsaved and our spirit was dormant and deadened, there was the conscience telling us what was right and wrong, and either justifying us or condemning us. When we heard the gospel and repented, the first part of our being which we used was our conscience. Our conscience, that is, our spirit, was opened to the regenerating Spirit. When we confessed and called on the name of the Lord, the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, entered into our spirit to enliven it and to dwell in it, to unite and mingle Himself with our spirit to form a mingled entity composed of the divine God and a human man.</p>
<p>From the time of our repentance, we the regenerated people should walk, live, and have our being absolutely according to this spirit. We should exercise the spirit given to us by God in prayer (Eph. 6:18), in speaking (Acts 6:10), in daily walk (Rom. 8:4), and in function in the meetings. Whenever we pray, our prayer usually begins with the exercise of the mind rather than of the spirit. However, after a few sentences, our prayer will spontaneously turn from our mind to our spirit. This is because our spirit, not our mind, is our praying organ. A baby begins to move by crawling on his hands and knees, but because his feet with his legs are the walking organ, his crawling eventually leads to standing and walking. Our prayer by our mind leads us to prayer by our spirit. Moreover, we now know the secret to praying in the spirit. We do not need to start praying by our mind, but we can begin by calling on the name of the Lord&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord Jesus; Lord, I worship You.&rdquo; In this way we can immediately begin our prayer by exercising our spirit.</p>
<p>In the foregoing fourteen chapters, we have pointed out that the proper Christian experience is to have everything related to us linked with the Triune God. We have also seen that the Triune God is of the riches of Christ, and these riches can become our enjoyment. The major items of this enjoyment&mdash;regeneration, being filled within with the essential Spirit, and being filled without with the economical Spirit&mdash; are normal yet miraculous. The way to have all these normal yet miraculous things is by exercising our spirit. The development of the exercise of our spirit is practiced mainly in the proper church life that is based upon the Bible. There is not much exercise of the spirit in the denominations. Although a few small groups of Christians have been helped in relation to this matter, it is hard to find some who take care of the exercise of the human spirit. Thank the Lord that this is stressed very much among us.</p>
<p>Even as an elderly person, I exercise my body because I still have to use it. I render much service to my body that it may serve me better. If I do not walk at least half an hour daily, I may become sick. I also exercise my soul very much. I use dictionaries, lexicons, and concordances quite often in order to develop my understanding, my mind. Most of all, I daily exercise my spirit. Often I hear good news. Good news always encourages people, making them proud of their accomplishments. The way to avoid this kind of corruption is to not stay in the mind to consider how much you are appreciated. The more we exercise our mind in this way, the more we will be corrupted. When we hear good, encouraging news, we must turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit. Many times, however, I may hear bad news, news which is damaging, discouraging, and depressing. On hearing this kind of news, one may be depressed and discouraged. The only way to stay away from this negative influence is to exercise the spirit. On calm days when I have neither good nor bad news, I still like to exercise my spirit. I have to pray and get my spirit strengthened, trained, and disciplined. I have to exercise my spirit to pray my entire being into the spirit. If I lived in a common way all day long and came to speak in the meeting, I would not have the heavenly light and I could not speak such terms as the &ldquo;miraculous normality.&rdquo; All the fresh, new terms I have used in these messages came from much labor in exercising my spirit. This is what you also need to do.</p>
<p>I am not teaching you athletics for the exercise of your body. Neither am I teaching you as a professor to understand many things. What I am doing here is uniquely to help you to develop your spirit, to exercise your spirit. After a short time with this ministry, many have been helped to exercise their spirit. To pray-read two verses and call on the name of the Lord early in the morning, to speak the Lord all the day long, and to walk strictly according to the spirit is for the exercise of the spirit. If we do not have such an exercise, our spirit will be weak, and we will be through with the Lord&rsquo;s move. Then our meetings will be dead and full of vain talk. To keep our meetings fully in the spirit, we need to exercise our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRIT FOR THE WORKING,<br />
MOVING, AND OPERATING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Today the Spirit is not far away in the third heavens; He is right here in our spirit. When we know how to exercise our spirit, the very Spirit in our spirit works together with us. When we exercise our spirit, He works, moves, and operates. This Spirit is Christ (2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:45b), and Christ is the processed Triune God. How wonderful it is that when we exercise our spirit, the processed Triune God works, operates, and even says, &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; within our spirit. With this &ldquo;amen&rdquo; we have peace, joy, much encouragement, and boldness. Without such an &ldquo;amen,&rdquo; such boldness, and assurance, I could not speak for very long. But if I speak by exercising my spirit, and the very Triune God says, &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; within me, I am encouraged and have the peace, joy, and confidence that I am one with the Triune God. I am speaking, and He is speaking in my speaking. He is really one spirit with me, and I am one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<p>If we all experience this, our meetings will be in the third heavens, full of the Triune God, full of Christ, and full of the riches of Christ. We will have an exhibition of all the riches of Christ. No doubt, this kind of meeting will issue in producing and edifying the members of the Body of Christ, and even in the building up of the Body of Christ directly through the members. This is what the Lord is doing in His ordained way, which we call the new way.</p>
<p>When you stand up to read a verse, you should exercise your spirit. It is preferable to exercise the spirit and make mistakes, rather than to make no mistakes but be full of the exercise of the mind. Do you prefer to exercise your spirit and make mistakes or to be fully right in the mind? We are a spirit-exercising people who make mistakes. If we do not exercise our spirit, regardless of how right we are and how few mistakes we make, our meetings will be dead and will not afford any life supply. If we make some mistakes, yet have the exercise of the spirit, people will receive the help in life. I do not care to be a prominent professor, lecturing with the exact pronunciation, accent, rhythm, and voice. I am a spirit-exercising man speaking Christ. As long as I exercise my spirit in speaking Christ, you will get the help. I may make some mistakes, but they will eventually not matter. You do not come to this ministry to listen to a top lecturer; you come to listen to a brother who is speaking Christ to help you. As long as your spirit is touched, nourished, edified, strengthened, and built up with Christ, you will be happy and not care about the mistakes.</p>
<p>When we were young, we studied about D. L. Moody. After one of his gospel meetings in which many people were saved, a man came to him and told him that his grammar had been incorrect. Moody pointed out to him that through his speaking with incorrect grammar many had been saved, and he asked this one how many would have been saved through his own correct speaking. Moody was not a scholar. He was a worker in his uncle&rsquo;s shoe shop, but he was caught by the Lord to be a full-timer, and I believe that he spoke by exercising his spirit. The spiritual experiences are altogether a matter of the exercise of our spirit.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 1:7 says that God has not given us a spirit of cowardice. This giving is the renewing, regenerating, and enlivening of our spirit. We had a deadened spirit, but God came to regenerate, renew, and make it alive. God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of a strong will, a loving emotion, and a sober mind. No one can stay away from their bothering mind, emotion, and will. They are bothering to us, but we cannot live as a human being without them. However, we should keep them under the control of our spirit.</p>
<p>If your spouse looks at you with an unpleasant expression and you exercise your mind, you will be angry with her. You must immediately put your mind under your spirit. The way to do this is by exercising your spirit, and the way to exercise your spirit is by calling on the name of the Lord, which implies praying. When your spouse has an unpleasant expression, you can say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Do not argue with her. Once you open your mouth with one word of argument, you will be damaged. You will come under the control of your devilish mind. Sometimes you may call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; and the situation will be calmed down. However, after half an hour a devilish thought may call you back to think about what your spouse did and about how you should not be treated like that. The more you think in this way, the more the demonic emotion rises up, and eventually the troubling will rises up also. The only way to overcome the devilish mind, demonic emotion, and troubling will is to always call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; This is why the Bible tells us to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). Once you cease to pray, the troubling, demonic, and devilish things rise up.</p>
<p>These things accompany us all the time, even during the meetings. The way to control them is to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; to speak Christ in the spirit, and to say something about God by exercising your spirit. If you do not do this, while you are sitting in the meeting listening to the testimonies or message, you may criticize everyone. The devilish mind always reminds you of people&rsquo;s shortcomings, and the demonic emotions always stir you up to love or hate, adore or despise something. Many times in the meetings we have been in our mind, emotion, or will, but not in the spirit. Many Christian meetings are meetings with the mind, emotion, or will, but not with the spirit. It is only when we exercise our spirit that the Spirit works, operates, and moves. A meeting with the exercise of the spirit is a meeting full of the Spirit. This kind of meeting issues in the riches of Christ and the building up of His Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">EXERCISING TO SPEAK<br />
THE WORD OF THE LORD WITH THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 6:63; 7:38-39; Rom. 10:8; Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16</h1>
<p>For us to meet and to serve in the scriptural way, we must exercise to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit. Our speaking of the living word of the Lord will issue in the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE EMBODIMENT<br />
OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Most Christians know that the Bible is the Word of God. But many do not know the very essence of the holy word in the Bible. Anything that is solid always has an element and an essence. We need to consider what the essence of the word of the Lord is. The holy word that has been spoken by God through the generations is the very embodiment of the Triune God. This is based on John 1:1 and 14. Verse 1 tells us definitely that the Word, the holy Word, is God. The word that has been spoken through the generations is God Himself essentially. The Word is God Himself, not in person but in essence. This simply means that God is altogether embodied in the Word. God is Spirit, and a spirit is mysterious and invisible. But the Word is something in black and white. It is visible and solid. Thus, the Word is the embodiment of the mysterious and invisible God. Although God is invisible and mysterious, the Word is not. The solid and visible Word embodies God. The Word defines, explains, and expresses God. When I am speaking word after word, I express myself. God is invisible, yet God is fully defined and explained in the Word.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord that we have God and we have the Bible. Where would the human race be if there had been no Bible for the past four thousand years? It would be in darkness. Today we have the privilege of being in the light and not in darkness. We are even shining over others as lights in the world (Phil. 2:15; Matt. 5:14, 16). The publications that we print are also a shining to spread the explanation and the definition of the invisible God. I recently found out the standing orders in Spanish for the publications of Living Stream Ministry are almost the same as the standing orders in English. This means that God is spreading through the publications to shine over Latin America.</p>
<p>Most of Latin America is under the influence of Catholicism. Nearly all of the truths in Catholicism have been leavened and corrupted. Hardly any of the truths in Catholicism are pure. In Matthew 13, there is a parable of a woman who took leaven and mixed it with the fine flour to leaven its entire contents (vv. 33-35). The unleavened fine flour signifies Christ as our food, and the woman signifies the Catholic Church who took many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning this pure Christ. Some in Catholicism use the excuse that it is hard for people to understand the divine and spiritual things, so there is the need to make these things easy to take in. Leavened bread is much easier to eat than unleavened bread, but leaven in the Scriptures is a corrupting and evil element (1 Cor. 5:6, 8; Matt. 16:6, 11-12). Because of Catholicism, Latin America has not been under the shining of the pure truth. Our publications have touched the hungry hearts there and are shining to spread the word as the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>John 1:14 tells us that the Word, which is the embodiment of the Triune God, became flesh, and this Word become flesh is Jesus, a man. This Man lived on this earth in Nazareth in the poor home of a carpenter for about thirty years. When He was thirty years old, He came out to minister Himself as the Word. Whatever He spoke was the coming out of His divine essence. The word spoken by the Lord Jesus was the very essence of the Triune God. He was the sower sowing the word (Luke 8:5, 11), and the word that He sowed was Himself. He Himself was the word. The gospel is the embodiment of Jesus Christ. The gospel is not merely in doctrine but it is a Person, and that Person is Jesus Christ. When we preach the word, define the word, and explain the word, what we speak is not merely the word but a Person.</p>
<p>To believe in the gospel is not to believe in teachings or doctrines but to believe in a living Person. When you believe in the gospel, immediately a living Person, Jesus Christ, enters into you, and this Person, Jesus Christ, is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The word is altogether wrapped up with the Triune God. The holy word is the embodiment of the Triune God. When we exercise our spirit to speak the word, we speak God, we speak Christ, we speak the Triune God consummated as the Spirit. There is much speaking in today&rsquo;s Christianity that is not the speaking of the Triune God. This speaking is merely vain words, but our speaking should be the word that is the embodiment of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD SPOKEN BY THE LORD<br />
BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>In chapter one of the Gospel of John, we are told that the Word was God Himself embodied to be Jesus. When Jesus speaks the word, whatever He speaks is spirit and life. The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The Word today is the Spirit and the life. Because it is the Spirit, it is also life. When the Lord brought me into the line of life many years ago, I saw John 6:63. From that day my understanding of the Bible was absolutely revolutionized. From that day I never considered the Bible as something merely printed in black and white. Instead I began to consider the Bible as the living Spirit and life itself. If we contact the Bible only with our mind, the Bible will be only the letter to us. But whenever we contact any part of the Bible with our spirit, that part of the Bible becomes spirit and life to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT FLOWING IN AND WITH THE WORD</h2>
<p>The Spirit flows in and with the word (John 7:38-39). The Gospel of John has a very good sequence. The sequence in John&rsquo;s Gospel is not according to history or according to doctrine, nor is it according to the standard of morality like the Gospel of Luke. John&rsquo;s sequence is according to spirituality. Chapter one tells us clearly that the Word was God. Then in chapter six, the word is something that comes out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus Christ. Whatever comes out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus is spirit and life. In chapter seven the Spirit becomes a flow (vv. 38-39). First there is the Word, then the Word is the Spirit, and finally the Spirit is a flow.</p>
<p>John 7 says that rivers of living water will flow out of our innermost being. The Lord tells us clearly that this flow out from our innermost being is the Spirit. With what does the Spirit flow from deep within us? This Spirit, who is the flow and who flows from within us, flows with the word. When we speak the living word, bubbling with the word, the Spirit flows with the word we speak. If we do not have the proper word with which to speak, the Spirit cannot flow out of us. This is why Paul tells us that we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly (Col. 3:16). We must have a living storage of the word. Then when we speak, the words that are stored within us will become water. When the word comes out of us, water comes out. The Spirit can flow in and with the word. The more we speak the word, the more the Spirit flows.</p>
<p>The Word, God, and the Spirit are altogether one. In John 1 God was the Word, who was in the beginning. In John 20, the Lord Jesus Himself became a Spirit that was breathed into the disciples. In between John 1 and John 20, there was a process. The Word became flesh, and whatever this One spoke was the Spirit. The Spirit flows with the word. Eventually, this One went to the cross, was crucified, and through resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) as the very breath that could be breathed into our inner being. Thus, John shows us the Word as God becoming flesh, and eventually this very Word becomes the Spirit. Today the very Word whom we speak is God Himself, Jesus Christ Himself, and the Spirit Himself. The Word is the Triune God.</p>
<p>This Word has gone through a process. The Triune God is the very essence of this Word, and this essence is altogether contained in the Spirit. God is the Word, the Word became flesh, and this Word today is the Spirit, so we all have to exercise our spirit. Then we have to learn how to exercise to speak this wonderful Word, which is the Triune God. In Ephesians 6:17 Paul refers to &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.&rdquo; The antecedent of &ldquo;which&rdquo; is &ldquo;the Spirit,&rdquo; indicating that the Spirit is the word of God. The Lord Jesus indicated that the word is the Spirit, and Paul said that the Spirit is the word. This is like saying Paul is the apostle and the apostle is Paul. The Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. These two are really one.</p>
<p>We must learn to speak this kind of word. To learn to speak any language, we must exercise to speak. Do not care about making mistakes. Your speaking will correct and improve you. We should not expect the new ones in a home meeting to speak so correctly. Children learn to speak by making mistakes. The more they speak, the more they learn to speak. Not much adjustment of their speaking is needed. Children also learn to walk and run by their exercise. First, they crawl until eventually they learn to stand up. Then through much trial and error, they learn to walk and then to run. All of us can learn to speak by exercising to speak.</p>
<p>We must endeavor to have a meeting without a definite speaker. We must put aside the practice of a single speaker in our church meetings. When I hear the saints speaking in a meeting, I may hear incorrect things. But eventually the saints correct themselves when they continue to speak. Sometimes I had the feeling to correct someone, but I decided not to. If we correct too much, no one will speak. Our correcting may make others afraid to speak. It is better to give others the freedom to make mistakes. When you go to a home meeting, do not correct the new ones. Let them speak. As long as they speak, that is marvelous.</p>
<p>In the full-time training in Taipei, I charged the trainees not to go to the home meetings of the new ones and become their pastor. It is possible to make yourself the new ones&rsquo; pastor without having the title of a pastor. Recently in Taipei, we began to have district meetings with at least fifty attendants in one district meeting. Among these fifty there might have been ten to twelve good speakers. I charged these saints not to become a &ldquo;corporate pastor&rdquo; of twelve persons in the district meeting. If these twelve do all the speaking, they become a corporate pastor. This practice can also annul the functions of the saints. We must try to speak in a way that leads and guides all the rest to speak. When the other saints open up their mouths to speak, let them continue the speaking. Give others the ground to speak, and do not try to correct them. If you correct them, they may stop speaking and the flow will be cut off. Treasure their speaking and even their making of mistakes. Let them speak with the view of their being perfected in their function.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the saints need to be balanced in their functioning. Some may like to talk all the time, and they may speak too much. These saints may need some correction and adjustment. Most of the saints do not need this kind of balancing word. They need to be balanced by learning to speak. In Hosea 7:8 the Lord likened Israel to an unturned cake. Cakes that are baked need to be baked on both sides. Many saints may be &ldquo;baked&rdquo; on one side, but not on the other. We all have to be turned cakes. If you shout too much in the meetings, you have to be balanced not to shout that much. If you would not shout at all, you have to be balanced to shout. If you shout too low, you have to be balanced to shout louder. If you shout too loud, you need to be balanced to lower your voice. The burning young ones, however, should not be balanced too quickly. If you balance them too fast, the burning fire will be quenched, and this fire may not come back.</p>
<p>Because I speak so much, I make mistakes. The more one speaks, the more mistakes he will make. The best way not to make mistakes is not to speak. The less one speaks, the less mistakes he makes. This is the philosophy of the Chinese culture. The Japanese are also very quiet according to their natural constitution in their culture. No matter what culture we come from, we all have to deny our self and our natural constitution by exercising to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIVING WORD, THE EMBODIMENT OF THE SPIRIT,<br />
BEING IN OUR MOUTH AND IN OUR HEART</h2>
<p>The living word, the embodiment of the Spirit, is in our mouth and in our heart according to Romans 10:8. How can the word be in our mouth and even in our heart? It is by being the embodiment of the Spirit. We must always remember that today the living word we speak is the embodiment of the Spirit. This word is Christ, and this word is the Spirit, the processed Triune God. My speaking is a major factor of my good health. My speaking requires a lot of deep breathing. Deep breathing is a very healthy practice for our physical being. In like manner, when we exercise to speak the living word, this is very healthy to our spiritual being, to our spirit. The more we speak the living word in a living way, the more we exercise our spirit and the more we breathe the fresh air of the Spirit. Then our spiritual being, which is actually our intrinsic being, our spirit, becomes very, very healthy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER<br />
WITH A SPIRIT-FILLED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we desire to speak the word of God, we must first have our spirit filled with the Spirit (Eph. 5:18-19). This means that we have to pray. We have to make a thorough confession of our sins to get ourselves fully emptied. Then our spirit will be filled with the Spirit, and we will speak by our Spirit-filled spirit. When our spirit is filled with the Spirit, we are qualified to speak. We all have to practice being filled with the Spirit to speak by our Spirit-filled spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO SPEAK<br />
THE WORD OF CHRIST TO ONE ANOTHER</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:16 indicates that we need to exercise to speak the word of Christ to one another. It is very good for the members of a family to speak the word of Christ to one another. We have to build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord. This will enable us to render some help to the meetings. If speaking the word becomes our habit, we will speak in the meetings and the meetings will be greatly enriched. Presently for many of us, our habit is not to speak. To change our habit is not so easy. We need to build up the habit of speaking the word of the Lord until it becomes easy for us to speak.</p>
<p>A person cannot live without talking. The more we talk, the healthier we will be. Talking makes people healthy and happy. To keep ourselves quiet all the time is to choke ourselves, and to talk is to release ourselves. I am not encouraging you to talk in a profane and vain way (1 Tim. 6:20) but to talk with the living word of the Lord. Then your entire spiritual being will be released. The more release you enjoy, the more growth you will have. You will grow by speaking the living word, which is the very embodiment of the Triune God, and you will enjoy what you speak.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP A HABIT<br />
OF SPEAKING THE WORD OF THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:16; 1 Tim. 6:20</h1>
<p>In order to practice the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ, we have to build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord. For the most part, we do not have the practice or the habit of speaking the word of the Lord properly. We do not practice applying the word of the Lord to our daily life that much, nor have we built up the habit of exercising to speak the word of the Lord regularly in daily affairs. For us to be saints who meet properly according to the holy Word, we need to build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord in our daily life and in our daily affairs.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING THE WORD OF THE LORD TO OUR DAILY LIFE<br />
AND AVOIDING PROFANE, VAIN TALK</h2>
<p>We must have a daily life that is filled with the speaking of the holy word. The normal daily human life is a speaking life, a talking life. It is hard to exist without speaking. It is difficult for people to be with others for even a short time without speaking. If you are with another person for only ten minutes without speaking a word, you must be a very strong-willed person. However, once we were saved by the Lord, we may have felt that it was very difficult to speak the word of the Lord to others. It is easy to speak the profane and vain word, but it is not so easy to speak the holy word. In 1 Timothy 6:20, Paul charged his young co-worker to turn away from &ldquo;profane, vain babblings.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;babblings&rdquo; indicates that it is very easy to speak profane, vain words. To babble is spontaneous and easy, but to speak the holy word is an exercise.</p>
<p>The only way to speak the holy word is to live according to the Spirit. If we want to speak the word, we must exercise to live by the Spirit, to walk by the Spirit, to do things according to the Spirit. We always have someone with whom we can speak. The husband and wife have each other, the parents have their children, and the students have their classmates. We all have the way and the time to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to others.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people have a lot of time to speak profane, vain words to others. Many would say that they do not have the time to pray, but they have a lot of time to talk on the telephone. When we do pray, we may pray only for a short time. But when we get on the telephone, we may talk for a long time. The reason for this is that our natural man has a lust for speaking natural things. There is a lust in our flesh for speaking profane, vain words to others. We must hate this lust, and we must do our best by the Spirit to put this lust on the cross. We have to turn from our lust to our spirit to live, to walk, and to have our being by the Spirit. We must hate our lust and crucify our lust by exercising our spirit. When we turn away from the lust that desires to talk in a vain way and turn to our spirit, our spirit will direct us to prayer. When we practice this, we are overcomers. This exercise will help us to practice speaking the word in our daily life.</p>
<p>In all the daily affairs of our daily life, we need to learn to speak the word. While we are doing things in our daily life, we need to learn to speak with others. Sometimes we may not have anyone with us. When there are no people to speak to, we can speak to the things around us. We can speak to the chairs, the flowers, the trees, and the animals. We should not stop speaking. Whether someone is with us or not, we should speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. When the sisters are cooking and no one is with them, they can talk to the oven about the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Always learn to talk in your daily life, but do not talk in a profane and vain way for your lustful enjoyment. You must change your habit to that of speaking the word of the Lord. If you want someone to accompany you when you go somewhere, get the right person to whom you can speak God&rsquo;s word. If you get the wrong person, you will not be able to build up the habit of speaking the divine things. You will be swallowed up by this wrong person. He will help you to speak things that are not so holy, and you will fall into profane and worldly talk.</p>
<p>If we do not speak properly during the day, when we come to the meetings in the evening, we will be the wrong persons. If we have been talking in a worldly way all day long and we come to the meeting in the evening, it is hard to make a &ldquo;U-turn.&rdquo; If our tongue is used to speaking worldly things for six days, on the Lord&rsquo;s Day our tongue will not cooperate with us to speak the holy word. If we are used to speaking worldly things during the week, how can we speak holy things in the meeting? Our speaking of the word in the meeting depends upon our habit. If I speak the holy word from Monday through Saturday, my tongue is used to that. Then when I come to the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, everything within my being, my mind, will, and emotion, is used to the speaking of the holy word. This is what I mean by applying the word of the Lord to our daily life.</p>
<p>If we do not practice speaking the word in our daily life, it will be very hard for us to speak much in the meetings, and we will need some to be our clergy to speak for us. Suppose that fifty saints are meeting together and forty-eight of them are silent. This will create a big gap in which the other two will be tempted to speak for them. These two will think that if they do not speak, the meeting will be very poor. Spontaneously they could become the pastors of this group of saints. To build up a meeting according to the biblical revelation is not an easy thing. It is like climbing up a high mountain. To roll down a hill is easy. If we give in to our habit of not speaking, our meeting will roll down to the bottom of the hill. To have a high meeting, we must pick up a habit of speaking the holy word.</p>
<p>When we speak the holy word, we should not only choose our favorite verses to speak. We can use any verse. We can speak the first verse in Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John. If we only practice speaking our favorite verses, this can spoil us. It is good if we learn to speak the hardest verses, such as the first seventeen verses in Matthew 1. If we speak verses such as these again and again, this will help us build up a strong habit of speaking the word. If we speak two verses a day, we can speak Matthew 1:1-17 in eight and a half days. To play certain sports such as basketball or tennis requires much practice. We need to practice speaking the word until we become proficient.</p>
<p>The Lord has the desire to recover the way of meeting revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. Without this kind of meeting, the Lord has no way to build up His Body. In the past history of the church, very little building of the Body took place because the way of meeting was not the scriptural, building-up way. The old, traditional way of meeting kills, annuls, and unconsciously tears down the Body of Christ. We may have received some help from this kind of meeting, but there was very little building. To have all the members of the Body fitted and knit together is to be built up (Eph. 4:16). After nearly two thousand years of church history, the Lord cannot see a builded church as His living Body on the earth today. The unique way for the Lord to accomplish this building is for us to meet according to His ordained way, not with a definite speaker or with dead speakings, but with the living members who always practice the living speaking. Whenever these living members come together, they do not necessarily need to choose a subject on which to speak. If they all speak, there will be something of the Lord in every speaking and all the attendants will receive the benefit and will be built up.</p>
<p>Whether or not the scriptural meeting which we desire to have is prevailing in the coming days depends upon our speaking. If all of us can build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord, our meetings will be a full success. Our speaking will make our meetings so convincing, nourishing, life-giving, and even subduing. Then our meeting will become an attraction and a source of rich supply. If all of us practice to speak, we will not need to rely on inviting a good speaker to help us. If someone speaks to us occasionally, that might be good. But if we practice having a definite speaker in our meetings all year round, that practice in the long run will result in the killing of the members and the annulling of their organic functions. The practice of having a definite speaker tears down for the long run. If everyone speaks when we come together, this will subdue and surprise people. To build up such a practice may be hard at the beginning, but if we endeavor to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word honestly, faithfully, and even truthfully for one or two years, the proper habit of speaking will be built up, and we will see the success and fruitfulness of our endeavor.</p>
<p>I have discovered that it has been somewhat easy for us to raise up local churches for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. At the beginning a few people are attracted to practice the church life, and within a short time the number of saints within a locality may increase to about fifty. At this point, however, a local church may find it hard to attract more people and the yearly percentage of increase may become quite low. The number of local churches on this earth has been increasing steadily, but at a certain point the increase within the churches comes nearly to a standstill. The basic factor that has stopped our attracting of others is that we took the way of a definite speaker. This is why some churches have remained in a place for at least fifteen years without much increase in number. At the beginning of the church life, we may be able to capture a good number of people, but eventually the practice of having a definite speaker kills the increase and annuls the functions of the members.</p>
<p>We must come back to the biblical way, to the recovery of the way of the proper meeting, and the proper meeting is to have all the attendants speaking. When all the saints speak&mdash; the weak and the strong, the old and the young&mdash;the result will be that people will be either nourished, subdued, convinced, or built up. Many positive results will issue from this practice. I encourage you all to practice speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word. We need to apply the word of the Lord to our daily life until we speak the word all the time.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of practicing to speak in our localities, we may become cold. To remain cold is easy, but to remain hot is not. At one time the water may be boiling, but if the fire is removed, it can become cold within a short time. Fire is needed to make the cold water hot, and this fire must be maintained to keep the water hot. I hope that the fellowship in this book can become a governing vision to us so that the fire within us to practice the scriptural way can be maintained. We need to allow the fellowship in this book to enter into us so that it becomes like an installed battery within our being to energize us to practice the new way.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD<br />
REGULARLY IN DAILY AFFAIRS</h2>
<p>To speak the word of the Lord regularly in daily affairs is to apply certain verses from the Bible to your affairs. If you are intending to go to a department store to spend some money, it is best to get a verse that fits that situation. There are many verses that can be applied to your going to shop. One verse is 1 John 2:15&mdash;&ldquo;Do not love the world, neither the things in the world.&rdquo; You can speak this verse on your way to the department store. When you are looking at some merchandise and are about to make a purchase, you can speak Romans 12:2&mdash;&ldquo;Do not be conformed to this age.&rdquo; You can get Romans 12:2 and apply it to your situation before you buy something. If you are going to quarrel with a brother or with your wife, do not quarrel before getting a verse such as James 1:20&mdash;&ldquo;The wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God.&rdquo; Before you lose your temper, you have to bridle it. Your temper is like a wild horse, and when you apply a verse like James 1:20 to it, a bridle is there. Even if you are going to shine your shoes, do not do it before getting a verse. When you shine your shoes, a verse like Ephesians 5:15 will help you&mdash;&ldquo;Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise.&rdquo; In doing anything in your daily affairs, it is best to get a verse first that fits your situation. If a sister is cooking fish, she can get some verses from John 21 where the Lord cooked fish for the disciples&rsquo; breakfast (vv. 9-12). She can speak these verses while she is cooking. Before brushing your teeth, you can speak Ephesians 4:29&mdash;&ldquo;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we would practice this, be assured that we will receive a great deal of help. This kind of daily practice in every daily affair will accumulate the riches in us. We will be enriched. A person who has the riches of God&rsquo;s word in his being can speak something rich, inspiring, and subduing in the meetings. His speaking will be like a sharp two-edged sword. This is not just a matter of reading the Bible and memorizing a verse. We are talking about the solid practice of speaking the word of the Lord regularly in daily affairs. Before doing anything, get a verse, apply that verse to your situation, and speak that verse to yourself. This surely is not vain speaking. This is the solid, applicable, and practical speaking of the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD,<br />
MINISTERING THE GOSPEL AND CHRIST<br />
TO PEOPLE AT ALL TIMES</h2>
<p>When we become used to speaking, we will be able to speak the word of the Lord, ministering the gospel to sinners and ministering Christ to believers at all times. We must have the habit of speaking with the ability to speak. Habit brings in the ability. If we do not practice speaking and build up a habit of speaking, we will not have the ability to speak. We have to speak the word of God, applying it to everything we do in our daily life. This kind of habit builds up an ability to speak. You will be not only eloquent but also very skillful in your expression and utterance. Sometimes you may want to preach the gospel to someone, but you may not know how to speak. You want to say something, but you do not have the ability or the skill. However, if you practice applying the word of the Lord to your daily life, avoiding profane, vain talk, and exercising to speak the word of the Lord regularly in daily affairs, it will be easy for you to speak the gospel to anyone. You will have the boldness, the skill, and the ability to speak the gospel to any kind of unbeliever.</p>
<p>You may be able to speak the gospel to a janitor, but not to a general manager. Would you be able to speak to a high government official or to the president of a university? You may be afraid to speak to such persons. You may be able to speak to a freshman at the university but not to the chairman of an academic department. But if you are apt to speak, you will have the ability to speak to anyone. You will not care what the person&rsquo;s status is. No one is higher than the Lord of lords and the King of kings (Rev. 17:14). The One who lives in you is the King of kings, and He is much higher than all the presidents, kings, and queens on this earth. When you build up the skill of speaking, this skill will encourage you to speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LETTING THE WORD OF CHRIST DWELL IN US RICHLY</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:16 tells us that we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. The Greek word for &ldquo;dwell&rdquo; in this verse literally means to be in a house or to inhabit. We need to let the word of Christ inhabit us, to make its home in us. When I buy a house and make it my home, all the rooms of the house will be under my management and direction. First, we move into a house, and then we get ourselves settled there. We occupy every room of the house. To let the word of Christ make its home in us is to let the word of Christ occupy us. Our mind, emotion, and will are the rooms of our inward being. We need to let the word of Christ occupy these rooms. Our strong will can be the safeguard of our being, our house. Would we let the word of Christ get into the safeguard of our being? We may be in the Lord for years without allowing the Lord to occupy our will. If we turn to the Lord in prayer, He may show us a part of our being that we have not opened to anyone. Now the Lord Jesus is knocking at that door, wanting us to open ourselves up to the word of Christ. He wants us to let the word of Christ occupy us, dwell in us, and take us over.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:15 tells us to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts. Christ Himself as peace must be the arbitrator in our lives. He must be enthroned as the ruler and decider of everything. That means whatever He says&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; First, we let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts, and then we let the word of Christ occupy us and take us over. We must practice this. Then we will have the divine utterances in us to convey the riches of Christ in our speaking. Otherwise, we may be speaking Christ, and at a certain point our utterance will run out. If we are driving a car and the gasoline runs out, the car will stop. Our utterance can run out in the same way. We may have the intention and the desire to speak, but we have to stop our speaking because we do not have the storage of utterances. We can always keep our utterance rich by letting the word of Christ make its home in us, occupy us, and take us over. When we have the word stored up within our being, our utterance will not run out when we are speaking.</p>
<p>Do we love the Lord? Are we for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in these last days? If we love the Lord and mean business with the Lord for His recovery, we must be so faithful and honest to practice all these items. Otherwise, I do not have much confidence that we will make it in this way. We all have to endeavor faithfully and honestly to practice day by day what the Lord has shown us. If the church in your locality does not practice these things that much, do not blame anyone. Practice these things yourself, and your practice will be a help.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">LEARNING TO TEACH OTHERS<br />
TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 5:13; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:19; 1 Thes. 5:20; 1 Tim. 6:3; Acts 2:42</h1>
<p>In chapter sixteen, we saw that we need to be those who exercise to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit. Not only must we ourselves speak the word of the Lord, but we also must teach others to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. We do not have the habit of teaching others to speak the word of the Lord. If we are going to teach others something, we ourselves have to practice what we are going to teach. Because we do not adequately practice speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word, we do not have the habit of teaching others to do so.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO INCREASE THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE WORD OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>If we desire to teach others to speak the word of the Lord, we must do one basic thing, that is, we must increase our knowledge and experience of the word. Hebrews 5:13 says, &ldquo;For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.&rdquo; Babes are only capable of drinking milk, and they cannot take solid food. Verse 14 tells us that &ldquo;solid food is for the mature.&rdquo; The solid food in this verse refers to the word of righteousness mentioned in verse 13. The book of Hebrews also mentions &ldquo;the good word of God&rdquo; (6:5), which is the milk the Hebrew believers tasted when they believed in the Lord. The good word is the word of God&rsquo;s grace (Acts 14:3; 20:32) for our salvation. The word of righteousness is much deeper than the good word of God because it embodies the deeper thought of God&rsquo;s justice and righteousness in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people. The good word, the word of grace, has been spoken much, but the word of righteousness which concerns God&rsquo;s dispensational and governmental dealings with His children is not understood by many Christians. We have to pick up a burden to practice the good word of God, that is, the word of grace for salvation, and we also have to practice the word of God&rsquo;s righteousness which is for God&rsquo;s dispensational and governmental dealings with us.</p>
<p>The more we increase not only our knowledge but also our experience of the word, the more we will be equipped to perfect others. Then when we go to take care of the new ones in the home meetings, we will have the rich materials in our being to use. When we go to a home meeting, we do not know what particular word will be needed. We must be like a pharmacy with many types of medicine stored within us. When we visit a home, we may not know what particular medicine the patient is in need of today. The many different kinds of people who are saved by the Lord through our gospel preaching will need help to begin their home meetings. This is why we need many different categories of the word stored in our being. This will enable us to open up our mouth and utter something to meet the particular need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Based on the Scriptures</h2>
<p>We all have to gain an increase and an accumulation of the knowledge and experience of the word based on the Scriptures (2 Tim. 3:15-17; Col. 3:16a). To gain such an accumulation we surely need to study the Bible. In 2 Timothy 3:15-17 Paul pointed out to Timothy that he had gained a good foundation in the knowledge of the holy Scriptures from his childhood. Then he told Timothy what the Scriptures can do for the man of God. The Scriptures enable the man of God to &ldquo;be complete, fully equipped for every good work&rdquo; (v. 17).</p>
<p>I must charge you not only to pick up two verses daily but also to study the Bible daily. These two verses are to stir up your spirit for your daily life, but we still need to study the Bible. At least we should read the New Testament once a year. Furthermore, when we study the New Testament, we should not study it according to our preference. We should study according to the sequence of the books beginning with Matthew.</p>
<p>When I was young, I loved the Bible, but in my reading of the Bible I wanted to skip over the first seventeen verses of Matthew regarding the genealogy of Christ. At a certain point, I realized that there were many riches in these seventeen verses, so I began to study them. Based upon my study of these verses, I wrote <em>Gleanings from the Genealogy of Jesus Christ</em> in 1936. The content from this publication with some additional revelation is contained in the notes on these verses in the Recovery Version of Matthew. A number of seeking ones began to admire and appreciate the Recovery Version when they read these notes. This shows us that we should not despise any verse of the Bible.</p>
<p>Every verse of the Bible bears some particular significance. We must learn to study the New Testament according to its sequence. Do not merely select some of your favorite chapters to study. We need to study the Word to increase our knowledge of it, and we need to experience the word. We should not be inexperienced in the deeper word of God. A teacher must learn much more than what he needs for his teaching. In the public schools of the United States, a person must have a college degree to teach kindergarten.</p>
<p>Today we cannot see Christian groups practicing the proper Christian meeting according to what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. This is because many Christians would rather take the easy way. To endeavor to practice the meeting that is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 is a heavy burden. But if we take the grace, grace will bear the burden. We all need to experience the grace. We have to practice speaking, and then we have to learn to teach others to speak. For this we must increase our knowledge and experience of the word.</p><h2 class="head2">Through the Hymns</h2>
<p>To increase our knowledge and experience of the word, we also need to study and use the proper hymns (Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16b). Any writing that we use apart from the holy Scriptures must be based upon the Scriptures. The hymns in our hymnal were altogether based on the Scriptures when they were written. We need to read and study the hymns. The table of contents in our hymnal is a very good chart with all the items of the proper theology. By studying the hymns and learning to speak them, we will gain more knowledge of the word. Through the singing, reading, and speaking of the hymns, we will also gain the experience of the word. Many verses of the Bible may be hard to understand without the hymns. Many hymns are expositions of certain chapters or verses of the Bible. If we get into one of these hymns, we will be able to understand the portion of the Word concerning which it was written. We have to use the hymns.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Publications in Life</h2>
<p>We can also let the word of Christ dwell in us richly through the publications in life (1 Thes. 5:20). We have many publications in life among us, especially the Life-study of the New Testament. The Life-studies are a storehouse of the riches of the Word. I charged the young full-time trainees in Taipei to spend from two to four hours every morning in the Life-studies for two to four years. Some of the young people did this and finished reading all the messages and also all the footnotes of the Recovery Version. When these ones stand up to speak, their speaking is rich because they have gained much knowledge and experience of the word within their being. When they speak, the riches flow out. The Lord may afford some among us, especially the young people, the opportunity to study the New Testament in the same way. We need some who can do this in the churches. Most of us may not be able to make it through the Life-study of the New Testament in two to four years, but we can all get into the Life-study messages according to our time and capacity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Within the Limits of the Healthy Words<br />
of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Teaching<br />
of the Apostles, Which Are the Contents<br />
of the New Testament and of Our Faith (Belief)</h2>
<p>We can gain the knowledge and experience of the Lord&rsquo;s word based on the Scriptures, through the hymns, and through the publications in life. This knowledge and experience that we gain must be within the limits of the healthy words of the Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching of the apostles, which are the contents of the New Testament and of our faith, our belief (1 Tim. 6:3; Acts 2:42). The entire Bible, especially the New Testament, is very profound. Many things are covered in the Bible, but if we pay too much attention to certain matters, we will be distracted from the healthy words of the Lord and from the teaching of the apostles. This is why 1 Timothy 1 tells us that Paul told Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently (vv. 3-4). To teach differently is to teach things different from the healthy words of the Lord Jesus and from the teaching of the apostles. If we are willing to be limited in this way when we come to the Bible, we will gradually discern what things are healthy and what things are not so necessary. When we read the Bible, it is easy for us to be biased according to our personal preference.</p>
<p>Some Christians emphasize tongue-speaking. The matter of speaking in tongues is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14. If we study these chapters in an unbiased, fair, and objective way, however, we will see that Paul wrote them not to encourage tongue-speaking but to adjust and limit the Corinthian saints because of their abuse of tongue-speaking. Paul&rsquo;s spirit and attitude toward speaking in tongues in these chapters is negative, not positive. This indicates that speaking in tongues is not crucial. In our sixty-six year history in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we attempted to practice the so-called miraculous Pentecostal things, including tongue-speaking, and we discovered that they were altogether unprofitable. At the beginning, these Pentecostal things seemed good to stir up the saints. But eventually the outcome was a damage to the church life and a destruction to the Christian life. After the third attempt among us to practice these things, the leading ones and especially the co-workers kept their hands off the Pentecostal practices. We spontaneously dropped these things. We found out that they did not work to properly edify the saints and to build up the Body of Christ in a very positive way with the proper life supply. Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 to deal with the abuse of tongue-speaking, and he wrote chapter thirteen on the need of love in order to balance the Corinthians by turning them to care for the Body and not for the outward gifts.</p>
<p>Foot washing is another practice that has been overemphasized by some, thus distracting them from the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. One brother who was very much for the practice of foot washing, which is mentioned in John 13, asked me if we practiced foot washing before the Lord&rsquo;s table. I told him that we have practiced foot washing occasionally in the past but that we did not practice it in a legal way. This brother then told me that our way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s table was not scriptural because we did not practice foot washing with it. To pick up a practice such as foot washing and not be restricted within the limits of the teaching of the apostles is altogether not healthy.</p>
<p>Some also overemphasize the teaching concerning head covering in 1 Corinthians 11. We were the first Christians who practiced head covering in mainland China, but we did not practice it in a legal way. Some Christians were influenced by us to pick up this practice, but they practiced it legally. They established ordinances concerning what kind of head covering the sisters should wear. These ordinances stirred up arguments. Their legality in this matter issued in fighting over doctrines. To overemphasize such a teaching is altogether not healthy. We must increase our knowledge and experience of the healthy words, which are the contents of the teaching of the apostles, and what we gain from the word and speak should always be within the limits of the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p><h2 class="head1">TO TEACH THE NEW ONES AS IN TEACHING<br />
YOUNG CHILDREN TO LEARN A LANGUAGE</h2>
<p>When we have the increase of the knowledge and experience of the word, we are qualified to teach others. To teach others requires much learning. A kindergarten instructor has to be instructed how to teach the little ones. A high school teacher also needs to be instructed how to teach. When we go out to preach the gospel and people get saved and baptized, we should immediately begin to help them have home meetings. According to my knowledge and experience, to have home meetings with the new ones is a most difficult thing. We spent much time in our full-time training in Taipei on this matter, and we are still learning and improving our practice.</p>
<p>In less than two years in Taipei, we baptized thirty-eight thousand, but we did not consider that we did not have enough people to care for these new ones. We learned that from now on we have to apportion our labor according to our manpower and the time that we have. If parents are not capable of taking care of a lot of children, they should not have that many children. A person may beget twenty-four new ones when he is only capable of taking care of six. So eighteen new ones would be left without any care. A certain local church may only have the personnel with the proper time to take care of two hundred new ones. In principle then, this church should not go out to get more than two hundred new ones to receive the Lord and be baptized. This church may have the ability to bring more people to the Lord, but they would not have the manpower or the time to take care of them.</p>
<p>In our preaching of the gospel, we also practiced to lead a person to believe and be baptized within fifteen minutes. From now on after new ones are baptized, we will try to stay with them for an hour to have a home meeting. According to our experience, the best time to help the new ones know some basic things is immediately after they have been baptized. That time will lay a very good foundation to preserve them in their home meetings.</p>
<p>The first thing to tell the new ones immediately after they have been baptized is that they have been saved based upon the precious blood of Christ by the regeneration of the Holy Spirit. We also need to tell them that they have been regenerated in their human spirit. We should give them at least two verses to show them that their salvation is by regeneration through the Holy Spirit in their human spirit (John 3:3, 5-6; 1:12-13). Now they have to learn to use their spirit to pray to contact the Lord. We should demonstrate to them how to pray by exercising their spirit. We need to show them how to call on the name of the Lord. This is the first lesson. It is best if we can stay with the newly baptized ones for an hour, if their time allows, to cover this point concerning the two spirits, the human spirit and the divine Spirit.</p>
<p>Do not think that matters like this are too deep for the new ones. You must exercise your faith to tell them some new things in a heavenly language. You have to believe that they will understand, and you have to present these truths in a very skillful way. Do not present things merely in the way of knowledge, but help them to enter into the practice. Do not teach too much but show them the proper practice and help them to enter into it. The next time we go back to meet with them, we should spend a half hour to an hour to help them to begin their Christian life with praying and reading the Bible. This is the best way to begin the Christian life.</p>
<p>After covering the matter of praying and reading the Bible, we have to help the new ones follow their inner sense. They have been regenerated and have received the divine life. Now the Holy Spirit is dwelling within them. The indwelling Spirit gives them an inner feeling, an inner sense. You may illustrate to a new one that before he was saved, he may have gotten angry with someone, maybe with one of his neighbors. He may have even been happy about the way he dealt with his neighbor in an angry way. Then you can ask him how he feels within since he has been saved for only a short time&mdash;when he gets angry with someone in a hateful way now, does he feel good within? He would say that he does not feel so good. Based on this fact, you can point out to him that he has a sensation, a feeling, a consciousness, that he did not have before he was saved. Then you can tell him, &ldquo;From now on as a real Christian you have to live, to do things, to deal with people, and to deal with matters according to this inner feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to lay the foundation with the new believers with these three stones: using their spirit to contact the Lord by prayer, praying and reading the Bible, and behaving according to the inner feeling, the inner sense. Based upon this foundation, we can build them up. Furthermore, every time you have a home meeting with the new ones, you have to charge them to call on the name of the Lord. You have to set yourself up as a model, an example, of one who calls on the name of the Lord. Immediately after their baptism have them start calling on the name of the Lord and encourage them to call all day long. The above three matters, including calling on the name of the Lord, are the foundation of the Christian life. You can then build upon this foundation and help them with many other things such as the clearance of their past and their old living.</p>
<p>The new believers are like babes who learn from and imitate their parents. You need to take heed to yourself (1 Tim. 4:16). If you are a rough person, the new ones will learn your roughness, and they will be rough Christians. After you contact the new ones on a regular basis for three months, they may be the same as you. Therefore, you must be a praying person, giving the new ones an impression that you bear a spirit, an attitude, and an atmosphere of prayer. When you contact the new ones, you must give them such an impression. This will affect them. Do not just tell them that they need to learn how to pray. That is not adequate. They will learn from you and imitate whatever you are.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">STEPS TO RAISE THE NEW BELIEVERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 10:12-13; 2 Tim. 2:22; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Acts 13:52; 4:8, 31; 2 Cor. 4:13; 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will see some of the practical steps to raise the new believers. We must learn the steps of how to raise up the new believers in the growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES<br />
TO CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>If we are going to raise the new believers, we must learn how to lead them to call on the name of the Lord (Rom. 10:12-13; 2 Tim. 2:22). There are many ways to lead the new believers into calling on the name of the Lord; the way largely depends upon your practice. Learn to call and practice calling on the name of the Lord. If you are a person who spontaneously, constantly, and instantly calls on the name of the Lord, this will not only impress the new ones, but also stir them up to spontaneously call on the name of the Lord. As little children like to follow their parents, the new believers will follow you to copy and imitate whatever you practice. We should not merely teach the new ones but lead them to call on the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>In order to help the new ones to do anything, we need to read and study the proper verses in the Old and New Testaments. We must do everything based upon what the Word teaches. Calling upon the name of the Lord is mentioned throughout the holy Scriptures. Beginning with the third generation of mankind, men learned to call on the name of Jehovah (Gen. 4:26). Then throughout the Bible, from the Old Testament to the New Testament, there is the line of such a life of calling on the name of the Lord (See Acts 2:21, note 1 in the Recovery Version).</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul charged his young co-worker Timothy to pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with all those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. This indicates that at Paul&rsquo;s time all those who sought after the Lord with a pure heart called on the name of the Lord. Calling on the name of the Lord is the unique way to seek after the Lord. We must learn to practice calling upon the name of the Lord all the time&mdash;spontaneously, instantly, and constantly. In Romans 10:12 Paul tells us that the Lord is rich to all who call on Him. Calling on the Lord is a unique way to touch the Lord, to contact the Lord, and to enter into the full enjoyment of His unsearchable riches.</p>
<p>We obtain salvation by calling on the name of the Lord (Rom. 10:13). To receive salvation from the Lord, believing alone is inadequate. You need to call on His name. From the first time we contact the new believers, we should lead them into the practice of calling upon the name of the Lord. You should tell them that the name of the Lord is very available. Wherever they go, the name follows them because the name is always with them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Name Denoting His Person</h2>
<p>In the Bible, especially in the New Testament, the name of the Lord denotes the Lord Himself, His very person. A name always denotes a person. When you call a person, you call his name. Humanly speaking, without having a person&rsquo;s name, there is no way to call a person. The name of the Lord Jesus is always with you. Wherever you go, the name goes with you; wherever you are, the name is also there with you.</p>
<p>We touch the Lord by naming His name (2 Tim. 2:19b). We can name His name, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; at any time. While we are listening to a message or engaged in any other kind of activity, we can call on the name of the Lord within. It is so convenient to call on the name of the Lord because His name is always available. We may call on others&rsquo; names and not have any sense that they are presently with us. But when we call on the Lord Jesus, right away we have the deep sensation that He is with us. This is because He is the Spirit who can be with us at any time and anywhere (2 Cor. 3:17). When we call on Him, we have the sense that He is with us because today He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). For our redemption, the Lord Jesus was the Lamb of God on the cross. But in order to be with us as our life, He became a life-giving Spirit through death and resurrection. As the life-giving Spirit, He is omnipresent. Thus He is in us, with us, upon us, and through us.</p>
<p>Even when you do not call, He is still with you all the time (Matt. 28:20). However, if you do not call, you do not have the sense of His presence. Your calling brings in the sense of His presence. We should not hold the concept that when we call on the Lord, He is present, and that when we do not call on the Lord, He is absent. Regardless of the situation, whether we call or not, whether we are up or down, whether we do well or not, He is always with us. But the sensation we have within concerning His absence or presence depends upon our calling. When you call, you have the sensation of His presence; when you do not call, you have the sensation of His absence. Calling brings you into the enjoyment of His practical presence. He does not come and go; rather, He remains with us and makes His home in us. When you like Him, He is present with you. When you dislike Him, He is still with you. When you love Him, He is present; when you are cold toward Him, He is still present. His indwelling presence is not changeable. But your sensation of the enjoyment of His presence depends upon your calling. We all must call on the Lord&rsquo;s name to enjoy His presence.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Person Being the Lord the Spirit</h2>
<p>We must tell the new ones that today the Lord is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18), and that as such a Spirit He is our Redeemer, Savior, Lord, and Master. A unique way to enjoy Him as all these aspects, to enjoy His presence, is to call on His name. We ourselves must be calling people. We must be people who call on the name of the Lord all the time. Then when we visit the new believers in their home meetings, we will bring not only this practice into their homes but also an atmosphere, spirit, attitude, and impression into the new believers themselves. They will be thoroughly impressed that the matter of calling on the name of the Lord is very unique. No founder of any religion asked his followers to call upon his name. This is unique with Jesus Christ. Only the Lord Jesus, the very God, Jehovah, asks us and even requires us to call on His name.</p>
<p>The Christian life begins with believing and calling (Rom. 10:9-10). Calling is one of the initial experiences of our Christian life. Once we believe in the Lord in our heart, we also must call on Him with our mouth. This is the initiation of our Christian life; our Christian life starts from and with calling. Today&rsquo;s Christianity does not stress this matter, but we should be different. We should have an attitude, spirit, atmosphere, and practice of calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name all the time. Then, as such a person, we should help the new believers by stressing this matter of calling to the uttermost. We can never call too much. If we lead one of the new believers into calling, he will enter into all the spiritual realities. All the spiritual and divine realities are in the Lord&rsquo;s name and are wrapped up with our calling. Our calling changes us and can make us happy and even beside ourselves. This matter of calling on the Lord is marvelous. Therefore, we have to build up a habit of calling at all times during the day. The more we call, the better it is. If we would call upon the name of the Lord for half an hour, we would be beside ourselves with enjoyment</p>
<p>Regardless of how much we enjoy calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, it is easy for us to neglect it. I charged the saints in Taipei to call on the Lord right after waking up and before getting out of bed in the morning. But I have found that the more we stress this matter, the more we may forget it. If we do not stress it, we may spontaneously practice it. This is my experience. We should just practice calling without stressing or emphasizing it that much. If we would go to bed at night saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the next morning we may say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; spontaneously. When we make up our mind to do something, we may forget to do it. If we make up our mind to have a victory, we may experience defeat. If we make up our mind not to lose our temper, Satan sends in one thing after another to urge, charge, induce, and stir us up to lose our temper. However, if we do not make up our mind to restrain our temper, we are able to restrain it in the Lord without hindrance from Satan. Here is a battlefield. The wisest way to fight the battle is to intend to do something but not to make up our mind to do it. To make up our mind is to make our strategy known to the enemy. When two countries are fighting each other, they keep their strategies from one another. We too need to keep our spiritual strategy from the enemy by not speaking it out. Very often, if we speak out our spiritual strategy, in a short time we see the opposite thing occurring.</p>
<p>Today there is the reality of spiritual warfare (Eph. 6:12), and we are in a spiritual battle. For this reason we sometimes have to keep things hidden within us, not speaking them out. We then keep things not only from men but more importantly from the demons. Calling on the name of the Lord is a battle because Satan hates the name of Jesus. When we call on the name of Jesus, we receive the Spirit, who is the Person, the reality, and the realization of Jesus. Whenever we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we are in the Spirit and we receive the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3; Acts 2:17, 21).</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO BE FILLED<br />
WITH THE ESSENTIAL SPIRIT</h2>
<p>After leading the new ones to call on the name of the Lord, we should immediately lead them to be filled with the essential Spirit. In Acts 13:52 joy is mentioned with the infilling of the Spirit. After calling on the Lord and making a thorough confession, some thought that they should immediately have joy. If we do not pay attention to joy, simply calling on the Lord and making a thorough confession, joy may come. However, if we expect joy to come when we make a thorough confession of our sins, it may never come. Joy is not the unique sign or evidence of our having been filled with the essential Spirit. It is only one of many evidences. But even if we have no apparent evidence, we still have to exercise our spirit and our faith. Second Corinthians 4:13 says that we have a spirit of faith and that we must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak&mdash;&ldquo;I believed, therefore I spoke.&rdquo; We must exercise our spirit to speak, confess, and call, and we must exercise our faith to stand on the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>As we are learning to be filled within with the essential Spirit, we have to exercise our faith. If we have made a thorough confession to the Lord, we must believe that He is working. An experience I had many years ago illustrates this. In 1939 I was invited by my former school to preach the gospel to the students. While I spoke, the Spirit touched one of the teachers, who was also a judge in a local court, very deeply. After the meeting, he told me that he believed what I had preached but that he did not know the way to enter into what I had said. In a brief way I told him to go home, kneel down privately in his bedroom, and pray to the Lord Jesus and to make a thorough confession of his sins. I encouraged him to confess whatever he felt was a sin, and I told him that by making such a confession he would be saved. He took my word and went back home to do what I had told him. He expected something from the heavens to come down upon him, but nothing happened that day, so he was very disappointed. He had prayed, confessed, and asked the Lord to forgive him, but according to his feeling nothing had happened. The next morning he still felt that nothing had happened. But as he was walking on his way to the court, he noticed that his outlook was completely different. He suddenly became very happy. Everything around him was different, and he began to rejoice. He was so happy that he could not control himself. His secretary noticed his joy and asked why he was so happy and joyful. He replied that he did not know why he was so happy, but that he was just happy. Throughout the day, morning to evening, while he was judging the cases in the court, he was happy. When he returned home, his wife was surprised by her husband&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>When he went to school that evening to teach, he asked one of the students who was a brother to explain to him why he had experienced such joy. The brother told him that the joy he experienced was a sign that he had received the Spirit, and that this was an indication that he had been saved. From that time onward, this teacher knew that he was saved. Something had happened, but not according to his expectation. When he expected something, nothing happened; but when he was not expecting anything, something happened. We too must learn as we are being filled with the Spirit, to leave the manifestation of our being filled with the Spirit to the Lord. We simply need to exercise our faith.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We should lead the new ones not only to confess their sins that they might be filled with the Spirit, but also to experience the economical Spirit (Acts 4:8, 31). We must tell them that as new believers they should give testimonies to their family, relatives, neighbors, and friends. We should point out to them that whenever they speak of the Lord Jesus to other people, they should exercise their faith to believe that they have the outpouring of the Spirit. We must lead them into this realization, rather than merely teaching them. If we are such people ourselves, we will then be able to bring this kind of atmosphere, attitude, and spirit to them. Spontaneously and sometimes even unconsciously, we will lead them into the realization and enjoyment of this outpoured Spirit.</p>
<p>We should lead the new ones into calling on the name of the Lord, being filled with the essential Spirit within for life, and experiencing the outpouring of the economical Spirit without for authority. Do not believe that these things are too hard. Humanly speaking, these things are very normal. On the one hand, these things are miraculous to the uttermost; but on the other hand, they are so normal in our experience. Cornelius with his relatives and intimate friends experienced all of these things at the same time (Acts 10:24, 44). They were regenerated, filled with the Spirit within, and experienced the outpouring of the Spirit all at the same time.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Christianity has made regeneration very hard. Some would question whether or not a person could be regenerated in fifteen minutes. It is not time that regenerates people; the Spirit does (John 3:6). Hearing the preaching of the gospel can be likened to taking pictures with a camera. As we preach the gospel using <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> we direct our listener through each point of the booklet, getting him (as we would a camera) into the right position. By the presentation of each point we remove the &ldquo;lens cover&rdquo; from his mind. When everything is ready, the opening of the shutter by a little &ldquo;click&rdquo; allows all the &ldquo;scenery&rdquo; to get into the camera of his being and onto the &ldquo;film,&rdquo; his spirit. It is not time, but the light with the opening of the shutter which brings the scenery into the listener. By our preaching the gospel in this way, many people have experienced regeneration, the infilling of the essential Spirit, and the outpouring of the economical Spirit.</p>
<p>We should not think that it is too early for one who has just been baptized to experience the outpouring of the Spirit. Some who were saved long ago were seeking the outpouring of the Spirit for many years, but their seeking was with much unbelief. Actually, you do not need to spend that much time to be filled with the economical Spirit. You simply need to exercise your faith to believe and to speak with boldness. Then regardless of your feeling, believe that you are under the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES<br />
TO SPEAK WITH BOLDNESS BY FAITH<br />
IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We must also lead the new ones to speak with boldness by faith in preaching the gospel (2 Cor. 4:13; Acts 4:31). After someone is saved, we should lead him immediately into speaking the Lord as the gospel, preaching the gospel in the boldness received by faith in the outpouring of the Spirit. According to the revelation of the Bible, we should pray, confess, stand on the word of God, exercise our spirit and our faith, and speak in boldness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO KNOW<br />
THAT THE MEETINGS OF THE BELIEVERS<br />
ARE IN MUTUALITY</h2>
<p>We also must lead our new ones to know that the meetings of the believers are in mutuality (1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25). I do not like to see the new ones come to an old-fashioned meeting with one eloquent speaker and all the others listening. This kind of meeting may be very attractive to the new ones. They may prefer to go to a meeting with a very good, eloquent speaker who speaks in a very meaningful way. But once they develop a taste for this kind of meeting, they will not want to practice the new way ordained by the Lord. Although the old, traditional way with a big building, large congregation, choir, song leader, and a learned, eloquent speaker seems to be good at first, in the long run, it gradually annuls the organic ability and function of the believers. Eventually, in such a situation, the spiritual life of the new ones will be killed. Once they get used to attending this kind of meeting, they lose their appetite and taste for taking the biblical way.</p>
<p>When we were in Christianity, we also lost our taste for taking the biblical way. We desired to listen to good, eloquent speakers all the time. But the result of such a practice is that the members of the Body lose their functions and abilities. In Christianity today there is a great facade which attracts people and keeps them under the apparent edification of teaching. But over a long period of time, this kind of traditional meeting annuls and kills, causing the function of the Lord&rsquo;s people to be reduced to nothing. In Christianity there are many believers but few who are really useful. These useful ones are usually encouraged to go to seminaries to learn to be good speakers. This practice supports the traditional practice of Christianity which depends upon organization and clergy. Rather than building up the Body of Christ, the meetings in Christianity build up the organization of Christianity and the practice of hierarchy. Thus, on the whole earth today, no group has fully entered into the practice of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. Therefore, we are burdened for the recovery of the practice of these two verses so that the Lord can have the practical building up of His Body. If we all receive the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace to practice the new way wisely for five to ten years, we will see the practical building up of the Body of Christ. This heavenly way is full of impact, and it can produce permanent results. The Lord will then see the building up of the Body of Christ, and He will be very happy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO SPEAK<br />
FOR THE LORD AND SPEAK THE LORD<br />
IMMEDIATELY AFTER BEING SAVED</h2>
<p>We should lead the new ones to know that one should speak for the Lord and speak the Lord immediately after being saved (Rom. 10:9). Tell the new ones to speak immediately what they know without waiting until they learn more. Perhaps all they can say is, &ldquo;Jesus is good. I love Him.&rdquo; Tell them to speak this to their neighbors. If a typical preacher, a &ldquo;professional speaker,&rdquo; were to say this, very few would listen. But if a so-called layman, such as a bank manager who just became a Christian, were to tell his neighbor, &ldquo;Jesus is good. I love Him,&rdquo; his neighbor would respect this word. The word out of the mouth of a so-called layman means a great deal, but the same word out of the mouth of a professional preacher means very little.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO REALIZE<br />
THAT THE MEETINGS ARE FOR THE BELIEVERS<br />
TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD AND TO LISTEN<br />
TO OTHERS SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>We should lead the new ones to realize that our meetings are for the believers to speak the word of the Lord (1 Cor. 14:26). We have to lead the new ones into the realization that they need to learn the word so that they can speak the word in the meetings. They learn the word of the Lord in order to speak the word in their home meeting, which is one of many kinds of believers&rsquo; meetings. Following our example, they can speak by the word of the Scriptures, by the hymns, and by the publications in life. When they speak, they do not need to have a definite subject and can just speak the word of the Bible.</p>
<p>The new ones should realize that our meetings are also for the believers to listen to others speak the word of the Lord (Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16). Do not think that you should only speak; you should also listen. On the one hand, as a new one you have to speak; on the other hand, you have to listen to others&rsquo; speaking.</p>
<p>The steps to raise up new believers presented in this chapter are a map for setting up home meetings in the homes of the newly baptized ones. We should put all these things into practice in a wise way. If there is a church in our locality already, we should submit ourselves to the church and go along with the church. The church in your locality may not have fully entered into the practice of the new way; therefore, do not initiate anything without the proper fellowship with the church. If, however, there is no church in your locality, you have the liberty to start everything new with the believers according to the steps presented here.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE INCLUSIVENESS OF THE SCRIPTURAL WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 2:2; Col. 2:2; 2 Cor. 3:8; John 1:4; Eph. 1:23; 3:4; 5:32; Matt. 22:9-14; Luke 14:23; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 12:12; 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25; Acts 9:31; Eph. 4:12, 16</h1>
<p>In October of 1984, I was burdened that we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery could have a new start. I told the saints in Taipei that what I meant by a &ldquo;new start&rdquo; was that we needed to change our present practice. I was fully aware of all the complications that would be raised up when we attempted to change our practice so that it could fully conform to the scriptural way. Christianity has been in this old practice, this old system, for centuries. We studied church history in order to help us find the way to meet and to serve according to what is clearly revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee was the one who brought the revelation concerning the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to us in China about sixty-two years ago. About fifty years ago in 1937, Brother Nee saw the light concerning the scriptural way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ, and what he spoke concerning this was printed in the book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> But he did not have the chance or even the possibility to practice all that he saw. I not only listened to Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages concerning this matter but he also talked with me personally about it. He told us clearly that to change our practice would be very hard because of two factors. First, the old way of meeting and serving is a deeply rooted habit in us Christians. It is very difficult to remove this habit from us. Second, he said that if we remove our old way of having the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message meeting, we will not have anything to replace it. If we did not replace it, this would create a gap in the practical church life into which negative things could come. Thus, we did not enter fully into the practice of this scriptural way for eleven years.</p>
<p>In 1948 Brother Nee had a training in which he picked up this matter again. This time his word was stronger. His fellowship concerning the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting is in chapter four of the book <em>Church Affairs.</em> In this fellowship, he picked up three crucial points. First, he said that the old system of meeting with one speaker and the rest listening was according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8&mdash;NASB). Second, he said that this kind of meeting was a waste. It wastes the saints&rsquo; energy and time. Third, he said that there was no need to maintain the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting. These are three crucial matters.</p>
<p>Based upon the light of this fellowship, I realized that changing our practice would be difficult and that it would touch the different feelings of the dear saints who have been meeting with us. I knew that some would feel very positive about this change, but I was also aware that a small number of the dear saints who have been meeting with us for many years and who have been so faithful to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and to the church life might not be so happy about this change. For this reason, I told the saints in Taipei that I was carrying out an experiment to find out the best way to carry out the revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the New Testament that was seen by Brother Nee and fully covered in his verbal teachings and written articles. I told them that I had the desire to do something according to our present situation.</p>
<p>In 1984 the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery were in a dormant situation. At the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery outside of mainland China in the East and in the West, the churches were not like this. But by 1984, we were drifting back to a situation that the Lord would not honor. This situation bothered me to the uttermost and compelled and forced me to study our situation. Through this study, I realized that we needed a change. The statistics of the major denominations in the United States and Britain show that the old way of meeting and serving has resulted in a declining membership. In these end times, the Lord will not honor an unscriptural practice that He tolerated in the past. Now is the time for the Lord to accomplish His recovery of the scriptural way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ. This may be the Lord&rsquo;s concluding recovery. With this vision, I was strong to run the risk of practicing the new way. I told the saints that I would set up an experiment in Taipei to see what would come out.</p>
<p>Today we are attempting to change from a traditional way which has existed on this earth for nearly nineteen centuries. It is not so easy to take the scriptural way. We have to take this way slowly, carefully, and gradually. If we are going to practice the scriptural way, we need to see its inclusiveness. The factors of the new way are in the objective aspect of the truth and in the subjective aspect of practice.</p><h2 class="head1">IN THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>In the objective aspect of the truth there are four main factors: Christ (1 Cor. 2:2; Col. 2:2), the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:8), life (John 1:4), and the church (Eph. 1:22b-23; 3:4; 5:32). These four factors in the truth have been my subjects in the ministry for years. Each one of these factors is a great topic, and all of them are included in the new way. The reason we have to change our practice to the new way is to carry out these four items. We want to carry out Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</p>
<p>Our purpose, our goal, and our destiny is not merely to preach the gospel to save souls. Preaching the gospel for others&rsquo; salvation is a means to accomplish the purpose that can fulfill God&rsquo;s economy concerning Christ and the Spirit through the divine life for the church. To accomplish such a goal we need the way to save sinners, to make sinners sons of God so they can be brought into the church. Otherwise, we will not have the new materials to accomplish such a great universal building, the building up of the Body of Christ. To visit people, to have home meetings, and to group people together into group meetings are not our goal; they are simply the means to reach the goal. Our goal is to have the building up of the Body of Christ. This is the very goal, the destiny, according to God&rsquo;s eternal economy, which He purposed in Christ according to His good pleasure. This building has to be of Christ, of the Spirit, by the divine life, and through the church.</p>
<p>From 1962 to 1984 in the United States we concentrated our ministry on Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. When we pick up the matter of visiting people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, this does not mean that we drop these four major items. In practicing the new way, we have never dropped these four items. Since I returned to Taipei in 1984 to begin the practice of the new way, I never departed from Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. When I spoke to the trainees in Taipei, I spoke on these four subjects. The first few messages I gave to the full-time trainees in Taipei were on the Triune God. I believe that the four factors of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church cannot leave those of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Even if we wanted to drop them, we could not because they have been deeply rooted in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE SUBJECTIVE ASPECT OF PRACTICE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>The other four factors of the new way are in the subjective aspect of practice. The first item of practice is to visit people by knocking on their doors for the preaching of the gospel (Matt. 22:9-14; Luke 14:23). Our experiment on this item was completely successful based on the fact that thirty-eight thousand people in Taipei believed and were baptized in less than two years. To get thirty-eight thousand people to receive the Lord and be baptized required a lot of labor, yet this was accomplished. Furthermore, I have received hundreds of encouraging letters from the six continents testifying that this new way to preach the gospel works so well.</p>
<p>The practice of visiting people to preach the gospel is the biblical way. God visited Adam (Gen. 3:8-9) and preached the gospel to him (3:15). The Lord Jesus visited people (Luke 19:1-10; John 4:3-15), and He sent the twelve disciples to visit people (Matt. 10:5-8, 11-13). Furthermore, He sent the seventy to go to every city and place to seek the sons of peace (Luke 10:1-6). After His resurrection, He charged all of His disciples to go to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). Can the nations be discipled if we do not visit people? We have to go. To go is to visit.</p>
<p>The early missionaries opened up the old and conservative China because they paid the price to visit people with the gospel. Because of their visiting, the Lord opened up the Chinese race to the gospel. We owe much to this first group of missionaries. They did not have the light that we do, but in this matter of living to God&rsquo;s gospel, these devoted God-men were incomparable. Through their marvelous and even legendary mission work of visiting people&rsquo;s homes and knocking on their doors, the Lord had a way to spread the gospel throughout China. We have to take this biblical way of preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>In the subjective aspect of the practice of the scriptural way, we stress the preaching of the gospel by visiting people. We have to go to visit people to bring God, Christ, the Spirit, the gospel, the holy Word, salvation, and God&rsquo;s presence to them. When we visit people, we bring all these heavenly and divine things to their homes, to their families. We do not need to invite people to our place to hear the gospel. We need to go with all these wonderful, heavenly, and divine things as gifts to impart into people. We have to take the way of visiting people to preach the gospel. I do not mean that we should never invite people to hear the gospel or that inviting people is wrong. But there are different ways of doing anything, and we must choose and take the top way. If we are going to travel somewhere today, we will not take a mule wagon. When I travel long distances, I like to take a 747, which is the fastest and most efficient way. To knock on people&rsquo;s doors for the preaching of the gospel is the best way to take. When it comes to preaching the gospel, visiting people by knocking on their doors is higher and better than any other way. Only by taking this way could we have baptized thirty-eight thousand people in less than two years. This is not the only way of preaching the gospel, but this is the best way.</p>
<p>If I were to travel from Los Angeles across the Pacific Ocean to Taiwan on a junk, it would take me at least six months. I would not be wise if I took that way when I can fly to Taiwan on a 747 from Los Angeles and be there within twelve hours. This is a wonderful age with wonderful modern means of transportation. We do not need to preach the gospel by the poor way of &ldquo;a mule wagon&rdquo; or &ldquo;a junk.&rdquo; Rather, we can take the best way to preach the gospel by visiting people, knocking on their doors to find the sons of peace. In Luke 10 the Lord said that He sent the seventy as lambs in the midst of wolves to find the sons of peace (vv. 3-6). We found thirty-eight thousand sons of peace in Taipei within less than two years, not by setting up a love feast and inviting them to come but by knocking on doors. I say again that visiting people by knocking on their doors is not the only way to preach the gospel, but it is the top way, the best way.</p><h2 class="head2">Building Up Home Meetings and Group Meetings</h2>
<p>The subjective way of practice also includes building up home meetings (Acts 2:46; 5:42) and group meetings (Acts 12:12). Many people do not like to come to a big meeting, but we can send the meeting to their homes. They will be very grateful to us for this, and they will welcome this kind of meeting. To set up home meetings, however, is not an easy matter to carry out. To merely go to people&rsquo;s homes and open the Bible, sing a hymn, and pray is not sufficient. Acts 2 tells that at the beginning of the church life, the three thousand who were baptized began immediately to meet in their homes. The Greek text for Acts 2:46 indicates that they met not merely from house to house but according to their homes. This means that there were as many meetings as there were homes. Each home had a meeting. We spent much time in Taipei to consider how we can carry out prevailing home meetings.</p>
<p>To bring people to salvation is one step, to help them to meet in the homes is another step, and to group them together to bring them further on the way to the church life is still another step. It is not so easy to set up home meetings in a prevailing way and it is even more difficult to group them together to bring them fully into the church life, not in the old way but in the biblical, God-ordained way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking and Listening to One Another</h2>
<p>The third factor in the subjective aspect of practice is that we meet by speaking and listening to one another in mutuality (1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25). We must have meeting after meeting full of speaking and listening to one another, full of mutuality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up the Local Churches<br />
for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The final factor of the scriptural way in the subjective aspect of practice is the building up of the local churches for the building up of the Body of Christ (Acts 9:31; Eph. 4:12, 16). If we do not build up the local churches, we cannot build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>To meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need to know and experience Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit day after day, having an abundance of life. We have to knock on people&rsquo;s doors, visiting them with the gospel. We must pay a price for this. Sometimes we will suffer persecution and doors may be slammed in our face. We also have to learn how to build up home meetings and group meetings with the intention to build up a proper church life. Finally, we have to build up the universal Body of Christ through the building up of the local churches. We have no choice but to take this scriptural, inclusive way. We all need to labor gradually and positively in this way to reach God&rsquo;s goal&mdash;the building up of the Body of Christ. Praise the Lord for the inclusiveness of the scriptural way!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICAL WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 10:5-6; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor. 14:26, 4, 12</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE PRACTICE<br />
OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
BY VISITING PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the practical way in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to carry out the new way. The practical way is first to build up the practice of preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes (Luke 10:5-6). From the time we first began to speak on this matter, we have not expected all the saints in the recovery to go out to visit people by knocking on their doors. It is impossible that all the saints would go out in this way. Some may be too old, some may be weak, and some may be very busy. Moreover, so many are needed to take care of other aspects of the church life. According to our budget, only one fourth of the saints who meet in the churches are expected to pick up the burden to go out to visit people by knocking on their doors for the preaching of the gospel. Out of one thousand, two hundred fifty may go out, and the other seven hundred fifty may remain home to pray for them and support them.</p>
<p>We do not expect that everyone in the church would go door-knocking, but we do expect that preaching the gospel in this way could be built up as a practice in the churches. This will take time. Sufficient time is needed to build up anything as a practice. We are now only at the initial stage of building up this good practice. I have the confidence that this will eventually be built up among so many in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. A good number of the lovers of Jesus Christ will pick up the burden and be willing to sacrifice all they have, all they are, and all they can do to visit people with the heavenly gospel by knocking on their doors. I believe the Lord will build up such a practice in every local church. However, I say again that it is not possible that all of the church people will do this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
AND THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The practical way for the new way is also to build up the home meetings and the group meetings (Acts 2:46; 5:42). The meetings in the homes of the believers are the basic factor of the building up of a local church. The building up of the local church does not depend on the big meetings; it depends upon the home meetings of the saints. A number of the messages I have spoken on this matter have been published in several small books (see <em>Key Points on the Home Meetings; The Living Needed for Building Up the Small Group Meetings;</em> and <em>The Home Meetings&mdash;The Unique Way for the Increase and the Building Up of the Church</em>). I hope that especially the young people would spend some time to get into these messages. I have stressed the meetings in the believers&rsquo; homes since I first shared on the change of the system in the church life in October of 1984, and I would still stress this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF A PROPER TECHNIQUE</h2>
<p>Both to knock on people&rsquo;s doors and to set up meetings in the new believers&rsquo; homes are not easy. We cannot do them in a natural way. People knock on doors for purposes other than gospel preaching. To visit anyone, one must knock on their doors. However, when you go out to knock on the door of a stranger for the purpose of gospel preaching, you may be afraid. To knock on people&rsquo;s doors in this way requires you to pay a price. You may be scolded or rejected. If this happens, you should rejoice (Acts 5:40-41; 13:50-52), but to rejoice at that time will be difficult if you are not enjoying the inward and outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In our earlier days we went out to knock on doors. However, we did not see much result. Our way was wrong, mostly due to our long speaking. Now we have found out that the secret to preaching the gospel is that a long speaking is not needed. The shorter and the more to the point the speaking is, the better. This way of speaking will bring you success.</p>
<p>Some may feel that we are helping the saints to preach the gospel by a technique rather than by the power of the Holy Spirit. They may question whether we believe that it is the technique or the power of the Holy Spirit which can save people. But we have not borne much fruit as a result of our way in the past. Where was the power of the Holy Spirit then? The Holy Spirit was there and His power was there, but it was not available. Electricity may be used as an illustration of the power of the Holy Spirit. You may claim to have electricity, but it may not be available to you. We surely need a technique to install the electricity. Regardless of how much electricity there is, you still need a wire to connect the power plant with your home. Moreover, you need an electrician to exercise his technique to install the wire and switches correctly. If the electricity is installed, you only need to go to the switch. Then the electricity becomes available. It is not the technique which operates; it is the electricity. But the electricity is so available in your home because you hired the electrician with the proper skill and technique to install the wires.</p>
<p>To read <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> and present the keys in it is the best way to install the &ldquo;wires&rdquo; and &ldquo;switches.&rdquo; Wherever you go to use this way, the heavenly electricity is with you. The power of the Holy Spirit will be there. We do not emphasize the technique, but to have the power of the Holy Spirit requires a proper way. To talk too much or to argue with people frustrates the power of the Holy Spirit. Some who depended on the power of the Holy Spirit without the proper technique may have only seen a few people saved, but some young sisters under our training have baptized five people in one evening.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE POOR IN SPIRIT TO BE TRAINED</h2>
<p>To learn to go out in this way we must first be empty in our spirit. Matthew 5:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit.&rdquo; Regardless of how old we are and how experienced we have been, we must learn to be poor in spirit. It should seem that we know nothing because we are so empty in our spirit. We should be so new and willing to learn as little children. Then we will be willing to pick up the new way. We will be taught and be successful.</p>
<p>We may think that to set up a home meeting is easy. It may seem that to have a home meeting is merely to go to someone&rsquo;s home and sit with them to sing a hymn, open the Bible, read one or two verses, and speak a little to them. But this alone is not a proper home meeting. On the day of Pentecost, the first day of the church life, three thousand new ones met in their homes. No doubt they had a big success. I tried to find out the secret of their successful practice, and in the recent full-time trainings I have passed on what I have found out.</p>
<p>The building up of a group meeting is even harder. It is difficult to group together new ones who do not know each other. What will we do when we come together? If we call a hymn, direct the reading of the Bible and the prayer, and speak something to the new ones, we may become a pastor holding a little church service in a home. This is not what we want. This absolutely cannot build up a local church. To carry out the proper way is not easy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE MEETINGS<br />
TO BE FULL OF MUTUALITY</h2>
<p>We must build up a practice of preaching the gospel by knocking on people&rsquo;s doors, we must build up the home meetings and group meetings, and we must build up the meetings to be full of mutuality (1 Cor. 14:26). It is hard to collect a number of people to speak and listen to one another fully in mutuality. Furthermore, we must help the attendants to speak and to listen in a living way, not by exercising their mind, but by exercising their spirit. This is altogether something new to the human mind and to the entire human society. Naturally speaking, no one has the concept of such a thing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h2>
<p>We must build up the local churches in the new way (1 Cor. 14:4, 12). We must not build in the old way, the way of a Sunday morning service with a preacher speaking to an audience. We must build in the way that is so living and so much in the riches of Christ, the way according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. To build up a church according to the old way is somewhat easy. We could build a hall or a chapel or rent a large room, hire a good speaker, and send out advertisements and invitations. When people come, we could have a church service and speak to them. A local church could be &ldquo;built up&rdquo; like this within two months. However, is this a church or is it merely a social gathering? How much will the life of Christ be ministered into these people?</p>
<p>The way to practically carry out God&rsquo;s ordained way is to build up a practice of the proper preaching of the gospel, build up home meetings and group meetings, build up the meetings to be full of mutuality, and build up the local churches for the building of the universal Body of Christ. We all must learn to do this. We cannot graduate from these four things. We need our entire life to finish the course. I am still here striving, struggling, endeavoring, and laboring to run my course. While I am speaking, I am running the course. I do not know when I will finish this race. After entering into the fellowship in this book, we cannot say that we do not know the Lord&rsquo;s way. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we are here and we know His way. Our eyes have been opened and the divine scenery has been presented to us. We cannot deny that something has been presented to us and that our eyes have been opened. Some heavenly light has come to shine over and within us, and something of this light remains in our inner being.</p><h2 class="head1">BRINGING THE NEW WAY TO A LOCAL CHURCH</h2>
<p>We may have seen something of the new way, but to carry out what we have seen is not an easy thing. This is true even with all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must first try our best to avoid any kind of unification. Do not try to unify all the churches with what is presented in these chapters. To unify is a big mistake. To unify will not help us to carry out God&rsquo;s ordained way. Rather, to unify would frustrate this way. Perhaps your local church has not come up to the level of the practice of this God-ordained way. There may be many reasons and factors for this. You must not look down on the church. Do not consider that because you have seen these matters, you have a special knowledge that the saints in your church do not have. To have this concept is altogether wrong. Do not think that you are extraordinary or superior. Although the church in your locality may not yet be able to come up to the level of what you have seen, you must go along with the church one hundred percent. Even if the church still has the Sunday morning message meetings, you should still attend these meetings.</p>
<p>Many churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have a time in the meetings for sharing from the saints. After the Lord&rsquo;s table and quite often in the prayer meeting there is a time for sharing. You should consider this as the golden portion of the meeting. That is the time for you to share, to exercise your spirit to function in a refreshing way. Many saints in the meeting need the refreshment. Take the opportunity to speak in the sharing time, but do not do too much. If the sharing section of the meeting is twenty minutes, you should occupy three minutes at the most. To occupy more time may offend people. Do not expect to do a quick work. You must carry this out little by little, week after week. Perhaps after fifty-two weeks you will have accomplished something. Simply take the opportunity to share, not only livingly and richly, but also refreshingly. Let all who hear your sharing feel so refreshed. They will aspire to do the same thing that you do. This will cause the church in your locality to rise up to the point that they can carry out the new way. You do not need to propose anything. Simply go along with the church.</p>
<p>Perhaps the church in your locality still does not practice the preaching of the gospel by knocking on doors. However, probably the church would not prevent you from knocking on doors. Even if some dear ones are opposed to the door-knocking, none of them would say anything to frustrate gospel preaching. Do not argue, and do not label yourself as a trained door-knocker. This will offend people. Go out to preach the gospel in an ordinary way. Do not even use the term &ldquo;door-knocking.&rdquo; Simply say that you are going to visit your relatives, classmates, or friends for the preaching of the gospel. The church will not prevent you from doing this, and the elders will not criticize you for doing this. They will be happy with you. When you baptize someone, you may bring them to the meeting. On the other hand, you may not feel to bring them to the meeting right away. You may have weekly or biweekly home meetings with them for a short while to lay a good foundation with them. Through this they will taste the new way. Then if you bring them to the meeting, they will not be influenced by the way of one person speaking. In Taipei, even though certain new ones came to the big meetings, they had no taste for the old way because of the foundation laid with them.</p>
<p>You should not criticize anything or express an opinion. Do not stand in the meetings of the church to tell the saints that their practice is not right or up to the proper standard. Simply go along with the church, do your duty, and exercise your spirit, faith, and wisdom with much grace. When you do everything in the right way, the Lord&rsquo;s grace will be with you. People will sense that there is much grace with whatever you do. The saints will receive a bountiful supply from you. Expressing your idea or opinion, despising others, and criticizing or even uplifting a church will not help others. Only the exercise of your spirit with faith, wisdom, and grace can nourish and cherish people and even bring them into God&rsquo;s economy. If you exercise in this way, you will be a good steward of the grace of God (1 Pet. 4:10). Eventually, all the churches will be brought up to the standard of the new way.</p>
<p>Do not have the intention of speaking too much concerning this way to the church in your locality. Do not even promote or push the practice of pray-reading two verses in the morning. Sometimes we may push something to such an extent that we impose it on others. This will offend people and stir up opposition. Rather, after a meeting go to a brother&rsquo;s home for a little fellowship. After five or ten minutes according to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, you may ask the brother to pray-read two or three verses with you. Do not use any special terminology or tell him that this is a &ldquo;propagation group.&rdquo; Simply pray-read with this dear one. He will be nourished and cherished and will receive the benefit. You do not need to charge this brother to continue to pray-read. He will spontaneously do it. After you are gone, he may tell his wife about pray-reading and try it with her. Do not propose, push, or impose anything. Simply live and practice the new way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MEETINGS<br />
ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 17:8; Eph. 4:12-16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the characteristics of the meetings according to the God-ordained way. The outward expressions of the inner essence, substance, and nature of a certain thing are its characteristics. God&rsquo;s ordained way, His new way, has its own inward, intrinsic, and divine essence, substance, and nature. With its essence, substance, and nature, there are some characteristics.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING THE BELIEVERS LIVING</h2>
<p>The first particular characteristic, or expression, of the proper Christian meetings according to God&rsquo;s ordained way is that they make the believers living. You may come into this meeting as a dead person, but when you leave the meeting, you leave as a living person. After you go to the meeting and return home, your spouse may tell you that you are a different person, that you are living, new, and fresh. These are expressions of the inward, intrinsic essence and nature which you received from attending such a meeting. Whether or not a meeting is according to God&rsquo;s ordained way depends upon whether or not it makes people living. If a meeting does not make people living, it is off the central lane. If it does make people living, this meeting is on the right track, the track of life. This requires all of us who attend the meeting to be living and full of life.</p>
<p>A very calm, quiet Christian meeting can be likened to a cemetery. I told people in the past that one of the quietest places in Los Angeles was Forest Lawn Cemetery. Everyone there is not only dead but also buried. This is why a cemetery is such a calm and quiet place. Sometimes we may have a meeting that is like a cemetery with all the attendants sitting there so calm and so dead. Some might say that it is better to be calm than noisy. But God in His Word charges us to make a joyful noise (Psa. 66:1; 81:1; 95:1-2; 98:4, 6; 100:1). The Word does not tell us to make a joyful voice. A voice means that the sounds are arranged in a proper order. A noise has no order and no arrangement.</p>
<p>Do you like a quiet and calm meeting or a noisy meeting? We need to have a proper noise in our meetings where everyone speaks, everyone prays, everyone praises, and everyone gives thanks. To be noisy is better than being calm and silent because calmness and silence signify death (Psa. 115:17). Nothing that has life is quiet; everything with life must act. As long as a person is living, it is impossible for him not to move at all. Only a dead person has absolutely no movement. We can recognize living persons because they are moving. The first characteristic of our meetings is that they must make the believers living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEVELOPING THE ORGANIC ABILITY AND FUNCTION<br />
OF THE LIVING MEMBERS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Another characteristic of the meetings according to the God-ordained way is that they develop the organic ability and function of the living members of Christ (Eph. 4:16). The old way of meeting is not the right way because, instead of developing, it annuls the organic ability and function of the members of the Body. Many who have attended the so-called services in Christianity week after week have had their ability and function annulled. By birth a small child has all its organs&mdash;organs for eating, digesting, seeing, listening, smelling, speaking, and walking. But suppose a child&rsquo;s parents practiced a way that prevented the child from having any kind of movement or function for twenty years. Because the child&rsquo;s walking ability had not been developed, he would not be able to walk. In Christianity, after a person&rsquo;s new birth in Christ, his regeneration, he is put into a situation where he is prevented from functioning in a normal way. The newborn ones have hardly any way to exercise their spiritual eyes, ears, nose, or feet. They have hardly any way to develop any kind of organic ability or function.</p>
<p>By our spiritual birth we have many divine, organic functions. But after we were regenerated, we were put into an environment in which our functions were being annulled. This annulling goes on under the best pretense, a pretense of feeding, teaching, edifying, perfecting, and helping people to grow. But these so-called feedings and teachings are doing a unique work to annul the members of Christ. The situation in Christianity is one of little development of the abilities or functions of the saints. Instead there is the annulling.</p>
<p>In all the local churches, we have to reconsider our way. It is easy, in a sense, to keep people by having a big meeting with a good speaker. But for the long run, all the seeking ones will grow tired of listening to the same kind of messages year after year. In the beginning, the new ones may be happy with the new and better terms we use in the recovery, such as <em>dispensation, dispensing,</em> and <em>transformation,</em> but after listening to messages from a brother for six months, they will become bored.</p>
<p>Certain co-workers and elders have been assigned in the past to take care of giving a message in the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting. For many of them Saturday was a &ldquo;sad day&rdquo; because they had to prepare for their sharing the next day. The new way releases the brothers from this kind of suffering and releases the saints to develop their organic ability and function. In the old way there is not much enlivening or developing. Instead there is much deadening and annulling. The proper meeting must bear the particular characteristic that it develops the saints&rsquo; ability. After meeting in the proper way for half a year, one will have much ability to speak, to preach, to pray for others, to touch people&rsquo;s hearts, and to get them fully saved. The new way will enable all the saints to be the real ministers, the ministers of the new covenant.</p>
<p>In certain ways, the sisters are more skillful than the brothers. If their abilities are annulled, this will be a great loss to the church. In the sisters, there is a great spiritual, divine, asset. We must develop that asset. The sisters must be free to function. In this sense, they need to be emancipated. In the Recovery Version, I pointed out in note 1<sup>1</sup> of John 12 that in the house in Bethany, as an early figure of the model church, there were more sisters than brothers (vv. 2-3). In a typical church, there are more sisters than brothers, and the sisters should be free to function. Let Martha be Martha. Let Mary be Mary. If the sisters are very active, you will have a living church.</p><h2 class="head1">FITTING THE LIVING BELIEVERS&rsquo; TASTE</h2>
<p>The third characteristic of the proper Christian meeting is that it fits the living believers&rsquo; taste. We all have different opinions and different views. But our opinions and views mean little; taste means everything. Do not argue whether something is sweet or bitter; just taste it. If it is sweet, it is sweet to your taste. Little children may not know the words <em>bitter</em> or <em>sweet,</em> but they have a taste. If you put something bitter into their mouths, they will spit it out. If you put a piece of candy into their mouths and tell them it is not good for them, they will still eat it because of the sweet taste. Some have come to our meetings full of criticism. According to their thinking, tradition, education, and knowledge, they had a critical opinion and view, but within their spirit there was a taste. While they were criticizing, the taste within told them that this meeting was right&mdash;life was here, the Lord&rsquo;s presence was here, the Lord&rsquo;s move was here, and the Lord&rsquo;s anointing was here. According to their educated mind, they would not take this kind of meeting, but their inner taste liked it. A number of the saints came into the recovery against their mind, their view, their education, and their philosophy just because of their inner taste. What convinces people is their inner taste. Our meetings must bear the characteristic of fitting the living believers&rsquo; taste. This characteristic impresses, convinces, and touches people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RENOUNCING &ldquo;THE CUSTOMS OF THE NATIONS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Christian meeting according to God&rsquo;s ordained way renounces &ldquo;the customs of the nations&rdquo; (2 Kings 17:8&mdash;NASB). When we practice a church meeting altogether according to the God-ordained way, there is nothing natural; thus, nothing is according to the customs, the habits, of the Gentiles. The word <em>nations</em> refers to the Gentiles, and their customs are their habits or practices. In our meetings, we should not give people the impression that we have anything natural, anything as a habit, practice, or custom of the unbelievers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Another expression that we must bear is that the ultimate goal in our church meetings is the building up of the Body of Christ. We need to realize the real meaning of this phrase&mdash; &ldquo;the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; Whatever we do must issue in the building up of the Body of Christ, not merely in the building up of the local church in our locality. If we are merely building up a local church in our locality, that is not the building up of the Body of Christ but the building up of a local sect. What is the proof, the evidence, the sign, that our meeting is building up the Body of Christ? If our meeting builds up the Body of Christ, the saints who have been meeting with us for a while will be able to go to any locality and attend the meeting of any local church with no problem. They will have no problem because they are not only local but also universal.</p>
<p>When people go to another country and learn another language, it is hard for them to get rid of their native accent. Those of us from countries outside the United States may all speak English, but we speak it with different accents. We must endeavor to speak our common, universal &ldquo;language&rdquo; in the Body with no local &ldquo;accent.&rdquo; I have seen brothers visit other localities and give the saints the particular accent of their locality. Such a local accent is strong proof that the church does not meet absolutely for the building up of the Body of Christ. Rather, this so-called local church bears some sign of a local sect. A local sect is a so-called local church which is not universal but merely local. If we are simply local, we become a local sect, a local division, not the local expression of the universal Body of Christ. A local church must be a local expression of the unique, universal Body of Christ.</p>
<p>None of us in the churches should bear our local accent. We need to renounce any local accent. We may have been saved in a certain locality and raised as a Christian there for years. How can we stay away from the accent of that locality? This depends upon whether we insist upon our local accent or we renounce it, whether we impose what we are in on others or we sympathize with others, not imposing anything on them. Some may say that they have a Body-consciousness and that they are for the Body. But their kind of body may be somewhat different from the Body revealed in the Bible. The Body revealed in the Bible is universal. Their kind of body may be just the small group in their locality. Actually speaking, that is not the Body, but a restricted, local sect. We must remember that the meeting we desire to practice is one that really builds up the universal Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS<br />
FOR THE GOSPEL VISITATION</h1>
<p>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 12:2; Matt. 28:19; Phil. 1:21</p>
<p>I am very burdened that we see the absolute requirements for the gospel visitation. When we hear the term <em>door-knocking,</em> we may think of some activity without gravity. Actually, however, preaching the gospel by visiting people is a very respectable matter. Thus, we have to practice our gospel visitation in a way that is full of respect and that is according to some absolute requirements.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ONE WITH CHRIST AND<br />
IN THE ORGANIC UNION WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>If we want to go out to preach the gospel by visiting people through knocking on doors, we must be one with Christ. In 2 Corinthians 12:2 Paul told us that he was a man in Christ, and in Philippians 3:9 he aspired to be found in Christ. He wanted to remain in Christ all the time, doing things in Christ, acting in Christ, and living in Christ. In other words, he wanted to be one with Christ that people might see him in Christ, find him in Christ, and meet him in Christ. He was a person altogether in Christ and one with Christ. To go out to visit people for the gospel preaching, we need to be persons who are one with Christ and in the organic union with the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). We have been baptized into the Triune God, and we have to remain in the organic union with this Triune God. As long as we are persons in Christ and in the organic union with the Triune God, we are qualified to visit people for gospel preaching.</p>
<p>When we go out to visit people for gospel preaching, we are authorized as the representatives of Christ. A nation or a country authorizes ambassadors to represent it in their dealings with other countries. These ambassadors must be persons of regard, full of gravity, commanding people&rsquo;s respect. We should not go out to visit people in a common, ordinary, loose, or light way. We have to go out as the Lord&rsquo;s authorized representatives. We must be the ambassadors of Christ (2 Cor. 5:20), representing Him to go out to visit people and bring Him to people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING CHRIST IN THE DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>To be persons who are always one with Christ and in the organic union with the Triune God, we need to live Christ in our daily life (Phil. 1:21). We need to make Christ our daily living. In Philippians 1:21, Paul said, &ldquo;To me to live is Christ.&rdquo; We all have to say this and practice this. Day by day, we need to live Christ. Christ is not only our life but also our living. Since He is our life, He has to be our living. If we live Him, we will spontaneously represent Him and have the proper gravity that will cause people to regard and respect us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING INTO THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE<br />
OF BEING ONE WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must also pray ourselves into the practical experience of being one with Christ (Acts 4:24-31). Regardless of how much we have been living in Christ, we are still in the old creation. Our flesh still exists, and our natural man still lives. As we are living on this earth, there are many factors that cause us to be distracted away from Christ. Because many factors in our daily life, in our family, in our home, in our place of business, in our school, or elsewhere unconsciously distract us from Christ, we need to pray. This was the reason that the Lord Jesus charged us to watch and pray (Matt. 26:41; Eph. 6:18; Col. 4:2). To watch and pray is to preserve ourselves in Christ. We need to be watchful that we are not out of Christ and pray that we would be brought back to Christ. Prayer always either keeps us in Christ or brings us back to Christ. We have to pray ourselves into the practical experience of being one with Christ because we might be distracted from Christ and not be in Christ in our experience.</p>
<p>According to the spiritual and divine fact, we are in Christ all the time. But according to our daily, practical experience, quite often we are not in Christ. Then we have to pray ourselves into Christ again. Prayer brings us into Christ and into the practical experience of being one with Christ. We need this kind of practical experience. Many times we have the sensation that we are not in Christ in our experience. Our talk, our doing, and even our purchasing of certain things prove that we are not practically in Christ. Positionally we are in Christ, but experientially we may not be in Christ. Therefore, we must pray to preserve ourselves in Christ and also pray ourselves back to Christ when we are away from Him. Before going out to visit people for the gospel, we must spend at least twenty minutes in prayer with the Lord to get ourselves back to Christ. Then we will go out for the gospel visitation one with Christ, and we will go out in Christ.</p>
<p>Acts 4:24-31 is an account of how the believers in the early church prayed themselves into Christ. The disciples with the apostles in Jerusalem, being under the persecution and threat of the Jewish leaders, prayed together. No doubt, their prayer kept them in Christ. As they were praying, they were all filled with the Spirit outwardly, once more experiencing the outpoured Spirit. As a result, they had the boldness to speak the word of God and even to testify to the very Jewish leaders who were persecuting them (Acts 5:28-33).</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYING TO HAVE A REAL BURDEN<br />
FOR THE SINNERS&rsquo; SALVATION</h2>
<p>We also need to pray to have a real burden for the sinners&rsquo; salvation. In 1 Timothy 2, Paul exhorts us to pray on behalf of all men (v. 1) because God our Savior desires all men to be saved (v. 4). God&rsquo;s desire requires our prayer for it to be carried out. In Romans 10:1, Paul said concerning the Jews, &ldquo;The delight of my heart and my supplication to God for them is for their salvation.&rdquo; Like Paul, the delight of our heart needs to be the salvation of men because this is the delight of God&rsquo;s heart (Luke 15:6-7, 9-10, 23-24). We need to pray to the Lord that His concern for sinners&rsquo; salvation would be dispensed into us to become our burden.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VISITING PEOPLE WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>We also must be those who visit people with Christ (Acts 10:24, 34-44). We must have the assurance and the confidence that we are going out to visit people for the gospel&rsquo;s sake with Christ and that Christ is going with us. We should not go to visit people on our own or by ourselves. We must visit others by Christ, who is going with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING AND CONVINCING PEOPLE<br />
THAT CHRIST MIGHT BE IMPARTED INTO THEM</h2>
<p>In our gospel visitation, we must contact and convince people with the goal of Christ being imparted into them (Acts 8:26-39). After contacting people, we need to convince them, and we cannot convince people with our own ordinary words. This is why we must pray, even while we are knocking on the doors. Then when people open their doors to us, they see us as persons in Christ, praying to Christ. At that juncture, some instant expression will come to us which we have to utter. This is the instant utterance, not the utterance prepared by us. Just as the letter kills (2 Cor. 3:6), the prepared and fixed utterance can kill. We must be open to the Lord for any kind of utterance.</p>
<p>You could say, &ldquo;I have come to bring the good news to you&rdquo;; &ldquo;I have come with Christ to visit you&rdquo;; &ldquo;I have come with God to see you&rdquo;; or &ldquo;Sir, I had a burden to come here to read the Bible with you.&rdquo; You do not need to repeat the same utterance all the time. Of course, under the anointing we may be led to repeat things as we speak to people. If you are under the anointing to repeat something to a person at a certain point, you have to repeat. You may need to repeat that man is a vessel created by God to contain Him. Quite often repetition is needed, but you should not always begin your talk with the same opening word. If you repeat the same opening word again and again in a mechanical way, you are like an actor and your visitation is a performance. You must be one with Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit. He is so living and so instant, and He can give you the instant utterance. The instant utterance given by Him will catch people. They will be so willing to open up themselves to you and to talk with you so that you can impart Christ into them.</p>
<p>A long talk with our new contact will kill him. We must open our talk immediately with an utterance that can impart Christ into him. We may tell this one that we have come with Christ to visit him, and we may go to a portion in <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> to show him that he is a vessel to contain Christ and that this very Christ is God Himself as the Spirit. We may tell him that this One, according to Romans 10, is here right now, even in his mouth and in his heart (v. 8). We can then direct him to receive the Lord by praying and calling on the name of the Lord Jesus (vv. 9-13). By speaking in this way, we put Christ into him. This way is quick, powerful, and full of impact. People can receive Christ in this way within five minutes.</p>
<p>The Spirit goes with us when we visit people for the gospel, He contacts people with us, and He enters into the homes with us. While we are contacting people, the Spirit of our Christ is waiting for the opportunity to get into them. When people pray with a sincere heart, they spontaneously exercise and open up their spirit. The Spirit is waiting for the time when someone will call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; This is the time that the waiting Spirit can get into someone&rsquo;s open spirit. In this instant, regeneration transpires (John 3:6). It does not take long for a person to be regenerated. Too much talk will close a person&rsquo;s spirit. Good salesmen are trained not to speak their own words but to speak what they have been trained to speak. At a certain point, they stop talking and close the deal.</p>
<p>Some may disagree with this way, saying that we must visit and speak with an unbeliever several times before he is ready for regeneration and that we must wait until we are certain that he is regenerated before baptizing him. In the past, the saints used to bring new ones to the leading ones of the church for them to discern whether or not they were regenerated and ready for baptism. If a candidate could not pass this interview, he would have to be comforted and encouraged so that he would not be disappointed. The one who brought him to the Lord might tell him, &ldquo;I will help you learn more from the Bible about salvation to prepare you. The church will probably have another baptism in three weeks and that will not be too late for you to come back. By that time you will be able to pass the elders&rsquo; test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, however, there is not one instance where a believer is asked to wait for a time before he can be baptized. The Scriptures show us that once a person believes, he should be baptized immediately. On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were baptized directly after believing (Acts 2:38, 41). The Ethiopian eunuch was baptized immediately after Philip realized that he had believed (Acts 8:38). After Philip had a short talk with this eunuch, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, &ldquo;Look, water! What prevents me from being baptized?&rdquo; Philip did not tell the eunuch to wait, but he immediately baptized him. Soon after the Apostle Paul had met the Lord on the road to Damascus, Ananias told him, &ldquo;Why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized...&rdquo; (Acts 22:16). There should not be a gap between believing and being baptized. Believing and being baptized are two parts of one complete step for salvation (Mark 16:16).</p>
<p>Brother Nee told me of the case of a young man who had believed in the Lord Jesus and was getting ready to come to the United States to study. Brother Nee was burdened that this young man be baptized before leaving China, so he referred this case to another co-worker. After this co-worker contacted the young believer, he told Brother Nee that it was too early to baptize him. Brother Nee told the co-worker that this young man was going to America to study, so there was no time to wait. The co-worker still insisted that it was too early to baptize him. Then Brother Nee said that if the baptism was wrong, he himself would bear the responsibility, but this co-worker still insisted that it was necessary to wait. Eventually, Brother Nee had no way to baptize this young believer. This concept of a waiting time between believing and being baptized is unscriptural. Today&rsquo;s Christianity, in general, does not practice baptizing people immediately after they believe, but we must take the biblical way. According to the Bible, anyone who believes in the Lord should be baptized immediately.</p>
<p>The Philippian jailer and his entire household were baptized by Paul and Silas immediately after they believed in the Lord Jesus (Acts 16:30-34). This baptism of the jailer and his family must have been in the bathing pool of the place where they were. Acts 16 tells us that after he and his household were baptized, &ldquo;he brought them up into his house&rdquo; (v. 34). According to the word &ldquo;up&rdquo; in verse 34, this bathing pool must have been in the basement. This shows that the baptisms of the early believers were without regulations and rituals, but they did what was convenient according to where they were. Under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty, there were homes in the ancient times that had such bathing facilities that could also be used as a baptistry. In today&rsquo;s modern age in the United States, it is even more convenient for us to baptize the new believers immediately since nearly every home has a bathtub and running water. This surely is scriptural. However, we should not baptize people in a light way; we must do it with much regard and much reverence.</p><h2 class="head1">BAPTIZING PEOPLE INTO THE TRIUNE GOD&mdash;<br />
INTO THE ORGANIC UNION WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>In order to baptize people into the Triune God, we must have the impact. We must baptize others with much assurance and confidence that we are not merely putting them into the water but that we are putting them into the Triune God. The water represents, signifies, symbolizes, the Triune God. According to Matthew 28:19, to baptize people into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit means to put them into the organic union with the Triune God (see notes 19<sup>4</sup> and 19<sup>5</sup> on this verse in the Recovery Version).</p>
<h2 class="head1">REQUIRING THE LORD TO GO AND ACT WITH YOU</h2>
<p>When you go out to visit people for the gospel, you must require the Lord to go and act with you (Matt. 28:20b; Mark 16:20). You must tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You have to go and act with me. If You do not give me the assurance that You are going with me and taking action with me, I will not go.&rdquo; You need to learn to pray yourself into this kind of assurance. Otherwise, you should not go. Even to have two or three gospel companions with you is not adequate. You must have the Lord Jesus. You must have the assurance that He is going with you. Then you will be able to tell people, &ldquo;I have come with Christ to visit you.&rdquo; When you say this to people, you will not speak it in a light way, but you will really mean business because you have the assurance that Christ is with you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT TAKING THIS KIND OF GOSPEL VISITATION<br />
AS AN EASY MATTER AND<br />
AVOIDING ANY KIND OF LIGHTNESS</h2>
<p>Finally, you must not take this kind of gospel visitation as an easy matter, and you must avoid any kind of lightness (1 Thes. 2:1-4, 7-12). You must be a person full of gravity who attracts not only people&rsquo;s attention but also their respect. Even if you are a young person speaking to an elderly professor, you must show him your gravity. Do not go out in an easy or light way. You must go out with Christ and with much gravity.</p>
<p>We should try our best to build up a habit of visiting people by knocking on their doors for gospel preaching. We need to practice it in a proper way according to the nine items presented in this chapter. Then we will be fully equipped and qualified to visit people for the gospel. I hope that such a habit will be built up in every church. If we will practice the principle of one-fourth of the saints in the church going out and the other three-fourths praying and supporting, I believe that it is possible for us to have an increase of one hundred percent every year.</p>
<p>While we are knocking on people&rsquo;s doors for the preaching of the gospel, we also have to endeavor to have proper meetings. Through the proper meetings, the new ones that we gain will be kept. If we bring them to the Lord and do not have the proper meetings to preserve and keep them, they will be lost. We need proper home meetings and group meetings to keep the new believers. Three things are basic and crucial: to visit people, to set up home meetings, and to have group meetings. Out of the visiting of people will come the home meetings, out of the home meetings will come the group meetings, and out of the group meetings will come the larger church meetings. By this way, we can build up the local church for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">LIFE AND FRUIT-BEARING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:1-8, 16; 12:24, 28</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the matters of life and fruit-bearing in John 15. We need to be brought into a full realization that today we all are the branches of the divine, true vine (v. 5). In order to see the intention of the Lord&rsquo;s speaking in John 15, we have to realize that the section from John 12:12 through John 17 is one section on the multiplication of Christ. Many readers of the Bible have never seen this secret of understanding this section. The crucial and controlling verse in this section is John 12:24. The Lord Jesus likened Himself to a grain of wheat that falls into the earth and dies. This one grain then becomes many grains, which are the multiplication of that one grain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUE VINE BEING A MATTER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The subject of John 15 is still the multiplication of Christ. Christ is the vine tree, and this very Christ needs to be multiplied. This tree multiplies by the branches of the tree bearing fruit (vv. 1, 5). The vine tree is like the one grain of wheat and its fruit is like the many grains. For the one grain to be multiplied into many grains, there is the need of the dispensing of the very life of that one grain into many grains. In the same principle, for the vine tree to be multiplied, there is the need of the dispensing of the very life of the tree into the fruit. The true vine is a matter of life (John 15:1, 4, 6). The vine tree is the organism of the Triune God with the divine life for the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity. The true vine dispenses the very Triune God into all the fruit.</p>
<p>Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God (Col. 2:9), and the very organism of the Triune God. An organism, of course, is something organic and living. It is the opposite of a dead organization. Our human body is something living and something organic, so it is an organism. Because our body is an organism, it functions in many ways. Our body functions to contain us, express us, and take action for us. We could not move, act, or have any kind of activity without our body. In like manner, the organism of the Triune God, which is His very embodiment, Christ Himself, functions to contain the Triune God. The very Triune God is here in this organism, in this vine tree. Furthermore, this organism expresses the Triune God and is the means by which and through which the Triune God can act and move.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRANCHES OF THE TRUE VINE<br />
BEING FOR FRUIT-BEARING</h2>
<p>John 15 presents a full picture of the organism of the Triune God. How good, how miraculous, how wonderful, and how excellent it is that we all are a part of this organism! Christ is here as this organism, and we are included in this organism. He is the tree, and we are the branches. As far as we, the branches, are concerned, the tree lives to be our support, our supply, and our everything. The tree in its entirety is not for itself but for the branches. Also, the tree does everything through the branches. The tree needs the branches. It cannot do anything apart from the branches. Today Christ as the very embodiment of the Triune God can do nothing without us. Without us Christ is unable to act, to work, or to have any kind of activity.</p>
<p>The Triune God is in the tree, and the tree is within the branches. Where is the Triune God today? The Triune God today is in Christ, and this very Christ is the vine tree. Where is Christ, the vine tree? He is within the branches. Without the branches, the tree cannot express itself or do anything. In John 15:5 the Lord says, &ldquo;Apart from Me you can do nothing.&rdquo; As the branches of Christ, we can say the same thing to Him. Without Him, we can do nothing, and without us, He can do nothing. We surely need Him, and He surely needs us. The branches need the tree, and the tree needs the branches for what purpose? It is not only for the purpose of our enjoying the wonderful, excellent, and marvelous divine life. Eventually, the purpose of this divine organism is fruit-bearing. Fruit-bearing is the multiplication and the enlargement of this divine tree, the divine organism of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>We all have to be the fruitful branches of this vine tree. Fruit-bearing is the unique and particular characteristic of all the branches of the divine organism. All of us need a new start, a new turn, so we all have to consecrate ourselves anew. We all need a renewed consecration for the purpose of fruit-bearing. Suppose a branch of a vine tree only bears one piece of fruit. This branch will not look very nice because the branches of a vine tree should bear clusters of fruit. As branches of Christ, we have to bear clusters of fruit.</p>
<p>The branches of the true vine are for fruit-bearing (John 15:5), and the purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s choosing of the branches is for fruit-bearing (v. 16a). A vine tree has branches for the unique purpose of bearing fruit. A pine tree is good for building material and good as fuel for burning, but not a vine tree. A vine tree is good for only one purpose&mdash;the purpose of bearing fruit. We have been chosen as the branches of Christ for the unique purpose of bearing fruit. Many of us have to admit, however, that instead of bearing fruit, we have been barren for years. This is why I was compelled to study our situation. I realized that we had to find a way to bear fruit.</p>
<p>We need to abide in the vine to receive the life supply for fruit-bearing. The Lord chose us for fruit-bearing, and our abiding in Him is also for fruit-bearing. First we receive the life supply by abiding in Him. Then we will grow with this life supply to produce fruit. The branches of the vine bear fruit for the glorification of the Father&mdash;for the multiplication of the Father in the Son (John 15:8; 12:24, 28). In John 15:8 the Lord said, &ldquo;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.&rdquo; Glorification means multiplication. A single grain of wheat by itself has no glory. But when it dies in the earth, grows up, and bears many grains, these many grains are the one grain&rsquo;s glory, the glorification of the one grain. This glorification is the multiplication and expression of the one grain.</p>
<p>At one time, Christ was the only grain. But He, as the one grain, passed through death and entered into resurrection. In resurrection, He was multiplied. The death and resurrection of the one grain issued in many grains. When Christ was resurrected, we all were resurrected in Him and with Him (Eph. 2:6; 1 Pet. 1:3). It was not only the individual Christ who was resurrected, but a corporate Christ with His many members. Before the grain is sown into the earth and dies, it is alone. But when this one grain grows up from the earth, it bears fruit and becomes many grains. The many grains are Christ&rsquo;s multiplication as His glorification. We believers are the many grains as Christ&rsquo;s multiplication and His glorification.</p>
<p>When the Lord was walking in Judea and working in Jerusalem, He was the only grain of wheat. But after His resurrection and through His propagation, we are here as His glorification, which is His multiplication. We are the multiplication of that unique grain. Christ is glorified in His multiplication, and we together with all the believers on this earth are His multiplication.</p>
<p>The glorification of the Father is the multiplication of the Father in the Son. For this purpose the Father prunes the branches. His pruning is for the fruit-bearing of the branches (John 15:2). When we are praying and making a thorough confession, that confession is the practical and actual pruning. The more we confess to God the Father, the more we will get pruned. Have we ever realized that our confession of sins is a pruning? God the Father prunes us by showing us all our defects, failures, and wrongdoings, that we may make a thorough confession to Him. Through this thorough confession, we are cleansed from our defects, imperfections, defeats, failures, wrongdoings, mistakes, and sinfulness.</p>
<p>Many Christians only realize that God prunes us by chastising us. I am not saying that this is wrong, but God does not prune us mainly by chastising us. Whenever we make a thorough confession, we have the sensation that we are so clean and cleared up from many negative things. The Father shines over us and exposes our defects and sinfulness under His divine light. Our confession of everything exposed through His divine light is our cooperation with the Father&rsquo;s pruning.</p>
<p>Suppose that you, as a branch of Christ, go out to visit people without having a thorough confession, without the pruning. Then it will be hard for you to bear much fruit. This is why we all need to make a thorough confession, which is our cooperation with the Father&rsquo;s pruning. We need to be pruned daily, time after time. Just as we wash our hands many times throughout the day, we need to be pruned many times. To be pruned is to be washed. From morning to evening, we need to make confessions again and again. Every confession is a washing, and every washing is a pruning. The word &ldquo;prunes&rdquo; in John 15:2 is literally translated &ldquo;cleanses.&rdquo; As branches, when we are pruned, we are washed and cleansed through our confession according to God&rsquo;s exposing. When we come to Him, we are exposed under His light because He is light (1 John 1:5). Our confession accomplishes or completes the Father&rsquo;s pruning. Then we become clean, new, and fresh, and it is so easy for us as a clean, new, and fresh branch to bear fruit.</p>
<p>The danger of not bearing fruit is to be cut off from the enjoyment of the vine (John 15:2a). The Lord says clearly that if we are branches not bearing fruit, we are in danger of being cut off from the vine tree. This does not mean that we will suffer eternal perdition. To be cut off from Christ here is to be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. As the branches abide in the vine tree, they enjoy its life supply. If a branch is cut off from the vine tree, it is cut off from enjoying the riches of the vine tree. When we are barren, not bearing fruit, we have the sensation that we are not enjoying Christ that much. There is hardly any enjoyment of Christ. This indicates that we have been cut off from the vine tree. I have received many letters telling me that visiting people for the gospel not only saved sinners but also revived the visiting ones. This means that visiting people for the gospel by knocking on their doors revives our enjoyment of the rich Christ. Many saints have testified that going out to visit people in this way revived them to contact Christ, enjoy Christ, and absorb all the riches out from Him. This is the recovery of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ for bearing fruit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FRUIT BORNE BY THE BRANCHES</h2>
<p>Some teach that the fruit borne by the branches is ethical virtues such as love, longsuffering, kindness, etc., as mentioned in Galatians 5:22-23. But the fruit in John 15 is not our good conduct, or behavior. The fruit borne by the branches does not denote moral virtues as in Galatians 5:22-23, but denotes the saved persons regenerated with the divine life through the dispensing of the branches (John 15:16b). This is proved by the requirement that the bearer of this kind of fruit should &ldquo;go forth.&rdquo; To bear ethical and moral virtues as fruit does not require us to go forth. We do not need to go forth to bear the fruit of love, longsuffering, kindness, etc. But to bear fruit as persons regenerated through our dispensing of the divine life requires us to go forth. We need to go forth to contact and reach the people who will become our fruit.</p>
<p>The fact that this kind of fruit should &ldquo;remain&rdquo; also proves that the fruit in John 15 denotes saved persons. If the fruit that we bear are virtues, there would be no need to mention that these virtues should remain. But the Lord Jesus clearly says that we should go forth to bear fruit and that our fruit should remain. This proves that the fruit here is not moral virtues but persons. In the past we may have borne some fruit, but they did not remain. Immediately after a new child is delivered, he needs to be properly taken care of. Otherwise, he will not remain. Thus, immediately after we baptize people, we need to set up a home meeting with them; this meeting will be the very channel, instrument, or means for us to keep these new ones as remaining fruit. Now we have a way to keep our fruit. The home meeting is a way to keep them, to hold them, that they could remain. This requires much labor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PATHWAY FOR FRUIT-BEARING</h2>
<p>The pathway for fruit-bearing is to abide in the vine (John 15:5), that is, to remain in the very organic union with Christ, receiving the Father&rsquo;s pruning (v. 2b). We have to remain in this union as persons always living Him. We have seen that the Father&rsquo;s pruning implies His exposing through His divine shining. When we confess our defects, shortcomings, and wrongdoings to Him in His light, we are cooperating with Him to get this pruning completed, finished, accomplished.</p>
<p>This pathway also includes having the words of the Lord abiding within us (John 15:7). &ldquo;Words&rdquo; in verse 7 in Greek is <em>rhema</em> which refers to the Lord&rsquo;s instant words, not the constant word. When we are in the divine fellowship, enjoying the divine exposing, and we cooperate with this divine exposing by our confessing, we are receiving the very Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God and as the instant word. When we are in this kind of fellowship, we have the sensation of a speaking, an oracle, going on within us. When we are cut off from the enjoyment of Christ, we do not have this speaking in us. We are empty within. But when we are in the divine fellowship under the divine shining and are confessing to cooperate with this shining, something in us begins to speak all the time. In big things, in small things, and in everything, there is a speaking in us. That speaking is the divine <em>rhema,</em> which is Christ Himself. If we have the speaking word, we have Christ.</p>
<p>When we take two verses in the morning to have a good time with the Lord and enter into the enjoyment of Him through the Word, the whole day we will have Someone speaking in us. This Someone is Christ as the instant word, and this instant word, this oracle, is the very presence of the Triune God. The Triune God is a Person, and He is not only the spoken word but also the speaking word in us. This speaking One bothers us when we go against Him. We may like to go somewhere, but within us there is a &ldquo;no.&rdquo; This speaking, this word, is the living One, the presence of the Triune God, warning us not to go. We have to renew this speaking in us every day by picking up two verses early in the morning to enjoy the Lord. We must have the divine speaking in us all day and every day in our Christian life. This speaking is the oracle; this oracle is the word; this word is Christ; this Christ is the Triune God; and this Triune God is the very presence of the divine Person.</p>
<p>The pathway to fruit-bearing also includes praying for fruit-bearing (John 15:7b). If we practice the principles in this chapter, we will be very fruitful. We will bear cluster after cluster of &ldquo;grapes.&rdquo; We need to aspire to be a part of the building up of such a practice in our local church. We need to reconsecrate ourselves to the Lord in a thorough way, presenting ourselves to Him as His branches to build up the practice of fruit-bearing in the local churches.</p>
<p>In the universe, the Son of the Trinity is the organism of the Triune God, and this organism is the expression of the Triune God. The way for this organism to express the Triune God is through its many branches. We are the branches of the organism of the Triune God. The function and the purpose of the branches is to bear fruit. Fruit-bearing is the multiplication of the divine organism. The multiplication is the glorification of the source of the divine Trinity, the Father, and this glorification is the very expression of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Life and fruit-bearing both need to be emphasized. Some stress life to the uttermost, but life without fruit-bearing is empty. Life operates, lives, moves, acts, and works to produce fruit. Life is for the reproduction, for the multiplication, for the glorification, for the expression of the source of life, the Father. This is why there is the need of fruit-bearing. Others stress work and activity such as going to the mission field with not much life. Thus, what is done is mostly activity alone and not fruit-bearing. We need both life and fruit-bearing.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
BY VISITING PEOPLE TO BEAR FRUIT AND<br />
HAVING HOME MEETINGS TO HAVE OUR FRUIT REMAIN</h2>
<p>The first step we should take is to preach the gospel for the bearing of fruit. According to the Bible, history, and our own experiences, the best way to preach the gospel is to visit people. We should not stay at home or in the hall and invite people to come. This is not the God-ordained way. God did not stay in the heavens and invite the sinners to come to Him. Rather, He came down to the very spot where the sinners were. God came to Adam and said, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; That was God&rsquo;s visitation to Adam. That was God&rsquo;s door-knocking. God came to knock on the door of Adam&rsquo;s heart. Then the Lord Jesus was incarnated to come to man, even to come within man. He went to Jericho purposely to visit that great sinner, Zaccheus (Luke 19:1-10). He also went to Samaria to wait for a sinful woman to come to Jacob&rsquo;s well (John 4:1-42). He sent the twelve to visit people (Luke 9:1-6). Then He sent seventy to visit people (Luke 10:1-9). They were instructed to enter into people&rsquo;s homes and stay with them to find out whether or not they were sons of peace.</p>
<p>To preach the gospel we have to go to visit people in their homes. In order to visit them in their homes, surely there is the need to knock on their doors. Some may think that this is too much activity and that we must come back to life. We have been emphasizing life again and again for years, but we bore very little fruit. Barrenness has been prevailing among us. I am fully disgusted with the barrenness.</p>
<p>I would like to help all the saints to bear remaining fruit. The Lord chose us that we might go forth and bear fruit and that our fruit might remain. For us to bear fruit, we have to go to visit people in their homes. For the fruit to remain, we have to set up home meetings. Only home meetings can help the new ones to remain. The best way to bear fruit is to knock on people&rsquo;s doors, and the best way for the fruit to remain is to have home meetings. This is for the multiplication of Christ, which is the glorification of the Father, and this glorification of the Father is the very expression of the Triune God. The scriptural way to meet and to serve is for this expression.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE GROWTH IN LIFE<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading; Eph. 4:12-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH IN LIFE FOR FRUIT-BEARING</h2>
<p>In the last chapter, we saw the matters of life and fruit-bearing. In this chapter, we want to see the growth in life for the building up of the Body of Christ. For the branches of the vine to bear fruit, there is the need of the growth in life. If life does not grow, it can do nothing. The bearing of fruit does not require life alone; it requires the growth in life. We all must grow that we may bear fruit.</p>
<p>Without the Father&rsquo;s pruning, or cleansing, it would be hard for us to grow in the divine life. Daily and time after time, we have to cooperate with the Father&rsquo;s cleansing by praying and making a thorough confession to be fully cleansed by Him. Then we will have the growth in life. If we do not pray, receive the exposing from the Father&rsquo;s light, cooperate with the Father&rsquo;s shining, and make a thorough confession of all our failures, we will be at a standstill in our growth in life. But whenever we confess our sins thoroughly, that confession brings in the growth.</p>
<p>When we say growth in life, we mean the growth in the divine life, not in the natural life. The growth in the divine life is the addition of God&rsquo;s very being into us. God&rsquo;s being, God&rsquo;s essence, God&rsquo;s element, must be added into our being. We need God added into us day by day. I have been a Christian for about sixty-three years. Throughout all these years, God has been added into me, and today I have much more of God than I did sixty-three years ago. In our experience, the addition of God into our being may have stopped for a while. When we became aware that this addition had stopped, we confessed to the Lord. This means that we were once more under God&rsquo;s shining, and by His mercy and grace, we cooperated with this divine shining by confessing. Then the addition of God, the increase of God (Col. 2:19), resumed again. After another period of time, this addition may have been frustrated again. Then God was merciful to us by shining over us and touching us to make a thorough confession, and the addition of God into our being began again. Through this ongoing addition, many of us can testify that we have much more of God today than we had when we were first saved. The growth in the divine life is God being added into our being. Then we bear fruit by this growth. We bear fruit by God being added into us daily.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FRUIT-BEARING FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Fruit-bearing eventually issues in the building up of the Body of Christ. In the last chapter, we saw that fruit-bearing is for the multiplication of Christ, the multiplication of Christ is for the glorification of the Father, and the glorification of the Father is for the expression of the Triune God. Eventually, the Body of Christ is this expression. Ephesians 1:22-23 says that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. The fullness is the expression. A glass may be full of water, and we may say it has the &ldquo;riches of water,&rdquo; but the &ldquo;fullness of the water&rdquo; is when the water fills the cup to the brim and overflows out of the cup. This fullness of the water is the expression of the water. The fullness is the expression of the riches. The Body of Christ is the fullness, the expression, of all that Christ is, the fullness of all the riches of Christ. Our fruit-bearing is for the expression of the Triune God, and this expression is the Body of Christ, which is the church.</p>
<p>Life is for fruit-bearing, but for life to bear fruit it needs to grow. The growth in life is God added into our being. The more that God is added into us, the more growth we will have; and the more growth we have, the more fruit we will bear. Growth in life and fruit-bearing are altogether for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH IN LIFE FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:12-16 speaks of the growth in life for the building up of the Body of Christ. We grow in life by fully knowing the Son of God (v. 13a). The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience. We should endeavor to know Christ as the Son of God by studying the New Testament.</p>
<p>Our growth in life is for arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (v. 13b). We need to understand the relationship of these four nouns in 4:13&mdash;the measure, the stature, the fullness, and Christ. The measure is of the stature, the stature is of the fullness, and the fullness is of Christ. A man&rsquo;s body is his fullness, his expression. Because we have a body, we all have a stature, and our stature has a measure. A man&rsquo;s body grows by his eating. It is through eating that the fullness of a man is enlarged. When the fullness, the body of a man, is enlarged, the stature of that fullness is also enlarged; furthermore, the measurement of the stature is increased. A man has a fullness, the fullness has a stature, and the stature has a measure. The fullness of Christ is simply the expression of Christ, and this expression is the very church, which is His Body. The church as the fullness, the expression, of Christ has a stature, and this stature has a measure. We have not arrived at this yet. We must endeavor to arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ by growing in the divine life, by having God added into our being all day long.</p>
<p>By holding to truth in love, we grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things (Eph. 4:15). Truth means reality. According to the context of Ephesians 4:15, &ldquo;truth&rdquo; refers to Christ and His Body, the church. In God&rsquo;s eyes, besides God Himself, only two things are realities: Christ and the church. We have to learn how to hold to Christ and the church in love. We love Christ, so we hold to Him. We love the church, so we hold to the church. By holding to Christ and the church in love, we grow up into Christ in all things.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 4:16, the growth in life is for the building up of the Body of Christ. In the building up of the Body of Christ, all the Body is fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply according to the operation in measure of each one part. Out from the Head, Christ, all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of the Body itself in love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE ITEMS CONCERNING<br />
BOTH THE GROWTH IN LIFE AND THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING CARRIED OUT<br />
MAINLY THROUGH THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The building up of the Body of Christ is mainly carried out in the meetings, through the meetings, and with the meetings. If we do not have the proper meetings, there is no possibility for the building up of the Body of Christ. Our meetings must be proper and up-to-date. Any meeting that is still according to the old way is below the level for the building up of the Body of Christ. I do not mean, however, that the old way of meeting did not accomplish anything. These meetings according to the old way did save and edify many people, but going along with this help, there was the annulling, the killing, and the binding of the members of Christ.</p>
<p>Christianity has brought in millions of believers, but most of them have been annulled in their function and made of no effect. Some in Christianity have even claimed that they are short of manpower to evangelize the world, but where are all the millions of believers that have been saved there? Their organic function was confiscated due to the wrong way of meeting. On the one hand, this wrong type of meeting accomplishes something, but on the other hand, it tears down what it builds up.</p>
<p>To some extent we have been doing the same thing. We have not had much increase, and today among the dear saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery not many are organically useful. Therefore, there is the need of some labor to have a transition. As today&rsquo;s church people, we are transit passengers. We are in transit from an old way of meeting and serving to a new, scriptural way. We have been Christians for years under the annulling of the old way of meeting. Many of us are so quiet and calm in the meetings. We have become dumb and disabled.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have been helped to sing the hymns, pray, and stand up to read Bible verses freely. These practices have kept us alive. When I first came to minister the Word in the United States, I still remember how quiet the attendants were when I walked into the meeting. Even though there were verses on the board, no one would read them. Everyone sat there, waiting for someone else to do everything for them. We were never enabled, taught, developed, or promoted to function in this way. I told the saints that they did not need to wait to read the verses but that they had the privilege, freedom, and ability to stand up and read them in a living way by ones, by twos, by rows, by groups, or by everyone at one time. Gradually we have learned not only to sing and to pray but also to read the verses in this way. But even today the reading of the Scriptures in the meetings is still not up to the standard. We should not read in such an orderly, formal, regulated, and mechanical way. We need to read livingly, not like robots.</p>
<p>Eventually, we began to have a time for the saints to share after each message. Through this many have learned how to speak a brief word, but not many can speak a word for the Lord full of spiritual significance for three to ten minutes. We may be able to shout &ldquo;O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; for a few seconds, but what about speaking a word full of spiritual significance? Many of us have never been perfected or helped to speak something for the Lord in this way. Why are we not able to speak a word for the Lord for one minute, although we have been Christians for years? This shows that our organic ability to speak for the Lord has been annulled in our being. It seems that many of us do not have a speaking organ. I do believe, however, that in two or three years, there will be a great improvement in the meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery because the saints will be enabled to speak a word for the Lord. All the items concerning both the growth in life and the building up of the Body of Christ are carried out mainly through the church meetings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE FULFILLMENT<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S WORDS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:20-22; 4:12-16; Matt. 24:35</h1>
<p>The fellowship in this chapter is mainly to remind us of what the Lord has spoken in a promising and prophetic way concerning building up the church as the dwelling place of God in Matthew 16:18 and Ephesians 2:20-22 and as the Body of Christ in Ephesians 4:12-16. There is the need of the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s words in the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;On this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; &ldquo;This rock&rdquo; does not refer to the Lord&rsquo;s person directly but to the revelation concerning the Lord&rsquo;s person. The revelation concerning the Lord&rsquo;s person is the very foundation, the very rock, on which the Lord is building up His church. This is for the dwelling place of God. In Ephesians 2:20-22 the Apostle Paul tells us that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Actually, this does not mean that the church is built upon the persons of the apostles and prophets but upon the revelation that the apostles and prophets have received of the Lord. Thus, both Matthew 16 and Ephesians 2 tell us that the building up of the church is based upon a revelation concerning Christ which is the foundation, or rock, for the building up of the church of Christ as the dwelling place of God.</p>
<p>The church as the dwelling place of God is built upon the revelation of Christ&rsquo;s divine person that the Father gave Peter (Matt. 16:16-18). Christ&rsquo;s person is mainly in two aspects, indicated by the titles &ldquo;the Christ&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Son of the living God&rdquo; in Matthew 16:16. In Matthew 16:16 Christ is mentioned in a definite and an emphatic way as &ldquo;the Christ.&rdquo; This refers to the very Christ prophesied of and promised in the Old Testament and expected by many seeking saints to come at the beginning of the New Testament age (see Luke 2:25, 36-38). &ldquo;The Christ&rdquo; refers to His commission that God has given Him and means &ldquo;the Anointed One.&rdquo; God appointed Him as the Anointed One, the One anointed by God with a definite commission to carry out. Thus, His designation as &ldquo;the Christ&rdquo; refers to His work, His ministry, and His commission to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. &ldquo;The Son of the living God&rdquo; refers purely and solely to the person of Christ, to the very essence and substance of Christ. In these two titles are Christ&rsquo;s person, Christ&rsquo;s very divine essence, and Christ&rsquo;s commission, Christ&rsquo;s ministry, Christ&rsquo;s work, to build up the church with His essence. Christ is the commissioned One to do a work for God, which is to build up the church with His very essence, the divine essence of God, as the building material.</p>
<p>The church as the dwelling place of God is also built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ as the cornerstone (Eph. 2:20). The revelation concerning Christ and the church was given at the beginning of the New Testament age to the apostles and prophets and mainly to the Apostles Paul, Peter, and John. The New Testament is composed mainly with the writings of these few prominent apostles and prophets, and their revelation is considered as the foundation upon which the church is built. In their revelation, the church is in two aspects: the universal aspect and the local aspect. In the universal sense, the church is the temple of God (Eph. 2:21). The church is the holy temple in the Lord, that is, in Christ universally. The entire church, not just in one place but in the whole universe, is the temple of God, which will be consummated in the New Jerusalem. The entire city of the New Jerusalem will be the temple of God, the consummation of God&rsquo;s dwelling place in this universe.</p>
<p>In the local sense, the church is built up as a dwelling place of God in our spirit (Eph. 2:22). This dwelling place is within the spirit of the believers. After being regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, our human spirit is now the very dwelling place of God. God today on this earth dwells in our spirit, making us a part of His house, which is the local church. God has the local church as His dwelling place in our spirit, and He has the universal church as His universal temple, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The church is a house to God, and at the same time, it is also a Body to Christ. We may know the term <em>the Body of Christ,</em> but we may not be clear in our understanding concerning the real significance of the Body of Christ. The church as the Body of Christ means much more than the church as the house of God. In the picture of the house of God, the house and the Dweller are two; the house is the dwelling place and the dweller is God. However, the church being the Body of Christ indicates that the Body is one with Christ in life and in nature. Actually, the Body and the Head are one complete person. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy has accomplished such a marvelous thing&mdash;to make all the believers parts of the one Christ. These parts have the same life and the same living that Christ has. Christ&rsquo;s life is their life, and Christ&rsquo;s living is their living. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy reaches to the extent of making all the believers of Christ the real and true parts of this one, big, universal, divine person. The Head and the Body are Christ, the Body is the church, and all the members of the church are the members of this organic Body.</p>
<p>It is difficult to have a thorough understanding of the Body of Christ because this matter is too mysterious, deep, spiritual, and divine. We have been made parts of Christ, members of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27; 6:15a). It is a divine reality that we have been mingled with Christ. In Philippians 1:21a Paul said, &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ.&rdquo; In Galatians 2:20 he said, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&rdquo; These verses indicate that we are mingled with Christ and even that we are becoming Christ. Christ is in us and Christ is becoming us.</p>
<p>In typology Adam and Eve are an excellent type (Gen. 2:21-24). Essentially, Eve was a rib of Adam, a part of Adam, that came out of Adam and was built up into a woman. When Eve was presented to Adam, he said, &ldquo;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh&rdquo; (v. 23). This signifies that the wife is a part of the husband, and the wife comes out of the husband. Thus, the wife is the husband, and the husband is the wife (Eph. 5:28). Neither the husband nor the wife is complete. Each is a half of one complete person. A husband and wife may be likened to two halves of a melon. When the two halves are put together, the melon is whole.</p>
<p>In one particular church meeting many years ago, an older brother arrived and one of the saints said, &ldquo;The first half is here, and the second half is coming.&rdquo; The first half, the husband, was in the meeting already, but the second half, the wife, was on the way. None of the married brothers and sisters should consider themselves as a whole. The wife and the husband need each other to be complete. The wife is the husband&rsquo;s completion. Without her, he is a half. Even the standing boards of the tabernacle were not a complete unit. Each board was one and a half cubits (Exo. 26:16). When the two boards were put together, there was a complete unit of three cubits. Even in the church life, each one of us is just half. We need another one to make us whole, to make us complete. Our relationship with Christ today is essential; it is altogether in the intrinsic, divine essence. He is the Head and we are His organic Body; He is our Husband, and we are His bride, His wife. He and we together are one complete person. This is a great mystery which we cannot understand to the fullest extent (Eph. 5:32).</p>
<p>The building up of the church as the Body of Christ is completed through the perfecting work of the gifted persons (Eph. 4:12). These gifted persons are of four categories&mdash;the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. They do not build the Body directly but indirectly by perfecting the saints. Although the early apostles and prophets who received the revelation of the New Testament are not here, we are still being perfected by them. Their revelation in their writings, especially the writings of the Apostle Paul, has done a lot of perfecting work throughout the generations. The fourteen Epistles of Paul are still perfecting us. Day by day we are under the perfecting of the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s writings. Through the perfecting work of the apostles and prophets, we are helped to realize that Christ and the church are the unique reality in this universe, and this is the truth that we have to hold to in love (Eph. 4:15a). We hold to the truth in love toward Christ and in love toward the church.</p>
<p>The building up of the church as the Body of Christ is by the members of the Body growing up into Christ, the Head, in all things (Eph. 4:15). We all need to grow up into Christ in a practical way in all things, such as the way we dress and the way we cut and comb our hair. In every way we have to grow into Christ. Our growth into Christ is a matter of levels. We may have been saved for three years and gradually during this time we have grown into Christ in a certain matter. Later we may grow into Christ in another matter, but still in many things we have not grown into Christ. We need to grow more and more. Merely to adjust the believers outwardly is not so good. A certain young brother may not be very nice to his mother, so we need to help him. But we should not forget that merely correcting him will not work. We must minister some amount of life, some amount of God, into him. When he receives more increase of God, he grows with this increase of God. Spontaneously he will have a change in his attitude toward his mother and a change in the way he treats his mother. This is not a change by outward correction but by inward transformation. I do not like to correct the saints, but I like to see the saints grow up into Christ in their relationships with their spouse, their children, their parents, their brothers in Christ, and with all men. If we are growing up into Christ, we are growing practically in all the detailed items of our daily life.</p>
<p>Among us there is one item in which it is hard to see the growth of the saints. This item is gossip. Regardless of how old or experienced in Christ the saints may be, very few of them have grown into Christ in the matter of gossip. Most of us just like to talk about others. We may think that to gossip in bad things is not right but to talk about good things is all right. We may differentiate our speaking into these two categories. But in God&rsquo;s sight, whenever we speak something that is not necessary, whether it is good or bad, that is gossiping. The biblical term for gossip is &ldquo;idle words&rdquo; (Matt. 12:36). Idle words are words that we do not need to speak. An idle word is a non-working word, an inoperative word, having no positive function, useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I justified myself in wanting to know about the saints by thinking that I needed to know the things concerning them if I were to help them. Actually, however, you cannot render people the best help by knowing everything about them. Rather, you can render them much help without knowing anything concerning them. If you minister to the saints according to what you know about them, this is to play politics. This is not a pure ministry. Throughout the years I have learned that to know things concerning the saints is not so healthy.</p>
<p>Whenever I am visiting another place and am staying in a brother&rsquo;s home, I do not use any drawer or closet that I have not been directed to use. When some saints receive hospitality, they might open all the drawers and closets in the room where they are staying. They want to see what they can find out about the couple with whom they are staying. To know the things of others does not help; instead it damages you. Once you know something about the saints, you can be sure that you will speak about it to someone sooner or later. A husband who has visited another locality and received hospitality in a couple&rsquo;s home may tell his wife when he returns how many pairs of shoes he saw in their closet. This kind of talk is gossip and will contaminate, defile, and pollute you. When you are put into a room for hospitality, you should only use what you have been directed to use by the host.</p>
<p>If a certain person has a fault, that is his business. You have no right to speak about it. Learn not to touch anything that you do not have the right to touch, and learn not to know anything that you do not have the position to know. This will keep you in a holy position. To know things other than what we need to know is altogether not holy but is common and worldly. As long as you know something about another person, be assured that you will speak it sooner or later. To speak it is worse than knowing it. This is gossip and the words that you speak are idle words. You may speak the facts, yet your speaking is gossiping, and this damages your Christian life. Do not be the &ldquo;information desk&rdquo; of the church. To know things about others and to speak them damages you and spreads a killing death, the killing power of the subtle one, in the church. Hundreds of saints have been killed by gossip. Our mouths must flow out the words of grace, the words concerning Christ that edify and build up others and that mend and heal the wounds (Eph. 4:29; Col. 4:6). We need to cooperate with our indwelling Lord by stopping our loose speaking. Then we will grow up into Christ in the matter of gossiping.</p>
<p>The building up of the church as the Body of Christ is also through the full knowledge of the Son of God by arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13) and by all the Body being fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply according to the operation in measure of each part. Then all the Body, out from the Head, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of the Body itself in love (4:16). The Greek preposition for &ldquo;unto&rdquo; means resulting in or issuing in. Actually, the direct building up of the Body of Christ is by all the members&rsquo; functions, and all the members&rsquo; functions will issue, or result in, the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S WORDS TO BE FULFILLED<br />
BEFORE HIS COMING BACK</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the building up of the church as the dwelling place of God and the Body of Christ must be fulfilled before His coming back. The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 24:35, &ldquo;The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.&rdquo; Without the biblical way for us to meet and to serve, the way that is illustrated, shown, and signified in the New Testament, the Lord&rsquo;s words concerning the building up of the church cannot be fulfilled. The traditional way to meet and to serve surely cannot fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s words concerning the building up of His church.</p>
<p>If 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 are not fulfilled, there is no way for the building up of the house of God and of the Body of Christ. If we do not endeavor to take the scriptural way, this will delay the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. The heaven and the earth will pass away at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, and His words will be fulfilled. Sooner or later verses like 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 will be fulfilled. When Christians have a proper way to meet and to serve, that will afford the Lord the possibility to build up the church as the dwelling place of God and as the Body of Christ. I have the assurance that right now the Lord is doing something to bring His people back to the God-ordained way to meet and to serve that He may accomplish all He has prophesied and promised concerning the building up of His church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE &ldquo;CHURCH&rdquo;<br />
AS AN ORGANIZATION AND<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS AN ORGANISM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:23; Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18; 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25; 2 Pet. 1:3-8; Eph. 4:15-16; 1 Cor. 14:5, 12</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters, we have seen various aspects of the building up of the Body of Christ. In this chapter we want to see a comparison between the building up of the &ldquo;church&rdquo; as an organization and the building up of the church as an organism. <em>Organization</em> refers to Christianity, including Catholicism and all the denominations, which constitute &ldquo;the church.&rdquo; <em>Organism</em> refers to the proper church on the way of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE &ldquo;CHURCH&rdquo;<br />
AS AN ORGANIZATION</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;church&rdquo; as an organization is built firstly with the gospel. Many so-called denominational &ldquo;churches&rdquo; build themselves up by preaching the gospel to, as they would say, &ldquo;win souls.&rdquo; This point is good, right, and absolutely scriptural. The &ldquo;church&rdquo; as an organization is also built up with the teachings of the Scriptures. Many of the fundamental denominations use scriptural teachings. This is also good and right. But they also attempt to build up their situation by meetings according to the traditional way. Here is a problem that we are still fighting today.</p>
<p>The denominations render spiritual help to people in their salvation and edification, but they annul, instead of develop, the organic functions of the believers as the living members of the Body of Christ. This problem is altogether due to the traditional way of meeting, which renders spiritual help but at the same time annuls and kills the organic function of the members of Christ. This traditional way of meeting renders the help for people to be saved and edified, but then it kills those who have been edified. Here is the subtlety of the traditional way. Millions of Christians have been helped to receive Christ as their Savior, and some spiritual help has been rendered to them. But while this help is being rendered their organic function is being hiddenly annulled. The believers do receive some edification, but the traditional way of meeting unconsciously and hiddenly annuls and nullifies all the spiritual organs. Many believers attend these traditional services for years; the longer they remain there, the more they are killed, robbed, and stripped of their organic ability to function. Therefore, out of millions of Christians, only a small percentage are useful; most of these are members of the so-called clergy.</p>
<p>I was in that traditional way for about the first seven years of my Christian life, and I received some help. But the more help I received, the more I was annulled and disabled. Then I began to know the church as an organism, and I was brought into the church. From that year in 1932, I began to be equipped in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry in His recovery. The longer a believer stays under the traditional way of meeting of one speaking and the rest listening, the more he is disabled and his spiritual ability and organic function are annulled.</p>
<p>In the traditional way of meeting, not only are the functions of the believers nullified, but also the living members of the Body of Christ are bound even to the extent of spiritual death. When we were in that way, we did not sense this because along with the spiritual help we received, we were unconsciously drugged. We lost our organic function, yet we had no consciousness, no awareness, of it. We did not become aware of this until we came out of that drugging situation.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;church&rdquo; as an organization does not fully care for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ with the adequate growth in life of the living members. They care for the building up of the church to some degree but not fully. Thus, their care becomes a tearing down and a frustration to the real building. Eventually, what is built up is not an organism in life but a religious organization. Look at today&rsquo;s denominations. Which one is not an organization? If organization were taken away from the Christian groups in Christianity, they would collapse. In contrast, the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are not dependent upon organization. Without organization, the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would still stand because they are not built upon organization. They are built upon Christ as the very life that produces an organism. We have to come fully out of the old, traditional way because this way leads in the direction of organization.</p>
<p>If one speaker is always assigned to take care of the meetings of the church, this is a strong organization. We must take away this old way of meeting. To do this is to tear down that particular organization. If this organization is replaced by the many members of Christ coming together without any arrangement or assignment but with the living Christ in them and having the freedom to follow Christ to speak something, this is an organism. To change from the traditional way to the scriptural way is to change from an organization to an organism, to have something organic replace something organized. As the living, functioning members of the living Body of Christ, we should be happy about this.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I attended a church meeting, I had a burden to speak for about fifteen minutes, but the speaking was altogether occupied by the assigned speaker. The situation would not allow me to release my burden. The organizational way not only annuls the functions of the members but also kills the opportunities for the saints to function by annulling the time.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH AS AN ORGANISM</h2>
<p>The church is built up with Christ as life, which produces an organism rather than an organization. The church as an organism preaches the gospel that people may be regenerated (1 Pet. 1:23). Our way of preaching the gospel is different from the organizational way. The way of the denominations is to invite people to come to their meetings. The new way is to go to people&rsquo;s homes with the gospel. We visit them with Christ as grace, life, forgiveness of sins, and salvation and with all the truths in the Bible.</p>
<p>The building up of the church as an organism includes ministering Christ as the life-giving Spirit through the word of the Scriptures that the believers may be transformed (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). The teaching concerning transformation is an item that is unique to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I began to speak on this matter in the United States in 1963. Second Corinthians 3:18 tells us that we need to be transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image, and Romans 12:2 says that we need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. Transformation is clearly mentioned in the Bible and is a crucial point in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Some are even opposed to the truth of Christ as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). But if this item is taken away from the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have no ministry. We must keep Christ as the life-giving Spirit since this reality is the basis of the New Testament ministry.</p>
<p>The church as an organism is built up by meetings in mutuality according to the biblical way (1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25). Mutuality will bring us out of the &ldquo;church&rdquo; as an organization and into the church as an organism. The church meeting should be an exhibition of Christ in all His riches and a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants with one another before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.</p>
<p>The church not only renders spiritual help to people in their salvation and edification but also develops the organic functions of the believers as the living members of the Body of Christ through the growth in life by the dispensing of the divine life to them (2 Pet. 1:3-8). <em>Dispensing</em> is a particular expression in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Joseph&rsquo;s ministry in Egypt was to dispense the food to all the starving people (Gen. 41:56-57), and Paul&rsquo;s ministry in the New Testament dispenses the riches of Christ to all the believers (Eph. 3:8). The goal and issue of the divine dispensing is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God to be our life that we may live Him and have one living with Him.</p>
<p>The church ministers life to the living members of the Body of Christ, helping them to grow in the divine life into Christ, the Head, in all things that the Body of Christ may be built up by itself through the functions of its members (Eph. 4:15-16). The church as an organism also fully emphasizes the building up of the church as the Body of Christ through the development of the organic functions of its living members, who receive the supply of life mainly through the church meetings (1 Cor. 14:5, 12).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">TRUTH AND LIFE SUPPLY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 14:6; 8:32; Eph. 3:8; Phil. 1:19; Eph. 5:29</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TRUTH</h2>
<p>Truth is Christ with God as the reality (John 14:6; 8:32). With us Christians, the believers in Christ, it is always possible that we could take something as a truth without the reality. The reality of the truth is the processed Triune God in Christ for us to partake of and enjoy. If we only have truth without the processed Triune God as the reality, that truth is empty. Truth without the reality of life falls into doctrine of letters, and it forms deadening regulations.</p>
<p>Truths should not be regulations, but it is very possible that we can make them regulations. I am concerned that after receiving the fellowship in these chapters, we may make each point of these truths a regulation. We may go to the church in our locality and say that it is wrong to have a big meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen. If we only say this much, our speaking will make this item a regulation. The church may be convinced by our speaking and change to meetings in which all the attendants may speak and with no definite, assigned speaker. Eventually, however, no one may speak. Formerly, there was a regulation that the meetings would have one speaker with all the others as the audience. Now we may have another kind of meeting in which all the believers come together with no definite speaker, yet they come together without life, without the life supply, and without the real content. This practice is not the truth. Rather, it is a regulation.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that in the big meetings we may not have an assigned speaker, but we may have a group of dear saints assigned in a hidden way in order to make a show that we now have many speakers instead of one. In this case, whether we would have one speaker or many speakers, they would all be assigned. This is not the reality; it is a change of regulation. Formerly, the meetings in the churches were regulated in one way. Now the regulated way has been changed. The way has been changed in outward form but not intrinsically in the spiritual and divine essence. The essence remains the same. In the former kind of meeting there was no life, and in this new kind of meeting neither is there life. This kind of change means nothing. The situation will still remain the same. There is no difference between having one person assigned to speak or many assigned to speak without life. The one kind of meeting was empty, and the other kind of meeting will also be empty. The new way of meeting will be different in the form, the practice, the outward way, but in actuality there will be emptiness, not reality.</p>
<p>The actuality and practicality of our meeting must be in reality. This reality is not in many persons speaking concerning doctrines. This reality has to be the very processed Triune God Himself as our real life. We do have such a reality, and this reality changes not only the outward way of the meeting but also its inward, intrinsic essence. With this change we do not merely have an outward appearance but the inward reality. Thus, whatever we do, whatever we speak, and whatever we carry out will be the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Truth and Grace</h2>
<p>John 1:14 says, &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; This verse says that the Word was not full of practices or doctrines, but full of grace and reality. Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment; reality is God realized by us in the Son. When the Triune God became flesh, He did not bring us practices and doctrines. He brought us Himself as our enjoyment in the aspect of grace and as reality to be realized by us in the aspect of truth. God is the reality to be seen, touched, realized, and received by us. When we receive Him, we receive Him as the very reality. Then we enjoy Him as the very grace. This is truth and grace coming with the incarnation of the Triune God.</p>
<p>We now have the reality; we do not care for empty doctrines. There are many doctrines in the Bible, but every doctrine in the Bible points to a reality. If we do not have the Triune God Himself as the reality of our teaching concerning the Trinity, our teaching is just vain and empty theology. We care to speak the truth, the very God Himself who is triune and who has passed through all the processes to be our reality and our enjoyment. Such a God is truth and grace. Therefore, He Himself could say, &ldquo;I am...the reality&rdquo; (John 14:6). He did not say, &ldquo;I am the doctrine.&rdquo; He was the very reality of what He spoke to the disciples, of what He brought to them, and of what He intended to give them. He did not intend to give us doctrines; He intended to give us God Himself, and this divine Self is simply the divine Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Consummated and Consummating Spirit</h2>
<p>Today the divine Spirit is the consummated and consummating Spirit. All that the Triune God is, has gone through, has accomplished, and has attained and obtained is consummated in this consummating Spirit. God is the reality; therefore, in the New Testament the Spirit is also the reality (John 14:17a; 1 John 5:6). If you have the Spirit, you have incarnation, the incarnated God, the processed Triune God. If you have this Spirit, you have the very humanity of the Lord with His divinity, and you even have His very human living. If you have this Spirit, you have the reality of the all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross. If you have this Spirit, you have the reality of the resurrection, which is the unique power in the entire universe. The power of the resurrection of Christ is altogether realized, wrapped up, and embodied in the Spirit. If you have this Spirit, you are in the heavens because the ascension of Christ is wrapped up with and one with the Spirit. If you have the Spirit and if you are in the Spirit, you are in the ascension. You are one with this Christ because you have the reality which is the very consummated and consummating Spirit. We must have this reality. Do not merely bring a doctrine to the church in your locality. You have to bring the very Triune God as the reality, which is the truth. When you speak, you must have the assurance that you are passing on, that you are dispensing, some amount of this reality to people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contacting, Living, and Speaking Christ</h2>
<p>The dispensing does not depend on our eloquence. We do not need to look to the Lord and pray much for eloquence. We must learn to fellowship with Him, to have a good beginning of every day by contacting Him, by being revived again in the morning and being exposed in His very presence, by being enlightened, by being put in His divine light, and by seeing all our failures. Even if we did this yesterday, we still need to do it again. Every morning we need to wash. If we washed thoroughly yesterday, that does not mean that today we do not need to wash again. Every day we need to have a good start of the day by contacting God to have a renewed revival and to receive enlightenment. We should not hide any shortage or any part of our person. We need to cooperate with the divine life to be fully exposed and fully dealt with. Then we will receive a thorough cleansing, and our day will have a good start.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole day you must live in this Triune God, and you must live the very embodiment of this Triune God, Christ. You must learn to say as Paul did, &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). Then speak Christ in any place, in season or out of season. If there are no humans, speak to the birds and animals. Speak Christ all the time. This is our duty. No humans may be listening, but be assured that the demons are present. They will hear your speaking. The good and evil angels are also present. There is a spiritual battle, and we must testify to the entire universe that we are such persons living Christ and speaking Christ all the day. We are not persons living for the world; we are not persons living for our interests. We are persons living Christ and living to Christ. We are such persons day and night. In the evening we may go to meet with our dear fellow-believers, either our family in our own home, our neighbors, or our relatives. We may go to a big meeting or a small meeting. We may go to a home meeting, a group meeting, or a larger church meeting. In any case, the principle is the same. Wherever we are, we should be persons speaking Christ.</p>
<p>Do not preach a doctrine concerning truth. Go to impart the Triune God to people, to dispense the very Christ, even in a fine way. Then you will have the truth with the very divine life backing it. Truth without the reality of life falls into doctrine of letters, and it forms deadening regulations. This is a solemn warning. Do not go anywhere to merely preach doctrine as truth. That is not truth. Do not preach empty doctrine, but impart the living Triune God. Dispense the very Christ you have experienced in a very fine way in your daily life. If you are such a person, you are fully qualified to tell others what you have seen. Otherwise, it is advisable not to speak anything. Do not merely tell others what you have heard in messages as doctrines without reality and the supply of life.</p><h2 class="head2">Ministering the Life Supply to the Hungry Ones</h2>
<p>What I expect and what I would charge you to do is to go to minister the life supply to the hungry ones. Do not consider that you are the only one who has been trained, qualified, and equipped with something to supply. This is ugly. You must have the assurance that you are really one with the very Lord and that you are living Him. If you do have something, you do not need to advertise or promote yourself; you do not need to prove that you have something. Fellowship spontaneously and normally with those who are around you, your &ldquo;neighbors&rdquo; (Eph. 4:25). Do not boast and do not &ldquo;sell your cargo.&rdquo; Simply fellowship in a humble, gentle, and lowly way. You may say, &ldquo;Brothers, may we pray together? May we turn to John 1:1? Let us enjoy the Lord in His Word.&rdquo; Pray, but in your prayer do not have a facade that you have received so much from the fellowship of the training contained in this book. It is better to put what you have received &ldquo;in your pocket.&rdquo; Gradually, a little of it may come out. After a few minutes, a little more may come out. Item after item will come out of your being to edify, cherish, and nourish people. Do not teach the doctrines concerning the so-called truths, but supply people with life, with the very processed Triune God, without an outward declaration. Be one with the Lord in this way.</p>
<p>You do not need to promote, advertise, or declare. Simply be what you are in the Lord. Have a gentle and meek attitude and a lowly appearance all the time. Always live this way. Then you will surely have a lot within you. As such a person, you will have Christ accumulated in your daily life day after day. Something of the dear Christ will be accumulated in your being. You do not need to do anything in particular. Simply live in this way, and something will come out of you. You do not need to say that you have received so much from these messages; let others say this about you. Gradually, they will realize and will taste that you surely have received some riches. This is the proper way. Simply live whatever you are and be whatever you are in the Lord. Then the truth will be with you and the reality will follow. Life will come out of you as a dispensing to support others and to supply them with the riches which you have enjoyed of Christ. This is the Lord&rsquo;s way. The root, the influence, and even the impact of the traditional way is present with us. It is not by our preaching or teaching that this deeply rooted matter could be removed. To preach and teach with a facade will help the root to become deeper rather than pull it up. Our being and our living need to be in the new way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE SUPPLY</h2>
<p>The life supply is the supply of the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). This supply has to be carried out in our living and our being. It must be the contents of our transformed being. The life supply is the supply of the riches of Christ enjoyed by us. It is not merely something objective of Christ; it is a subjective experience and enjoyment in our daily life. We must bear all these riches which will spontaneously become a life supply dispensed into each one whom we contact. We should go to supply all the saints in this way. Do not go to tell others that you have received so much and that many days would be needed for you to tell them everything. This will just help the doctrinal way to become more deeply rooted. Simply live and be what you are and contact people according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>Our &ldquo;salesmanship&rdquo; is not like the worldly salesmanship. We do not need advertisement. We do not need propaganda. We do not need to make a big facade, a show, to let people see what we have received. Rather, we need to be little &ldquo;Nazarenes,&rdquo; like Jesus. The Lord Jesus is lowliness and humility. His lowliness and humility are not merely virtues of the human character. He lived lowliness and humility, and He is lowliness and humility. When He speaks, He ministers Himself, He imparts Himself, and He dispenses some elements of His person into His listeners. Thus, people are infused by Him with what He is, not just taught, edified, or instructed. The Lord Jesus only ministered for about three and a half years, forty-two months, but He imparted and dispensed much. Even though Peter, James, John, and the other disciples did not realize what they were infused with, they still received some infusion of Christ. After three and a half years, this infusion, which remained within them, came out on the day of Pentecost. Go to the church in your locality, not to preach, but to infuse, to impart, to dispense. This way will be slow, but do not be bothered by the slowness; the slower it is, the better. If we would live in the way of infusing others, how good our situation would be after three, five, or ten years!</p>
<p>The life supply is the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (Phil. 1:19), making truth real with the essence of the processed Triune God. In the church in your locality, make the very truth which you convey real with the essence of the divine Triune God. Do not merely teach, preach, or have an activity as a show. Simply live what you are and be what you are in the Lord, bringing nothing but the reality of the processed Triune God to others. We need to infuse others with the reality of the divine Trinity. Only this infusion is the life supply, and all the churches need this supply.</p>
<p>Also, we should not gossip by speaking idle words which work nothing but which will be recorded for the upcoming judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. In Matthew 12:36 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they shall render account concerning it in the day of judgment.&rdquo; I am concerned that perhaps one day when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, the heavenly &ldquo;tape recorder&rdquo; will replay word after word of our idle speaking. The Lord Jesus indicated that whatever we speak as an idle word will be recorded. This is not a small matter.</p>
<p>We should take every opportunity to minister, to impart, to dispense, and to infuse those around us with something of the Triune God. The life supply cherishes and nourishes the seeking believers (Eph. 5:29). If we would live in the way we have spoken of in this chapter and be this way, the ones that we contact and fellowship with will eventually have the deep conviction that they are cherished and nourished.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">GRADUALLY AND POSITIVELY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:12-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION OF THE BIBLICAL WAY<br />
FOR THE BELIEVERS TO MEET AND TO SERVE<br />
BEING GRADUAL ACCORDING TO<br />
OUR PRESENT SITUATION</h2>
<p>The application of the biblical way for the believers to meet and to serve should be gradual according to our present situation. In doing anything you have to take care of the situation. We may use a medical doctor to illustrate this principle. When a doctor treats someone, he always proceeds gradually according to the condition of the illness and the real situation of the patient. You must take care of the situation in your local church. Not all the churches today are on the same level in the application of the biblical way to meet and to serve. Some churches have just started; some churches may still be considering how to take this way; and some churches may have gone much further and may be at a higher level. You need to take the present situation of the church in your locality into a thorough, careful, and fine consideration. Then you will know how the Lord will lead you, and you will know what to do.</p>
<p>From the initiation, the beginning, of the biblical way, we should practice only the beginning part. Do not present all the points and all the parts of this biblical way at once. As in a feast, you should put out course after course. You need to consider what the first and second courses should be, what the last course should be, and how long each course should last. In a fifteen minute feast, one course may take only two or three minutes. All of this depends on the situation of the eaters. Some people do not eat so quickly, and they may not be happy with all the courses. We all must learn how to consider the situation of the eaters, how they appreciate and receive the courses of the feast, and how well they eat.</p>
<p>After a certain period of time, we may practice a further part of the biblical way to meet and to serve. I cannot tell you what parts should be practiced first in the church in your locality. Again, this all depends upon the situation and the condition of the saints. Thus, part by part, we practice the entire biblical way with much patience from the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION ALSO BEING POSITIVE</h2>
<p>The application of the biblical way to meet and to serve should also be positive. We human beings always tend to be unbalanced, like unturned cakes (Hosea 7:8). When we turn the cake on one side, we tend to leave it there; that side will be burnt while the other side is raw. We have to &ldquo;turn the cake&rdquo; quite often. As we practice to be gradual, we must at the same time be positive. To be gradual does not mean that we do not go further. Rather it means that we go further steadily and positively. We need much exercise, much wisdom, and much grace with patience. We all have to learn how to enjoy the Lord as our patience, our wisdom, and our grace.</p>
<p>While practicing the biblical way part by part, we should practice every part positively with much endeavoring to labor, strive, and struggle by the Lord&rsquo;s great power of resurrection that operates in us until we reach the goal in the full recovery of the truth covered in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. Nothing exhausts our power as much as a situation requiring patience. Therefore, we need to labor, strive, and struggle by the Lord&rsquo;s great power of resurrection.</p>
<p>During the period of such an endeavoring practice, we should do everything we can to avoid any kind of opinion or dispute. We should not have any discrimination in the church life. We should not say that a certain saint is for the new way and that another saint is not for the new way. To speak in this way is to create differences among the saints. Whether a saint is taking the new way or not should not matter to us. We must go on positively, not making an issue out of any differences among the saints. We should not look down on those who seemingly do not practice the new way, nor should we uplift those who do practice the new way. There should be no looking down or lifting up in the church life; all are the same. It is easy for us to push something when we are in it and to oppose something when we are not in it. This is a bad habit, causing a bad situation. From the beginning, I did not expect that all the attendants of the church meetings would or could practice the new way. I only expected that one-fourth of the saints would practice this way. You must honor and respect your church for what it is. Do not create any differences or build up something according to your own way. This kind of building always becomes a tearing down.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR GOAL IN PRACTICING THE BIBLICAL WAY</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that in practicing the biblical way our goal is to arrive at one of the major items in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. What we are dealing with now may be the last item, the concluding item, of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It seems that we are now very close to the end of this age, the conclusion of the ages, which will bring the Lord back. However, we should not say that this new way will definitely bring the Lord back. The New Testament teaches us that no one can know the day and the hour of the Lord&rsquo;s return (Matt. 24:36). In the past century, certain ones prophesied concerning the time at which the Lord Jesus would come back. Some went out with white robes to wait for His return, but nothing happened. We should not make the same mistake. Nevertheless, according to our knowledge of the Bible, it seems that this new way may be the last and concluding recovery of the Lord.</p>
<p>This new way is crucial, it is important, and it is just in time to meet our present need. I feel that I have come to a point that without such a change I just cannot go on in my ministry. This compels me very much. Furthermore, the ministry is altogether related to our living. If I would not know how to minister, it would be hard for me to know how to live. Our living must have a purpose; it must be for the purpose of the ministry. If I would not be here for this change, I would not know how to minister and what the purpose of my living should be. I would be lost. This is why I am endeavoring and am so desperate. In the years since October of 1984, many have seen the same thing I have seen. Therefore, we all must endeavor to carry this out with much patience, gradually yet positively.</p>
<p>To practice the biblical way is not merely to change a way. It is to fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire according to His word concerning the building up of His Body (Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:12-16). This is not merely to fulfill some of the prophesies in the New Testament. It is to accomplish the unique, central thing in the entire universe&mdash;the building up of the Body of Christ. We have not yet seen the accomplishment of such a thing. Where has this building been in the past, and where is it today? In the whole universe there is not yet such a thing. The building up of the Body of Christ has not yet been completed. With many Christians this building has hardly begun. Perhaps even among us over the last sixty years, this building has barely begun. This is a great and crucial matter prophesied by the Lord and the Apostle Paul in the New Testament. This is crucial; it must be fulfilled and completed, and we are here for this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S DAY MORNING MEETING</h2>
<p>The saints and the elders in all the churches must consider what we should do with the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. To have one speaker designated to speak to a great audience is traditional and should be condemned. Whether a particular meeting should be accepted or renounced does not depend on the day or time at which it occurs but on the nature and reality of that meeting.</p>
<p>Today most nations on the earth consider the Lord&rsquo;s Day to be a holiday. We call this day the Lord&rsquo;s Day, whereas the nations call it Sunday. Sunday is a name according to pagan religion, meaning the day of the sun. This is a superstitious title, and, strictly speaking, we should not use it. Around the world, regardless of their religion, most countries have this day as a holiday. It is a convenient time for people to do many things. In a good sense, if we do not utilize this day, we will miss something. Therefore it is better to hold an important meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. If we set up an important meeting on a weekday, most people will be busy at work. They may not even be free to come to the meetings in the evening. The Lord&rsquo;s Day is the best time for a large number of the saints to be gathered together. We may not need to change the day or the time of our present meetings, but we surely need to change the nature of the meetings. By doing so we will take advantage of this day. To set up a meeting on this day will be convenient, not only to the Christian believers but also to the Gentiles. It will accommodate their situation. However, this does not mean that we still should keep the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning service in the traditional way.</p><h2 class="head1">A PERSONAL TESTIMONY</h2>
<p>I was born into organized Christianity. I spent some time in fundamental Christianity and was eventually brought by the Lord into His recovery. In His recovery I entered into the inner life and experienced many things in the church life. I also practiced the Pentecostal things and received much help from other kinds of Christian practices.</p>
<p>From 1932 to the present the Lord has graced me to have four major successes in my ministry: in the church in my hometown of Chefoo, in Shanghai, in Taiwan with the Southeast Asian countries, and in the United States. While in the United States I wrote the footnotes of the Recovery Version and gave the Life-study of the New Testament through semiannual trainings over about a twelve year period.</p>
<p>By October of 1984, I had finished the last footnote in the exposition of the New Testament. I then felt that I was free to have more time to consider the Lord&rsquo;s way. I realized that a number of the approximately nine hundred churches around the globe were in a somewhat dormant situation. That bothered me and burdened me. After seeking the Lord for His way, I felt that something new must be brought in for a new start among us. What Brother Nee saw in 1937 and again in 1948 was in my mind and was also my burden. I realized that to build up the Body of Christ, to prepare the bride for Christ&rsquo;s coming back, and to conclude this age for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to set up His kingdom on this earth, we must have something absolutely different from the practice of Christianity in the previous nineteen centuries.</p>
<p>I reconsidered all the Bible verses concerning this matter, I gathered statistics concerning various Christian practices, and I reconsidered church history. I came to the conclusion that we must do something by the Lord and with the Lord for a new start. I realized that Taiwan would be the best place to have a new start. It seemed that everything was right for this, so I went there. I realized also that this could not be carried out quickly but would require much study and experimentation over a period of three to five years. I told some of the brothers in the United States that during that period of time I could not do much to help them except to conduct the semiannual trainings. I would spend my time in Taiwan to study and experiment in order to build up a model. When the model would be built up in Taiwan, I would have something to present to all the churches with all the revelations.</p>
<p>My expectation is first that many faithful saints would go out to visit people and that daily hundreds would be saved around the globe. Second, my expectation is that around the globe, in all the leading cities and even in the smaller cities, there would be home meetings in which the saints would function as living members of the Body of Christ, not in a big church building, but in small homes. Thousands of these homes will be on the earth for the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. Third, my expectation is that around the globe many small groups of two or three families would meet in the New Testament way for the expression of the Body of Christ in their localities. Fourth, my expectation is that the churches may have many district meetings of fifty to one hundred saints. A large church may even have hundreds of these district meetings to represent the meeting of the entire church. In these meetings everyone will function, everyone will minister, and everyone will speak. Everyone will be able to dispense, to impart, the processed Triune God to their fellow believers.</p>
<p>All these items are the details of my expectation, and I have the full assurance that the Lord will accomplish this. I do not believe that it will take a very long time for the Lord to finish this matter that He may fulfill His great prophecy concerning the building up of the church as His Body. Now you may understand where I am and what my burden and expectation are. I do hope that we all would be for this and fully take part in this.</p></body></html>
