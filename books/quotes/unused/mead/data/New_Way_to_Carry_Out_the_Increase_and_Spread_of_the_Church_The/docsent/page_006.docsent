   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE WAY TO SET UP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE HOMES OF THE NEW CONTACTS Scripture Reading: Eph 5:18-19; Col 3:16 Make an appointment in the first contact for the following meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Learn to use the Recovery Version and our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Learn to teach people to sing the hymns and songs and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Learn to stir up the interest of all the members of a home to share the activities in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>KNOCKING ON DOORS TO GAIN HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Previously we have seen the way to visit people by knocking on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To knock on people s doors is not the end; that is just the initiation, the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to our past study and experience, if you would knock on people s doors in this way, you will not be altogether rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some doors will not be open to you, and some people will reject you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, those in a good percentage of the homes will open up their doors and will welcome you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This will give us a very good chance to get into the homes, to not only gain individual persons but to gain homes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not forget that to knock on people s doors is not simply to gain individual persons but to gain home after home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our stress is on the home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The home is our unit, our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are going out to gain homes because a home always involves a lot of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you could get a home, you could get a good number of persons through that home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to take the home as our goal for our going out to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Throughout the years we have been hearing that it was too hard to get people, to bring people in. It was hard because we took the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You cannot drive a car onto the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have been trying to drive the car of the recovery onto the roof for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we would not go out to get people for our meetings but bring the meetings to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The home which you gain may have only three persons, but after a number of weeks their relatives, in-laws, and friends will come in. Do not forget that when you go to knock on people s doors, it is to get a home.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not be satisfied just to get one person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That is not so promising.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One person could be easily lost, but a home cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Remember well that your going out is to get homes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>MAKING AN APPOINTMENT IN THE FIRST CONTACT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>FOR FOLLOWING MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In your first contact you must grasp the time and seize the opportunity to make an appointment for the next meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What will you do in all the following meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the burden of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From the second time you go to visit them you must begin to do one wonderful thing, that is, to set up a meeting in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why we need training.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are getting ourselves prepared to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the doors are opened to us, we will go in to start a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From now on the church meeting will go out to be in other people s homes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that when people open their doors to you and you go in, you would not be persons so dear and precious yet unable to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not sufficient to simply go in and say, How are you?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What you can do depends on whether or not you would be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Formerly we considered that only the elders and the co-workers needed to learn these things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why in October of 1984, I had a big burden to change our entire practice, to tear down the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the saints need to learn how to set up meetings in the homes of the new contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>LEARNING TO USE THE RECOVERY VERSION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>AND OUR PUBLICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To set up meetings in the homes of the new contacts we must first learn to use the Recovery Version and our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether you use the Recovery Version first or the other publications first depends upon the present situation and atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you go to a home the second time, do not speak with your own words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You must learn to speak what is printed on our pages.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Most people respect the words printed in books.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whatever you speak may not be that valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whatever is printed surely is something better than the word out of our mouth because it has been thoroughly considered.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everyone on this earth knows that the Bible is the highest book, regardless of whether they are believers or unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When you present people the Recovery Version of the New Testament, read one verse to them with one of the notes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not read it carelessly; you have to read it meaningfully.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For this you have to prepare yourself in using the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have to spend time to read the text with the notes day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You must be trained in knowing and using the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Recently some sisters were singing in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Across the street an elderly lady heard the singing and came to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She was happy because she also was a seeking Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One of the sisters read note 3 2 in Matthew 1 concerning the five women in the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This note attracted that seeking Christian and stirred up her desire to get a copy of the Recovery Version for herself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The five women were Tamar v. 3 , Rahab v. 5 , Ruth v. 5 , Bathsheba v. 6 , and Mary v. 16 . Tamar was the daughter-in-law of Judah, who begot sons by her.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The second woman was Rahab, a prostitute.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A prostitute became one of the ancestors of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You must learn to know all these verses with wonderful notes such as these, which are very attractive to the seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Recently, two brothers had the burden to go door-to-door to introduce the Recovery Version to people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After two doors they met a woman who had begun to doubt the inerrancy of the Word due to the three missing generations in Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These brothers showed her note 8 1 of Matthew 1 which deals with this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Students of the Bible have debated about this for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They had no answers as to why the three generations in 1 Chronicles 3:11-12 were omitted from the genealogy in Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After reading this note, she was convinced that the Bible was really inspired by God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As a result of these brothers reading this note to this seeker, she bought two Recovery Versions and her entire home was gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When you are received into a home through some questions and a short talk, you may realize that these ones are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then you have to use the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Just as in fighting, you must know how to use the proper weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even carpenters in their carpentry know how to use their tools sometimes they have to use an axe and at other times they have to use a hammer or a saw.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You all have to learn how to use the Bible the Lord has put into our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Become familiar with the text of the Bible and with the notes in the Recovery Version that help to open up the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You also need to know the contents of the small booklets, especially the booklet entitled The Mystery of Human Life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You do not need to use the entire book.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Use only one of the four keys in this booklet that unlock the mystery of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When you talk to a particular person, you may have the realization that the last key would be very good for him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Simply use that one key and open the door with it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We also have many rainbow booklets, all selected from the Life-study Messages on the New Testament books.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should also take these booklets with us when we go to others homes.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have to realize that we are here living to the Lord Rom 14:8; 2 Cor 5:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should bear the burden to go out to spread the truth with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The truth is in the Bible, yet the Bible is a book that needs expounding.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Luke 24:13-35 is a good illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There the Lord Jesus met the two disciples going to Emmaus and interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself v. 27 . They did not know how to understand these things until the Lord Jesus opened their understanding to know all the verses concerning Himself in the Old Testament vv.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Likewise, in Acts 8:26-39 the eunuch from Ethiopia was reading Isaiah 53 but did not know what it meant until Philip explained to him what was there.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The holy Word needs to be expounded.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In 1936 I wrote a booklet on Christ s genealogy after I spent about eleven years to study it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The consummation of my labor on the genealogy is in the notes on the first seventeen verses of Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Many Bible students would rather skip over this portion of the Word, but these notes bring us into its real significance.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We all need to study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Thank the Lord that through the notes to the Recovery Version and through the Life-study Messages the New Testament has been expounded.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The notes and the Life-studies open up the Bible to us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The mine has been opened, but there is the need of more digging to gain the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should also spend some time on the rainbow booklets.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is better to pass out what you have read.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Then you will know what is there and how to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Therefore, when you go to a home the second time, the first thing you must be able to do is to show them some interesting and attractive portions from the Recovery Version and our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Pick a paragraph or a page and open it to the one with whom you are speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Either he or you will read or you may read together in a very close and intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Do not read too much.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The notes on the genealogy of Christ are quite long; most of the saints just use one paragraph or point.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The sisters I mentioned used the point on the five women, and the brother used the paragraph on the three missing generations.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>When you set up meetings in the homes, do not keep the meeting too long.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It is better if it is thirty minutes or at the most forty-five minutes, but never over one hour.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Use one paragraph from The Mystery of Human Life, the rainbow booklets, or some other Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>You will see the result and the response.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Then grasp their response to close the deal.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>You may close the deal to get one person baptized, because that person may have received the help from your reading or from his reading with you.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>You may close the deal with a prayer, with an appreciation of the Lord Jesus, or with the knowledge of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>It all depends upon what you have read.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>All the saints should learn this and practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Then your going out would never be in vain; it will be so productive all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Do not think that because a certain one was baptized by you that you may go on right away to tell him something else.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>As long as he was baptized that is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Do not go further.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Leave the other things for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Each time just do one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Do not be greedy to accomplish more than one item.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>You will have a regular, weekly meeting, and you will come back again.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>When you come back, you can continue.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Do not do many things at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Remember that it is very crucial and effective to use the Recovery Version and all our publications.</S>
