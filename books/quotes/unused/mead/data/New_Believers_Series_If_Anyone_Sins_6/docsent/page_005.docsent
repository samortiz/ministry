   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. AN ADVOCATE WITH THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First John 2:1 says, "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These things refer to the forgiveness and cleansing from our sins through God's promise and work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John wrote these things to us so that we may not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It shows us that the Lord has forgiven our many sins and that, as a result, we do not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we find out that we are forgiven, we do not become free to sin; rather, we will not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following this it says, "And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"With the Father" this is a family affair; it is something that happens after we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have already believed and have become one of God's many children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we have an Advocate with the Father, who is Jesus Christ the Righteous; "He Himself is the propitiation for our sins."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through the Lord Jesus' death and by His becoming the propitiation for our sins, He has become our Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These words are spoken to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The propitiation spoken of here is the reality of the type of the ashes of the red heifer in Numbers 19.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It speaks of God's forgiveness of our future sins according to the accomplished work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need to have a new cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We only need the work of the cross once and it is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the eternal redemption of the cross, our sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That sacrifice was not an ordinary sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was a sacrifice whose efficacy could be applied at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was ashes; therefore, it was applicable all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Based on His blood, the Lord Jesus Christ has become our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has accomplished redemption on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Based on His accomplished work, we can be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we sin by accident, we should not be disheartened by our sin; we should not wallow in it or remain in it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we sin, the first thing we should do is confess our sin to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God says that it is a sin, and we should acknowledge it as a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God says that this is wrong, and we also should say that it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we ask God to forgive our sin, He forgives our sin, and our fellowship with Him is restored immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the eyes of God, no brother or sister should sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if anyone sins by accident, the first thing to do is deal with it immediately before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He or she should take care of the problem of sin immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Never delay.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Deal with it as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must confess immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Tell God, "I have sinned!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our confession is our judgment of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we confess our sins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a child of God sins and does not confess his sin but instead remains in his sin, he loses his fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There will be no further fellowship between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is a leak in his conscience, and he will not be able to stand up before God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He may still have a little fellowship with God, but that fellowship will not be pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Indeed, he will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When a child who has done something wrong comes home, he will feel that something is not right because his father will not speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He cannot have an intimate fellowship with his father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He knows that there is a barrier between him and his father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the pain that results from a loss of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is only one way to recovery it is to go to God and confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has become our Advocate and has borne all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to confess our failures and shortcomings before God in a humble way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to look to Him so that we will no longer be proud or loose when we set out on our journey again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to realize that we are no better than anyone else, and that it is possible for us to fall at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to ask God for mercy and strength to go on step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once we confess this way, we will immediately recover our fellowship with God, and the joy and peace that were lost will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Finally, we should point out once more that Christians should not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sin results in suffering and loss.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May God have mercy upon us, keep us, preserve us, and lead us on in the way of unceasing fellowship with Him!</S>
