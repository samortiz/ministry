The heart is the source of evil. The traditions of the Pharisees require people to wash their hands until they are clean and white, but such traditions ignore the fact that the people's heart remains defiled. One does not need to go to Africa to find a savage; savages are everywhere in America, England, China, Japan, etc. This section shows (1) how defiled man's heart is, (2) how loving God's heart is, and (3) that it is the heart that needs cleansing; this is not an outward need. The foregoing passage speaks concerning man's heart being defiled, whereas the following passage speaks concerning God's heart. If we do not know man's heart, neither can we know God's heart.</P><P>Verse 21:"And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon." Because He desired to leave those hypocritical ones, the Lord withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon, which were places cursed by God (see Isa. 23; Joel 3:4). God openly cursed Tyre and Sidon through the prophets. The Lord preferred to leave the secret sinners to go to the open sinners. "The parts" means the realm. Although we do not live in Tyre and Sidon, we are in that realm.</P><P>Verse 22:"And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession." This Canaanite woman belonged to the race of the Canaanites, who were also cursed (Gen. 9:25-26). She came out from a cursed place. "Lord" is a cry for mercy; "Son of David" is a cry by mistake. The Son of David had nothing to do with a Canaanite woman.</P><P>Verse 23:"But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us." If the Lord were only the Son of David, He could have nothing to do with the Gentiles. This woman was standing in an improper position to lay hold of the Lord. Hence, when we pray, we should not be careless in the way we address the Lord. The disciples were impatient with the bothersome woman, so they asked the Lord to fulfill her desire quickly.</P><P>Verse 24:"But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." All the works of the Lord on the earth were for the Jews; His open works for the Gentiles would begin in the house of Cornelius. Until then the Lord's works toward the Gentiles were only suggestive. Even in His going to the house of Israel, He went only to the lost sheep (the remnant). Why did the Lord speak such a word? He wanted to give the woman a handle. The Lord was sent only to the house of Israel. Now, since He was to go to the lost sheep, the realm had become much broader. Was the woman not a lost sheep? Could she not receive grace? All she needed to do was to admit that she was a lost sheep. The Lord stayed at a far distance to allow her to think. His not answering was not a refusal; rather, it was a silent permission. Although the Lord did not open His mouth at that time, His heart was beating unceasingly, and He was eager to give grace. However, since the woman did not stand in the position of a sinner, it was inconvenient for the Lord to answer her request. God's silent delay is not a rejection. When our God delays, it is not that He rejects us; rather, He is waiting for us. After the Lord speaks one sentence, He stops. But within, He eagerly expects and loves us immensely. His outward distance is not a real distance.</P><P>Verse 25:"But she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!" This woman began to realize the handle of the Lord's word, and she held on to it. She thought, "Oh, I thought that all the Israelites were moral and good people. Little did I know that they are lost sheep. Since this is grace, there is not the limitation of position. Although I am a sinner under the curse, I am also a lost sheep and therefore may receive grace." The Lord Jesus brought the entire nation of Israel down to the same level as Tyre and Sidon-all are sinners. Now she called the Lord only "Lord" and eliminated the title "Son of David," for she now understood what salvation was.</P><P>Verse 26:"But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs." This was the first time the Lord answered the woman directly. The previous word was spoken indirectly to the woman but directly to the disciples. The Lord likened the Jews to sheep and the Gentiles to dogs. Only the Israelites are qualified to be God's flock; they are the Lord's sheep mentioned in John 10. The "other sheep" are the Gentiles who are saved. Not all Jews are sheep, but the Jews considered themselves as sheep. Therefore, the Lord said that they were lost sheep. The Gentiles thought that they too were sheep, but the Lord said that they were dogs. A sheep has divided hoofs (outward cleanliness) and chews the cud (inward cleanliness). This woman considered herself a sheep, yet the Lord said that she was a dog and refused her. However, He still did not give her up; rather, He again gave her a handle to hold on to.</P><P>Verse 27:"And she said, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table." In saying, "Yes, Lord," the woman acknowledged that what the Lord had spoken was right and that she was wrong. In Greek there are two different words for dog. One is used in reference to wild dogs and the other is used in reference to domestic dogs. Here the word used is that for domestic dogs. The Lord gave her the handle of His word, and she held on to it. What she meant was this: "Although I am a dog, I am Your dog. Since I am Your dog, I can eat the crumbs."</P><P>Verse 28:"Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour." The Lord here addressed her as "woman," and He first praised her and then gave her what she had asked. (The way of the Lord's rewarding is also first by praising and then by giving-Matt. 25:21, 23). The Lord's heart leaped because He greatly marveled at her faith. God's delay and God's trial are training schools of our faith. The longer the delay in answering, the greater the faith. "Son of David" denotes a natural relationship. If you consider that your behavior is good and that your conduct is not bad, then God will give you up. If you are willing to humble yourself and stand in the position of a dog, God will bless you. May we learn from this passage how to pray and hold on to the handle of God's word. (This portion speaks of the heart of the Gentiles.)</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
