 <h2 class="head1">XXXIX. THE TEST OF DIOTREPHES,<br />
WHO LOVED TO BE FIRST IN THE CHURCH<br />
IN WHICH GAIUS WAS&mdash;3 JOHN 9, 1</h2>
<p>Diotrephes did not receive the apostles and babbled against them with evil words; neither did he receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbade and cast them out of the church. If the Apostle John would have come to the church, he would have brought Diotrephes&rsquo; works to the remembrance of the believers (v. 10). We need to be careful in dealing with such a case. Diotrephes&rsquo; actions surely constituted a great sin. However, the apostle did not indicate that Diotrephes&rsquo; sin was intolerable to the extent that he needed to be quarantined. John did not tell us to quarantine such a person. Even sinful acts such as this in the church life should be dealt with through much consideration, with the expectation that the sinful acts could be corrected after a certain amount of loving rebuking and punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XL. THE TEST OF THOSE WHO<br />
HAVE GONE IN THE WAY OF CAIN,<br />
POURED THEMSELVES OUT IN THE ERROR<br />
OF BALAAM FOR REWARD, AND<br />
PERISHED IN THE REBELLION OF KORAH,<br />
GOING ON ACCORDING TO THEIR LUSTS,<br />
ADMIRING PERSONS FOR THE SAKE<br />
OF ADVANTAGE&mdash;JUDE 11, 16</h2>
<p>These apostates were hidden reefs in the believers&rsquo; love feasts, shepherds who fed themselves, waterless clouds, autumn trees without fruit, wild waves of the sea, and wandering stars (vv. 12-13). Jude exhorted the believers to remember the words spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, who said that in the last time there will be mockers going on according to their own ungodly lusts, making separations, soulish, not having spirit (vv. 17-19). Jude exhorted the believers also to build up themselves in their most holy faith, pray in the Holy Spirit, and keep themselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life (v. 20). This shows that in such a situation of apostasy, the best way for us is to exhort the believers in the positive way that Jude did.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XLI. THE TEST OF SOME IN EPHESUS<br />
CALLING THEMSELVES APOSTLES<br />
AND NOT BEING SUCH&mdash;REV. 2:1A, 2</h2>
<p>What these false apostles did in their false assuming and pretense was a great damage, carried out by Satan, to the building up of the Body of Christ (2 Cor. 11:13-15). This was a real test of the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ. We should follow the positive example of the church in Ephesus by trying these false apostles and finding them to be false.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XLII. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN EPHESUS<br />
LEAVING ITS FIRST LOVE&mdash;REV. 2:4</h2>
<p>The church in Ephesus was praised by the Lord for its works, labor, endurance, not bearing evil men, and trying the false apostles and finding them false (v. 2). However, it was rebuked by the Lord for leaving its first love. To leave the first love is to become indifferent and dormant in the appreciation of the Lord&rsquo;s excellency and preciousness and also in gratitude for the Lord&rsquo;s love in His redemptive work for us. This is the root of the degradation of the church through the centuries. For this the Lord admonished the church in Ephesus to repent; otherwise, its lampstand would be removed. The removing of the lampstand implies the losing of the power to shine in the darkness and to testify for the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s admonishing is the way for us to take care of a case of leaving the first love towards the Lord.</p>
