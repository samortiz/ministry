   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As proof: 1 They are different from the angels Acts 23:9 , 2 they are different from the spirits of the dead people Job 7:9 , and 3 they are spirits that have been separated from their bodies Matt 8:16; Luke 10:17, 20; Matt 17:18; Mark 9:25 .</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The evil angels are the rulers of this world, while the little demons are out to frustrate men, to torment men, to drive men to insanity, and to motivate men to worship idols.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to deal with ordinary men, he only needs to release the little demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in order to deal with godly men who stand absolutely one with God, like Daniel, he has to call in the princes.</S>
