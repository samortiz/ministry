<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Christ Coming as a Man in His Humanity<br>to Manoah's Wife</H2><P>Christ, who was the Angel of Jehovah, Jehovah Himself, came as a man in His humanity to tell Manoah's wife that she would bring forth a son, Samson, to deliver Israel from the oppression of the Philistines for the carrying out of God's eternal economy (Judg. 13).</P><P>Now we have to find out why Christ needed to be a man to visit Abraham, wrestle with Jacob, meet Joshua, and come to Manoah's wife. The answer to this question brings us to the unique and deepest truth in the divine revelation of the holy Scriptures. We need to answer the questions: "Why is there a God, why is there a Bible, why does this unique God have an economy which is revealed in this Bible, and why did God create the old creation with man as its center?" The answer to these questions as the one truth is the deepest truth, and it is very hard to explain.</P><P>Acts 2:23 says that Christ was crucified, "delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God." The Triune God in eternity past held a council to make a decision that the second among Them had to become a man for the purpose of visiting His chosen ones and making friends with them (Luke 7:34). When Nathanael saw Christ, he proclaimed that Christ was the Son of God, but Christ referred him to the Son of Man, saying, "You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man" (John 1:51). Christ being a man in His humanity is for God to carry out His economy, and the goal of God's economy is for the Triune God to be incorporated with man to be an incorporation. The New Jerusalem is the universal incorporation of God with man. For God to carry out His economy to have this incorporation, a constitution of God and man, man needs to be mingled with God. Without this, the whole universe means nothing. This truth is the unique truth in the whole universe. God needs man to match Him, to be united with Him, to be mingled with Him, to be incorporated into one incorporation with Him. The New Jerusalem will be the consummate incorporation of God and man. In eternity the New Jerusalem will stand to declare to the whole universe that this is God's eternal goal for His expression and for His enlargement.</P><P>The sixty-six books of the Bible are very consistent, but to see what the Bible unveils requires light. Apparently all the books are different, but in the unique truth the entire Bible is consistent. The Bible unveils to us that God's economy is to have God and man incorporated into an incorporation. Without man, with whom could God be incorporated? Therefore, there is the need of man. The one Bible reveals to us only one thing. First, God wants to be united with man, to have a union with man. Then God wants to be mingled with man. Consummately, God wants to be incorporated with man to be an incorporation. This enlarged, divine-human, universal incorporation is God's eternal goal, which is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate union, mingling, and incorporation of God and man. I hope that we all can see this.</P>
