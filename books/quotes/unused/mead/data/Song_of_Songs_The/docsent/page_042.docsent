   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Lord's Answer 5:1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 5:1 says, "I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although this garden belongs to the Lord, this verse shows us that He does not come into His garden all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, He only comes at special requests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to remember that although we belong to the Lord after we have consecrated ourselves to Him, it is a constant consecration that brings the Lord into our garden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, we should not be self-satisfied with the fact that we belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to tell ourselves this fact repeatedly and tell the Lord the same thing repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Otherwise, without our consciously declaring it, the Lord will not come into His garden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord accepts every consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As soon as the maiden makes an invitation, the Lord responds.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I am not mistaken, this is perhaps the one prayer that will receive the most ready answer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord reckons everything as His.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word "my" appears at least nine times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"My garden, my sister, my spouse...my myrrh with my spice...my honeycomb with my honey...my wine with my milk."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He receives everything except the payment for a harlot and the price for a dog Deut 23:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The significance of this is pure enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At this point, the Lord has occupied His place, the place that He had not occupied in the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By this time, He has truly gained something and seen the fruit of His labor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to note that the consecration and the acceptance in this verse are different from the ordinary consecration and acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Formerly, consecration was the offering of ourselves into His hand for Him to do something in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The consecration in this verse, however, comes after the Lord has done His work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not for the purpose of taking something from His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The maiden is filled with the Lord's work already, and this joy, this fruit, and this glory should go back to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, this is a consecration of the fragrance of the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same is true with the acceptance here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Formerly, the Lord's acceptance was for the purpose of gaining some ground to plant something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now the acceptance is not for planting, because "all the chief spices" are in the garden already.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now the acceptance is for pure enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Formerly, we were a barren ground, and there was no way to till it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We consecrated ourselves at that time to His hand and allowed Him to work and make us a perfect garden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now to whom does the garden belong?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Experienced believers often find that the latter consecration is harder than the first consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet it is more glorious than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only this consecration will give the Lord the fruit of His labor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Who do the friends and the beloved refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As Savior and Lord, the Lord now enjoys everything in the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the friends and the beloved must refer to the Triune God who is participating in the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If they refer to the sinners, it would not say "beloved," and if they refer to believers, they cannot be the consecrated one and can only be the companions of the consecrated one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet the Lord deserves all the enjoyment here; there is no room for other believers' participation.</S>
