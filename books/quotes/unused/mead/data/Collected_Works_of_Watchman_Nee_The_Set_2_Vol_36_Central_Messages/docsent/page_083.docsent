   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Old Testament, there is one book which shows us what obsessed people are like.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This book is Malachi.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1:2 it says, "I have loved you, says Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet the Israelites said, "How have You loved us?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word which came out of the mouth of the Israelites was different from ordinary lying.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They were not afraid to say to God, "How have You loved us?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This proves that they sincerely believed in their heart that God had not loved them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They did not believe the facts, they took falsehood as truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is being obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Malachi 1:6 says, "A son honors his father, and a servant his lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore if I am a Father, where is My honor?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And if I am the Lord, where is My fear? says Jehovah of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet they said, "How have we despised Your name?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They did not fear Jehovah, yet they believed that they had not despised His name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 7 says, "You offer defiled bread upon My altar."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet they said, "How have we defiled You?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were wrong, yet they believed that they were right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Malachi 2:13 says, "And this second thing you do: You cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping and sighing, so that He no longer regards the sacrifice or receives it with pleasure from your hand."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet they said, "For what reason?" v. 14 . They did something wrong, yet they did not believe that there was such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 17 says, "You have wearied Jehovah with your words."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet they said, "How have we wearied Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They wearied God, yet they did not believe that they had done so.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Malachi 3:7 says, "From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Return to Me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet they asked God, "How shall we return?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It seems as if they had never gone away from God's ordinances.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is obsession.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Examples of Obsession in the Gospel of John</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The New Testament also has a book which speaks a great deal about obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The following are some examples.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Israelites seemed to be perfectly at peace with their conscience when they rejected the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 44 says, "How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They did not seek the real glory; they sought that which is not glory.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>John 7:19 says, "Has not Moses given you the law?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet none of you keeps the law.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why do you seek to kill Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The crowd answered, "You have a demon!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Who is seeking to kill You?" v. 20 . They were obsessed by their lies.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Otherwise, they would not have said, "You have a demon."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They wanted to kill the Lord, yet they were so obsessed that they thought the Lord had a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 27 says, "But we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from."</S>
