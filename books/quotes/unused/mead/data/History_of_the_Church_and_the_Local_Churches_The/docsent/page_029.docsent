   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Practicality of the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After seeing the ground of the church, Brother Nee became clear concerning the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I still remember the day in 1940 when I was in Shanghai attending his training.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On this day he and I were walking down a staircase.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He showed me his hand and said, "Brother, we have the blueprint in our hand concerning the church life."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After he said this, I wondered what the blueprint was.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I wanted to see this blueprint.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, Brother Nee showed us the blueprint of the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not think that our present practice of the church life is a light thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Shanghai in 1940 I saw the blueprint of the practicality of the church life, and I brought it to northern China to put it into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have to testify that it really works.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through the outworking of this blueprint, a big revival was brought to northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We enjoyed such a revival through the practice of the church life according to the blueprint Brother Nee had received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>27.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From 1940 Brother Nee always stressed the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was very burdened that we would see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He gave message after message and conference after conference, always stressing this one thing seeing the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee was very nice, gentle, and kind, but with us trainees, he was very frank at times.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He would ask if we had seen the Body, and then he would ask some to give a testimony of what they had supposedly seen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After their testimony he would say, "You haven't seen the Body."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then he would point out what they said to prove that they had not seen the Body and that the Body was merely a theory or a doctrine to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may know the Body doctrinally, but it may not be real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He stressed again and again that we need the vision of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>28.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Authority of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Nee also stressed the authority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He imparted this vision to the church from 1940 through 1942.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>29.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Coordination</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Along with the vision of the Body of Christ, and the truth concerning the authority of the church, Brother Nee shared concerning coordination for the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our practical life in the church should be in coordination with the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>30.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Preaching of the Gospel by the Church</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Beginning in 1940 we began to see the preaching of the gospel by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This preaching is not merely by some individual evangelist, but by the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The result of such evangelism by the church was very fruitful.</S>
