   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now I would like to say a word of love, advice, and warning.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not think that we will abandon the churches which are in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will not abandon anyone or any church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, we would still take care of them and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It does not matter whether a church is high or low, living or not living; it is still the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We still have to bear the burden to take care of that church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should never criticize, despise, or form parties.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must maintain the present churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Otherwise, the Lord's recovery is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we lose the churches, we lose the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, you elders must take care of the church and participate in the normal church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, you should practice the new way, the "computer way."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The elders should take the lead to practice the "computer way" of contacting sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then within a short time your practice will influence others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others will rise up to follow you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You do not need to make an announcement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You do not need to promote this in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, you should just go along with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the other hand, you should practice the "computer way" to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nobody will condemn you as long as you do not promote, criticize, despise, or form parties among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, all will appreciate what you are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are a number of saints who will not be able to take this way, but they will still appreciate your taking of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I appreciate all the saints who are able to use a computer, even though I myself do not use one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should sympathize with the saints who do not feel that they can take the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But at least we should expect that one-fifth of the saints will take the "computer way."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If one-fifth take this way, the "computer age" will be brought in. Not everyone in the United States can use a computer, but many people can.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The using of the computer is gradually spreading into all parts of society.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the initial stage, I only expect one-fifth of the saints in the church to know and practice the "computer way."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that this will issue in a thirty-percent increase yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This fellowship is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to be the forerunners who take the new way, the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all need the Lord's grace to have a change in our concept in shepherding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, you have to release everything concerning the church out of your hand, and let the saints share in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You need to be revolutionized with this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is hard to ask the saints to take the "computer way" if you do not take it first.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You should take the lead to learn the "computer."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the "computer age" will come into the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our way of contacting sinners is the most effective and quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This way will change the entire structure of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are some churches in the recovery that have had about the same number for over ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The saints merely come together in a routine way every week.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no "new blood," no new element.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we need the spreading and the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope that within the next few years there will be more local churches in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I beg you elders to have a change in your concept, in your view.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then you should sacrifice something for the Lord to learn these two things the "computer way" of preaching the gospel and the "computer way" of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You do not need to promote these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You do not need to charge the saints or rebuke them for not prophesying in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You should take the lead to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then others will follow you, and you can encourage them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You must contact some of the saints meeting with you to shepherd them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Shepherd them into the proper morning revival and daily victory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, you should practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the other hand, you should go to tutor the saints one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to contact sinners one by one and tutor the saints one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our work should be a one-by-one work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Gradually, you will gain someone to do what you are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you elders expect the church to be revived in a general way, it will never happen.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This has been an unfulfilled dream in Christianity for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You should work on people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Go to contact sinners one by one and go to tutor the saints one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You do not need to give messages in the meeting to encourage them, advise them, or rebuke them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not rebuke, charge, or impose things on them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Just do it yourself directly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then you will see a change in your meeting every week.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you tutor the saints one by one, you will gradually gain a good number of saints to function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is how to shepherd the church in the God-ordained way.</S>
