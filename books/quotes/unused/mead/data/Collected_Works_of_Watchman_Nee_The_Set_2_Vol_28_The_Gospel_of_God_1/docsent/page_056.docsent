   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRUE MEANING OF REPENTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us study a few passages to see what repentance is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 2:37-38 says, "And when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, What should we do, brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And Peter said to them, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When some read these verses, they may say that faith is not even mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All that is mentioned is to repent, to be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and to receive the promised Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Faith is not mentioned at all; instead, only repentance is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this was not what was spoken prior to this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The apostle did not begin with repentance, baptism, forgiveness of sins, and the receiving of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was not the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not the first word that Peter preached.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was the last word Peter spoke after he gave his message.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Prior to this, Peter had said, "Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man shown by God to you to be approved by works of power and wonders and signs, which God did through Him in your midst, even as you yourselves know this man...you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed; whom God has raised up" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peter was saying, "This is our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has even exalted Him to the heavens and has made Him Lord and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the testimony of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has sent us, the apostles, to testify to the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit has been poured out, giving the one hundred and twenty the gift of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the testimony of the Holy Spirit, testifying that the Lord Jesus has been glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are two testimonies here.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostles testify of resurrection, while the Holy Spirit testifies of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The apostle Peter preached to them the word of God and showed them what they had done to the Lord Jesus and what God had done to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 36 says, "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word of God had been preached, and the apostles had shown them what God had done and what they had done.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please remember that slightly more than a month before Pentecost, the same group of people were shouting, "Take Him away!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Take Him away!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Crucify Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 19:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were instrumental in His murder and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Formerly, they considered the Lord Jesus as worthy of death; they shouted to crucify Him and to release Barabbas instead Luke 23:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What had happened?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Acts 2:37 says, "When they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, What should we do, brothers?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is to believe in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word of God was preached, and they received it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They realized that what God had done to the Lord Jesus was very different from what men had done to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, the Holy Spirit was also there testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They could not refuse that testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, they spoke this pleading word, asking what they should do now that they had crucified the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they had not crucified the Lord, there would still be the chance of restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But once the Lord Jesus was crucified, what should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They accepted the apostle's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, the apostle told them that they had to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They had to repent because of their concepts and view concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In addition, they had to be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be baptized is to receive Him, to believe in Him, and to confess Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The meaning of being in the Lord's name is to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When they do this, their sins will be forgiven, and they will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can now realize that this is a group of people who had received the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since they had believed that much already, the apostle was able to tell them to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This did not touch their behavior, but their view.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The apostle was not saying that if they did not change their former conduct, they could not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is absolutely not a matter of dealing with a person's conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What they had to do was judge themselves and be baptized upon the name of the Lord Jesus as an expression of their faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way, their sins would be forgiven, and the Holy Spirit would be received by them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, the condition for our salvation is faith alone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Salvation is given to us freely.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need not do anything to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is God Himself who has come to save us because of His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Acts 3:19-20 says, "Repent therefore and turn, that your sins may be wiped away, so that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we read this verse, we may think that repentance is a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is true that verse 19 seems to indicate that repentance is a condition of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But we must pay attention to the whole passage from verse 1 on.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot read verse 19 alone.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It would be wrong for us to start from verse 19 and explain it according to our thought.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>From verse 1 on, we find the story of a lame man being healed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When this lame man looked at Peter, Peter said to him, "Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk" v. 6 . When all the people saw a man who was born lame begin to walk, they marveled.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Peter then stood up to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First, he explained that this was not his work, and it was not through his godliness that such a person was made to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In verses 15-20 he said, "And the Author of life you killed, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>And upon faith in His name, His name has made this man strong...Repent therefore and turn, that your sins may be wiped away, so that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What was he saying?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He was talking about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He was saying that we believe in His being raised from the dead, that we believe in His name, and that His name had made the man strong.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Here was a lame man that everyone knew.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It was faith from the Lord that had made this man whole.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we want to believe, just as they had believed, we have to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we want faith, we have to pay attention to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we want to receive Him, we must have a new view and a new evaluation concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must have this qualification.</S>
