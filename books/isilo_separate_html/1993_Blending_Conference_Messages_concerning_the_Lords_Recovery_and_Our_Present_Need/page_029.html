The Spirit's sealing in verse 13 is a great blessing to us. We need to consider why the Spirit comes to seal us. This is because we have become God's inheritance, and He needs to put His seal upon us. We always want to put our name on what we treasure. When we buy a beautiful Bible, we may put our seal with our name upon it to show that it belongs to us. But this sealing implies even more. The ink on the seal saturates the sealed paper, so this sealing is the dispensing.</P><P>Ephesians 4:30 says that this sealing with the Spirit as the divine ink will last until our body is redeemed. The sealing of the Spirit with its permeating and soaking within us is still going on every day. This takes place whether we obey Him or disobey Him. If we obey Him, He seals us. If we do not obey Him, He may seal us even more. The Lord may impress a young person to go to a conference with the saints. Instead, he may go to the theater. In the theater the Lord continues to seal him, and this sealing is a bothering within him, impressing him to leave the theater and go to the conference.</P><P>When I was a young person, I played soccer a great deal. After I was saved by the Lord, no one told me not to play soccer. I still went to play. But one day when I was playing, something touched me within. That was the sealing of the Holy Spirit. When the ball came to me, I could not kick it. I just walked away and could no longer give myself to play soccer again. The whole team was surprised at me. This was the issue of the Spirit's sealing within me. I can never forget that experience.</P><P>The sisters may desire to go shopping, not just to take care of their need but to satisfy their lust for material things. When they are shopping for things on sale, the Spirit will be sealing them, impressing them to go back home. When we were regenerated, we were sealed by the Spirit, and this sealing is still going on every day.</P><P>This sealing eventually becomes the pledging to guarantee that God is our inheritance. The sealing is to confirm that we are God's inheritance. It confirms His ownership of us. This sealing then becomes a pledging to guarantee, to assure us, that God will be our inheritance. The pledging is also the Spirit's dispensing.</P><P>Now we can see the three aspects of the divine dispensing. The Father's nature and life have been dispensed into us; the Son's life element has been dispensed into us; and the Spirit's essence is also dispensed into our being. So we have the essence, the element, and the life and nature of the Triune God all the time dispensed into our being. The issue is that we are constituted the Body of Christ. We are the Body of Christ because we have received the dispensing of the divine life, nature, element, and essence into our being.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
