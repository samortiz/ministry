 <h2 class="head2">Speaking to the Churches</h2>
<p>Chapters two and three of Revelation say seven times that the Spirit speaks to all the churches (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). The Spirit as the sevenfold intensified Spirit is now speaking to all the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking to Testify of the Labors<br />
and Works of the Martyrs</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:12 and 13 say, &ldquo;Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from this time forth. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.&rdquo; &ldquo;The dead&rdquo; here refers to the martyrs under the persecution of Antichrist during the great tribulation. The Spirit functions in speaking to testify of the labors and works of the martyrs.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking with the Bride as the Universal Couple<br />
 to Express the Consummated Triune God<br />
in the Transformed Tripartite Man<br />
in God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>The Spirit also functions in speaking with the bride as the universal couple to express the consummated Triune God in the transformed tripartite man in God&rsquo;s economy (Rev. 22:17). At the end of the entire Bible, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, who has been processed and consummated to be the consummation of the processed Triune God, is the Husband. He is the Husband because He speaks with the bride, the wife. The One who speaks with the bride must be the Husband. The wife is the bride and the Husband, the Spirit, is the One who is speaking with the bride. The consummated Triune God is speaking here as <em>the</em> Spirit. <em>The</em> Spirit is speaking as the Husband with His wife, the bride.</p>
<p>The bride of this couple is the transformed tripartite man. Such a couple is the consummation of all the work of God through the old creation and the new creation and the consummation of the entire Bible. The working God eventually becomes the consummated Triune God, and the redeemed man eventually becomes the transformed tripartite man. The consummated Triune God is the Husband, and the transformed tripartite man is the bride. This couple is altogether the completion and the consummation of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. We are a part of this universal bride. We are in the bride because we are a part of the bride. We are not alone because we have our Bridegroom! We are not a part of a widow. We are a part of the bride who has the Bridegroom!</p>
