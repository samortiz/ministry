   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This sanctification, which takes place before our faith in Christ and before our justification through Christ s redemption, separates us from the world unto the obedience of faith in Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Holy Spirit does His sanctifying work by enlightening and seeking us, convicting us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment, thus causing us to repent and turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our repentance, which is a result of the sanctifying work of the Spirit, causes us to have a change of mind, to turn from things other than God to the kingdom of God and to God Himself.</S>
