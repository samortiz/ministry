<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST CRUCIAL ELEMENT IN THE CHANGE&mdash;<br />
BUILDING UP THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Building up the home meetings in every believer&rsquo;s home is the first and foremost thing in our new beginning. This is not a matter of choice. As long as a person is a believer, he is our brother in the Lord, even if he is the weakest, coldest, and most indifferent, backslidden person. Therefore, we must make every effort to build up a meeting in his home. I said from the beginning that the small group is the foundation for the building up of the church and that such a small group must be built upon the foundation of the home meetings.</p>
<p>The scriptural basis for the small groups and the home meetings is the expression <em>from house to house</em> in Acts 2:46 and 5:42. One and a half years ago I pointed out emphatically that on the day of Pentecost, as soon as the church was raised up on the earth, it began to meet from house to house. That was an unprecedented move; it was something that Judaism had never done before. It was not an idea that Peter inherited from the Jewish religion. Rather, it was a brand new thing, a creative act of God, and something that He ordained. Based on this, we were bold to say that we must have the small meetings, the group meetings, not only the big meetings. Eventually, the group meetings brought in the home meetings.

<h2 class="head1">HAVING HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The practice of the saints in the early church was to meet in their homes (2:46; 5:42; 20:20). To gain the increase, we need to have the home meetings. The church has been dead, passive, and low in the rate of increase because we do not have the crucial way to gain people through the home meetings. We need to have meetings in the new believers&rsquo; homes, in the homes of the ones we gain through our preaching of the gospel. If we can only gain people without setting up meetings in their homes, this will be a failure. The most successful way is to gain people&rsquo;s homes for home meetings. Meetings in the homes will work to the uttermost. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 9: The Eldership and the God-ordained Way (1),</em> p. 10)</p>
<h2 class="head1">BRINGING THE MEETINGS<br />
TO THE HOMES</h2>
<p>To bring the meetings to the homes is the very heart of the God-ordained way. It will be a great failure in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery if we cannot bring the meetings to the homes. For the past twenty years in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have been bringing people to the meeting halls. The more we work in this way, the fewer people we have, and the worse the condition of the homes becomes. More and more our meetings have become a kind of Sunday morning service. In Christianity many people &ldquo;go to church&rdquo; to listen to the singing of hymns and to attend the &ldquo;service,&rdquo; but their homes are deplorable; their tables may still be scattered with mah-jongg game pieces. In the morning the family attends the service, but in the afternoon the mah-jongg game goes on in the homes. In order to overturn this degraded situation, we must bring the meetings to the homes. (<em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;sRecovery, Book 1: The Vision and Definite Steps for the Practice of the New Way</em>, p. 216)</p>

<p>Acts tells us that the early churches met in the homes of the saints. The Epistles tell us of four different homes in which the churches met (Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19; Col. 4:15; Philem. 2). To meet in the homes is organic. If we only have a meeting hall with a definite, regular schedule, this will bring the entire church into the &ldquo;box&rdquo; of organization and causes us to lose the organic ability. If we take the way revealed in Acts, whatever we do will be organic, not organizational. (<em>The Excelling Gift for the Building Up of the Church,</em> p. 52)</p>

<p>Meeting in the believers&rsquo; homes is for all the members of Christ to function. In any big meeting it is hard for the saints to function. But in a small meeting with four or five, or two or three, even a small boy or girl could function. He or she could say, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus loves me, and it is so good that I love Him.&rdquo; This is a small function, but do not despise it. The new believers will function in a small way at first, but from that point, they will continue to progress in life and in function. By the functioning of all the members, the small home meetings will grow and be built up. When a new couple brings forth a little infant, they have the faith that their family will be built up. The same applies to the home meetings. We should exercise our faith and practice the home meetings with much expectation.
