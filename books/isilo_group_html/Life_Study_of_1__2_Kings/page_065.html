Ben-hadad, the King of Syria,<br>Waging War against Israel</H2><P>In 6:8-23 we are told that Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, waged war against Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Elisha Unveiling the Strategy of Ben-hadad<br>to Jehoram and Instructing Him</H2><P>Elisha unveiled the strategy of Ben-hadad to Jehoram king of Israel and instructed him how to stay away from Ben-hadad's strategy (vv. 8-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Ben-hadad Sending an Army<br>to Besiege the City of Dothan</H2><P>After he was informed that it was Elisha who had unveiled his strategy to Jehoram, Ben-hadad sent an army to besiege the city of Dothan (vv. 12-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Elisha's Young Attendant<br>Seeing the Army and Fearing</H2><P>Elisha's young attendant saw the army in the morning and was afraid, not knowing what to do (vv. 15-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Elisha Praying That Jehovah<br>Would Open His Young Attendant's Eyes</H2><P>Elisha prayed that Jehovah would open his young attendant's eyes. Jehovah opened his eyes, and he saw that the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha (v. 17). These were just for defense, not for offense. Elijah's miracles were offensive, but Elisha's were defensive. The horses and chariots of fire around Elisha were not for fighting but only for protecting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Elisha Praying That God<br>Would Strike Ben-hadad's Army with Blindness</H2><P>Ben-hadad's army came down to Elisha, and Elisha prayed that God would strike them with blindness. After Jehovah had struck them with blindness according to Elisha's word, Elisha told them to follow him, and he brought them to Samaria. Then he asked God to open their eyes, and they saw that they were in the midst of Samaria (vv. 18-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Elisha Instructing Jehoram<br>to Prepare a Feast for the Army of Ben-hadad</H2><P>Jehoram wanted to kill the army of Ben-hadad, but Elisha stopped him and instructed him to prepare a feast for them and then let them return to their master. After they had eaten and drunk, they went to their master, and the bands of Syria no longer came to invade the land of Israel (vv. 21-23). In this matter of preparing a feast for the enemies we see the New Testament ministry (Rom. 12:20-21). The Syrians were stopped by being invited to a feast.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Kings &nbsp; pg 65</div><br></body></html>
