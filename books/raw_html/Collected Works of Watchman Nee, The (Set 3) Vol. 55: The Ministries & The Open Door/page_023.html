<h2 class="head1">SUPPLY RECEIVED THROUGH FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>For the sake of His testimony in Tangshan, the Lord has chosen some brothers and sisters here to meet to worship and serve Him. In order to preserve and lead us, He has led us to fellowship often with His servants and all the churches. This enables us to live in the supply of life in the Body, as well as preserves us in His will and grace. In our last letter, we reported the condition of the assembly in Tangshan. Have you read it? During the past two months, Brother Sia came from Tientsin to fellowship with the brothers and sisters and to confirm that we are going on here in a proper condition. Because of His love for us, the Lord has given each of the brothers and sisters trials of sickness and accidents. This has brought us to an awareness of our smallness and weakness. We can only prostrate ourselves before the Lord. We beg the Lord to deliver us and have mercy on us so that by His grace we would not become those who slip away in this age! Because the newly saved ones have grown so much in life, we could not delay baptizing them. After fellowshipping with Brother Sia and receiving confirmation, we baptized them peacefully and successfully with the Lord's support on August 1 (the Lord's Day). There were thirteen brothers and eight sisters. Tangshan now has a total of thirty-eight brothers and sisters who are baptized and who have been received into the Body. However, we have not yet established the table to remember the Lord. We are still looking for the Lord's arrangement concerning this matter. We want to fellowship this matter with you and ask you to pray for us. If you have the burden, please give us some advice concerning when and how we should establish the table. We hope you brothers will remember us for the sake of the commission of the Lord's glorious testimony. This is our report to you. May the grace of the Lord be with you!</p><p>The brothers in Tangshan,<br />Lee Ze-zhe, Wang Yu-zhai, Wang Gui-wu, Enoch Hsiao,<br />Dai Ju-yu, Chui Yu-lin<br />August 4, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: 7 Zuang-Yuan Third Strip, Tangshan City, Hopeh province</p><h2 class="head1">NO LONGER TAKING THE WAY<br />OF INDIVIDUALISM</h2><p>Two months ago, I received a letter from Brother Jin-zhien, saying that many brothers had "handed over themselves," but he did not tell me the details and the extent of their consecration. I thought that it was a general consecration in principle. It was not until two days ago, when I received and read Brother San-gang's own notes from the April conference in Shanghai that I realized that the extent of "handing over oneself" was not just an empty consecration in principle. It was so concrete that even one's choice of career and dwelling should be in accordance with the church and the gospel. My heart rejoiced because the Lord had mercy on me, a small brother in the remote locality of Siying, and allowed me to know His ordained way in this age. I am now willing to fully hand over myself, my job, and my dwelling. I do not want to "go my own way" any longer. I want to be restricted, and I want to submit to authority. I beg you brothers not to leave me behind.</p><p>A few years ago, as I was preparing to go inland to take the college entrance exam for an engineering degree, I was clear that my goal of being an engineer after graduation was only a temporary measure. When the time came, I would give up this earthly occupation and singleheartedly serve the Lord by preaching the word. When I was about to graduate last year, I felt to shorten this time of temporary commitment. Presently, I am forced to take up a little of my earthly occupation because I am still immature in the matter of serving Him. I am ready to give it up whenever He wants me to. I earnestly desire to receive more training during these days!</p><p>With regard to a job for me in Shanghai, it does not have to be with the Railroad Company. Any job will do, as long as I am capable of doing it, and as long as it does not take away from my time of learning with the church. Any job will do, even if it is not with the Railroad Company (private contractor, high school mathematics or physics teacher, or anything).</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Pao-sheng<br />June 15, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: c/o 38 Alley 240 Tung-Ren Road (23) Shanghai</p>
