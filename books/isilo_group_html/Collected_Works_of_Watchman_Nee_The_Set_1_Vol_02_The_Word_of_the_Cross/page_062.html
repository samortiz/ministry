Because he does not know how to deal with this kind of experience, much sorrow and discouragement may fill his heart. The nature that is born of the flesh has no goodness at all; but the nature that is born of God does not commit sins. The source and nature of the new man and the old man are opposites. But both natures are within the Christian. From the first man, we inherited sin, rebellion, and death. From the second man, we inherited righteousness, obedience, and life (Rom. 5:17-19).</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>The old man:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"The flesh" (John 3:6)</li>		<li>"Your father the devil" (John 8:44)</li>		<li>"The heart is deceitful" (Jer. 17:9)</li>		<li>"Cannot please God" (Rom. 8:7-8)<br>		The best moralists, the most devoted religionists, and the most compassionate, charitable people are far away from God 		and from eternal life unless they are born again. They are the same as the tax collectors and harlots. Without being 		born again, one cannot please God, because his heart is deceitful and his father is the devil.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The new man:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Born of the Spirit" (John 3:5-6)</li>		<li>"New man" (Eph. 4:24)</li>		<li>"A new creation" (2 Cor. 5:17)</li>		<li>"Begotten...of God" (John 1:11-13)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The new man is Christ living within you:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Christ in you" (Col. 1:27)</li>		<li>"Christ our life" (Col. 3:3-4)</li>		<li>"Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The battle:<br>	The new nature and the old nature are archenemies. Both of them want to dominate completely. The old nature has its power and 	its will. The battle between these two natures is very severe. Therefore, many young believers doubt their regeneration to the 	point that they are completely disappointed (Rom. 7:14-25). How should we deal with our old nature? "Cast out" (Gal. 	4:22-31).</li>	<li>The victory-three ways:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>On the negative side:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Crucified with Christ" (Gal. 2:20; 5:24)</li>			<li>"Reckon...to be dead" (Rom. 6:11)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>On the positive side:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Walk by the Spirit" (Gal. 5:16)</li>			<li>"Walk by the Spirit" (Gal. 5:25)</li>				</ol></li>		<li>On the negative and positive side:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Put to death...you will live" (Rom. 8:13)</li>			</ol>		The way to overcome is not by self-discipline or self-imposition. The way to overcome the old nature is (1) by the 		cross of the Lord, acknowledging that the self is dead already, (2) by following the leading of the Holy Spirit in all 		our endeavors, and (3) by allowing the Holy Spirit and the cross to work together to put the old man to death.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 02: The Word of the Cross &nbsp; pg 62</div><br></body></html>
