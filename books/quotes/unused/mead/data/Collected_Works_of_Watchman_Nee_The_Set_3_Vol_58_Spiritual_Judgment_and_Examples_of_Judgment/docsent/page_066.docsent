   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 46 Date:August 26, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER H. L.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I do not know the exact date when I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My parents were both Christians, and I am by nature a quiet person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was ten years old, I began to sit through sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because my older brother and sister passed away early, I became the darling of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While I was in medical school, I heard Dr. Stearn's preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some of the words pricked my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time I was busy with my school work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day I became sick with an almost incurable illness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I prayed, "Lord, if You heal me, I will consecrate myself to You."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I became well soon after that.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The matter was forgotten, and I put away my consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although I read the Bible often, I had no desire to seek after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1942 the church received me, and in 1943 the Lord wanted me to offer up my possessions to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After I made the offering, I became proud, thinking that I had done something that deserved merit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's word came to me: "I love mercy, not sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In spiritual things, I am easily affected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some time ago I became sick again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This time I needed long-term convalescence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I stayed in bed for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of my prolonged stay in the hospital, I neglected my family.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, my wife and I were not in harmony very much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When my children were disobedient and my wife reported these things to me, I would become unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day the Lord seemed to say to me, "Honor your wife."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I did not agree in my heart, because I thought that my wife was the one who should submit to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later I saw that I was actually behind my wife in everything, and I began to honor her.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once I obeyed the Lord this way, the problems in the family went away.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the Lord's mercy that I am able to come up to the mountain without many hindrances.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 7:14 says, "The unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The gospel preacher always tells others that there is no middle ground.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, between salvation and perdition there is another ground.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An unbelieving wife is different from other kinds of wives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although children born into Christian families are not automatically saved, they are on a different ground.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are closer to the Lord, but few of them ever are saved in a dramatic way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God deals with men in fragmentary, fundamental, or supplementary ways.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes God deals with men in a fragmentary way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At other times He deals with men in a fundamental way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At still other times He deals with them in a supplementary way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Supplementary dealing is similar to fragmentary dealing, except that the significance of the two dealings is different.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Supplementary dealing is additional; it is something added to a fundamental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fragmentary dealings are like symptomatic cures in medical treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fundamental dealings are like major operations, and supplementary dealings are like post-operative treatments of supplemental medications that help recover the health of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Fragmentary dealings must be accompanied by fundamental dealings before the former will become beneficial to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there are no fundamental dealings, the fragmentary dealings will become a frustration to the fundamental dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After there are fundamental dealings, supplementary dealings come as an added benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Outwardly, fragmentary dealings appear to be the same as supplementary dealings, but they are not the same inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The main difference is in the experience of a fundamental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once a person has a fundamental dealing, all fragmentary dealings become supplementary dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our brother was raised up in a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord has not dealt with him in any drastic way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It seems as if it is easy for him to simply pick up supplementary dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He has an advantage over others in that he can be spared of many miscellaneous dealings and can save some time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In our course of following the Lord, there are many big things and big revelations that we have to see.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not be distracted by the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If there are supplementary dealings, we have to accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the Lord is doing something big, however, we should not be held down by small things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to learn to pay attention to the big things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the president of a nation is conducting a meeting on national policy, and his wife cables and tells him that the servant has overcooked the rice, the president should not tend to such a small matter, even though his wife or servant may think that it is a big matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The same can be said of our Christian experience; we should not allow the small things in our living to affect the big things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today God is doing many big things in the believers and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But He often is frustrated because the believers have set their eyes on small things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our brother's view should be uplifted to see the big things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In order to take care of the overall need, he should turn away from insignificant and unrelated things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The experiences you had in the past can be considered as God's supplementary work in you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, you have overlooked the fundamental and great things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our brother has indeed been taking a straight course, but as he just now confessed, he is afraid of being influenced by others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It seems as if he has to be led by the hand before he can walk.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I hope that in the coming days our brother will place his attention on gaining knowledge of the major things.</S>
