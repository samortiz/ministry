   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REASONS FOR ISRAEL S DEGRADATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How could such a wonderful people who were God s elect, God s vine, God s bride, God s flock, and God s treasure become rebels, briars and thorns, a harlot, scorpions, and dross?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to answer this question, we need to consider the reasons for Israel s degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Idolatry</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first reason for their degradation was their idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ezekiel speaks again and again about the idols among the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not consider that an idol is always an outward image.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Idols are substitutes for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ezekiel 14:3 says, Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who set up idols in their hearts are estranged from the Lord through their idols v. 5 . Verse 4 says, Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him that cometh, according to the multitude of his idols.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In these verses we see a principle: All those who have idols within them and yet seek God in an outward way cannot find God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God will not be found by those who set up idols in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who seek the Lord with their whole heart will find Him Jer 29:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, God will not be found by those who seek Him outwardly, yet have idols inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there is an idol in our heart, something in our heart that occupies us instead of God, it will be useless for us to seek God, for in this situation God does not have a way to be found by us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anything within us that is a substitute for God is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever we love more than the Lord is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A scholarship, education, money, clothing, a wife, a husband, children all these can be idols, something or someone that we love more than God and that replaces God in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever is more important to us than the Lord is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first reason for the fall and degradation of Israel was idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The principle is the same with the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Revelation 2 we see that the degradation of the churches began with the leaving of the first love to the Lord v. 4 . The Lord Jesus said that the church in Ephesus had many good works, yet He had something against them, for they had left their first love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that they had some idols.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not love the Lord with the first love, this is a sign that we have some kind of idol.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whatever we love more than the Lord, is our idol.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we realize this, we will see that the cause of the degradation of Israel and of the church is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The people of Israel worshipped idols as substitutes for God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The situation is the same with a great many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most Christians have lost their first love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some love their missionary work much more than they love the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Others love their study of the Bible or their evangelistic outreach more than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many care for their work, but they do not care for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Dr. A. W. Tozer of the Christian and Missionary Alliance once said that if the Lord Jesus came into a conference of Christian leaders, they would not recognize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although they might be discussing their work for the Lord, if He were to come into their meeting, they would not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Tozer s observation indicates that it is common for Christians to love many things other than the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Association with the World</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Idols bring people into association with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The people of Israel had idols, and through these idols they were brought into contact and association with the world, that is, with the heathen nations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates that as long as we have something within us that is a substitute for the Lord, we will be associated with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may love various things in place of the Lord: money, a degree, a good job, an automobile, a house, a good living, and even our husband, wife, or children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anything that we love more than we love the Lord will bring us into association with the world and lead us into worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Walking after the Manner of the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the people of Israel became associated with the nations, they began to walk after the manners and customs of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that they followed the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to realize that the three causes of the fall and degradation of Israel are also the main causes of the fall and degradation of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These causes are loving something more than the Lord or in place of the Lord, association with the world, and walking after the manner of the heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although we are in the Lord s recovery, I am concerned that some may still have an idol within them, may still be associated with the world, and in their daily living may still walk after the manner of the heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not pattern our life after unbelievers in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, we should not follow the unbelievers in the matter of the style of dress.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not care for any particular style but care to have a proper outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The way we live, the way we spend our money, and the way we dress should not be after the manner of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are a holy people, and for this reason we must be different from the worldly people.</S>
