   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is inspiration?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The meaning of the Bible being God's inspiration is that at one time God breathed His breath upon this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without God's inspiration, the Bible could not be called the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Inspiration is the basis of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God inspired Paul to write the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was through God's inspiration of and His breath upon Paul that he wrote Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What then is revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is God's breathing upon the book of Romans once again as we open to it two thousand years later.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through revelation we touch God's word once again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Inspiration is a once-for-all occurrence, but revelation is a repeated occurrence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When God breathes His breath upon His word a second time, when we find light again through the Holy Spirit and the anointing upon His word to see what Paul once saw, we have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Revelation means God is doing something today; He is reviving today what He once gave to man through inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, this is something exceedingly glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is when God's Spirit revives His word in such a way that it becomes as living and full of life as when Paul wrote it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When God wrote that word through Paul, life was vibrant in both the writer and the writing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today the same words can be released once again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God can fill His word with the Holy Spirit once again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His anointing can once again act upon His word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When this happens, the word becomes as powerful, enlightening, and life-giving as it was before.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is what revelation is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is useless to merely study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a man does not have revelation, he can study every word from the first page to the last without hearing a single word from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At one time God spoke this word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if you want this word to be God's word today, you have to ask God to speak this word once again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This speaking will bring in many things God's word, light, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there is not this kind of speaking, the Bible will remain a closed and dead book to you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose one hundred brothers and sisters gather in a place, and God is speaking through them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is possible that not everyone will hear God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone hears the sound and the words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But some may hear God's speaking, while others may not.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some may be in touch with things of both realms, while others may be in touch with things of only one realm.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some may hear the doctrine, the truth, conveyed through the sounds and the words.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They may understand the thought, and those with a good memory may be able to recite the words over and over, but they may not have heard God's speaking at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hearing God's speaking is an altogether different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers and sisters, God's word is not just a doctrine or a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to hear the doctrine and the teaching, but in addition to hearing these things, we need to hear something else.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to hear God's personal speaking to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only after we have acquired that kind of hearing can we say, "Thank God, I have heard Your word."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only then can we say that we have touched something real.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose one hundred people listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ninety-nine may hear and understand everything that is said.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may know the doctrine, the teaching, and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They may nod their heads and say, "Yes, yes."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All ninety-nine may know these things, but it is possible that only the hundredth one, the one apart from the ninety-nine, receives a teaching beyond the teaching that the others receive, hears a voice beyond the voice that the others hear, and grasps a word beyond the word that the others grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He hears God's speaking in addition to hearing the teaching, and he bows his head and confesses, "I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>O God, save me."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such a man has heard God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The other ninety-nine have only touched things related to the human and physical aspect of the word; they have not heard God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is a fundamental difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The same thing can be said about reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is true that the Bible is God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At one time God spoke to Paul, Peter, and John through this word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But when some read this word, they only find words, expressions, doctrines, truths, and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They have everything except God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They can read the Bible for ten years without God having spoken to them once.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, have you ever heard someone testify, saying, "I have been reading the Bible for twenty years, but I still do not understand what it is saying"?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Have you ever heard someone stand up and say, "I have been reading the Bible for five or ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I thought I knew everything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But one day, God was merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He spoke a word to me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now I know that I did not know anything before"?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Brothers and sisters, an experienced person can readily tell the difference between these two.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One must have God's word in addition to man's word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In addition to man's speaking, there must also be God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If God does not open His mouth, nothing will avail.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These are two entirely different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One is the realm of doctrines, truths, teachings, words, language, and expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this realm anyone who is diligent and intelligent, who has a good mind and a sharp memory, can get by well.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But in the other realm, God has to reiterate His word to men.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Brothers and sisters, do you see the difference between the two?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God has spoken, and the words He has spoken are recorded verbatim in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But God also can speak to men a second time through the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is what we call God's speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God has to speak to us a second time through the words He once used.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He has to enlighten us a second time through His revealed light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He has to grant us fresh revelation within His established revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the basic principle of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Without this we do not have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Lest some among us do not understand the relationship between the Scripture and God's present revelation, I will use another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Suppose you realize that God once used you to speak something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It might not have been anything dramatic, but at least you can say that you had a definite sense that the Lord spoke something through you; there was definitely a special kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Suppose two months later you encounter a similar situation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You face the same kind of people, and the same kind of need arises.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You may feel that what you said two months ago is the most appropriate word for these people today.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You may have great assurance that you can help them in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But when you spoke two months ago, the anointing of the Spirit was with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When you repeat the same word today, however, you feel that you have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The power in the word is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Since you are speaking the same words that were so full of anointing, you think that the Holy Spirit will surely continue to anoint your word.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But this does not happen.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Holy Spirit may have anointed your word at one time, but this does not mean that He will anoint it whenever you speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must remember that a man can receive a word of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But this does not mean that it will be a word of revelation whenever he speaks the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The words may still be there, but the revelation may be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We can repeat the word, but we cannot repeat the revelation and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Revelation and anointing are in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We can only repeat and recall the words; we cannot repeat or recall the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We have to see the relationship between the ministry of the word and the Scriptures, or the relationship between the Bible and the word.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>A sinner may come to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we speak John 3:16, he may readily confess that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>A little later another person may come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We may be in the same room and quote the same verse, but the Holy Spirit may not speak, and the second person may not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>John 3:16 has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The question is whether or not the anointing and the revelation are still present.</S>
