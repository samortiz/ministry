<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Giving to the Poor for the Purpose of Being Delivered from the Power of Mammon</H2><P>Today, some people are bound by the world, but the bondage of money is more serious than the bondage of the world. Why do we have to give to the poor? To give to the poor is not merely for the sake of the poor ones. It is for the purpose of delivering ourselves from the power of mammon. When we do this, we promptly take care of the problem of money in our hands. Some people think that to spend money on the poor people is for the sake of the poor people. It is true that it is a good thing for a poor person to be saved through our giving. But even if he is not saved, it is still a good thing for us to give. A person who cares much for money will go into eternity alone; no one will thank him. But those who spend money on others will find others welcoming them in the heavens. Those who offer up themselves in laboring must also offer up themselves in material giving. It is one thing to be poor. It is another thing to have the kind of poverty that Paul refers to, which enriches many (2 Cor. 6:10). Today, the amount of excess we have is the amount of sin we have. The amount of excess we have is the amount of idols we have.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING SUBMISSION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY</H2><P>Brother Lee asked: How can one see the authority of the Body?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>First Finding Out the Deputy Authority</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: With some people, their submission seems to be a selective one. In order to practice submission, the first thing to ask is who is above me. When we go to work in the secular world, the first thing we ask is who the boss is. If we do not get this question settled, we will not be able to do a proper job, not to mention the possibility of being punished. The same principle applies to working in an office or in any institution. For many people, the first thing that comes to their mind when they sit down is how to be the boss. Such people need to learn a serious lesson of submission. Submission is a lesson that a man has to learn before God. We have to be disciplined to such an extent that we bear a submissive nature. Whenever any brother or sister or co-worker goes to a place, he or she has to find out who his or her authority is.</P><P>For example, the brothers and sisters who are staying at our guest houses have to submit to the authority in that house. When they come to the meeting, they have to submit to the ushers and have to sit where they are told to sit. Every house that you stay in has its own authority. A Christian should learn to look for authority and to submit to authority. All those who pretend to be the head do not know what headship means in the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submission without Any Preference</H2><P>I have never seen a man who says that he knows the Head, yet does not submit to Christ's deputy authority. A person who knows the Lord will never be selective in the matter of submission. For example, Brother Witness' children cannot be selective in their submission to their father. If a brother or a sister has never learned to submit to every deputy authority assigned by the Lord, he is under the greatest deception. The Bible says that there is no authority except from God (Rom. 13:1).</P><P>There are very few places in the Bible that talk about direct submission to God. Most of the time it talks about submission to man. Wherever we go, what we have to do is to submit, and not to criticize freely with our lips. If others give you some special authority, that is up to them; what you have to do is to learn to submit. Many people have never learned the lessons. Everywhere they go, they tear down the authorities, and they do not bridle their tongues. This kind of people are rebellious ones. May the Lord be merciful to us, that we will not be wild Christians. Not only should we not be selective in our submission; we should be actively seeking after the ones we should submit to.</P>
