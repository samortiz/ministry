   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ephesians 4:12-16 occupies a special place in the New Testament because it shows us the mystery concerning the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Without these few verses, we would not know how to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we must say that to build up the Body of Christ is not to build up a congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A congregation is an organization, but the Body of Christ is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An organism is altogether a matter of life, whereas an organization has no life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, a table is framed together from pieces of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is just an organization; it does not have any life within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A robot may do all kinds of things, but it is still an organization; it has no life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the contrary, I stand here not as an organization but as an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My whole being is a story of life; every part of me is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some think that since the church is a congregation, it must be an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, immediately after Paul mentioned the church in Ephesians 1:22, he said in verse 23 that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some Bible expositors have considered the Body of Christ to be a metaphor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Bible says explicitly that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not a metaphor, but a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the Head, and the church is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since the Head is an organism, the Body must also be an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, organization has no place in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some may ask, "Since there are elders in the church, is this not an organization?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Apparently it seems to be an organization, but actually the eldership is not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The elders are such not by their position but by their degree of life in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why 1 Peter 5 charges the elders to shepherd the flock of God among them, not lording it over them but becoming examples to the flock vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows us that in the church the elders are there not by organization but by their life; they are to be the examples to the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A sheep is a very communal animal; the whole flock follows the leading of one head sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elders are the head sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, the elders are like the shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But actually, the Lord did not ask them to be the shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, He charged them to be the head sheep, taking the lead in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, this is not organizational but organic.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not based on arrangement but on life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, while I am speaking here, not only does my mouth move, my whole being hands, head, eyes, feet, and the whole body move as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When one part of the body is sick, the whole body cares for it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not by arrangement nor is it artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, it is something organic.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some have said that the local church is an autonomous congregation: each should be governed by itself, and all the localities are separate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Seemingly this saying is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually it is wrong because each church is not an individual body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Body is the sum total of all the churches added together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a body one cannot carve out any autonomy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the shoulder, the arm, the hands, the head, the chest, and the legs all separate themselves into autonomies, the body is completely dismembered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though superficially we may distinguish the different parts of the body, the blood circulation within them cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Two weeks ago we were visiting an elderly sister just as a middle-aged sister came to treat this one's leg pain with acupuncture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was so wonderful that by putting the needle in the sister's finger, the pain in her leg was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This tells us that the human body is organic and is an integrated whole.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Also, 1 Corinthians 12:26 says that when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, a body cannot be divided, and none of its members can be independent and autonomous.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we say that the church is organic, we do not mean that it is an organism composed of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, it is an organism composed of the life in our spirit, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The resurrected Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This Spirit enters into us who have received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, within us we have the same life and the same spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this one life we become organic, being joined together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The problem now is that we have two lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One is the original natural life; the other is the Lord Jesus as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Which life are we living by?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we live by our natural life, we are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we live according to Christ and live Christ, we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The church is Christ Himself in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When Christ is in Himself, He is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When He enters into the saints and lives with the saints, the Christ within the saints becomes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The reality of the church is Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The key to the building up of the Body of Christ is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we live our natural life, the Body of Christ will not be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For this reason we must deny and reject our natural life and must put the natural life aside.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this way, Christ will have the proper place within us and will be able to increase day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Body of Christ grows by the growth of Christ within us and is built up this way.</S>
