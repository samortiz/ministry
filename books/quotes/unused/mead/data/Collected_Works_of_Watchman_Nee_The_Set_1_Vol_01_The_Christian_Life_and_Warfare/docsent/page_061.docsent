   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the light of these facts about the spirit of man, and the Indwelling of the Holy Spirit, the eighth of Romans is simply wonderful: "If we walk in the spirit," "if ye live in the spirit," "the mind of the spirit is life," "ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"The mind of the flesh is death."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"The minding of the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the back of all these words can be seen the PERSONAL VOLITION of the man, as the helm of the ship, so to speak, at the centre.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ACTIVE EXERCISE OF THE WILL, moment by moment, determining his obedience to the mind of God through the Spirit, or his walk "after the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not a state you are brought into, but a position, where you have to choose every moment what you will do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore it is important that you understand what is flesh, and what is spirit, since you have to hourly decide which you will obey.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 Cor xv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>45 we read, "The first man Adam was made a living soul, the second Adam a life-giving spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the life you get from the first Adam is soul, and all the life you get from the new Adam is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First that which is natural, or soulish, and then "that which is spiritual," for there is a "natural body," and there is a "spiritual body."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So that the Church will be prepared for translation by being brought to know this spirit life, where the LIFE OF THE SPIRIT QUICKENS THE MORTAL BODY.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through all the tossing and the tumult and the suffering, God is preparing His Church for the coming of Jesus Christ; and through travail and often bitter tears, God's children are pressing on to know all that He can do for them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the spirit gets to its right place of predominance, united to Christ, and filled with the Spirit of God, and joined to the Lord, one spirit, "the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead, will quicken your mortal body by His Spirit that dwelleth in you."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The devil just now is contending for the bodies, and for the mind of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Did Christ not say to Peter "Satan hath obtained you by asking, that he may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not say "I have prayed that you should not go into it;" but "I have let you go into it; you are so self-confident, Peter; you boasted that if all would forsake Me you would not, and I had to let Satan have you to sift you, and to break that self-confidence from you."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was soulishness in Peter, it was not of the spirit; and so he was sifted and prepared for his Pentecost in the judgment hall of Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How could God have used Peter if he had not got rid of his self-confidence first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All Peter's impulses, that wild devotion, that something about Peter that made him go headlong out of the ship towards his Master God had to get it out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You would not say that Satan cannot touch a child of God, if you carefully read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul was a child of God, and yet he said he had a "messenger of Satan" to beat him, to keep him from being exalted above measure through the abundance of God's revelations to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through Satan's buffetings and siftings, the children of God will advance into the knowledge of union with Christ, and victory over sin and Satan, which will prepare them for the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the basis of this walk after the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>CALVARY.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must take our position with Christ in death, according to the sixth of Romans, crucified with Christ, we must know victory over sin, before we can talk about victory over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Satan holds through sin, and it is only on the ground of the cross, standing there crucified with Christ, that you can dare take your position of victory over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans vi. is the basis of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In its practical outworkings you will see the need of avoiding a clouded spirit, because if you get a shadow, you will lose that keen spirit light which illuminates the mind, and shows you what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the spirit is kept in clear unbroken victory, dominant over soul and body, the mind is given clear perception to detect the Spirit's leading; for "they that are led of the Spirit are the sons of God."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You know how to avoid sin, but do you know how to avoid weights?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The devil knows that a shadow on your spirit will suit his purpose as well as anything else, so he does all he can to bring troublesome things to you in order to shadow your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no outflow from a compressed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is absolutely essential for revival that the spirit shall be free, for thus only is the outflow continual.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The law for keeping the spirit in victory is that it must be always going out; it must never turn back upon itself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because these powers of darkness are outside, and they are always seeking to press you in. The enemy tries to accuse you, and get you occupied with yourself, and thus to lose all aggressive power against him; but you have to go out against him all the time.</S>
