   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 5:14 says, Believers were all the more being added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and of women.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of this, the high priest and all those with him that is, the sect of the Sadducees rose up and were filled with jealousy, and they laid their hands on the apostles and put them in public custody vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The expression public custody denotes the outer prison house, not the inner prison used for serious cases.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the night, an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison and led the apostles out v. 19 . Those guarding the doors did not know what had happened.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE WORDS OF THIS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the angel of the Lord rescued the apostles from prison, he said to them, Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life v. 20 . We need to pay attention to the word this, for it indicates a particular life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Greek word rendered words here is rhema, denoting the present spoken word, not the constant written word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the angel was saying to the apostles, Go and speak the present words of this life.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today certain Christians may talk about life, but their talk is altogether doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to seek mercy and grace from the Lord so that whenever we speak concerning the divine life, we speak the words of the very life we live.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that the divine life becomes our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is this life that we should minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Acts 5:26 says, Then the captain with the deputies went away and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.</S>
