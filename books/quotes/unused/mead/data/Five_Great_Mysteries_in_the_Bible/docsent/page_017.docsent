   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST COMING FROM THE POSITION OF THE CREATOR TO THE POSITION OF THE CREATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1934 Brother Nee held the third Overcomer Conference in Shanghai on Christ having the preeminence in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both that dissenting one and I attended.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was the one who took notes of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee asked me to organize my notes and publish them in the issue of The Present Testimony of March-April, 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was even a note printed at the end of the message: "Spoken by Watchman Nee; recorded by Witness Lee."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this issue of The Present Testimony was an article entitled "God's Center or the Centrality and Universality of God."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Editor's note: This message has been included in The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Set One, Volume 11, published by the Living Stream Ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This message contains the following paragraph:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first thing in Christ's redemption is His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ was incarnated to be a man in order to come from the position of the Creator to the position of the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had to take on a created body before He could die for man and for all things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There must first be Bethlehem before there can be Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There must first be the manger before there can be the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Set One, Volume 11, p.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>740</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this paragraph there is a line that says "to come from the position of the Creator to the position of the creature."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that He is the Creator, but that in incarnation He as the Creator became a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, that dissenting brother translated these messages into English and translated this part as, "In becoming a man He steps down from the position of the Creator to the place of the created."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In his translation, he completely changed the meaning of Brother Nee's words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What Brother Nee meant may be compared to a king who steps down from his royal position to a commoner's position; this means that the king becomes a commoner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the translator would not translate it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, he changed it to say that the king steps down from his royal position to the place of the common people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This may be compared to the Queen of England, who, when she goes to Hong Kong, goes to the place of the common people for a little visit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, when the Lord Jesus became a man, He did not merely come to the place of the common people; rather, He came to the position of the common people to become a common person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way that brother translated was not faithful to the original writing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE CHURCH BEING THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we come to the subject of this chapter: the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The universe is a mystery, man is a mystery, and even more, God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible reveals these things very clearly, and there is no need for man to infer or grope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the Bible reveals another great mystery, which is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Colossians shows us that the mystery of God is Christ, while Ephesians shows us that the mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These two books may be called sister books; one is on Christ and the other is on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the "stories" of God are related to Christ, and all the "stories" of Christ are related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church came out of Christ; the church is also the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is an exceedingly great mystery in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the New Testament, we have the four Gospels which record the things of Christ's human life on the earth, showing us what kind of person Christ was.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These four Gospels are biographies of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the four Gospels, the church began in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, in the book of Acts we still cannot see the revelation and the story of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only in the Epistles does Paul show us clearly how the church is the mystery of Christ and the story of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This revelation was mainly written in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From Ephesians 1 we can see that the church was chosen and predestinated by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In time, because of man's fall, Christ came to redeem us who were chosen and predestinated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After Christ redeemed us, the Spirit came to seal us; that is, the Spirit seals us with God's life and nature and all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The beginning of this sealing is our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we believed in the Lord, the Spirit of God came to seal us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first part of this sealing is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Spirit of God regenerated us, He sealed us with God's life so that we have God's life and nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From that time the Spirit of God has been continuously sealing us within.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This part of the sealing sanctifies us, makes us spiritual, and causes the elements of God to increase in us until we grow and mature in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This sealing of the Holy Spirit causes us to have an organic union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this organic union, we enjoy God's rich life, which is Christ Himself, and we become the Body of Christ.</S>
