The Binding and Imprisoning<br>of the Devil, Satan, the Dragon,<br>the Ancient Serpent, in the Abyss<br>for One Thousand Years</H2><P>After the destruction of Antichrist, the false prophet, and those who follow them, the devil, Satan, the dragon, the ancient serpent, will be bound and imprisoned in the abyss by an angel for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>i. The Kingdom of One Thousand Years</H2><P>Then there will be the kingdom of one thousand years (Rev. 20:4-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The Overcomers Will Reign with Christ</H2><P>In the millennial kingdom, the overcomers will reign with Christ (Rev. 20:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Overcomers Will Be Priests of God and of Christ</H2><P>Furthermore, the overcomers shall be priests to contact God and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium (Rev. 20:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>j. The Last Rebellion of Mankind</H2><P>When the thousand years of the kingdom are completed, there will be the last rebellion of mankind (Rev. 20:7-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Satan, Loosed out of His Prison,<br>Deceiving the Nations, Gog and Magog,<br>to War against the Camp of the Saints and the Beloved City</H2><P>Satan, loosed out of his prison, will deceive the nations, Gog and Magog, to war against the camp of the saints and the beloved city; and fire will come down out of heaven and devour them (Rev. 20:7-9). Satan's deceiving of the nations which are in the four corners of the earth is his deceiving of "Gog and Magog." This may indicate that in the last rebellion of mankind, instigated by Satan, Gog and Magog will take the lead, and the nations will follow. Gog and Magog, according to Ezekiel 38:2-3 and 39:1-2, must be Russia. Ezekiel 38:2 (ASV) indicates that Gog and Magog are of Rosh, Meschech, and Tubal, answering to Russia, Moscow, and Tobolsk. Ezekiel 39:2 (ASV) refers to these places as "the uttermost parts of the north." At the end of the millennium, Satan will instigate rebellious mankind from the uttermost parts of the north to attack God's people. But fire will come down out of heaven and devour these rebellious ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Devil, the Deceiver, Being Cast<br>into the Lake of Fire, Where Also<br>Antichrist and the False Prophet Are</H2><P>The devil, the deceiver, was cast into the lake of fire, where also Antichrist and the false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever (Rev. 20:10). Antichrist and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire a thousand years earlier than the devil (Rev. 19:20). After the thousand years, the devil will be thrown into it.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
