   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RIGHT WAY TO COME TO THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we come to the Word, we need to open four layers of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To begin with, we must open our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If they are shut, we cannot read!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we must open our mind in order to understand what we are reading.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But reading and understanding are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must thirdly open our heart to receive what we read.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lastly, we must open our spirit to realize what we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The way to be helped by the Word, then, is to read, understand, receive, and realize.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This requires our opening of our eyes, mind, heart, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible is not a simple book.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Reading it profitably involves all four layers of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To open these four parts takes an effort.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yes, keeping our eyes open to read is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our mind, however, is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As soon as we sit down to read the Word, our mind takes off on a 747!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must call it back and insist that it concentrate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To open our mind means simply to concentrate on what we are reading.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do this, we shall uncover what is hidden in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As to opening our heart, we do this by loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may open our mind and pray-read the Word in a superficial way, but if we do not love the Lord, we are drawn off by thoughts of other things we love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When our time in the Word seems dry and lifeless, it may be that our heart is not open to Him to give Him our love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way to open our spirit, the deepest layer, is by genuine prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once our eyes see, our mind understands, and our heart receives, we can pray the Word into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the Word will become our life supply, bringing to us God, Christ, the Spirit, and all the divine virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A REPLACEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The result of our opening to the Lord in this fourfold way is that this living One replaces religion, ethics, and our natural virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He comes, all that is not of Him must go.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason it is so urgent that we come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With the reading, the understanding, the receiving, and the realizing, the Word becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It will grow and be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord is both the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Word also is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus it is that in the Word we find the Lord, the Spirit, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Time after time come to this Word, each time opening your eyes, your mind, your heart, and your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then you will be not only reading, but also understanding, receiving, and realizing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You will grow, and the church will be built up, by this way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the substitutes for Christ will be replaced with Himself.</S>
