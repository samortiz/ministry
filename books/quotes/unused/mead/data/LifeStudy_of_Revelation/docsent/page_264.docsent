   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a call to the thirsty to drink freely of the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we compare this verse with verse 14, we shall see that in verse 17 we have a call and in verse 14, a promise.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>OF THE BOOK OF THIS PROPHECY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 18 and 19 say, I testify to every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The I in verse 18 should be the Lord Jesus, according to verses 16 and 20, or it could refer to John, according to 1:2.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first aspect of this warning is not to add anything to the words of the prophecy of this book, and the second aspect is not to take away anything from the words of the prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who add will receive the plagues that are spoken of in this book, and those who take away will have their part in the tree of life and the holy city taken away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The main items of the plagues unveiled in the book of Revelation are the three woes of the great tribulation and the second death, that is, the perishing of the whole man spirit, soul, and body in the lake of fire.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you add to the book, you will suffer woe; and if you take away from it, you will lose the blessings, mainly the blessing of the tree of life and of the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a serious warning.</S>
