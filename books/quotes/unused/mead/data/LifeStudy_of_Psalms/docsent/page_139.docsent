   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. His Environment Compelling Him to Groan</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>before God and Declare His Iniquity and Sin</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 38:9-20 shows that David's environment compelled him to groan before God and declare his iniquity and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 18 David said, "For I declare my iniquity;/I am anxious because of my sin."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a good verse, which we all should love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We always have to say, "I declare my iniquity;/I am anxious because of my sin."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This thought is altogether in contrast with David's logic in Psalm 37.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalm 37 says that as long as you are righteous, not wicked, you will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in Psalm 38 David said that he was suffering, and he declared his iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Psalm 38 is much higher than Psalm 37.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It would be good to read Psalm 38 in a prayerful way again and again, even on our knees.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>D. Begging God Not to Abandon Him</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>but to Hasten to Help and Save Him</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Psalm 38:21-22 David said, "Do not abandon me, O Jehovah;/O my God, do not be far from me./Hasten to help me,/O Lord, my salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Psalm 37 it seems that David did not need God to come to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He thought that he was righteous and that because of this he would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in Psalm 38 all he could do was cry out due to the groaning of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the end he cried out for the Lord's help as his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He begged God not to abandon him but to hasten to help and save him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I would like to ask how God would answer David's cry to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the apostle Paul asked the Lord to remove the thorn from his flesh, the Lord's response was, "My grace is sufficient for you" 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord might tell David, "I will not answer your prayer for help in your way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, I will allow you to suffer because the more you suffer, the more you know your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more you are under suffering, the more you will declare your iniquity, not your righteousness as you did in Psalm 37."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Which psalm would you take for your prayer Psalm 37 or Psalm 38?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all have to learn not to pray in our natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>David's logic in Psalm 37 is very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should abandon our natural logic.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, we must learn to pray in the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must learn to pray when we are under God's dealing, under God's compelling, in a kind of odious situation Psa 38:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we will be blessed, and we will become a blessing.</S>
