   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE FUNCTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 3:16; Phil 1:19b; 1 Cor 12:4, 7-11; Acts 6:3, 5; 7:55; 11:24; 13:52; 2:4a; 4:31; 9:17; 13:9; Matt 12:28; Eph 4:3-4a; 1 Cor 2:10; Rom 8:13b, 11; 1 Cor 6:17; Gal 5:16, 25, 22-23; 6:8b; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 4:4, 16; Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 4:5b; 5:6b; 22:17a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to continue our fellowship concerning the functions of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous message we saw fifteen of these functions, and in this message we will see twenty more.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit, although abstract and hidden, is mentioned frequently in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But, sorry, many of those in fundamental Christianity do not see this clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the previous message and in this message, we are pointing out thirty-five functions of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are only some of the many functions of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation 22 shows us the throne of God and of the Lamb with the Spirit as the river of water of life proceeding out of it v. 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God and the Lamb are sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may wonder how one throne can seat two people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Revelation 21 and 22 in the description of the New Jerusalem, we can find the explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation 21:23 says that the lamp in the New Jerusalem is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lamb is the lamp, and God is the light within the lamp 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lamb as the lamp is the One sitting on the throne with God as the light within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The one throne for both God and the Lamb indicates that God and the Lamb are one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From this One, flows the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Revelation 21 and 22 present the ultimate, consummated revelation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this presentation we can see the Father, the Son Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The light is a figure signifying the Father Rev 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word Christ is not mentioned in these chapters, but Christ is revealed as the Lamb and as the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lamb and the lamp are not physical things, but figures, signifying the Son of God, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then there is a river.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This river is not a physical river but a figure signifying the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flowing of the river is the top function, the total function, of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The flowing of the river quenches the thirst of the whole city, supplying the whole city with the spiritual water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, quenching is another function of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The quenching of the Spirit is saturating, the saturating is transfusing, and the transfusing is infusing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are more functions of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 22 also reveals that the river grows the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Revelation 22, the tree of life does not grow in earth but in water.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is the water that grows the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is another function of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are many functions of the Spirit revealed throughout the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The entire Bible is a book on the Spirit and a book of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning God...."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God here is Elohim in Hebrew, a plural word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, the first verse of the Bible refers to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the second verse refers to the Spirit of God, saying that the Spirit of God brooded over the face of the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then at the end of the Bible in Revelation 22:17 there are the Spirit and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit of God is one aspect, and the Spirit with the bride is another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit of God was the Spirit not yet consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The unconsummated Spirit of God was not yet ready for marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But at the end of the Bible, there are the Spirit and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that the Spirit is married.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Revelation 22, He is the consummated Spirit as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The bride needs a bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Groom is the consummated Spirit, and the consummated Spirit is the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Actually, the revelation of the all-inclusive Spirit and the functions of this Spirit are endless.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What I am doing in these messages is giving us a little view to know what the Spirit is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, we cannot exhaust the functions of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
