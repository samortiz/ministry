God is authority, and God also ordains authority. In creating the universe God exercised His authority, and He instituted authority in the world, in human government, and in all human relationships. God also established a kingdom and instituted His authority in this kingdom. God desires to manifest authority through Himself, through His kingdom, and through all human relationships. For God to manifest His authority is for Him to manifest Himself. However, these institutions merely express the principles of authority. Although there are many things in the world that enforce outward submission, man is not submissive at heart. Rebellion characterizes half of all human activities, while lip service characterizes the other half. God has not fully secured the authority which He intends to build up in the universe. His authority has not found the proper expression in all these areas. God's authority is not manifested in many human governments or human relationships. Mainly, God has received man's lip service. Many people submit to authority outwardly but not in the heart. This is the reason God's plan is still not fulfilled. Therefore, God needs an instrument or institution to express His authority. This institution is the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING<br />THE PERFECT MANIFESTATION OF GOD'S AUTHORITY</h2><p>God desires to express His authority through the church. Many people do not realize that the church is a crucial and solemn institution. God must carry out His will fully through the church; the church cannot afford any hindrance to Him. If a man does not see the seriousness of this matter, he may presume the church to be nothing but a gathering of Christians, a society of brotherly and sisterly love. He may consider the church a mere gathering of men with the same faith or same love who cherish the same future hope. However, God has a different view toward the church. In man's eyes the church is an organization, a gathering of men with kindred love, but God's view is different. He considers the church to be the Body of Christ. God has made Christ the Head of the church. The church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23); it is not merely the gathering of men with similar goals. The relationship between Christ and the church in God's ordination is a relationship between the Head and the Body.</p><p>No institution on earth can express the submission of the human body to its head. The submission of the body to the head is the ultimate expression of authority. The union and harmony between the head and the body is altogether profound. Nothing manifests divine authority more profoundly than the submission of the body to the head. There is a possibility of dissolution in social relationships as between father and son, master and servant, and husband and wife. However, the body can never be detached from the head. One cannot dissolve the relationship between the body and the head because this would deny the very existence of the life of the body. When the bonds between husband and wife, father and son, and master and servant are broken, each can still exist. This, however, is not true of the body and the head. No submission, such as that of servants to masters, wives to husbands, or sons to fathers, can be as perfect as the submission of the members to the head. The obedience of the ears and the eyes to the head is the most perfect obedience. Between the members and the head, there is authority, and there is life union; this relationship is living and organic. Even the most submissive person in the whole world cannot compare his submission to that which exists between the hand and the head. As soon as the head decides, the hand acts. The eyes do not need the head to tell them explicitly what to see; they do not need explicit commands to see. The instant the head desires to see something, the eyes see it. This is a oneness and submission that come out of an inward harmony. This is the Body of Christ. The Body life is the ultimate and perfect manifestation of authority. God has not found such a total and ultimate manifestation of authority in the universe, the world, or any human relationships. He has to begin with the Body of Christ. From this Body He intends to build up His system of authority in the universe, the world, and the kingdom.</p><p>God twice appointed a head in this universe. The first, the original archangel of the universe, rebelled. The second, Christ, accomplished God's purpose. God has established His authority in six spheres. The first is the original universe. The second is the present world. The third is the kingdom of Israel. Then there is the church, which is the Body of Christ. Fifth, there is the kingdom, and finally, there is eternity. The Body of Christ is in the middle of these six spheres. The first three spheres are linked to and ushered into the future kingdom through the Body of Christ. Satan rebelled, and the world as well as the kingdom of Israel have failed God's purpose. The church, however, as the Body of Christ, will bring in God's system of authority. After the Body of Christ there is the kingdom. After the kingdom, the entire universe will belong to God. The first three attempts of God's work failed, but the last three moves will succeed. In the middle there is the transition, or the turning point, which is the church, the Body of Christ.</p><p>We are not here to engage in exegesis or Bible study. Our intention is not merely to understand the doctrines of the Bible but to be those who echo God's heart's desire. We have to realize the importance of our position. God has given us the highest place and the greatest honor. No other group of people is as blessed as we are, and no other group has as much expectation and hope as we have. However, this means that God's demand for the church is much higher. If we do not see authority, we are basically unqualified to meet God's demand, and there is no way for us to go on. Privately, I have been praying, "God, open my eyes to see what the church is." God's church is a group of people who bear the responsibility of expressing God's authority. God has bestowed this honor upon us for the purpose of accomplishing His goal. If authority is not manifested among us, we have no way to go on. If we do not settle this issue among us, it will not be settled in any other place. The whole church bears the responsibility of expressing God's authority before Him. All of us have to bear this responsibility.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> </body></html>
