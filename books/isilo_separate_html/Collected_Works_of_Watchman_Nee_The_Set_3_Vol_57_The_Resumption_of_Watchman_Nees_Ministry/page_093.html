Not everyone can appoint elders. Paul asked Timothy to appoint elders, but he did not ask Mark, Silas, Luke, or Demas to appoint elders. Some are hands; they cannot be the eyes. Some people say that they have to consider more. But if you are a hand, will you know whether a pillar is white simply by more consideration? Even if you considered for five days, you would not be clear whether the pillar was white. It is better for you to seek the help of the eyes. It is easy to appoint a person, but it is troublesome to ask anyone to step down from responsibility. If you do this, the whole church will be greatly affected. For this reason, we cannot appoint responsible ones lightly. Paul asked Timothy to look for faithful ones. This is not an easy matter.</p><p>When the Western missionaries select personnel, most of the time they select the good and the lovable persons. To us these ones may be the most useless; they may even be swindlers. Some people ask why we do not appoint certain brothers as responsible ones. We have to realize that some brothers are good people and nice gentlemen, but they can easily be deceived. Do not say that this is only the missionaries' problem; the Chinese can have the same problem. It is not a light matter for a man to receive a ministry before the Lord. There are certain basic qualifications in appointing a person. It is not such a simple matter.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE PHYSICAL NEEDS<br />OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Taking Simple Luggage When Traveling</h2><p>Sixth, the co-workers should pay special attention to their physical needs. Concerning our personal life, the Lord's principle is first that our personal belongings have to be simple when we travel. It is too improper for a worker to travel with five or ten pieces of luggage.</p><h2 class="head2">Eating What Others Serve</h2><p>Second, we must pay attention to how we eat. Whatever others put in front of us, we have to eat. Other than for the reason of physical weakness, we have to make ourselves persons who are easy to be served. When we are at home, we can do whatever we like. But when we are traveling, it is not so simple.</p><p>Once I was in Anhwei province. The people there like sesame oil, but I hate sesame oil. I had sesame oil continually for sixteen days. When they saw that my appetite was not good, they asked if I would like some preserved eggs. I said yes, and they served me preserved eggs, but they were also soaked in sesame oil!</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Overcome Our Bodies in Our Dwelling</h2><p>The third thing is related to the place where we live. The co-workers should not pick places for sleeping that are too good or too coarse. They have to select moderate places. Once they have decided where to stay, they should stay there until they leave the city. Even if you find that you are staying in a lion's den, you have to wait until daybreak. If the king has not come, you cannot go out by yourself. Unless others make further arrangements for you, you should not make any choice of your own. Many workers are involved in trouble merely through moving around.</p><p>Once someone prepared a bed for me. It was supposed to be a sofa bed, but it was a bed that no one could lie on. The bed was put together with blocks of wood. When I turned over, the wood would make noise. I was disturbed not only by others' noise, but by the noise I made also. A worker has to learn to live in abundance, and he also has to learn to live in poverty. A worker must learn to overcome his body.</p><p>There was a brother in southern Fukien province who had a somewhat higher standard of living at home. When he had to work in a place that had a lower standard of living, he found that he could not handle the situation. What we eat and wear and how we live at home are personal matters before the Lord. But when we are guests in others' homes, we have to live according to the standard of that family. Habit is one thing, and a mind to suffer is another thing. No matter how weak we are or how many needs we have, we have to learn to lower ourselves. Do not let any church think that it is a troublesome thing to provide hospitality for a servant of God. If we practice living in a low way at home, we will be able to stand it even when others put us in a lower place. Only those who have learned to overcome their bodies present no difficulty to others. Only a mind to suffer can give us the strength to humble ourselves before men. Hence, we have to learn to overcome our bodies.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_092.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_094.html">Next</a> </body></html>
