[2]  The matter of recreation is never a problem to a consecrated person.
[3]  Anyone who is not absolute in his consecration has a problem with recreation.
[4]  Among God's children, the matter of recreation does not exist to those who are consecrated.
[5]  A man who has not settled the matter of consecration may approve what God disapproves.
[6]  There are many games, such as chess, ball games, and horse-riding, which can be considered proper activities, even though they contain the element of winning and losing.
[7]  We may say that the only kind of recreation that is proper is that which involves pure skill and nothing of chance.
[8]  We have a certain recreation because we have a certain need.
[9]  We should not have any recreation without having the need for it.
[10]  Those who have a genuine need for diversion do not feel the need for it, while those who do not need diversion think that they have a need for it.
[11]  Seventh, recreation has to do not only with physical fitness but also with one's disposition.
[12]  When a person is doing what he likes to do, he tends to be more mentally relaxed and psychologically happy.
[13]  Doing something that you do not enjoy doing is a labor; it is not a recreation.
[14]  Ninth, we should not take up any recreation that is improper in the eyes of the Gentiles.
[15]  This does not mean that we can do anything that the Gentiles consider to be proper.
[16]  We may not necessarily do what they approve of, but we certainly will not do anything that they do not approve of.
[17]  CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX WORDS I. WORDS REVEALING A PERSON'S HEART
[18]  Speaking occupies a great part of a person's life.
[19]  It is, in fact, a very crucial part of his life.
[20]  The Lord Jesus said that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks Matt 12:34 .
[21]  It is not easy to know a man through his conduct, but it is very easy to know a man through his words.
[22]  A person's conduct may often give others the wrong impression, view, and judgment of him, but it is very easy to know a person through his words because no one can easily restrain or control his own words.
[23]  A person is lying when he first says one thing and then turns around and says something else, when he first says yes and then no, when he first says that something is good and then says that it is bad, or when he first agrees that something is right and then says that it is wrong.
[24]  No church in Shanghai has a sitting capacity of five thousand.
[25]  First Peter 3:9-12 says, "Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing.
[26]  For he who desires to love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips to speak no guile.
[27]  And let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears incline to their petition; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.'"
[28]  Verse 2 says, "For in many things we all stumble.
[29]  If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well."
[30]  E. A Spring Cannot Gush Out Two Types of Water
[31]  One cannot bless God with his tongue and use the same tongue to curse the man created by God.
[32]  Psalm 38:13-14 says, "But I, like a deaf man, do not hear; /And I am like a dumb man, who does not open his mouth./Indeed I am like a man who does not hear/And in whose mouth there are no reproofs."
[33]  Many people indeed need to be as a deaf man who does not hear.
[34]  When others speak unbecoming things, you should act like a deaf man who does not hear anything.
[35]  We will now talk about clothing and food as they pertain to Christians.
[36]  When Adam and Eve sinned, their nakedness exposed their sin.
[37]  Second, Leviticus says that a man can be plagued with leprosy.
[38]  A house and a piece of garment can also be plagued with leprosy.
[39]  Let us look at 1 Timothy 2:9-11: "Similarly, that women adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, what befits women professing godly reverence, by good works.
[40]  However, we should take note of one thing: No one should wear anything that draws attention to his clothes rather than to his person.
[41]  If our clothing always draws others' attention to us, there is something wrong with it.
[42]  Why did God give animals to man for food?
[43]  Second, there is one thing which Christians should not take blood.
[44]  When God spoke to Noah in Genesis 9, He forbade men from taking the blood of the animals v. 4 . Taking blood was something forbidden by God.
[45]  In Leviticus 11 God gave the Israelites a list of clean beasts which they could eat and a list of unclean beasts, such as creeping things, which they could not eat.
[46]  He said to the Lord, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean" v. 14 . Then a voice came to him the second time, saying, "The things that God has cleansed, do not make common" v. 15 . This occurred three times.
[47]  If we refrain from eating some things, we are saying that the Jews are God's people but that we are not.
[48]  Although a person may live in sin, he still cherishes certain lofty ideals.
[49]  After a person is saved, he subconsciously carries this thought of asceticism into the church.
[50]  Though he never practiced it in the past, he admired those who practiced it.
[51]  "If you died with Christ from the elements of the world" Col 2:20 .
[52]  No philosopher can be a philosopher from inside his own tomb.
[53]  Colossians 2:22 says, "According to the commandments and teachings of men."
[54]  They have nothing to do with the church and nothing to do with Christ.
[55]  Men think that they cannot eat this, and that they must not touch that, but these are all teachings and commandments of men, not of God.
[56]  Paul criticized such ones for practicing "self-imposed worship" v. 23 . What are these ones like? They are, in reality, engaged in self-imposed worship.
[57]  The expression self-imposed worship can be translated as "worship of the will."
[58]  They involve a worship of the will, not a worship of the Lord.
[59]  God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit John 4:24 .
[60]  Colossians 3:1-3 says, "If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above....Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth.
[61]  For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
[62]  If we pay attention to what we should not touch, taste, or handle, we are setting our mind on the things of the earth.
[63]  Sex is right, and food is right, but both can turn into lust.
[64]  nor a Matter of Not Eating and Not Drinking
[65]  It is like little children sitting in the market places, who call to the others and say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not mourn.
[66]  Concerning illness, there are a few things we need to consider before God.
[67]  We absolutely believe that there are natural causes for sickness.
[68]  There are enough reasons and scientific proof to keep us from disputing the natural causes of sickness, but at the same time, we must acknowledge that many illnesses come upon God's children because of their sins.
[69]  It is sin against God, as described in chapter eleven of 1 Corinthians, that brings about illnesses.
[70]  With such cases, we need to ask God for forgiveness rather than for healing.
[71]  Often when a person becomes sick, he can quickly discover how he has sinned against the Lord, in what matter he has been disobedient, and where he has turned against His word.
[72]  Isaiah 53:4-5 says, "Surely He Christ has borne our sicknesses,/And carried our sorrows;/Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken,/Smitten of God and afflicted./But He was pierced because of our transgressions;/He was crushed because of our iniquities;/The chastening for our peace was upon Him,/And by His stripes we have been healed."
[73]  God's forgiveness of our sins is basically different from His healing of our diseases.
[74]  A BELIEVER'S ATTITUDE TOWARD ILLNESS A. Discovering the Cause of an Illness
[75]  A believer should first go before the Lord to discover the cause of his illness.
[76]  He should not hastily seek healing as soon as he becomes ill.
[77]  When a person is sick, the first thing he should do is to discover the cause of his illness.
[78]  Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
[79]  And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him."
[80]  When a person is sick, and he has dealt with the Lord about his sickness, one of the things that he can do is to call for the elders of the church to anoint him.
[81]  The more we know about the church and the more we are related to the church, the more the Lord will put us in a situation where His hand will be heavy upon us as soon as we become individualistic.
[82]  It is interesting to note that unbelievers often are easily healed, while Christians are not healed so easily.
[83]  God allows many illnesses to remain in us in order for us to learn a lesson.
[84]  Let me say a frank word to them: The only reason many of them are sick is that they love themselves too much.
[85]  I believe that when Paul wrote 2 Timothy, Timothy and Trophimus, as well as Paul himself, still had their illnesses.
[86]  However, they acknowledged that their illnesses were there to help them in their work; they learned to look after themselves and to be restricted for the sake of God's glory upon them.
[87]  It is true that God can heal us, but how do we know that He will heal us?
[88]  Suppose the Lord is not willing to heal us.
[89]  There are at least four different kinds of forgiveness in the Bible.
[90]  We will give a different name to each of them: First, there is eternal forgiveness.
[91]  The moment we believe in the Lord Jesus, we are forgiven of all our sins; the Lord removes all of our sins, and we are left with no trace of sin before God.
[92]  First John 1:7-9 says, "If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.
[93]  If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
[94]  And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world."
[95]  Many portions in the Bible point out similar things.
[96]  For example, Galatians 6:7 says, "Whatever a man sows, this he will also reap."
[97]  If a father spoils his children, his children will not grow up in a proper way.
[98]  To understand the significance of governmental forgiveness, we must consider the example of David in the Old Testament.
[99]  No portion of the Bible speaks of God's governmental forgiveness as clearly as the story of David with Uriah's wife.
[100]  This shows us clearly that his fellowship with God was restored after his confession in Psalm 51.
[101]  He said, "Nevertheless, because you have given the enemies of Jehovah much occasion to blaspheme Him because of this thing, the son who is born to you shall also surely die" v. 14 . He also said, "Now therefore the sword will not depart from your house forever because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife" v. 10 . Finally, He said, "I will now raise up trouble against you from within your house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and will give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
[102]  After Aaron failed, God still allowed him to remain a priest and restored his fellowship with God.
[103]  Even though he wore the priestly robe, God nevertheless told him that he would not be able to live.
[104]  God wanted him to command water to flow out from the rock, but he smote the rock with his rod and lost his composure.
[105]  Brothers, the very day that you begin your Christian life, you should set a hope before you that you will stay on the course that God has measured to you, all the way to the end. Do not live loosely.
[106]  Two other portions of the Word speak about God's governmental hand: Matthew 6:15 and 18:23-35.
[107]  One very important thing can be found in these verses do not condemn others easily.
[108]  In whatever matter you do not forgive or excuse others, the same matter will come back to haunt you!
[109]  The Lord said that if you do not forgive others of their sins, God will also not forgive you of your sins.
[110]  If a brother offends such a one, and that one does not forgive his brother, God will not forgive him either.
[111]  CHAPTER FORTY-ONE THE DISCIPLINE OF GOD Scripture Reading: Heb 12:4-13 I. THE PROPER ATTITUDE
[112]  Verse 6 says, " For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.'"
[113]  God has no time to discipline everyone in the world, but He disciplines His own children because He loves them.
[114]  But once you have accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior, once you are born of God and have become His child, you have to prepare yourself for His discipline.
[115]  The apostle quoted Proverbs when he wrote to the Hebrew believers.
[116]  In verse 7 the apostle explains the quotation from Proverbs in verses 5 and 6, saying, "It is for discipline that you endure."
[117]  We see a big contrast when a person understands that what is happening to him is of God; he will have a different view toward his experience.
[118]  If someone hits me with a cane today, I may argue with him or snatch the cane from him.
[119]  If any child of God is foolish enough to think that there can be smooth sailing in his living and work and that he can be spared God's discipline, he is saying that he is illegitimate, that is, one who is adopted.
[120]  Verse 9 says, "Furthermore we have had the fathers of our flesh as discipliners and we respected them; shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?"
[121]  The apostle pointed out that the fathers of our flesh discipline us and we respect them.
[122]  Verse 10 says, "For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them."
[123]  Often parents discipline their children in a poor way, because they act and discipline according to their own whims.
[124]  No discipline or reproach of God is merely a punishment; it is educational in nature, and it is there for our profit.
[125]  Verse 11 says, "Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it."
[126]  Here are some sobering words: "His taste remains in him, /And his scent is not changed."
[127]  Because Moab was not emptied from vat to vat, from pot to pot, and from vessel to vessel, and because he was never disciplined and dealt with by God, his taste remained in him and his scent never changed!
[128]  Brothers, this is why God has to work on you.
[129]  God does not want your own taste and scent.
[130]  CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:28; Matt 10:29-31; Jer 48:11; Gen 47:7-10
[131]  We have believed in the Lord and have received a new life.
[132]  But there are many habits which we acquired before we believed in the Lord.
[133]  Many character traits and aspects of our disposition were part of us before we believed in the Lord.
[134]  This is the reason many people do not touch the new life or experience the Lord when they meet us.
[135]  God arranges the necessary environment for us, and unconsciously, we are broken and the Holy Spirit is constituted into us so that we acquire a character and disposition that resembles God.
[136]  The kinds of discipline that God arranges are as varied as the number of people there are.
[137]  Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."
[138]  If a man claims that he has no choice of his own, that he asks nothing for himself, and that he only wants everything that God gives to him, he should have only one desire in his heart to love God.
[139]  However, if he knows much but does not love God in his heart, all of his knowledge will not help him to know God.
[140]  If we remember the Lord Jesus' word, that "not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father" Matt 10:29 , and if we realize that everything is of God, we will humble ourselves under His hand and receive the good.
[141]  The Lord causes many things to come our way, few of which are according to our preference.
[142]  Perhaps our life is not as easy as Moab's. Perhaps we have not been "at ease from...youth." Perhaps we have had to go through "many tribulations" like Paul Acts 14:22 . If so, we should realize that the Lord is removing our lees and our original taste.
[143]  CHAPTER FORTY-THREE WITHSTANDING THE DEVIL Scripture Reading: James 4:7; 1 Pet 5:8-9; 2 Cor 2:11
[144]  The devil is known also as Satan Rev 12:9 .
[145]  Later, he rebelled against God by uplifting himself to be equal to God.
[146]  Second Corinthians 10:4-5 says, "For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds, as we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ."
[147]  God has given us our mind; it is ours, not Satan's. We are the only ones who have the right to use our mind; Satan has no authority over our mind.
[148]  The Bible shows us clearly that many physical diseases are the result of Satan's attack.
[149]  The fever of Peter's mother-in-law was an attack from Satan, and the Lord Jesus rebuked the fever Luke 4:39 .
[150]  Something must have a personality before the Lord can rebuke it.
[151]  We cannot rebuke a cup or a chair; we can only rebuke something that has a personality.
[152]  But the Lord Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, saying, "Dumb and deaf spirit, I order you, come out of him and enter into him no more" v. 25 . The dumbness and deafness of the child were outward symptoms of his demon possession; they were not ordinary illnesses.
[153]  We must be sure that they have enough strength before the Lord to go on before we give them stronger advice or urge them to move ahead.
[154]  Second, where there is the clear work of the Holy Spirit, we should raise the standard a little, for with the clear operation of the Spirit of the Lord and the spirit of revival, the Lord's word has the ability to uplift the capacity of a person.
[155]  If we raise the standard very high when the Spirit of the Lord has not done anything, we are not helping these accused ones to go on; rather, we are giving Satan opportunities to accuse them even more.
[156]  But if you do not have the assurance within and you do not have the power to uplift him, your exposure of his failures will only quench his prayers, his reading of the Bible, and his meeting life.
[157]  Second, we must believe that through death the Lord Jesus has destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil Heb 2:14 .
[158]  The Lord's death pronounces the greatest defeat for the devil because the Lord's death is not only a punishment but also a way of salvation.
[159]  Third, we must believe that the Lord's resurrection has put Satan to shame.
[160]  Colossians 2:12 says, "Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead."
[161]  Verse 13 tells us how we died and resurrected; verse 14 tells us what the Lord did at the time of His death; and verse 15 says that the Lord Jesus stripped off the rulers and the authorities and "made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
[162]  Fourth, we must believe that the ascension of the Lord has put Him far above the power of Satan.
[163]  Ephesians 1:20-22 says, "Raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all...not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church."
[164]  This means that the Lord Jesus is already seated in the heavenlies and is far above all the power of Satan.
[165]  Ephesians 2:6 says, "And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus."
[166]  CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR HEAD COVERING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:2-16
[167]  First Corinthians 11:2-16 does not speak of believers as brothers and sisters; rather, it speaks of them as men and women.
[168]  It does not speak about our status in Christ, but rather of God's order in His creation.
[169]  In the garden of Eden, man was given fruit for food.
[170]  LEARNING TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD'S GOVERNMENT A. Adam Being Cast Out of the Garden of Eden
[171]  After God prepared the garden of Eden, He created Adam and Eve and charged them to guard the garden.
[172]  I cannot persuade you to cover your head if you do not know anything about God's government.
[173]  If you do not know the meaning of God's government, you will not know the significance of head covering!
[174]  Once you see God's government and see that such a system of divine government is revealed in the Word, you will realize that head covering has much to do with this government.
[175]  First Corinthians 11:2-3 says, "But I praise you because in all things you have remembered me and hold fast the things that I have handed down even as I handed them down to you.
[176]  First Corinthians 11:4-5 says, "Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head.
[177]  But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved."
[178]  Just as Christ accepted God as His Head, so also every man should accept Christ as his Head.
[179]  First Corinthians 11:6 says, "For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered."
[180]  In other words, God is telling the sisters that they should be absolute in everything that they do.
[181]  They may think that since the man is the head, the woman should subject herself to him in everything.
[182]  The problem with some is that either they do not do anything at all or they go to an extreme when they do something.
[183]  Here Paul seems to ask the sisters in particular, "After hearing this word and realizing that in God's government God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, man is the head of the woman, and God has appointed the woman to be a representative of Christ before God, do you still think that it is fitting for a woman to pray with her head uncovered?"
[184]  I would like to point out two things to you: Since God gave women long hair for a covering, Paul indicated that the woman should add a head covering to this covering, because God wants her to be covered.
[185]  Verse 16 says, "But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God."
[186]  This is the same as saying that God's headship over Christ is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter; this is the same as saying that Christ's headship over man is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter; and this is the same as saying that man's headship over the woman is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter.
[187]  The Bible contains a very important principle the principle of representation.
[188]  I have spoken of this before, and I would like to reiterate it here.
[189]  One is that we walk as individuals before God, and the other is that we walk in the capacity of a representative before God.
[190]  In the eyes of God we not only live the Christian life individually, but representatively.
[191]  If I am not deceived, I believe that in the coming judgment we will be judged not only individually but also according to what we do as representatives.
[192]  If I am not deceived, I believe that we will be judged for our own sins and for the sin of misrepresenting the Lord in the coming judgment before God.
[193]  CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE THE PATHWAY OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Rev 2 3 I. THE REVELATION OF THE PATHWAY OF THE CHURCH
[194]  There are seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3.
[195]  These churches were seven actual churches in Asia Minor at the time John wrote the book of Revelation.
[196]  At that time there were many churches in Asia Minor, but God chose only seven for prophetic representation.
[197]  Therefore, God chose these seven churches as a prophecy to foretell the pathway the church takes on the earth.
[198]  They also show us what kind of church God condemns and what kind of church He approves.
[199]  Only through the study of these two chapters can we understand the pathway of the church, the kind of church we should be in, and the kind of person we should be to please the Lord.
[200]  If there are four different kinds of churches on earth today and if all of them continue until the Lord comes again, what kind of attitude should a child of God have in regards to these churches?
[201]  If we choose a church which is not well pleasing to the Lord and which the Lord condemns, we will suffer a great loss before the Lord.
[202]  Revelation 2:20 says, "But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices."
[203]  Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works; and her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works."
[204]  Every child of God in the New Testament is a priest.
[205]  As long as he is a child, he is a priest.
[206]  In the eyes of God all those who believe in the Lord Jesus are priests and all of them serve Him.
[207]  But the Roman Catholic Church, realizing that the priests in Judaism effectively served as an intermediate class of people, divided the Roman Catholic believers into two classes and introduced the Old Testament Judaistic concept of the priesthood into the New Testament church.
[208]  Sardis is the recovered church or the church that remains.
[209]  Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God....But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments" 3:1-2, 4 .
[210]  In the beginning of the Reformation, many of God's people came out of Catholicism because they wanted to be freed from its fornication and idolatry.
[211]  If the believers who left the Roman Catholic Church had turned back to the New Testament, they would have seen that the church is God's people and that it is a society that does not derive its support from anyone.
[212]  At the beginning, when these dissenting ones separated themselves from the state churches, they were branded as divisive.
[213]  Because they held different opinions, they were labeled divisive ones.
[214]  Next comes the sixth church; it has the name Philadelphia.
[215]  Phila means "love" and delphia means "the brothers."
[216]  Revelation 3:8 says, "I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name."
[217]  To the Lord, His name is enough for His children.
[218]  But we have to wait until Philadelphia before we see men who are satisfied with the Lord's name alone.
[219]  The last three came out of Roman Catholicism, and all four will remain until the Lord Jesus comes again.
[220]  Today every child of God has to choose the pathway he should take with regard to the church.
[221]  APPENDIX: THE HERESY OF CONFUSION Scripture Reading: Matt 13:31-33; Rev 17 18
[222]  In this appendix to the section on Thyatira, we bring up a subject which we call the heresy of confusion.
[223]  Every reader of prophesy knows that Roman Catholicism will become more and more powerful, while Protestantism will become weaker and weaker.
[224]  Revelation 17 says that the great harlot, which typifies Roman Catholicism, will ride on the beast and then be killed by it.
[225]  Therefore, all genuine children of God must fully prepare themselves for this crisis in the last days.
[226]  In Matthew 13:31-32 the first parable says that the kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed: "Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, and which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches."
[227]  According to God's intention, this seed "is smaller than all the seeds" v. 32 . The mustard seed is very small; it is smaller than all the seeds.
[228]  When God sowed His word into the world, His intention was for such a mustard seed to remain an herb when it grew up.
[229]  At first, the bishops, or overseers, were the elders, and they were always plural in number.
[230]  Still later, the bishops began to oversee not only the church in their own locality but churches in several localities.
[231]  Matthew 13:33 says, "The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal."
[232]  If you argue that the Bible does not say anything about the practices of the church, the Roman Catholic Church will tell you that it decides the way things should be.
[233]  The number three is frequently used in the Bible.
[234]  The pope must wear two crowns at his coronation, one signifying that he is the king of the church and the other signifying that he is the king of the world.
[235]  One crown, the Miter, signifies the pope as the king of the church.
[236]  When the pope receives the Miter, he claims headship over the church.
[237]  Every student of history knows about the persecutions in Spain, the Spanish Inquisition.
[238]  Believers were branded as heretics and 10,220 were burned to death within twelve months.
[239]  As soon as a person confessed his faith in the Lord, he was put to death.
[240]  In 1901 Pope Leo XIII published an article in Rome which said, "The church, that is, the Roman Catholic Church, has authority from God to confiscate all properties of heretics and imprison and burn them."
[241]  CHAPTER FORTY-SIX ONENESS I. THE HEAD, THE BODY,
[242]  In this chapter we will cover the subject of oneness among Christians.
[243]  We have seen that the Body of Christ is something that can be seen on earth.
[244]  Paul did not say, "So also are Christ and His church."
[245]  NOT BEING GREATER THAN THE BODY A. The Oneness of the Church Being Limited
[246]  They think that as long as a man is a Christian in name, they can be one with him, whether or not he belongs to God, has life, and is a member of the Body.
[247]  I would like all of us to consider what the church is.
[248]  The church is a group of people who possess the life of Christ.
[249]  In principle it is right to stop unbelievers from coming into our midst.
[250]  Once a brother asked me, "Have you ever received any person by mistake?"
[251]  My feeling at that time was that we had not received any wrong person.
[252]  But one day God opens his eyes to see that though these are genuine children of God, the group as a whole is not the church: It only accepts and meets with those baptized by immersion, and anyone who is not baptized by immersion is not accepted, even though he may be a child of God.
[253]  If anyone thinks that he should not be divisive, he should first bear in mind what it means to be divisive.
[254]  The division in 1 Corinthians 12 refers to a division from the Body v. 25 , not a separation from a group which is not according to the Body.
[255]  If anyone who is concerned about keeping the oneness is in a group that is smaller and narrower than the Body of Christ, he should realize that this oneness is not Christian oneness or the oneness of the Spirit, even though the group may speak of oneness.
[256]  We ask God to open their eyes to see that the Body of Christ is one and that the sects are divided.
[257]  If someone tells you that you have broken the oneness, you should answer by saying that you have broken the oneness of the divisions but you have not broken the oneness of the Body.
[258]  Galatians 5:19-20 says, "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as...outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects hairesis ."
[259]  If you try to divide the Body into denominations and then unite them again, you no longer have the Body!
[260]  To unite something after cutting it apart results merely in an association, not the Body.
[261]  You should not think that you will have the same person after cutting him into pieces and then putting the pieces together again.
[262]  I hope you will see before God the error of dividing the Body of Christ into many denominations.
[263]  Never boast and say, "I have a home already.
[264]  I do not care whether other brothers are wandering outside."
[265]  Something is wrong with our family if we do not feel this loss in our family.
[266]  As long as a brother or a sister is still wandering in the denominations, our heart should ache and we should be sad.
[267]  The boundary of oneness can only be maintained with a price.
[268]  Do not think that you can be one by having more love and forbearance.
[269]  Today Christians are not one not because there is a lack of love but because sin has not been removed.
[270]  Today when God opens a person's eyes to see the Body, the boundary of the church, and the oneness among Christians, and when this person disentangles himself from all human affection and tolerance, he will spontaneously take a step forward in his pursuit of the Lord.
[271]  CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN LOVING THE BROTHERS Scripture Reading: John 5:24; 1 John 3:14
[272]  The Gospel of John was the last Gospel written, and the Epistles of John were the last Epistles written.
[273]  Before the Gospel of John there are three Gospels, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which cover many acts and teachings of the Lord Jesus.
[274]  The Gospel of John shows us the highest and most spiritual things concerning the coming of the Son of God to earth.
[275]  John 5:24 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life."
[276]  John gave us a way to differentiate between true brothers and false brothers, between those who are born of God and those who are not born of God.
[277]  First John 3:11 says, "For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."
[278]  Verse 23 says, "And this is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, even as He gave a commandment to us."
[279]  God commands us to do two things: to believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and to love one another.
[280]  First John 4:7-8 says, "Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God.
[281]  Verse 15 says, "Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."
[282]  We cannot imagine that any person would still murder after becoming a believer.
[283]  The Bible tells us that to hate one's brother is to murder.
[284]  A person who has eternal life should never hate his brother.
[285]  If there is a brother who has done something extremely evil, we may ask him to come to us and rebuke him severely before the Lord.
[286]  If a believer does not love his brother but hates him instead, or if he threatens or attacks his brother, we can say only, "May God be merciful to him!
[287]  First John 4:20-21 says, "If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.
[288]  He said, "How does the love of God abide in him?" because the love of God is the love of the brothers, and the love of the brothers is the love of God.
[289]  First John 3:16 says, "In this we know love, that He laid down His life on our behalf."
[290]  We do not know what love is until we see how the Lord laid down His life for us.
[291]  First John 4:10-12 says, "Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.
[292]  The Bible speaks of the ministry of the priesthood.
[293]  This ministry consists of a group of people wholly separated from the world to serve God.
[294]  They have no other occupation or duty other than to serve God.
[295]  Beginning from the book of Genesis, we find God calling men to be priests.
[296]  The Bible shows us that even the Lord Jesus became a priest before God after His ascension to the heavens.
[297]  While Moses was up on the mountain, the people at the foot of the mountain wondered about his delay.
[298]  They said to Aaron, "Up, make us gods, which shall go before us" 32:1 .
[299]  From that day forward, the kingdom of priests became a tribe of priests.
[300]  The scope of the priesthood was reduced from a kingdom of priests to a household of priests.
[301]  Right then a promise which had been set aside for fifteen hundred years was recovered by God.
[302]  The same word can be found in Revelation 1:6, which says, "And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father."
[303]  I have said this before to the young people: If a person is a doctor before he believes in the Lord, his occupation is medicine; if he is a nurse, his occupation is nursing; if he is a teacher, his occupation is teaching; if he is a farmer, his occupation is farming; if he is a businessman, his occupation is business.
[304]  There are many people who think that they are granting God a favor by offering themselves to Him.
[305]  Over the past decades, I have always felt uneasy when preachers pleaded with believers in revival meetings to give themselves to serve God.
[306]  Many people give a little money to God and think that they are doing Him a special favor.
[307]  Some people think that they are bestowing honor upon God when they give up a little position in the world.
[308]  If God in heaven has called us to be His priests, we should be on our knees before Him to receive His calling.
[309]  In order for us to abolish this class, we all have to become part of it.
[310]  If all the brothers realize that their sole occupation is to serve God and if all of them will serve God in coordination, the intermediary class will disappear!
[311]  The church witnessed a drastic change in the fourth century.
[312]  During that period, many who joined the church were either unbelievers or half believers.
[313]  If one day all the brothers and sisters in all the churches rise up to serve, the kingdom of God will come among us.
[314]  It will be a kingdom of priests; all the people will be priests.
[315]  CHAPTER FORTY-NINE THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 4:11-13; 5:29-30; Gen 2:21-24; 1 Cor 10:16-17; 12:12-30; Rom 12:4-8 I. THE CHURCH BEING OF CHRIST
[316]  Genesis 2 shows us that God took a rib from Adam and made Eve out of it.
[317]  This typifies the relationship between Christ and the church.
[318]  Just as Eve came out of Adam, the church comes out of Christ.
[319]  God gave us not only the grace, power, and nature of Christ, but He also gave us the Body of Christ.
[320]  God has given us His bones, His flesh, and Himself, even as He gave Adam's rib to Eve.
[321]  First Corinthians 12:12-13 says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.
[322]  For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."
[323]  We have seen that the church comes out of Christ.
[324]  First Corinthians 12:14-21 says, "For the body is not one member but many.
[325]  If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body....If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?
[326]  As long as you are a Christian, you are a member of the Body of Christ, and as a member in the Body, you must have your own service before God.
[327]  Ephesians 4:11-13 says, "He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
[328]  God's intention in giving the church these ministers of the word is for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[329]  For the Body of Christ to be built up, the church must ask God for more ministers of the word.
[330]  In this chapter we will consider the matter of the authority of the church.
[331]  When God created the universe, He ordained authority as the governing principle for His rule over it.
[332]  Though only two persons rebelled in this catastrophe, it was in effect a rebellion of the whole world.
[333]  Not only was the authority of man over man overthrown, but even the authority of God over man was overthrown.
[334]  Satan said that in the day they ate thereof, they would be as God, and that God had forbidden them to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so that they would not become as Him.
[335]  If a man refuses to learn from God's appointed deputy authority and if he never presents things to God but cultivates his own independent thought, considering only what is pleasant to the eyes, what is good for food, and what is desirous to make one wise, he is rebelling not only against God but also against His appointed authority on the earth.
[336]  God chose Abraham not only to be the father of faith but also to be a pattern of submission.
[337]  In the midst of the rebellion of the nations and the confusion of the tower of Babel, God chose Abraham not only for his faith but also for his submission.
[338]  THE PATTERN OF SUBMISSION A. The Lord Jesus Being
[339]  He said that He spoke only what He heard and that He could do nothing from Himself except what He saw the Father doing John 5:19 .
[340]  He did not seek His own will but the will of the One who sent Him v. 30 . Here was a man who would not speak or act by Himself.
[341]  After His death on the cross, God raised Him from among the dead and highly exalted Him to be the Lord and Christ and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord Phil 2:5-11 .
[342]  We see an even clearer word in the book of Romans.
[343]  Romans 13:1 says, "For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God."
[344]  This verse and those that follow show us in particular that we should be subject not only to authorities but also to rulers.
[345]  Yet this same book tells us, beginning in Romans 12 on the matter of consecration to Romans 14, that we should be submissive not only in the church but also in the world.
[346]  But if you are in the church, you must uphold one basic need and principle before the Lord you must insist that God's authority be carried out in the church today.
[347]  Submission is the life and nature of the church.
[348]  It is the basic principle that underlies the church.
[349]  This is like saying, "Let us be free and be delivered from the bondage of the Son of God."
[350]  But today the church says, "We gladly put ourselves under the bondage and chains of the Son of God to learn the lesson of submission."
[351]  I have used the illustration of a cancerous tumor.
[352]  The longer we go on in our Christian life before the Lord, the more we will realize the reality of the oneness of the Body.
[353]  Sooner or later, we will see that oneness is a reality.
[354]  If you still feel that you are right after two or three brothers speak to you, Matthew 18 says that these brothers should take the matter to the church and let the whole church consider the matter before the Lord.
[355]  If the whole church decides before God that you are wrong, what will you do?
[356]  You may say, "Although the Body says I am wrong, the Head says that I am right.
[357]  God shows us through the Bible that the brothers who are bearing responsibility before the Lord, who are called overseers, and who serve as the elders, are the ones who represent His authority in the church.
[358]  Let us read a few verses together concerning the elders.
[359]  First Corinthians 16:15-16 says, "Now I exhort you, brothers: You know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister to the saints; you also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring."
[360]  We must be subject to the deputy authority of God in the church.
[361]  Peter said that the younger men should be subject to the elderly ones, who are patterns to others before the Lord v. 3 . If a young person finds someone taking care of him according to God's will, he should learn to subject himself to such a one before God.
[362]  APPENDICES APPENDIX ONE A FLEXIBLE LIFE Scripture Reading: Matt 11:16-19; 1 Cor 7:29-31; 9:19-22; 2 Cor 6:4-10; Phil 4:11-13
[363]  Since God has prepared many things in man's environment that are pleasing to him and which match his many needs, man should do his best to enjoy all these things in life.
[364]  First Corinthians 7:29-31 says, "But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened.
[365]  Henceforth both those who have wives should be as though they had none, and those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess, and those who use the world as though they did not abuse it; for the fashion of this world is passing away."
[366]  In view of the greatness and glory of the indwelling Lord, all outward things had dwindled in significance.
[367]  If we are filled with Christ, we will transcend all outward things.
[368]  To a Christian, having a wife is as though having none, and those who do not have a wife need not ask for one.
[369]  APPENDIX TWO EXPECTING THE LORD'S RETURN Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 3:11; 1 Cor 1:7; 1 Thes 1:9-10; Phil 3:20; Titus 2:11-13
[370]  It was later excluded from the published version of the series.
[371]  Christ has two comings, and these two comings are different.
[372]  In His first coming to earth, He died on the cross for the remission of sins.
[373]  Through this, sinners are reconciled to God; they can draw near to God and partake of His life.
[374]  Every group of politicians in every nation of the world is vying for the center stage, and every nation in this world is trying to take advantage of other nations.
[375]  We are not called to engage ourselves in the work of the League of Nations; our work is not to help weak and struggling countries.
[376]  The angels one day will proclaim that the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ Rev 11:15 .
[377]  WHAT CHRIST WILL SETTLE WHEN HE COMES A. Injustice
[378]  When the Lord comes back, the first thing He will settle is injustice.
[379]  Isaiah 11:4 says that the Lord will "judge the poor in righteousness,/And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land."
[380]  APPENDIX THREE SELLING ALL Scripture Reading: Luke 18:18-30; 19:1-10; Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35; Matt 6:19-24
[381]  The following message was given by Watchman Nee in Kuling in 1948 as part of the "New Believers" series.
[382]  It was published by the Kuling Book Room as the third message in a 1949 edition but was later excluded from the final published version of the series.
[383]  In order to understand this message in the proper light and in the context of Watchman Nee's ministry during this period, the reader should also refer to Volume 57 of The Collected Works, The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry.
[384]  The first thing we should realize concerning a new believer selling all to take the Lord's way is that the church must first take the lead to do this.
[385]  I am not saying that God will not do a special work to raise up new brothers and sisters to take this way.
[386]  This is why he addressed the Lord as "Good Teacher" v. 18 . The Lord Jesus was quite kind to him; He was even moved with love for him Mark 10:21 . He knew that it was not easy to gain such a person.
[387]  The Bible says that when the young ruler heard the Lord's word, he left in sorrow.
[388]  A man can be so close to the Lord and so clear about Him and yet still refuse to let go of his possessions.
[389]  The mistake of the young man was not his reluctance to sell his all but his turning away in sorrow.
[390]  God knows, and the Lord also knows, that this is something that is impossible with men.
[391]  The Lord knows that we cannot sell all that we have to give to the poor.
[392]  Yet this man turned away in sorrow because he thought that since the matter was impossible for him, it must be impossible for God as well.
[393]  The Lord answered Peter saying, "Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God, who shall not by all means receive back many times as much in this time, and in the coming age, eternal life" vv.
[394]  A young person must see that in order to serve God, he has to set aside, sell, or give up everything before he can follow the Lord.
[395]  When the Lord called the twelve apostles, they happily and instantly followed Him.
[396]  Yet if there are men who, like the young ruler, find it difficult to respond to the Lord or to give up everything to follow Him, thank the Lord, there is still a way.
[397]  Please remember that as long as we take a firm stand and the church also takes a firm stand before God, we do not have to worry whether there are too many young rulers.
[398]  The Lord did not preach to him at all.
[399]  He simply said, "Hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house."
[400]  Even if He were ignorant about this man, His disciples should have investigated and found out that Zaccheus is not an upright man and does not have a good reputation.
[401]  One must not presume that God is able for no reason at all.
[402]  As for properties, houses, and valuables, they have to be sold.
[403]  G. Not Holding On to Anything, Always Letting Go
[404]  Many times when I read Acts 2 and 4, I get the impression that our so-called real assets such as properties and houses must somehow be sold.
[405]  God's children should always let go of what they have when it comes to supplying other children of God.
[406]  The Lord said, "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" v. 21 . A brother said to me once, "My treasures are on earth, but my heart is in heaven." I responded, "You are surely a museum piece, not of the London Museum, but of the Christian Museum.' The Lord said that no one can do this, yet you have come up with something that is more miraculous than a miracle." The Lord said that where our treasure is, there will be our heart.
[407]  APPENDIX FOUR IDENTIFYING HERESIES Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 11:13-15; 1 Tim 6:20-21; 2 Tim 4:3-4; 2 Pet 2:1; Jude 3; Isa 8:20
[408]  The first kind of heresy relates to the authority of the Bible.
[409]  Second Timothy 3:16 says, "All Scripture is God-breathed."
[410]  If they do not speak according to this word, it is because in them there is no dawn."
[411]  Concerning the person of Christ, the Bible shows us 1 that the Lord Jesus is God, 2 that He is the Son of God, 3 that He is the Christ appointed by God, 4 that He is a perfect man, and 5 that after His resurrection He is both God and man in heaven.
[412]  First John 3 says that the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil v. 8 . If a man does not recognize that Jesus the Son of God has come in the flesh, it means that he does not recognize the Lord's work in destroying the devil.
[413]  Some heresies try to deny the matter of sin altogether.
[414]  The Bible clearly tells us that man has sinned.
[415]  In saying that man has sinned, the Bible means two things.
[416]  Second, man has sinned against God; this is sin before God.
[417]  The Bible records many miracles and works of wonders.
[418]  There is nothing wrong for a man who has faith, who has a word from God, and who believes in such a word to pray and anoint sick ones in the name of the Lord.
