   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 18:28-35</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>28 But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a 1 hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>29 Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>30 But he would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>31 Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly 1 grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>32 Then his master called him to him and said to him, Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>33 Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>34 And his master became angry and 1 delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>35 So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 28 definitely refers to things that take place in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How small is any brother's debt to us compared to our debt to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, we may not be willing to forgive vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The offended brother, the one not willing to forgive others, was certainly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, in this parable the Lord is dealing not with sinners, but with believers, with saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He deals with a brother who has been offended, yet who is not willing to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verses 15 through 20 the emphasis is on the offending brother needing to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the parable the emphasis is on the offended one needing to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both our unwillingness to repent and our unwillingness to forgive will keep us out of the kingdom not only in this age but in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps you have not heard such a serious word before and were misled concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Christians do not know how to interpret this part of the Word because they have not seen God's dispensational administration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They do not realize that God has ordained three ages: the present age, the coming age, and the eternal age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to Matthew 12:32, certain sins cannot be forgiven either in this age or in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that other sins can be forgiven in this age or in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not practice the way of repentance and forgiveness, the longer we stay in the church life, the more offenses there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will annul the kingdom life and cause us to forfeit the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May the Lord grant us the grace we need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I offend you, I need to go to you and repent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you offend me, I need to look to the Lord for the grace to forgive you from my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And once I have forgiven an offense, I should forget it and never mention it again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do this, we will have the proper kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will share in the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>28 1 Less than one ten thousandth of ten thousand talents.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It refers to a sin committed against us by a brother after we are saved and become slaves of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>31 1 Our not forgiving the brother who sins against us will grieve the other brothers, and they may bring this matter to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>34 1 This refers to the Lord's dealing with His believers at His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, we will be disciplined by the Lord until we forgive him from the heart, i.e., until we repay all that is owed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the Lord will forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is forgiveness in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This implies that if we do not forgive a brother from our heart today, we will not be allowed to enter into the kingdom in the coming age.</S>
