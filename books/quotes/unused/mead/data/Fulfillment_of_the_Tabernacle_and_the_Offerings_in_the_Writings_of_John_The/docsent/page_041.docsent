   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONTINUING TO LIVE BY OUR OLD BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our actual daily living we may not be a newborn person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may still be an old person, even perhaps a good, moral, ethical, religious, God-fearing Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I say this because we may not live, walk, behave, and have our being in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of living by the Spirit, we may live by ethics or religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before you were saved, you may have done things that were sinful, perhaps even immoral.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now that you are saved, you would never do those things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have become a person who is religious, ethical, and moral.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, you fear the Lord and you seek Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, all this may be something of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It may not be the living of a reborn person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This does not mean, however, that you have not been reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have been reborn, and you have received another life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the problem is that you do not live by this life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let me give you an illustration to point out how a newborn person can live by the old life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many years ago in my hometown, most of the houses did not have electric lights.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our home we used kerosene lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From the time I was a child, I learned to take care of these lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I learned to clean the chimney, trim the wick, and supply oil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was accustomed to doing this every day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in 1939 we had electric lights installed in our home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All we had to do from that time onward was switch on the lights.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, I was still in the habit of using an oil lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Often, out of habit, I would come home late in the evening, go to the oil lamp, and pick up a match to light it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then my children would laugh at me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Realizing what I was doing, I would throw the match away and go to the light switch.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though electricity had been installed in our home, I was still in the habit of using an oil lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, even though we have been reborn and have the divine life, we are not in the habit of living by it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to our natural birth, all of us automatically live by our serpentine being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is to live according to good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With the tree of knowledge in the garden of Eden there was not only the knowledge of evil, but also the knowledge of good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But with the tree of life there is nothing but life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not think that morality is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Morality is good, but it is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Confucius taught many things concerning morality and ethics, but he had nothing to say about the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I turned to Christ, I turned to Him for life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I realized that I had learned things that were good, but I did not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After I was saved, the main subject in my preaching of the gospel to the Chinese people was the matter of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I told the people, "Confucius may teach you to be good, but he cannot give you life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is life, and you must come to Him in order to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether you are good or bad, you still need life."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No matter what kind of person we may be, in our natural life we all are serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One person may be very refined and another quite crude, but both are serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Certain snakes may be colorful, and others may be ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But regardless of their color, they all are snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same principle, whether we are good or bad by nature, we are still serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before we were saved, we lived by our serpentine life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then after we were saved and became genuine Christians, we became religious, and we tried to live a religious, ethical, moral, and good life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This may be your situation right up until the present.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I consider the situation among Christians today, I often weep inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I may mourn before the Lord and say to Him, "Lord, I have been ministering to Your saints for years concerning Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But, Lord, I cannot see many that daily live and have their being in You."</S>
