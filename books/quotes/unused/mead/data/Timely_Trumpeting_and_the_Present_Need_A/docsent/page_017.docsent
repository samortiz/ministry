   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR A WORD OF FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATION Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:18; 4:16; John 21:15-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I hope to give a word of fellowship and exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After much prayer and seeking before the Lord, I feel that the Lord s recovery both in the East as well as in the West has arrived at a stage where we need to look for a fresh revival.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Particularly here in Taiwan, the elders of the churches and the co-workers should pick up the burden to seek a fresh revival.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A REVIVAL OF THE INNER LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The revival that I am talking about is not the kind of revival commonly known in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not something sudden, brought about by days of prayer and fasting and accompanied by extraordinary events, resulting in a general excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The revival that I am talking about is the renewing described in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Corinthians 4:16 says, ...indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The renewal here is a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every day we need a renewal, and this renewal has to be refreshed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we need today is this kind of renewal in the inner life as opposed to a renewal in outward actions or expression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has set up a natural law that the rising of the sun affords a new beginning and a fresh renewal every day for everything, whether plant, animal, or human being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same is true with our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every morning we should allow the Lord Jesus, our Sun, to rise up in us so that we can be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the revival that I am talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have covered this matter in an elders and co-workers meeting already, but I feel that I have not yet awakened the attention of the saints in all the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the words of this message will be short, I hope that the elders taking the lead in all the churches, together with all the helping co-workers, will practice this new revival, that the Lord Jesus may have a fresh rising within us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>EARLY TO BED AND EARLY TO RISE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to achieve this, all of you should rise up early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But to rise up early, one must go to bed early.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you cannot go to bed early, it will be hard for you to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Early rising affords tremendous benefits for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every morning, when the sun rises up, it is time for us to rise up to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should pray to the Lord, Thank You, Lord, for a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May this day be a memorable day in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, we have such a fresh consecration and waiting before the Lord; on the other hand, we receive from Him fresh bestowals and enlightenings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With all this freshness, we will naturally have a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what we call a morning-by-morning revival.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is also what Paul described as the renewing day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This renewal happens early every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that this matter would be practiced properly among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the co-workers with the elders should trumpet this call in all the places, awakening all the saints to go to bed early and rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as we get up, we should have a good touch with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No matter how busy we are or how important other things are, we must put them aside until we have a touch with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CONTACTING THE LORD DIRECTLY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BY PRAY-READING IN ORDER TO ENJOY HIM</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This touch with the Lord should preferably be for half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the very least, it should be for fifteen minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This should be something very easy for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Leviticus 6:12 tells us that the priest shall burn wood on it the altar every morning and arrange the burnt offering on it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that every morning we should offer up Christ as our burnt offering based upon His being our sin offering so that we may have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only must we do this every day, we must also do it with sweetness and depth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fifteen minutes in the morning is not mainly for prayer or supplication; rather, it is for a direct touch with the Lord by which we speak to Him and He speaks to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, the best way is to spend this time on a few verses, so that we may be filled by the Lord through pray-reading His Word in an enjoyable way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this way, we will have a new beginning and a fresh revival.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are daily revived spiritually, there will be no need for a big revival.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually, none of the so-called big revivals are long lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, the great Welsh revival at the beginning of this century was over by 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the revivals brought in by various spiritual movements in the past were transient.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After a while, they all cooled down.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of sporadic revival is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The reliable revival is the kind that comes from a daily renewal.</S>
