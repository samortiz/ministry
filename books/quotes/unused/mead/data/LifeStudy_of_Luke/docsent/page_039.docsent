   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN GALILEE 3 Scripture Reading: Luke 5:1 6:11 THE SPIRITUAL CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>OF EVERY FALLEN HUMAN BEING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 5:1 6:11 we have a record of five cases: the attracting of the occupied 5:1-11 , the cleansing of the contaminated 5:12-16 , the healing of the paralytic 5:17-26 , the calling of the despised 5:27-39 , and the breaking of the deformed sabbatical regulation for people s satisfaction and liberation 6:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not regard these cases merely as records of what happened to different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually all these cases portray a single person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the Lord Jesus performed a miracle related to fishing, Peter said to Him, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Immediately following, we have the case of the cleansing of a man full of leprosy, the cleansing of a contaminated one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter was not only an occupied person but also a contaminated person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Spiritually speaking, the same is true of us all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, in addition to being occupied and contaminated, we are paralyzed, despised, and under the bondage of the deformed regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The cases 5:1 6:11 portray the spiritual condition of every fallen human being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we were saved, we were occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We were also lepers, sinful people, in need of cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition, we were paralytics, those unable to walk or do anything according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we were in need of the Lord s healing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No matter what a person s occupation may be, when he is called by the Lord and released, he immediately realizes that he is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When people are busy with their occupation, they may think that they are very good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when they are released from their occupation to follow the Lord, they realize that they are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, after they are cleansed, they realize that they are paralyzed with respect to God and the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are not able to walk in God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But after they are healed, they come to see that they are tax collectors, despised persons considered to be of no value.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, they understand that they are under the bondage of certain regulations and are in need of both satisfaction and liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we are freed from our occupation, cleansed from our leprosy, and healed of our paralysis, we become in the Lord a person of value, for now we have Him as the new clothing to cover us outwardly and as the new wine to fill us inwardly Luke 5:36-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Following this, we are released from the binding regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, we become persons fully saved by the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we read 5:1 6:11, we should not consider these cases as separate from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, we need to regard all these cases as describing aspects of the condition of a single person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In particular, these cases are a portrait of the spiritual condition of every fallen human being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CLEANSING THE CONTAMINATED Revealing the Lord s Human Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In each of these cases we can see the human virtues of the Man-Savior and also the divine attributes expressed in His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Consider the case of the cleansing of the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Luke 5:12 says, And it came about that as He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You will, You can cleanse me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And immediately the leprosy left him v. 13 . In this case the Lord acts in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we see that the Man-Savior sympathized with the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the Old Testament, a leper was not to be touched by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to keep others away from him, a leper was required to cry out, Unclean, unclean!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, a leper was altogether isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the Man-Savior stretched forth His hand to touch this leper.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord s touching the leper reveals His human virtue.</S>
