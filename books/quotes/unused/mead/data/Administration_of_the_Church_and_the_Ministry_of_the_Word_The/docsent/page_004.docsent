   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CENTRAL WORK OF GOD BEING THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The central work of God is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The building is not a matter of understanding doctrines, saving sinners, or even edifying the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even though the New Testament refers to the edification of individual saints, its focus is on the building of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We often have strong feelings concerning saving sinners and edifying the saints, but we lack feeling concerning building God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This does not mean that we should not pay attention to saving sinners and edifying the saints, but we need to see the ultimate goal of God s work in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since Paul had a clear vision concerning the building, he said, As a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But let each man take heed how he builds upon it 1 Cor 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to be careful concerning the way we build, the materials we build with, and the outcome of our building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May the brothers and sisters see that saving sinners and edifying the saints are related to the central goal of building God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we pay attention to this central work, our preaching the gospel to save sinners will be more effective, and our edification of the saints will not cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, our shortage in building God s house is the basic reason the brothers and sisters in Taipei do not seem to have the strength to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The key is the building of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God s house, the Body of Christ, can be built up, saving sinners and edifying the saints will be very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE KEY TO THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH AND</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The two most important matters in the building up of the church, God s house, are the administration of the church and the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the administration of a local church is poor, there will not be much building in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Similarly, if the ministry of the word is poor in a local church, there will not be much building there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have used the word edification for so many years, but we now need to use the word building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The individual saints need to be edified, but the church as a corporate entity, as the Body of Christ and the house of God, needs to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The building up of the church depends on the administration of the church and the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the New Testament, all our speaking should be for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Corinthians 14:12 Paul says, Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 1 says, Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The gift that excels in building up the church is prophesying, because prophesying is a matter of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1 and 2 Timothy, when the church was in a desolate situation, there was the need for the administration of the church in addition to the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The responsibility for the administration of the church is with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the church became desolate, the apostle spoke of the administration of the church in the books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The administration of the church becomes crucial when the church is in desolation and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The administration of the church and other matters related to the elders are not spoken of in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus clearly speak of the administration by the elders, because the church had become desolate at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we know the principle of the Bible, we will understand the meaning of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the initial stage of the church God led and built up the church by the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, at a certain time the ministry of the word was not sufficient; there was the need for the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, in the books of 1 and 2 Timothy we see both the administration of the church and the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul says, The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also 2 Tim 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we see the ministry of the word and the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the church had been established for a period of time, there was the need for the administration of the church as well as the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both are necessary for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the administration of a local church and the ministry of the word are poor, the church will not be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the administration of the church and the ministry of the word are strong, the church can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that the central work of God in this age is His building; He wants to build His house, the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since we have a part in this building, we must see the administration of the church and the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The ministry of the word is related to gift, and the administration of the church is related to office.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both of these aspects are for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our speaking as prophets is for the ministry of the word and is related to the aspect of gift.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The serving of the elders is for the administration of the church and is related to the aspect of office.</S>
