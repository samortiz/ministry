   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 3 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 5:1-3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 And when He saw the crowds, He 1 went up to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And after He sat down, His 2 disciples came to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2 And opening His mouth, He taught them, saying,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3 Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 1 The new King called His followers by the seashore, but to give them the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, He went up to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that for the realization of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to go higher with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 2 When the new King sat down on the mountain, His disciples, not the crowds, came to Him to be His audience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, not only the believing Jews but also the discipled nations the Gentiles 28:19 became His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later the disciples were called Christians Acts 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the word the new King spoke on the mountain in chs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>5 7, concerning the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, was spoken to the believers of the New Testament, not to the Jews of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew 5, 6, and 7 may be called the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In these three chapters, we see a revelation of the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The nature is singular, but the principles are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is composed of seven sections: the nature of the kingdom people 5:1-12 ; the influence of the kingdom people upon the world 5:13-16 ; the law of the kingdom people 5:17-48 ; the righteous deeds of the kingdom people 6:1-18 ; the dealing of the kingdom people with riches 6:19-34 ; the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others 7:1-12 ; and the ground of the kingdom people's living and work 7:13-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first section, 5:3-12, depicts the nature of the kingdom of the heavens under nine blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It unfolds the kind of people who live in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The kingdom people must also exert an influence upon the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The nature of the kingdom people, the very nature of the kingdom, exercises an influence upon the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The kingdom people also have a law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This law is not the old law, the law of Moses, the ten commandments; it is the new law of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The kingdom people are those who perform righteous deeds and who have the proper attitude concerning material riches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the kingdom people are still on earth in human society, the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens reveals principles by which they deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Finally, in the last section of this constitution we see the ground, the base, of the daily life and work of the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All Christians should be kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the situation today is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many believers are not on the high level of the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The kingdom people are the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In God's economy, every believer should be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be an overcomer is not to be something special; it is to be normal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These verses 5:3-12 describe nine aspects of the nature of the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are poor in spirit, mourning for the present situation, meek in suffering opposition, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful toward others, pure in heart, making peace with all men, suffering persecution for righteousness, and suffering being reproached and evil spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every aspect begins with the word, "Blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The English word "blessed" does not adequately translate the Greek word here, for the Greek word conveys the meanings of both blessed and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we should not use the word happy in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The blessedness and the happiness here is not a light thing; it is something that is rather weighty.</S>
