 <h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND PATIENT<br />
IN TAKING THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Some local churches have a large number of elderly saints, and the leading ones in these localities hope that they can all speak and function; this may not be easy for the elderly saints. We need to be patient with them and wait for them. In a sense, we are climbing a mountain. The younger ones certainly will be in the front, but the older ones may not be able to keep pace. At such times, the younger ones need to exercise patience to wait for the older ones. In carrying out the new way, we should not force people, expect too much, or want to achieve enormous success with the first try. The elderly saints are not young in age, and it is impossible for them to be like the young people; therefore, we need to take it slowly and not be too hasty. Rather, we need to work in a slow and steady way. Do not expect an instant success. A quick success often implies a quick failure. A slow success, on the contrary, lasts longer. There is an ancient Chinese saying: &ldquo;He who advances with haste will retreat with haste.&rdquo; This means that quick progress often results in a quick withdrawal; in contrast, a steady progress that occurs little by little is the most secure. If we spend five years to put the new way into practice in Taiwan, we will greatly please the Lord.</p>
<p>The trainees among us pass through four terms of training, that is, two years. However, not a single program in the secular system of education is able to perfect a talent within two years. Elementary school usually takes six years, junior high school takes three years, high school also takes three years, college requires another four years, and in order to get a masters degree, graduate school takes an additional two years. If someone has the ability, he may receive a doctorate degree after even more years. This demonstrates that there is no program of study in the world that is able to perfect someone within two years. We should never expect that after four terms of training, the trainees will be specialists.</p>
<p>Although two years of study cannot produce specialists, there is still a great difference between those who have passed through two years of the training and those who have not. Even if someone has finished only four years of elementary school education, he is still very different from one who has never been to school and is illiterate. We should not seek to advance quickly in the new way; rather, we need to take care of people&rsquo;s actual situation.</p>
<p>The young people learn fast no matter what the subject matter is. In reference to climbing a mountain, although they may be able to reach a peak within thirty minutes, they should not leave the older ones behind. Instead, they need to take care of the older ones. When older people try to climb a mountain, they may need to rest for ten minutes after walking for five minutes. Young people are able to walk fast without any rest, whereas older people need to walk and sit. They may not reach the peak in half a day; however, sooner or later they will arrive. The situation with the church is the same. I hope that the responsible brothers in all the churches will exercise patience to lead the saints positively, continuing in the new way but not being too hasty. They should believe that the new way will eventually succeed.</p>
<p>In 1937 Brother Nee spoke of the need to change the big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, a meeting in which one person spoke and everyone else listened. Nevertheless, he also said that the habit that needed to be changed was deeply and firmly constituted into the saints and that it would be difficult to overthrow. To overthrow this habit requires that everyone push in one accord. I still remember clearly that he used the word <em>push.</em> He said that slowly but surely this deeply and firmly rooted habit within us will be overturned. I believe that as long as the brothers and sisters go on faithfully and patiently, the old system on the island of Taiwan will be completely overthrown within five years.</p>
