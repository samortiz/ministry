   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We know that sin leads to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But we must realize that the book of Galatians is not on the subject of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Galatians speaks of good works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It speaks of keeping the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Galatians is on the keeping of the law and circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul did not say that they had fallen into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said that they had fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a big difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be fallen from grace and to fall into sin are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be fallen from grace is to be fallen from the principle of grace and to follow the principle of works once again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, there are numerous saved believers who have fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But they have not lost their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even we ourselves are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A countless number of times we think that we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But our salvation is because of the grace of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul said that those in Galatians 5 strove to overcome, but they had fallen from grace to trust in their works instead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They wanted to have good works, but when they did this, they fell.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is to be in grace?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Grace means that we are lowly and helpless persons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have received grace before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are in a lowly position.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are looking to God to give us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As such, we are those that live in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not a matter of sin or evil conduct here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a man trusts in his own work, he is obstructing the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul rebuked the Galatians here for following the law after they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They had fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He reprimanded them for not having received enough grace and not having received enough mercy from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To receive mercy and grace from God is to allow God to work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This proves that the flesh is incapable and cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can work by our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But those in the flesh do not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose Brother Yau is an unprincipled man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every day he earns a dollar fifty cents but spends two dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Tonight I have pity on him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is short of fifty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I give him sixty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is like this every day, and I have pity on him also every day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose one day Brother Yau starts thinking, "Mr. Nee has had pity on me and has sent me money every day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But I have to think of a way to discipline myself a little."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When he does this, he is doing what the Galatians were doing with circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were doing it in the flesh, and as a result, they had fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have met such people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the world's point of view, I like such people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not want others to feed them the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They want to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the Bible says that, as far as God is concerned, this is wrong because such people have fallen from His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul was not rebuking them for sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul was rebuking them for doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul rebuked them for doing good because their doing good meant that they did not need God's mercy anymore for the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They would not live in God's mercy anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My friends, man's thought is totally different from God's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We think that we can please God by doing a little.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But God is happy when we remain in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He repeatedly says that He desires mercy and not sacrifice Matt 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Mercy is for God to give you something, and sacrifice is for you to give something to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God desires mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that He likes to give things to you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He does not desire sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that He does not want you to give things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If God can give things away, He will feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Salvation is not to make us happy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Salvation is to make God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God likes to keep giving.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He wants to work continually on us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He wants to give us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You might think that it is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But He thinks that it is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You are a poor man and can get by with a few pennies a day.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But now you are given a few dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No wonder you would think that it is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If God is to do something, He wants to do it to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you allow Him to do only a little, He will not feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you want to be saved, you have to willingly allow God to work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You have to ask God to be merciful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God can only be happy if He is allowed to work this way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you keep trying to give God something, He will not feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When God sees you being shown mercy, He is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is why I say that God desires mercy and not sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Galatians 5:4 says that we should not fall outside of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It does not say that we should not fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What is contended here is not the question of salvation, but the question of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Before God, we need not move, and we need not keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should just allow God to work on us and to give us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Once we have works, we are fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, to say that one has fallen from grace does not refer to the question of salvation and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To be fallen from grace is a question of whether or not we enjoy Christ's benefits for us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>To be fallen from grace is a matter of whether or not one allows the work of Christ to operate in him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We thank the Lord that salvation means to be continually under God's mercy and to be continually under His grace.</S>
