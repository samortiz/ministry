   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOING AND COMING BACK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the outer man is broken, the spirit spontaneously will remain in the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A brother read Brother Lawrence's book The Practice of the Presence of God the second year after he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He struggled very much because he was not able to enjoy God's presence continually like Brother Lawrence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He made a pact with a brother to pray once every hour.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He wanted to follow the biblical teaching of praying unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every time the clock struck the hour, they would try to kneel down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, they felt as if they could not maintain God's presence, and they wrestled to turn back to God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was as if they wandered away from God whenever they went about their own business or became engaged in their studies so that they had to hurriedly turn back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If they did not turn back, they felt that they would be gone forever.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They prayed all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On Sundays they prayed the whole day, and on Saturdays they prayed half of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They did this for two or three years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But even though they felt His presence when they turned back to God, they would lose it as soon as they turned away.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The problem of maintaining God's presence with human memory is a great frustration to many Christians, not just to these brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To them, the "presence" of God can only be maintained when their memory is fresh; when their memory fails, the "presence" is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such attempts to preserve the divine presence with human memory are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's presence is in the spirit, not in the memory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to deal with God's presence, we have to first deal with the matter of the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The nature of our emotion is different from the nature of God; the two can never be joined as one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same can be said of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 4 shows us that God's nature is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only our spirit is of the same nature as God, and only our spirit can be in harmony with God forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we try to retain God's presence in our mind, this presence is lost as soon as we are not in complete control of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we try to retain God's presence in our emotion, the same is true; this presence is gone as soon as we are not in complete control of our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes when we are happy, we think we have God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But this happiness does not stay.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When it goes away, our sense of His presence is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may think that we have God's presence when we weep, but we cannot weep all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sooner or later our tears will stop, and when they stop, God's presence seemingly stops as well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The function of the mind and the function of the emotion are both activities, and no activity can go on forever.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we try to maintain God's presence with activity, this presence will be gone as soon as the activity stops.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Two substances will blend together only when they are of the same nature, such as water with water or air with air.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Things with the same nature can enjoy each other's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The inner man is of the same nature as God; therefore, it can realize God's presence through His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The outer man is constantly in the realm of activity; therefore, it is a frustration to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The outer man is not a help but a hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The inner man will be free from distractions only when the outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has installed a spirit within us to respond to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The outer man, however, only responds to outward signals.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A man loses God's presence and the enjoyment of it because his outer man is constantly responding to outside activity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot eliminate all outward signals, but the outer man can be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot stop all outside activity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Millions and billions of things in this world are occurring outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the outer man is not broken, we will react whenever something happens outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot enjoy God's presence calmly and continually because the outer man is constantly reacting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's presence is based on the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If God grants us mercy and breaks our outer man, we will manifest the following traits: Our old curiosity will be dead; we will no longer be curious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Formerly, we were very strong in our emotion; we were easily stirred up in the tender sentiment of love or in the raw sentiment of anger whenever something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We reacted as soon as something happened around us, and we were caught up in those things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, we lost God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if God is merciful to us, He will break our outer man, and our inner man will no longer be touched when many things happen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We will remain calm, and God's presence will abide with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must see that the enjoyment of God's presence is based on the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A man can only enjoy God's uninterrupted presence when his outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brother Lawrence worked in a kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people would come and demand service from him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There was noise all around him; plates were shuffled back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet Brother Lawrence was not affected by all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He had God's presence when he prayed, and he also had God's presence when he was busily working.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How could he maintain God's presence in the midst of his hectic work?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The secret is that no outward noise could affect his inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some people lose God's presence because they are inwardly affected as soon as they hear any noise around them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some who do not know God try to hold on to God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What do they do?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They look for an environment where there is "no shuffling of plates."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They think that the farther away they are from people and activities, the closer they will be to God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They think that the problem is with the "plates," the human distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No, the problem is with them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God is not delivering us from the "plates"; He is delivering us from being influenced by them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everything around us can be in turmoil, but within we can remain untouched.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everything around us can be clamorous, but within we can be perfectly still.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Once the Lord breaks our outer man, our inner being will not respond to such things; we will have a deaf ear to these noises.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thank God that we can have very sensitive ears.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, the action of grace and the operation of His work will break our outer man, and nothing that comes upon our outer man will affect us any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When the "plates" clamor, we can hide ourselves in God's presence as much as when we are praying by ourselves alone.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once the outer man is broken, a man does not have to come back to God because he is with God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There is no need for a coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>An unbroken man needs to come back to God whenever he goes about with his business because he has moved away.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the reason he has to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A broken man never moves away; therefore, he does not need to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Many people move away all the time, even while they are working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is because their outer man has never been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is best that they not do anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As soon as they do something, they move away.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But those who know God in a genuine way never move away.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, they never need to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If they spend the whole day praying to God, they enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If they spend the whole day busily scrubbing the floor, they still enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As soon as our outer man is broken, we will live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We will not need to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There will not be the feeling nor need to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We usually feel God's presence only when we come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Whatever we do, even when we exercise the utmost care, we feel that we have turned away from God a little.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I am afraid that this is most of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Although we conscientiously try to rein ourselves in, we turn away as soon as we engage in some activity.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Many brothers and sisters feel that they have to drop the things they have in their hands before they can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They somehow feel that there is a difference between being in God and doing some form of work.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>For example, we may be helping a person by preaching the gospel to him or by edifying him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Halfway through our conversation, we may feel that we have to pray and come back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We feel that we have somehow drifted from God in talking to others and that by praying we can come back to Him once more.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It seems as if we have moved and are returning to God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We have lost His presence, and now we are regaining it.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We may be conducting some daily chores such as scrubbing the floor or working at some craft.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>After we are finished with this work, we feel that we have to come back before we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We feel that there is a great distance between where we are and where we want to be.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Any feeling of coming back is a sign that we have moved.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The breaking of the outer man will bring us to the point where we will not have to come back any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We will feel as much of God's presence in talking to others as when we are kneeling down and praying with them.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We will feel as much of God's presence in scrubbing the floor and working on our craft as when we are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>These things will not take us away from God's presence any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>As a result, we will no longer need to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Let me give a more extreme example.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The most raw sentiment a man can have is temper.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The Bible does not say that we cannot be angry; some forms of anger are unrelated to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The Bible says that we should "be angry, yet do not sin" Eph 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This shows that a person can become angry without sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Yet anger is a very raw sentiment.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>In fact, it is close to sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>God's Word never says that we should love yet not sin, because love is far from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Nor does God's Word say that we should be patient yet not sin, because patience is also far from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But God's Word says, "Be angry, yet do not sin."</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>This shows that anger is very close to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Sometimes a brother commits a big mistake, and we have to rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>But this is a very hard thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>It is easy to exercise kindness but very hard to exercise anger.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Once we are careless, we will fall into a different state.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>It is not easy to be angry according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>If we know the breaking of the outer man, we can enjoy God's continual presence without interruption from the outer man, whether we are rebuking a brother severely or praying in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Putting this a different way, we will not have the feeling that we are turning back to God when we pray after rebuking a brother severely.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Any feeling of turning back to God is a proof that we have left God.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>I admit that rebuking a brother is a difficult thing to do, but if our outer man is broken, we can rebuke a brother without the need of turning back to God because God's presence will be with us all the time.</S>
