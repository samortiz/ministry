[2]  This book is a translation of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the Chinese New Year's Conference in Anaheim, California in February 1984; in the Young People's Conference in Anaheim in August 1984; and in a Chinese-speaking working saints' meeting in Alhambra, California in April 1991.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS OF THE BIBLE THE CHURCH, CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, AND LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 4:1-6; Col 3:4a; John 15:4-5; 1 Cor 6:17; Exo 30:23-25; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:11; 15:16b; 2 Cor 3:18; Rev 4:5; 1 Cor 1:30; John 14:17; Phil 1:19-21a OUTLINE The church the emphasis being that the believers are on the ground of oneness to be the testimony of the Body of Christ Eph 1:23; 4:1-6.
[4]  The Spirit the emphasis being that the Holy Spirit of God has been compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection to be the compound, life-giving, indwelling, sanctifying, transforming, and sevenfold intensified Spirit Exo 30:23-25; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:11; 15:16b; 2 Cor 3:18; Rev 4:5.
[5]  God has called us out of the world, out of every nation, tribe, people, and tongue Rev 7:9 and has gathered us together to be the church.
[6]  CHRIST THE EMPHASIS BEING THAT CHRIST IS THE BELIEVERS' LIFE AND IS UNITED AND MINGLED WITH THE BELIEVERS
[7]  The second crucial element of the Bible is Christ.
[8]  The holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25 typifies the Triune God being processed and eventually consummated as the Spirit.
[9]  It was not until the Lord Jesus was glorified in His resurrection Luke 24:26 that the Holy Spirit became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and life-giving Jesus Christ, having both the divine element and the human element, including Christ's divinity and humanity with all the essences and realities of His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: John 15:4; Col 1:27; Eph 3:17; Gen 1:26; 2:9; John 16:12-13; 6:56; 1 Cor 15:45b; Heb 1:8; Col 2:9; John 14:9-10; 3:34; 6:63; 14:23, 25-26; 15:26; 2 Tim 4:22; John 4:24; Rev 22:17 THE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE BEING NOT FOR DOCTRINE BUT FOR EXPERIENCE
[11]  Concerning the person of Christ, who is a mystery, we must not merely have objective knowledge in doctrine.
[12]  TWO STEPS TAKEN BY THE TRIUNE GOD IN ORDER TO BECOME OUR EXPERIENCE
[13]  Christ is the One who is the embodiment of the complete Triune God, who is inseparable.
[14]  When we have the Lord Jesus, we have God because Christ is God.
[15]  At the same time, when we have the Lord Jesus, we have the Father because the Father is in Him and He is in the Father.
[16]  Furthermore, since Christ has become the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection, when we have Him, we have the Spirit also.
[17]  John 14:26 says that the Father sends the Spirit in the Son, and 15:26 says that the Son sends the Spirit from the Father, and when the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father.
[18]  For us to experience Christ we need to see that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection.
[19]  If we link this verse with John 14:26 and 15:26, we can see that the life-giving Spirit is the Spirit who is sent by the Father in the Son and who is also sent by the Son from the Father and with the Father.
[20]  Therefore, became refers not only to the Son's becoming the Spirit through His death and resurrection but also to the Father's sending the Spirit in the Son and the Son's sending the Spirit from the Father and with the Father.
[21]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 9:5; 1 Tim 2:5; 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 1:30; Col 3:4; Eph 3:8; Gal 2:20; 4:19; Phil 1:20, 21a; 3:8, 10a CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, LIFE, AND THE CHURCH BEING THE EXTRACTS OF THE BIBLE
[22]  In 1961 I led the saints in Taipei in a study of the riches of Christ to make a list of all the titles of Christ in the Bible.
[23]  First Timothy 2:5 says that Christ is also man.
[24]  It is more difficult to speak of Christ as man than to speak of Him as God.
[25]  In the record of the four Gospels the Lord Jesus twice fed, in a miraculous way, the crowds who followed Him Matt 14:14-21; 15:32-39; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-13 .
[26]  The Lord Jesus not only lived a human life but was eventually crucified for our redemption.
[27]  Moreover, He was resurrected from death and became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b .
[28]  Rather, He is God, man, the Spirit, our wisdom righteousness, sanctification, and redemption our life within, and the One who is all-inclusive and unsearchably rich.
[29]  In order to live and magnify Christ, Paul said that he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain Christ Phil 3:8 .
[30]  However, after he was saved, the things in which he trusted in his flesh, including the righteousness of the law, he counted as loss because they became replacements of Christ that distracted him from Christ and made it impossible for him to experience Christ, live Christ, and magnify Christ.
[31]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 7:37-39; 14:16-20; Acts 16:7b; Rom 8:9b; Phil 1:19; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:16; Rev 2:7; 3:22; 14:13; 22:17; John 6:63b
[32]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You as the fountain of living water for our satisfaction.
[33]  THE REALITY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The Forerunner and His Whole Family Being Filled with the Holy Spirit
[34]  In the New Testament, the One who is portrayed, typified, and prophesied in the Old Testament came.
[35]  Holy Spirit is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God in the New Testament.
[36]  Living the God-man Life by the Holy Spirit
[37]  The Lord Jesus began to minister at the age of thirty.
[38]  As soon as He was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, that is, was poured upon Him.
[39]  The apostle John told us, "But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive" v. 39a . We know the Spirit of God, we can understand the Spirit of Jehovah, and we know a little concerning the Holy Spirit, but what is "the Spirit" referred to here? In Greek, there is a great emphasis in using the definite article.
[40]  One day, after they had been following the Lord Jesus for less than three years, suddenly He indicated to them that He was going to die.
[41]  THE ESSENCE AND SPHERE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BEING THE SPIRIT
[42]  The Old Testament speaks of Christ by way of allegories and types.
[43]  The Content of the Entire New Testament Being the Spirit
[44]  At the beginning Matthew says that Mary conceived through the Holy Spirit and brought forth a God-man; at the end John says that this God-man became the Spirit and was breathed into His disciples.
[45]  At the conclusion of the Gospels, the God-man Jesus, who brought divinity into humanity through incarnation and who also brought humanity into divinity through death and resurrection, became the Spirit.
[46]  The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God, while the Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross.
[47]  The processed and consummated Spirit, who is within us today, is our unique need.
[48]  Often we have a natural concept, thinking that if we love the Lord, we need to be taught more through His oracle to know how to be proper parents, children, husbands, or wives and how to speak to others with a proper tone and attitude.
[49]  Bible readers all know that the Bible speaks of God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit.
[50]  When Christ came out to minister at the age of thirty for the accomplishing of the commission which He had received from God, the Spirit of God descended upon Him Matt 3:16 .
[51]  Matthew 1:18, 20 and Luke 1:35 unveil to us that Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit as His essence.
[52]  Then at His baptism, the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, descended upon Him again.
[53]  The Holy Spirit as the essence of Jesus in His conception and birth was His divine life, and He lived by this Spirit as His essence and life.
[54]  Jesus had the Holy Spirit in the essential aspect as His intrinsic nature from His conception and birth, but it was at His baptism that the Holy Spirit in the economical aspect descended upon Him as His outward power.
[55]  In Resurrection the Son Entering into the Disciples as the Comforter That They Might Experience the Son in the Father
[56]  How could the Lord enter into the disciples, and how could He be with them forever?
[57]  Another Comforter Being the Holy Spirit Whom the Father Sent in the Son's Name
[58]  Verse 6 says that Christ is the way, the reality, and the life; verse 9 says that he who has seen the Son has seen the Father; verse 11 says that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son; and verses 16 and 17 say that another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, would be given to the disciples not only to abide with them but also to be in them.
[59]  John 14:20 says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."
[60]  Hence, after the Spirit was breathed into the disciples, when they experienced the Spirit, they realized that the Spirit had brought the Father with Him and therefore the Father and the Spirit are one.
[61]  THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY OF ALL SPIRITUAL THINGS
[62]  After I was saved, I enjoyed reading spiritual books and magazines, especially the writings by Brother Watchman Nee.
[63]  In two of his books, The Normal Christian Life and The Overcoming Life, based on Romans 6, Brother Nee said that every Christian should know how to reckon v. 11 . For example, we should reckon that we have been crucified with Christ.
[64]  THE SPIRIT OF REALITY GUIDING THE BELIEVERS INTO THE SPIRITUAL REALITY
[65]  On the evening of the day of His resurrection, the Lord breathed into the disciples.
[66]  When the Holy Spirit operated, the disciples had an inward sense, and they understood the words that the Lord had spoken to them on the night He was betrayed, because the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of reality, entered into them and guided them into the subjective experience of the Lord John 14:17 .
[67]  The Spirit of reality as the other Comforter came into the disciples and led them to realize what the Lord had said: "I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" v. 20 . First, the disciples realized what the Lord had said in chapter fourteen about His being in the Father vv.
[68]  THE TRIUNE GOD NOT BEING FOR DOCTRINE BUT FOR THE BELIEVERS' EXPERIENCE
[69]  I was saved in 1925, and in 1931 I experienced a revival.
[70]  Some Bible teachers teach that we should not confuse the three of the Divine Trinity: the Father is simply the Father, the Son is simply the Son, and the Holy Spirit is simply the Holy Spirit.
[71]  THE SPIRIT OF REALITY BEING THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[72]  In Christianity, the general understanding concerning Colossians 1:27 is that it speaks of Christ in the believers but does not speak of the Father or the Spirit in us; that is, Christ is related neither to the Father nor to the Spirit because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate persons.
[73]  Many have not seen that 2:9 in the same book says that in this Christ is not only the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit but also all the fullness of the Godhead the fullness of the Father, the fullness of the Son, and the fullness of the Spirit.
[74]  It is true that the Triune God is one God, but there is the aspect of three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[75]  As the Son, He came to die to redeem us from our sins.
[76]  However, this does not mean that while the Son was dying, the Father and the Spirit were not there.
[77]  When we call on the Lord, passing through the Son, we are in the Spirit because the Son and the Spirit are one and because the Spirit is the reality of the Son's name.
[78]  When Ephesians 2:18 speaks of these three steps, it is telling us not that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three different persons but that they are one God in three aspects: the aspect of His redeeming us, the aspect of His applying redemption to us, and the aspect of His coming into us for our enjoyment.
[79]  The second passage in the New Testament that speaks of the Triune God is Ephesians 3:16-17, which says, "That He the Father would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ the Son may make His home in your hearts through faith."
[80]  This is the apostle Paul's prayer that the believers may experience the fullness of God according to the riches of the Father's glory that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God v. 19b . The Father hears Paul's prayer and grants the believers to be strengthened through the Spirit into the inner man.
[81]  The third passage in the New Testament which speaks of the Triune God is Ephesians 4:4-6, which says, "One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
[82]  Here we see the Spirit, the Son, and the Father, because these three verses speak of the Body of Christ.
[83]  When we speak of the Body of Christ, we must begin with the Spirit, because it is the Spirit who is in the Body.
[84]  If these three verses are explained according to the traditional teachings of Christianity, then some may say that there are three different Gods, and some may even say that God is not only three in one, but five in one: one is the Spirit, another one is the Lord, and still another one is composed of "three Gods," one who is over us, another who is through us, and still another who is in us.
[85]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE SPIRIT WITH THE HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 20:22; 16:13-15; Col 1:18; 1 Cor 11:3; Matt 28:19; John 3:6; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 1:9; Eph 1:17b; 2:22; 3:16b; 4:23b; 5:18b; 6:18a; 1 Cor 6:17 TWO HYMNS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[86]  As we have seen, the Holy Spirit, who is the consummated Triune God, is of two aspects the essential aspect and the economical aspect.
[87]  Matthew 28:19 is another verse on the believer's experience of the Triune God.
[88]  It says, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[89]  From the time that the Nicene Creed was established by the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325 until the present day, Christians have inherited the concept that the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit; the Father is God, the Son is the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God.
[90]  Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
[91]  In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness."
[92]  God is Spirit; therefore, when we worship Him, we must worship in our human spirit.
[93]  God is Spirit, and He created a spirit for man that man may worship Him.
[94]  The fourth passage that speaks of the human spirit with the Spirit is Romans 8:16, which says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God."
[95]  John 1:12 says that as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.
[96]  Ephesians 3:14-16 says, "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man."
[97]  Paul prayed for us, asking the Father to strengthen our being through His Spirit to such an extent that we would be strengthened into the inner man.
[98]  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND US BEING A MATTER OF TWO SPIRITS BECOMING ONE SPIRIT
[99]  When we put together these verses in the six chapters of Ephesians, we can see a clear picture.
[100]  Chapter one speaks of our receiving revelation in spirit; chapter two, of our being God's dwelling place in spirit; chapter three, of our being strengthened into our spirit that Christ may make His home in our hearts; chapter four, of our mind being renewed in spirit that we may be transformed; chapter five, of our being filled with God in spirit; and chapter six, of our praying in spirit.
[101]  CHAPTER EIGHT LIFE Scripture Reading: John 3:14-15; 1 John 5:12; 2 Pet 1:3; Rom 5:10; 8:2, 6, 10-11; John 6:63b; Rev 2:7; 22:14a, 17 THE ESSENCE OF THE BIBLE BEING CHRIST
[102]  The first mysterious matter in the Bible is Christ, who is God and also man.
[103]  Christ's coming among men through incarnation was entirely a story of the Spirit.
[104]  If He had not been conceived and born of the Holy Spirit, and if He had not had the Spirit poured out upon Him, He could never have had those three and a half years of ministering and living.
[105]  Romans 8:2 reveals that the Spirit is the Spirit of life and that this Spirit of life has a law.
[106]  This indicates that the Spirit Himself is life because a life is a law.
[107]  Hymns, #113, stanza 5 says, "Though angels praise the heavenly King,/And worship Him as God alone,/We can with exultation sing,/ He wears our nature on the throne.'"
[108]  Therefore, we have not only Christ and the Spirit within us, but today this life is also in us.
[109]  When we believed in the Lord, we may not have been clear about what we believed, but one thing is clear: When we prayed, Christ, the Spirit, and life all came into us.
[110]  Revelation 2:7 also joins life to the Spirit, saying, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[111]  CHAPTER NINE THE CHURCH 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 84:1-12; Matt 16:16-18; 18:15-17; Acts 8:1; Eph 1:22-23; 2:22; 4:24; 5:25-32; 6:11-13; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 21:10-14; 22:1-2, 16-17 HYMNS BEING EXPRESSIONS OF A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRUTH
[112]  Our hymns were written not according to our own ideas but according to the truths in the Bible.
[113]  THE CHURCH IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The Church in the Gospel of Matthew
[114]  In the Gospels in the New Testament, the church is mentioned only twice, in Matthew 16 and 18.
[115]  In the Epistles, especially in Ephesians, the apostle Paul gives a detailed explanation of the church.
[116]  Before the creation of the heavens and the earth, in eternity past, God had a heart's desire, a good pleasure, to gain a group of people as a corporate Body to be His vessel that He may be its life and may dwell in it so that this corporate Body may become His expression.
[117]  As saved ones and members of the church, we must know the church.
[118]  It is true that the ones who did not return were all Israelites and were descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and that they gathered together in different places.
[119]  However, they stubbornly remained in Assyria, Egypt, and Babylon, in the lands of captivity, and would not obey God's calling to pay the price to return to the holy land for the worship of God.
[120]  At the beginning, when the Lord first brought His recovery to the United States in order that His recovery may spread to the Caucasian Americans, we did not pay much attention to the Chinese-speaking work.
[121]  CHAPTER TEN THE CHURCH 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:16-18; 1 Cor 12:12-13; Eph 1:22-23; 5:25-32; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Rev 1:4, 11-12, 20; 2:7; 22:17
[122]  THE EXTRACTS OF THE BIBLE BEING CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, LIFE, AND THE CHURCH
[123]  Christ is complete and perfect, and He has passed through all His processes to become the life-giving Spirit the Spirit, who is life.
[124]  In Matthew 16:16-18, Peter first had the realization that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[125]  Ephesians 1:22-23 says that not only has Christ been exalted to be Head over all things, He is also Head over all things to the church.
[126]  THE CONCLUSION CONCERNING THE CHURCH The Relationship between Christ and the Church
[127]  The church comes out of Christ, through the Spirit, and by life.
