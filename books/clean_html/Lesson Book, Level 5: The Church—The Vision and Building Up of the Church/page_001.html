<h1 class=msg>INTRODUCTION TO THE LESSON BOOK</h1><h2 class=head2>Concerning the Lesson Books</h2><p>This lesson book is one in a series originally designed to teach the truth to junior high and high school students during their summer school of the truth. Because the lesson books were written over a period of several years, the books may vary in style and format.<h2 class=head2>Concerning This Lesson Book</h2><p>This is the fifth lesson book in this series. This book is based upon and compiled from the writings of Brother Watchman Nee and Brother Witness Lee and these brothers have not reviewed it.<p>This book is divided into two main sections of twelve lessons each. The first section covers the vision of the church. The second section describes the practical way for building up the church.<p>The church is one of the most crucial yet misunderstood matters in the Bible. Many people may see Christ as the Savior. Some may see Christ is for our daily experience. Very few see that the church is the Body, the enlargement, and the extension of Christ. We have been saved for the church. The processed Triune God’s dispensing is to produce the church. Our experiences of life and growth in life are not for our own spirituality, but for the building up of the church. God, man, and the universe are all for the building up of the church.<p>We need to see this vision of the church and the way the church is built up. If we see this vision we will always be in the practical expression of the church to build up the church. Having seen this vision, we will never leave the church due to distractions in the world or “problems in the church. We will continually pray to be in spirit and to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly so that the Lord may use us in the building up of the church. May the Lord grant us this vision.<h2 class=head2>The Structure of the Lessons</h2><p>The title conveys the subject of the lesson. The verses are for reading or pray-reading. The outline gives you an overview of the lesson. It is good to read the outline first to get an overview of the lesson before you proceed to the text of the lesson. The text is organized according to the outline. The writing contained inside the brackets [ ] are quotes from Brother Nee or Brother Lee’s publications. The questions are intended to help you better understand and apprehend the lesson. A list of books with the author, publisher, and page number is included for all quoted materials. Finally, a list of books is included for further reference on the subject of each lesson. Nee represents Brother Watchman Nee. Lee represents Brother Witness Lee. LSM represents Living Stream Ministry. CFP represents Christian Fellowship Publishers.<h2 class=head2>The Versions Used in Quotes</h2><p>When quoting verses, we used the American Standard Version of the Bible for the Old Testament and the Recovery Version of the Bible for the New Testament. We sometimes replaced New Testament quotations found inside the brackets [ ] with the corresponding Recovery Version verse.<h2 class=head2>The Proper Attitude Needed to Study the Word with the Help of the Lesson Book</h2><p>This lesson book is not the Bible. It is a lesson book based on the Bible. It can be used as a study aid for the Bible. Do not quote the lesson book as the authoritative source for biblical truths or teachings. You must learn to reference the appropriate source¾which book, which chapter, and which verse, etc. You must also learn how all the key verses relate to one another in presenting the vision of the church and the way to build up the church. Take the time to know the Word of God with certainty.<h2 class=head2>The Way to Study the Word with This Lesson Book</h2><p>The Word of God embodies the essence of the Spirit. Therefore, when you come to the Word, you must use your spirit. The best way to use your spirit is to pray. You must pray before, during, and after the studying of this lesson book. It is also important that you fellowship as you are studying. It is not adequate to read by yourself without fellowshipping with others. The fellowship of the Body is necessary to help you comprehend the heavenly vision.<h2 class=head2>Suggestions on the Summer School of the Truth</h2><p>It is suggested that the summer school of the truth be six weeks in length. Each week should be divided into four days, each day lasting three hours. Twenty-four days, each with three hours, will provide adequate time to pray, to cover all the lessons, and to fellowship. We recommend that all the students practice to write prophecies for each lesson, and also practice prophesying to speak for Christ and speak forth Christ. Each student should endeavor to experience individually and corporately what he has learned.<p>We have prayed and will continue to pray for you, that you may have an enjoyable time together during your summer school of the truth, that you will progress towards the full knowledge of the truth, and be built up in your locality. Amen!
