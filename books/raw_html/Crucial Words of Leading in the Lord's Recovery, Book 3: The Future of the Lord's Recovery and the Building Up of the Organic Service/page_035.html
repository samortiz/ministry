	 <h2 class="head2">The Example of the Family</h2>
<p>Suppose in a family there is only a sixty-year-old couple and their eighty-year-old parents. These two generations of four elderly people will just sit and look at each other. Without a child, their life has no meaning. Such a home will be very clean and scheduled, but it will have no future when both couples pass away. A normal family has three or four generations; this includes noisy young children. Even though the children might not be well behaved, they are full of vitality. Their home might be somewhat disorderly, which causes the older ones to suffer, but it will be full of youthful spirit, and it will have great hope. There is a saying that our progeny is our blessing. However, along with the blessing there is suffering. If we want to have children, we must accept some suffering. This is true not only in the family but also in the church.</p>
<p>In many families the older generation causes the younger generation to suffer, and the younger generation causes the older generation to suffer as well. For example, my grandchildren are afraid of me, but I am afraid of them even more than they are afraid of me. I like it when they come to my home, but it is a great trouble because afterward I must clean up the mess they leave. Hence, it is a blessing to have a second generation, but it is also a suffering. These examples show that the church life is multifaceted. The younger ones need the older ones, and the older ones need the younger ones.</p>
<p>Men cannot live without women, and women cannot live without men. It is the same in a family and in the church. We need to be multifaceted. However, in the church the sisters are frequently dissatisfied with the brothers and therefore complain. It is impossible for sisters not to complain. This is the nature of women. The brothers are also difficult. This is according to their nature. When a couple is newly married, the husband may often mop the floor, but after a while he gives his wife a difficult time, insisting that she polish his shoes and mop the floor. Brothers and sisters both need to be multifaceted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Example of the Spreading of the Church</h2>
<p>Just as a country needs strong young men when it goes to war, the church also needs strong young ones for it to spread. If the church is to preach the gospel and spread the truth, we must have young people. It is a hardship for an elderly person to preach the gospel to people on a bus. But when a young person speaks, all the people around him can hear because he has a strong voice. The young saints and the older saints should not place requirements on each other; the older saints should not insist that the young ones change, nor should the young saints insist that the older ones change. Even if the older saints are wrong, the young ones should respect them as their older generation. It is often unavoidable for the young saints to make mistakes. As long as we pray more and exercise our spirit more, we will go forward together step by step, and the church will have a bright future.</p>
<p>In the church some saints are shy by nature and other saints are bold by nature. Whether we are shy or bold, we must be multifaceted and avoid conflicts. The bold saints like to go out to preach the gospel; they can preach the gospel boldly every day. The shy saints who think that the bold ones are too crazy are not multifaceted. God did not make us all shy by nature, nor did He make us all bold. He made some of us shy and some of us bold so that we could be multifaceted&mdash;able to take care of every situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO CARE FOR TRUTH, LIFE,<br />
THE GOSPEL, AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>For the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s work, we must gain people. Even though we have thousands of brothers and sisters, we still need to spread. We must first gain people in &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; (cf. Acts 1:8). Taiwan is our Jerusalem. While we spread, we should never forget that the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are His golden lampstands. Hence, they must bear the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. The first item in bearing the Lord&rsquo;s testimony is to preach the truth. We must therefore spend time laboring on the truth. All the brothers and sisters in the churches must be like the children in a scholarly family. Not only should they understand the truth, but they should also be able to use simple words to teach others the truth. It is a tremendous matter for us to be trained and constituted with the truth.</p>
<p>Suppose ten thousand saints in Taiwan know the truth and speak the truth every day. This society and this country would be blessed, because that is what the Lord wants. The Lord requires that we not only shine as lampstands to be the light of the world but that we also be the salt of the earth to kill germs and prevent decay (Matt. 5:13). As the salt of the earth, we kill the germs and deal with the corruption of sinners. This is a great influence. Furthermore, we must live out the truth. To live out the truth is to live out Christ and to live out God&rsquo;s life. Hence, we must pursue the growth in life.</p>
<p>Because the church is multifaceted, the older saints must bear with the younger ones, and even more importantly the younger saints must respect the older ones. Not only so, the brothers must take care of the sisters, and the sisters must accommodate the brothers. Then there will be no problems when we coordinate together. Our testimony will not merely be that we are zealous for the gospel, clear concerning the truth, and rich in life; it will also be that we live a corporate church life. If our testimony includes these four aspects of being rich and clear concerning the truth, matured in life, corporate in our church life, and zealous for the gospel, we will have the true testimony of the Lord in the local churches.</p>
<p>For the past two thousand years of church history, the Lord has not had a rich testimony. Some believers, such as the inner-life believers, have placed much emphasis on the matter of life. In the end, however, they veered far off course and did not have a second generation. Some among these believers emphasized the spirit and the soul at the expense of their physical health. There have also been believers in the evangelical movement who only emphasized preaching the gospel and setting up mission boards; however, they had no foundation in the truth, were inadequate in life, and had no church life. Some even opposed the matter of the church.</p>
<p>We have spoken boldly concerning the ground of the church&mdash;one church in one locality&mdash;for many years. However, if we do not have the truth as our support, the ground of the church becomes an empty slogan. Not only so, without life, everything is empty. If we are not zealous for the gospel and do not bring in new ones, in a very short time the only brothers and sisters on the local ground will be old people, and it will not be long before there is no one left to continue standing on the ground. Therefore, we must gain people and bear children and grandchildren; we must also teach them to stand on the ground. This is why we must be multifaceted and have truth, life, and the church when we go out to gain others. In this way we will spontaneously produce a second generation.</p>
<p>Of these four aspects, the most crucial is the aspect of life. If we do not have life but only have the truth, we merely have empty doctrine. Once we lack life, the truth becomes empty, the church life is poor, and we have no support for the gospel. A church life that is without life is without Christ and is merely religious activities. In the same way, if there is no life, we have no reality when we preach the gospel, and our speaking will merely be doctrine. Even though a person is saved, without life he will have no salvation in his daily life. Paul says, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&rdquo; (Phil. 2:12). This means that in our daily living, we must live out Christ as life.</p>
<p>We have emphasized life for many years, because we felt that life is crucial. Even our study of the Bible is called the Life-study of the Bible. By constantly emphasizing life, we have turned everyone&rsquo;s attention to life, but we have neglected the gospel. However, when we pay attention to life, we should go out to preach the gospel. When we preach the gospel, we are also paying attention to life.</p>
<p>In order to keep our bodies healthy, we must exercise daily. If we eat nutritious food daily without exercising, the food will poison us. Even when we eat nutritious food, we must be active and exercise. Proper exercise and nutritious food are both necessary to make our bodies healthy. Therefore, we should not emphasize life and neglect preaching the gospel, nor should we overemphasize the gospel and neglect life. We must pay attention to both life and the gospel and not neglect either of them. We need to be multifaceted. Life is Christ. If we live Christ, we will be multifaceted. As soon as Christ has the ground within us, we will be multifaceted. When we grow in life, we live Christ.</p>
