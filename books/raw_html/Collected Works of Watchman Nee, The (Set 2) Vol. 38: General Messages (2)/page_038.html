<h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Paul was an apostle of deep spiritual stature. He wrote to the Corinthian saints, saying, "But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you. For we are not extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you...but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance" (2 Cor. 10:13-15). Paul's word was a word of experience. He said he was not willing to extend himself beyond the bounds which God had measured for him. He would not go to the places which God had not measured to him. He felt it was his responsibility to take care of the places God had assigned to him. But he would not extend beyond his measure to try to take responsibility for the places which God had not assigned to him. If every servant of God had done the same thing, there would not have been so many disputes and sects. Every servant of God has a specific work that God has assigned to him. Every believer has a way that God has ordained for him. If everyone would stand in his proper position, do his proper work, and walk his proper course, the result would be a real glory.</p><p>We should not work because we reckon the work to be good or because a work can save men or render help to others. Our only concern should be whether or not our work is within the bounds of God's measurement for us. The main pillars in a house are important, of course, but all the little nails are equally indispensable. If everyone in the church wants to be a great revivalist or evangelist, how can the church be built up? We should choose the course that is according to God's will. We should not aspire to do only great things; we should stand firm in the position that God has measured to us. We should be willing to become calm and do small works. God is not after great gifts; He is after those who can be used by Him. May we be willing to remain in the position that He has measured to us; this is the proper ground. Strictly speaking, all thoughts of change for the better and all kinds of ambitions and aspirations are worldly, soulish, and fleshly, and we should guard ourselves against these thoughts. Once we are clear about this, we will not dare to touch God's work either lightly or rashly.</p><p>Paul said, "I have finished the course" (2 Tim. 4:7). What course was that? Mrs. Penn-Lewis said the following in her autobiography: "There is a `course' prepared for each believer from the moment of his new birth, providing for the fullest maturity of the new life within him and the highest which God can make of his life in the use of every faculty for His service. To discover that `course' and fulfill it is the one duty of every soul. Others cannot judge what that course is. God alone knows it, and He can make it known and guide the believer into it, as certainly today as He did in the day of Jeremiah and other prophets, and of Paul and Philip and other apostles." The most glorious thing for a child of God to do is to fulfill what God wants him to do within the bounds of God's assignment. God has a preassigned course for every believer to take.</p><p>God uses only those He has chosen for His work; He does not want any volunteers. Those whom God has chosen have no liberty of their own. If you want to be free and take your own course, you will end up with nothing but failure and suffering. If God does not use you, nothing more needs to be said. But if God uses you, you cannot escape from His assigned course. Even if you escape to Tarshish, the waves will still bring you to the sea, and the fish will still bring you back. You cannot run away. God's servants can never act according to their own will. The men God is after are those who carry out only God's assigned work, who run only God's assigned course, and who do not walk according to their own will.</p><p>When Moses led the Israelites through the wilderness, God told them not to work on the Sabbath. When someone reported to Moses that someone had picked up sticks on the Sabbath, Moses did not decide on his own to deal with him. God had not told him what to do. Only after God gave him the clear command to stone the Sabbath trespasser did he dare to order him to be stoned (Num. 15:32-36). Moses would only act after he had received God's command; he dared not do anything on his own.</p><p>If we do not wait, God's work will suffer great loss! How impatient is our disposition! We always feel that God is too slow. We cannot follow God's leading patiently, step by step. Anything we think of as good we jump into hastily, and whenever we see a lack we try to fill it up immediately. We think that if we have to wait in everything, our whole life will be wasted in waiting, and we will not be able to accomplish anything. We have forgotten the fact that those who wait before God and who work according to His command are blessed.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>The one great responsibility we have to bear is to be clear of God's command and carry out His work accordingly. Before we have His command, we should never do anything. God's command expresses His heart's desire. If we want to become a useful vessel in God's hand, we must move only after we have His command. We do not please God by doing what He has not told us to do. Whenever a work is placed before us, we must first ask whether or not such a work is according to His heart and whether it will please His heart. May we seek only after God's will. We should not engage ourselves in a spiritual work just because it is a good piece of work or because the circumstances require our help. Our foremost responsibility in our work is to seek after God's will. If we want to be useful in God's hand, we have to walk according to His will.</p><p>Man cannot randomly change God's pattern on the mount; he must work according to the pattern. Will you say that this is your work and that you can accomplish it without God's will? Or will you say that this is God's work, and you will act only according to His will? It is lamentable that many times God's work has been spoiled under man's fleshly hands!</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should remember that unless our wisdom is first judged and our will first put to death, we cannot do God's work. May God guide us to the point where we are free from the self and our own thoughts and where there is only God's will. Before we engage ourselves in a work, we must first find out whether or not this is God's will. Once we know God's will, we should work according to the pattern that He has shown us.</p>
