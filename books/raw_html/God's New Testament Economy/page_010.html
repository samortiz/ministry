 <h2 class="head2">Working with the Father</h2>
<p>Most young boys do not like to work with their father because he may restrict them with rebukings. But Jesus never did any work without the Father. He always worked with the Father (John 14:10b; 5:17, 19). To work with the Father requires an absolute denial of the self. Christ denied Himself to work with the Father. In today&rsquo;s church life we always need to work with the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Working in the Name of the Father</h2>
<p>The Son worked in the name of the Father (John 10:25). To work in the name of the Father means it is not I that work but I work as the Father. When this Man lived on this earth, He was the Son with the Father by the Spirit, living to set up a pattern so that man can live a life mingled with the Triune God. At least one Man among mankind succeeded in living such a life. Thousands of men possessing the divine life should follow this Man to live a life which is the result of the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Doing the Father&rsquo;s Will</h2>
<p>The Son put His will aside and took the Father&rsquo;s will, so He did the Father&rsquo;s will (John 5:30; 6:38). In John 6:38 the Lord says, &ldquo;For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking the Father&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>The Son never spoke His own word. Whatever the Son spoke was the Father&rsquo;s speaking (John 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeking the Father&rsquo;s Glory</h2>
<p>With Christ there was no ground for the self. He did not seek His own glory, but the Father&rsquo;s (John 7:18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Expressing the Father</h2>
<p>Finally, the Son expressed the Father (John 14:7-9). No wonder He said, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (14:9). He was one with the Father. He had no work, no will, no word, no glory, and no ambition for Himself. He only expressed the Father. The Triune God was expressed in this Man. This was the result of the divine dispensing in the first man of the new creation. This was the first man in human history who was the result of the divine dispensing. This result will develop and this dispensing will go on in thousands of God&rsquo;s chosen people. All of them will live a life which is the result of the divine dispensing. This is the Son&rsquo;s living on earth.</p>
