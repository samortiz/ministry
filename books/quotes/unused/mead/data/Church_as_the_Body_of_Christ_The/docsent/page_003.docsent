   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW GOD GAINS A CORPORATE MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How does God gain this corporate man?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis shows that in order to gain a corporate man, the first step in God s work was to create man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we look at God s work in man, we cannot neglect God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, creation was a preparation, not the completion; creation was a preparation for the completion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Creation prepared the material and laid the foundation for the completion of God s work to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible reveals that God created man with three parts spirit, soul, and body; in this way we are different from all other creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Triune God created a tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s purpose is to enter into us so that we may have His image to express Him and His authority to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to accomplish this purpose and carry out this work, God created a tripartite man with a spirit, soul, and body so that He could enter into such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God Creating Man with a Body</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us consider God s creation of man with a body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God created man with a body so that through this body there would be a framework, an appearance, and an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We usually become acquainted with a person through his body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We see the body of a person and become acquainted with him through his build, appearance, demeanor, and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our body is our concrete expression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Concrete means having a shape or form, referring to a practical expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God created us with a body for our practical expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we must keep in mind that this body is to express God, not ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the Bible says that consecration is to present our body Rom 12:1 and that we should glorify and express God in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The body is for expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God Creating Man with a Soul</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God created us also with a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our personality is in our soul; it represents our person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We were not created passive and indifferent beings before God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man is an active creature, with a strong will, mind, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Take a look at all the living creatures on earth; there are millions of creatures, yet man is the most capable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man dominates the earth today because man has a personality, is living, and has a will, ideas, preferences, and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since man has such a personality, he can cooperate with God s need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If God had created a passive and indifferent man, this would indicate that He was not very great or beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, God created man with freedom and personality so that His greatness and beauty would be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God desires a living, capable man to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some say that man cannot know the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, this is true, but on the other hand, it is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, there is not one person who is unable to know the things of God, because God created man so that man could know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 1:19 clearly says, That which is known of God is manifest within them, for God manifested it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Animals, such as cats, dogs, cows, and sheep, cannot know the things of God, but man can know the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although it is difficult to know the things of God from the spiritual side, man nevertheless has the capacity to know the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The reason man thinks of God is that he has God s concepts, thoughts, and preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to remember that God created a soul for man so that man would have a personality to match and complement God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This can be compared to God s creating Eve to match Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God first brought all the animals He had created to Adam, but nothing matched him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then God created Eve to match him Gen 2:18-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all know that this typifies Christ and the church, but it also typifies what man is to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man is God s counterpart in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After creating all things, God felt that it was not good to be alone, yet He could not find a counterpart in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, He created man to be His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course, man must first receive God s life in order to match God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to make this match, God in His creation laid the foundation and prepared the material; He created man with a soul so that man would have a personality and be able to respond to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Regardless of how smart an animal is, it will not respond to the preaching of the gospel, because animals were not created with such an ability.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the most uncivilized, uneducated, and ignorant person, or the most corrupt and extreme atheist, can respond to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God created man with this capacity; this is the preparation God made, the foundation God laid.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regardless of how much we may speak to a table, it will not respond, because our speaking cannot enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, our speaking can enter into a microphone because a microphone is designed with special devices to receive our voice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to thank God that He created us with special devices.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have a personality, a will, thoughts, emotions, and preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These special devices give us the capacity and ability to respond to God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God created all these items for Himself, not for man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this reason the Bible not only requires us to consecrate ourselves but also to obey; consecration is of the body, and obedience is of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our being must be defeated and obedient so that we can match God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our will, our thoughts, and our emotions should all match God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A simple analogy would be marriage; we are marrying God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The best marriage is when a couple matches each other; any unmatched marriage is not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God created us so that we would match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To match God in our soul is a matter of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our taking captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ is a matter of the soul 2 Cor 10:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God Creating Man with a Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God created man not only with a body and a soul, but He created man also with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all know that the spirit is used to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Man s will can choose God, man s emotion can love God, and man s mind can think of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, man still cannot touch God with only these functions of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For example, it may be very pleasing to our eyes to look at a flower, but we cannot touch a flower with our eyes; if we want to touch the flower, we must reach out with our hands and contact it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Another example would be a table of delectable dishes set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although it may appeal to our eyes, we cannot eat unless we open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If God had created us only with a soul, we could choose Him, love Him, and think of Him, but we would be unable to touch Him and receive Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God made us with a stomach to receive food, with ears to receive sound, and with eyes to receive color.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the same way God created us with a spirit to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The spirit is a specific organ, just as man s stomach is a specific organ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our spirit is for receiving God and is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The outermost part of man is a body for expressing God; within man is his personality, his soul, which can cooperate with God; at the center of man is the spirit, which is able to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This can be compared to a light bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The exterior part is a glass bulb, the body through which the lamp is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The innermost part is a filament, which possesses a special property that allows it to receive electricity, absorb electricity, and be compatible with the flow of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When electrical current flows in and through a filament, light is emitted, and through the bulb on the exterior this light is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the same principle, God is Spirit; He as the Spirit is able to enter into us and express Himself through us because we were created with a spirit, with the ability to receive Him as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He created us with a soul so that we may choose Him, desire Him, love Him, meditate on Him, and comprehend Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He also created us with a body so that we may express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is God s creation.</S>
