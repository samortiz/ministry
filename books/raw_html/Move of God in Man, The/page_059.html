<P>The Bible tells us that Christ is not only in ascension but also in us (Col. 1:27). If He were working only in ascension, His work would have nothing to do with us, and His work could never be our story as a part of God's history in us. But today He is working within us. Because His work is within us, this work is related to our history. So this work is God's history in His union with man. He is working in His ascension within us. As the ascended One with many statuses and positions, He is moving within us.</P><P>We need to see this. Merely to learn this is not enough. I have been living in Anaheim for nineteen years, and I see Anaheim every day. If I were asked to tell you about Anaheim without ever having been here, I would have to learn a lot by exercising my mind. But now that I have seen Anaheim so much, I do not need to merely exercise my mind to speak about it. I can simply tell you what I have seen. I hope that we see something as a vision through these messages on the ascension of Christ.</P><P>In the whole universe, there is such a scene into which Christ entered. He came down from the heavens in incarnation, and then He entered into His ascension. His being in ascension, in the heavenlies, is a great part of His dynamic salvation. He passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and then He reached resurrection. As the resurrection, He entered into His ascension. These steps were His move in man to carry out His dynamic salvation. Today God is still moving in His ascension. He is living, dwelling, staying, ministering, serving, working, moving, and acting in His ascension.</P><P>He is in His ascension within us. This is why Paul tells us that we are seated together with Christ in His ascension, which Paul calls "the heavenlies." The very heavenlies referred to by Paul is the ascension. Within our being there is something quite extraordinary. This extraordinary thing is a person, the ascended Christ. He came into us in His ascension. The Lord today is in our spirit in His ascension. In this ascension the Triune God moves in us, and this move becomes His history. It also becomes our history because we and He, He and we, are now mingled as one. We two have the same history.</P><P>Before a man and woman are married they have two histories, but once they are married they become a couple in a marriage life with one history. Today we and our God, the Triune God, are one, so He and we have one history. Otherwise, how could the Bible say that we live Christ (Phil. 1:21a), that we are the fullness of Christ (Eph. 1:23), and that we are the members, parts, of the counterpart of Christ? (Eph. 5:25, 30). Your ears are members of your physical body, but actually your ears are you. In this sense, as the members of Christ's Body, we are Christ, and this Christ is in ascension. Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and we are parts of this embodiment in His ascension. Whenever we are gathered together into His name, Christ is there with all His members in ascension, and this is God's move within man. This is a part of His history. Whether we can present this message to our fellow-believers depends upon whether we have seen something. Our seeing changes us inwardly, and this is transformation.</P>
