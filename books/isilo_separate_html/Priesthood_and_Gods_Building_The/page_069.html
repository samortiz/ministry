<h1 class="title">PRAY-READING THE BIBLE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE BIBLE AND PRAYING<br />
IN ORDER TO GROW IN LIFE</h2>
<p>Every Christian understands that in order to have genuine growth in life, a believer must read the Bible and pray. In recent years many saints among us have been exercised in the matter of reading the Bible and praying. Since 1958, when we began to fellowship concerning how to pray-read the Word, eat and drink the Lord, and enjoy God, many saints, either individually or in small groups, have risen up to pray-read and to enjoy God together. Hence, many saints have substantial experience in pray-reading. We need to pay further attention to the exercise of our spirit to strengthen our spirit so that we can minister in the spirit and serve God as priests, thereby becoming a priesthood to be built up together to be the glorious dwelling place of God. Since this is the Lord&rsquo;s leading, the way to go on has become clearer, and our speaking concerning this has become simpler. The way to go on is by pray-reading the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF LEARNING TO PRAY-READ</h2>
<p>When we reflect on how the Lord led us to practice pray-reading, we must admit that we have encountered many difficulties in learning how to practice pray-reading. Nevertheless, pray-reading is actually very simple. Learning how to pray-read was not easy because it was new and unfamiliar, and even though we saw something, we still felt that the path was rugged and difficult. Whenever a person begins a journey toward a new destination, he turns here and there and looks left and right in order to find the way. When he reaches the destination, however, he often realizes that he could have taken a simpler and more direct way. It is the same with learning to pray-read. Even in 1958, when I released the messages on how to enjoy God by eating and drinking Him, I was not as simple and concise as I could have been in my speaking concerning the way of reading and praying, praying and reading, because our experience was still developing at that time.</p>
<p>The more we touch the matters of exercising the spirit, serving as priests, and ministering in the spirit, the more we have God&rsquo;s leading. Now we are able to speak of a way that is easy, rich, simple, and expedient. We are not overturning our practice from the past; rather, we are providing a better way for the saints. Before we adopt a new practice, we must consider many aspects based on the situation of the saints. For example, if some saints cannot readily accept a new practice, we can begin by making modifications and improvements based on the old practice. We do not have to change everything immediately; we should allow the saints to adjust gradually.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Taiwan, I got lost as I was hurrying home on a bicycle. When I stopped and inquired about directions, I realized that I was headed in the wrong direction. Even though I had lost much time, I dared not to go too fast when I turned around; instead, as I pedaled, I constantly checked to make sure that I was going in the right direction. It is the same with spiritual pursuit. We may feel that we are endeavoring to go forward, but because we are not clear about the way, we may take a meandering way and even temporarily be further from our destination. However, as we become skilled in taking a straight way to reach our destination, we no longer need to look at the road.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLES OF PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>Pray-reading is a simple way. First, it requires the exercise of the spirit. Second, it enables us to receive a supply of God&rsquo;s word without waiting vainly to be inspired and moved by the Spirit. Third, it is easy to practice. Even a new believer can learn how to pray-read as long as he has a desire. Fourth, it enables us to easily receive God&rsquo;s word. Pray-reading can even help those who have difficulty speaking God&rsquo;s word, because it takes away the excuse that they do not have any words or feelings. With pray-reading, it is easy to receive the word and touch the feeling in the word.</p>
<p>It is best to practice pray-reading in small groups of six or seven people. A saint who pray-reads by himself is too isolated, and pray-reading with just two saints can be difficult if only one is exercised. However, ten saints are too many. It is best for six to eight to pray-read together mutually. This can be likened to starting a fire with wood. One piece of wood is not enough, and it is even difficult to start a fire with two pieces of wood. However, it is easy to start a fire with six to eight pieces. When we pray-read with six to eight saints, there is a mutual kindling; the saints kindle one another, and a fire can be quickly ignited.</p>
<p>There is no need to use many verses when we pray-read, but there is no legality either. Recently, some saints were pray-reading the first three verses of Hebrews in a small group. The leading one felt that three verses were not enough, but in fact, these three verses are too much because of their rich content. Hebrews 1:1-3 can be divided into two sections. The first section is on God&rsquo;s speaking of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets and of His speaking to us at the last of these days in the Son. The second section speaks concerning the person and work of the Son. Both sections are rich, and they should be pray-read and digested separately.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
