   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRIUNE GOD DWELLING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit" 1 John 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is Someone dwelling in us besides ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit is the consummate manifestation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hallelujah, the Triune God is in us!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil" 1 John 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Christians have been taught that Christ is seated on the throne at the right hand of God; He does not live in them, but He has sent His Representative to be in them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They do not believe that Christ Himself dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No doubt they also do not believe that Satan is in their nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Notice that this verse calls some the children of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Are they his adopted children?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Did he simply find them on the street, take pity on them, and adopt them for his own?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be called the children of the Devil means that such were born of Satan; his life and nature are in them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 8:44 says, "You are of your father the devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Jews might claim to have Abraham for their father, but their real father was the Devil, the father of liars.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were born of him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 2:2 tells us that the ruler of the authority of the air "now is operating in the sons of disobedience."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where is Satan today?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is not only in the air, but also in fallen man, in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was his counterplot.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matthew 16:22-23 records that one day Peter was being kind and loving toward the Lord Jesus, telling Him, "God be merciful to You, Lord; this shall by no means happen to You!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was unaware that Satan was in him and that he was one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord turned to him, calling him not Peter but Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only was the betraying Judas a devil John 6:70 ; even the loving Peter became Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These verses are enough to impress us that both Satan and God have wrought themselves into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan is in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the next message we shall see that Satan in our flesh is the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This God who has been processed and is now the Spirit dwelling in our spirit is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both Satan and God are now within us as laws.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may find this hard to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It no doubt differs from what you were taught in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I beg you to drop your religious background and consider the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you reject what I have just shared with you, where do you put all these verses?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The ruler of the authority of the air as the evil spirit is now operating in fallen man; before you were saved, Satan was working in this way in you Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even after you are saved, Satan is still present.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is clear from the example of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was saved in Matthew 16:16.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After that he nonetheless became Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord that we have the highest law in our spirit, which has freed us from the evil law!</S>
