   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Body Acting</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The third step in the process of the fall was the action of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the spirit is neglected and the soul is exercised, the body becomes a slave serving our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The eye sees, the hand takes, and the mouth eats.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If in the matter of shopping we forsake our spirit and use our soul, our body will take us to the department store.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Result</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is very important that we understand the result of man's first fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we know the result, we will understand where we are and what we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>a. The Soul Corrupted</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first result of the fall was that the soul of man was corrupted, contaminated, and ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was contaminated because the soul accepted and received the Devil's thought and word v. 7 . Eve should not have spoken to the evil one, for while she was talking with him his wicked thought entered into her mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, even before Eve partook of the tree of knowledge her mind had been polluted by the enemy's concept already.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not think that it was not until Eve ate of the tree of knowledge that she was contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While she was talking to the serpent, the serpent's concept penetrated her mind and defiled it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, her mind was ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, her mind was fully corrupted after she ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Body Changed in Nature</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The body was then changed in nature, having the element of the tree of knowledge, the element of Satan, added to it, making it the flesh v. 7 . As originally created by God, the human body was a pure vessel containing one essence, the element created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result of eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, a foreign element was injected into man's body, transmuting it into the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The body which once was pure and sinless now contains the evil element of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to Romans 7, this element is the indwelling sin which makes its home in man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Romans 7:17 Paul says, "So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This evil substance, the nature of sin that has contaminated our body, still dwells in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we should have no confidence in our flesh because it has been fully occupied and saturated with the sin of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may use a parable as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A little boy has been charged by his mother not to touch a certain bottle because it contains poison.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day, while the mother is away, the child takes the bottle and drinks some of the poisonous liquid.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He transgresses his mother's prohibition, but that is actually a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The truly serious thing which happens is that poison has entered into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Likewise, in the day that man partook of the tree of knowledge an evil substance entered into his body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, it is not merely a matter of transgression, but a matter of a poisonous element, sin, the nature of the evil one, having entered into the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one can deny or argue the fact that, although we might have been saved for years, we still have this evil element in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even as you are reading this message the evil substance of sin dwells in your body.</S>
