<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee from January 28 through February 1, 1985, in the young people&rsquo;s training meetings of the church in Taipei. These training meetings covered two lines with messages related to the fullness of God and messages related to life, truth, the church, and the gospel. Chapters 1, 3, 5, and 7 contain the line related to the fullness of God. Chapters 2, 4, 6, and 8 contain the line related to life, truth, the church, and the gospel. The chapters in this book follow the order in which the messages were given. These messages have been translated from Chinese.</p>
