   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In overseeing a church, the elders must first touch something called authority.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Authority represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the church there is such a thing as God's delegated authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once you try to annul it, there will be no administration of the church, and there will be no reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many denominations today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They all call themselves churches, but can you see the reality of the church there?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rarely do you see it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is because you do not see authority among them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you go to a group of Christians and you do not touch authority there, you have to put a big question mark on that place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wherever a place has authority, you can say that surely the church is there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It may not be the entire church, but at least it is a representation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have absolute boldness to speak what I am speaking of here, because I have found out these things from experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We experienced this matter when we were first raised up to meet in North China.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regardless to which meeting you went, you could sense something that you could not oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once you opposed it, you would have trouble with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once you opposed it, you would not be able to pray any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once you opposed it, you could not go on as a proper Christian any longer, nor could you go on in life, nor could you go on to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There was no other way than for you to submit yourself to this thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I could not tell you what this thing was before, but now I know that it was the representation of God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, it was the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not everything that a delegated authority of God says is right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From my experience I can tell you that there are often many mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But from our side, we can only refuse to obey; we cannot refuse to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we refuse to submit, it is as if we are throwing away our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In some things the delegated authority may not perceive as clearly as you do, and his judgments and decisions may not be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You can only refuse to obey; if you do not obey, it will not cost you your life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I believe you understand what I mean by costing your life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It means that you cannot go on before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the minute you refuse to submit, you know that you have immediately sacrificed your life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You will get into problems with your spiritual life, with your service, and with your fellowship, a fellowship not only with God, but with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An elder must touch authority, and all the brothers must also submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Never presume authority to be a matter of a person, a few persons, or a group of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose here is the chief executive of a government department.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is of course an authority, but if you understand authority to be this person alone, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, the chief executive of a government is an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But on the other hand, when the office of chief executive is changed to another person, the authority still remains there, because what we have is a nation and a government.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same principle, what we have here is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is the place of God's administration on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God commits His presence and establishes His deputy here.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As such, even when the person is changed, God's presence and His deputy authority still remain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Down through the years, the matter of authority has caused me to realize that there is God and there is a sovereign One in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If what we are serving is merely a name or some doctrinal terms, there will not be the reality of authority among us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But because the God whom we serve is real and living, the matter of authority is here among us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Gentiles can advocate democracy or a congressional system, but in the church none of this kind of thing will work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Gentiles are without God, and they are merely a community of people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With the church, however, there is the question of God's presence, God's move, and God's operation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, democracy cannot be applied to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, neither can autocracy be applied, for autocracy centers around a single individual.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With the church, it is not a question of many or one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With the church, it is a question of God's presence and its representation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If this representation is with two or three, then it is a matter of these two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If this representation is with ten persons, then it is a matter of these ten persons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If this representation is with one individual, then it is a matter of this individual.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The representation of God's presence is God's authority in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One cannot oppose this; he has to submit himself to this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason, the elders have to learn to be those who submit to authority.</S>
