The Relationship between the Anointing and the Applying of the Blood</h2><p>A very close relationship also exists between the anointing and applying the blood. The purpose of the anointing is to anoint God into us, that we may have fellowship with God and be mingled and united with God. However, many areas of our being are incompatible with God, and many situations in our lives do not match God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory; these make it impossible for God to mingle or unite with us. Hence, there is the need to first apply the blood. The purpose of the blood is to cleanse all the areas which are incompatible with God, and to remove all the situations which do not match Him. First we have the applying and cleansing of the blood; then God&#8217;s holy ointment anoints us with God Himself. Therefore, to experience the anointing we must first have the blood. The blood is the basis for the anointing.<p>The relationship between the anointing and the applying of the blood is also seen very clearly in the Old Testament. When a priest intends to apply the ointment to a leper at the time of his cleansing, the blood must first be applied. Some of the ointment is placed &#8220;upon the blood,&#8221; or &#8220;upon the place of the blood&#8221; (Lev. 14:14-18, 25-29). It is a great sin against God if we should apply the ointment before the blood. Because the ointment prefigures the Holy Spirit who came to mingle God with man, it must never be applied to one who has never been cleansed by the blood. It was necessary first to apply the blood, which would cleanse away all the filthiness and all the areas which are incompatible with God; then, the ointment, signifying God mingled with man, could be applied.<p>This principle remains unchanged in the New Testament. We have said that because 1 John speaks of the fellowship of life, it mentions the anointing. But not only so, it also mentions the blood. Furthermore, it mentions first the blood in chapter one, then the anointing in chapter two. This also indicates that in order to have the fellowship of life, we need not only the anointing of the ointment, but also the cleansing of the blood. Furthermore, the blood comes before the anointing. The blood is required to wash away all iniquity in order that the anointing may subsequently bring in the fellowship with God in life. Therefore, if we wish to experience the anointing, we must first experience the blood. The more we apply the blood and allow it to wash us continually, the more we will experience the anointing and feel the living presence and moving of God; thus, we will have fellowship with God. Therefore, the anointing and the applying of the blood are also inseparable.<h2 class=head1>III. KNOWING THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</h2><p>First John 2:27 says, &#8220;His anointing teacheth you concerning all things.&#8221; In the teaching of the anointing, there is not only the teaching aspect, but also the anointing aspect; there is not only the teaching of the Holy Spirit, but also the moving of the Holy Spirit. The teaching does not come from the ointment or the Holy Spirit, but from the anointing of the ointment, or the moving of the Holy Spirit.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
