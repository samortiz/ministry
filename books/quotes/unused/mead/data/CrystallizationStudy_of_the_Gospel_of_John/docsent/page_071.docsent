   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. God Entering into the Human Species</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Man Entering into the Divine Species</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God became flesh to enter into the human species, and man becomes God in His life and nature, but not in His divine Godhead, to enter into His divine species.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 3 the kingdom of God refers more to the species of God than to the reign of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>D. Entering into the Divine Realm</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>by Being Born of God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For something to be in the animal species, it must be born of an animal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Also, to enter into the divine realm, the realm of the divine species, we need to be born of God to have the divine nature and life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>E. Man Being Created in God's Kind</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That man was created in the image of God and after His likeness indicates that man was created in God's kind, in God's species.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis 1 says that each of the living things was created after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But God created man, not after man's kind, but in God's image and after God's likeness to be God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>F. The Believers Born of God</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Being More in God's Kind Than Adam Was</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The believers, who are born of God by regeneration to be His children in His life and nature but not in His Godhead John 1:12-13 , are more in God's kind than Adam was.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Adam had only the outward appearance of God without the inward reality, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have the reality of the divine life within us and we are being transformed and conformed to the Lord's image in our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is logical to say that all the children of God are in the divine realm of the divine species.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>G. God-men in the Divine Species</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, in regeneration God begets gods.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man begets man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Goats beget goats.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If goats do not beget goats, what do they beget?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If God does not beget gods, what does He beget?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the children of God are not in God's kind, in God's species, in what kind are they?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they are not gods, what are they?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all who are born of God are gods.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But for utterance, due to the theological misunderstanding, it is better to say that we are God-men in the divine species, that is, in the kingdom of God.</S>
