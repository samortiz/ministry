<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO LISTEN TO OTHERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Listening to Others Being a Basic<br />Qualification of the Workers</h2><p>The third matter is a serious demand on the workers today. It is to learn to listen to others when they speak. The basic requirement, technique, or qualification of a worker is that he can listen to others. We have to be able to sit down for an hour and listen to the brothers and sisters. As the brothers speak, we have to be able to understand what they are saying sentence by sentence. Not only do we have to hear what they are saying; we have to be able to understand what they are saying.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Quiet Within<br />and Not Having One's Own Words</h2><p>We have to remain quiet while the brothers and sisters are speaking. We cannot be saying something else within us at the same time. Many people hear the wrong things because they are speaking within at the same time that they are listening. This is like having two radios turned on at the same time. When two different stations are speaking at the same time, one cannot hear clearly what either one is saying. In the same way, if a man cannot listen to others, it is because he is speaking when they are speaking.</p><h2 class="head2">Touching Others' Spirit with the Spirit</h2><p>There is another point concerning listening. Man's spirit is revealed through his mouth. When a man speaks, his spirit is released, and it touches the spirit of others. A man's spirit is released through his speaking. If you cannot listen to others, you will not be able to touch their spirit. Whether or not a worker is strong in his work depends on whether he is able to touch others' spirit with his spirit. It is difficult to find one in a thousand who can detect others' spirit without listening to their words. Whether a man's spirit is rebellious, defiled, strong, weak, or in any other condition, it is expressed through his words. We have to be an objective person. Only an objective person can listen to others speak. This is the greatest need in our work.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SPEAK ACCURATELY</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Speaking Carelessly or Loosely<br />and Not Being Double-tongued</h2><p>The fourth thing that a worker has to learn is to speak accurately in his daily life. A careless person has no hope as far as participation in God's work is concerned. A double-tongued person cannot help anyone in any church; he can only cause trouble. Some brothers have asked me how they should study the Bible. I can tell you that only an accurate man can study the Bible. Some people cannot study the Bible by nature. Even if you were to send such a one to seminary, it would still be useless. He may be able to study philosophy, but he can never study science. Science is accurate, and knowledge in science is acquired through numerous experiments and verifications. In the Lord's work there is no such thing as "more or less the same.'' Either things are the same or they are not the same. For example, the whiteness of snow is different from the whiteness of a white horse. But the careless ones will say that they are the same.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Speaking from Feelings</h2><p>The sisters should pay particular attention to this matter. In their daily life they should be careful; they should speak properly, sentence by sentence. The careless ones, those who are active in their mind and who have a hard time differentiating between real and false things, are of little use in God's hand. The more we want to be accurate in our speaking, the more troublesome it is. It is easy to be careless. But a careless person can only speak from his feeling; he cannot speak accurate words. However, truth is absolute. It cannot change according to your feeling. Truth is not affected by anything.</p><h2 class="head2">Only an Accurate Person<br />Being Able to Receive Light from the Bible</h2><p>Who can study the Bible? The Bible is not understood through methods, but through proper persons. A person can listen to, study, and read the Bible. But if he wants to get some light, he has to be an accurate person.</p>
