<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG GIFTS, OFFICES,<br />
AND CHURCH MEETINGS</h1>
<p>Prayer: O Lord, we come before You and also come to Your Word by Your precious blood. Lord, we are truly for You, and we gather around Your Word, looking to You that You may give us light. Open up Your Word to us, and may light from Your Word illuminate our whole being. We do not want to remain in darkness, the natural realm, or religion. We truly desire to enter into Your revelation. May each one of us see the light. Your word is a light to our path and a lamp to our feet. Lord, thank You for leading us on the way of the recovery. Step by step and year after year, You have been leading us. You have not left us in darkness or let us go astray.</p>
<p>Lead us so that we can follow and have the assurance in our spirit that we are walking in the light. Lord, speak to us again. Give us a sober mind and grant us an open spirit. Cause us to be poor in spirit so that we would not be content or think that we have sufficient knowledge. Lord, we are still very poor in our knowledge of You, in our knowing of Your Word, and in our entering into the light in Your word. Visit us so that the hungry will be satisfied and the poor will be supplied with riches. Lord, thank You for Your precious blood that always cleanses us and covers us. Be with us. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BASIC TRUTHS CONCERNING<br />
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship some basic truths concerning the administration of the church in the New Testament. We need to have a new understanding of the administration of the church, because it concerns our household administration. Since the church is our home, there should be a household administration. These truths relate to the economy of God, and this new understanding of the administration of the church is based on God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Economy of God Having Two Aspects&mdash;<br />
Life and Administration</h2>
<p>The economy of God has two aspects: an inward aspect as it relates to life and an outward aspect as it relates to administration. The church also reflects the inward aspect of life and the outward aspect of administration. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy comprises both life and administration. Every man has a body for outward activities, but he also has an inward constitution related to his spirit and soul. Our body is for outward activities, but our spirit and soul constitute our real inner man. Although the genuineness of the church rests on the inward aspect of life, there is a need for the aspect of outward administration. Without this aspect the church would be like a person who has a spirit and soul but no body. Hence, it is easy to deviate from the economy of God if we speak of the church only in purely spiritual terms while neglecting its administration. Consequently, the economy of God includes both the outward aspect of administration as well as the inward aspect of life.</p>
<p>According to statistics published by some Christian denominations in the Far East, the Presbyterian Church has the largest number of members on the island of Taiwan with over eighty thousand. The local churches rank second with about forty-five thousand, and the True Jesus Church ranks third with about twenty thousand. Over the past twenty-eight years we have focused primarily on spirituality. We became so spiritual that we did not pay any attention to how many were born into our family. According to statistics provided by the brothers, we baptized fifty-eight thousand people in Taipei alone; this figure does not include other cities. Since the number of people saved in the church in Taipei typically comprises half of the people saved on the island, there could be as many as one hundred ten thousand believers among us on the island of Taiwan. According to this figure, we far outnumber the Presbyterian Church; this is a very precious fact to me. Regrettably, this information also shows that we have gained spirits and souls but not many bodies over the past twenty-eight years. We have been so spiritual that we do not even know the exact number of people born into our family.</p>
<p>In our effort to be spiritual, we have nurtured our spirit so that it could be strong, but our body is very weak. If we had paid more attention to this matter in just the last fifteen years, our situation would be vastly different. However, we failed to notice that something was lacking in our work. We were constantly preaching the gospel, saving and baptizing many, but our way of bringing them into the church was like pouring water into a bucket with many holes. As a result, close to one hundred thousand &ldquo;drops of water&rdquo; are no longer in our bucket; that is, they no longer meet with us.</p>
<p>Currently, brothers and sisters who meet with us are working in every level of society and in every Taiwanese institution; this is good. Nevertheless, we know little concerning the situation of the believers who are not currently meeting with us. This shows that we have been irresponsible in our care. We are like parents who have abandoned their children. We do not know where our children are living or even if they are still alive.</p>
<p>In order to have an accurate knowledge of the number and the condition of our brothers and sisters, we should use the information cards and establish the small groups. Many have testified that they have discovered a brother here and another brother there. One brother even testified that when he visited others, he would ask them if they used to meet in a district. If they responded by naming a certain district, he knew that they were our brothers and sisters, our family members.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who have been baptized by us are scattered throughout Taiwan and even overseas. There are Chinese students in all the major universities in the United States. Many of these Chinese students are involved in Chinese-speaking Christian groups, and many of the leading ones in these groups are brothers who met with us at one time. Our water has leaked out to many places. So many of these brothers were nurtured by us in Taiwan. It is a pity that they are completely dispersed.</p>
