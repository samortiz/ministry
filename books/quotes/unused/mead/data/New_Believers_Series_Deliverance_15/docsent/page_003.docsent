   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FREEING US FROM THE LAW OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 8:1-2 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The way to victory is to be freed from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse does not say, "The Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from sin and death."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am afraid that many Christians think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, it says, "The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Christians see the Spirit of life setting them free from only sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They do not see the law of the Spirit of life freeing them from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It takes many years for some Christians to realize that sin and death are a law in them and that the Holy Spirit is another law in them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord opens their eyes, they will see that sin and death are a law and that the Holy Spirit is a law as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The realization of the Holy Spirit as a law is a great discovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we realize that the life-giving Spirit is a law, we will jump up and exclaim, "Thank God, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man's will cannot overcome the law of sin, but the law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only the law of the Spirit of life can free man from the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once we realize that sin is a law, we will no longer try to do anything by our will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When God grants us mercy to see that the Holy Spirit is a law, we will experience a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many people only see the Spirit of life giving us life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not see that the Holy Spirit is another law in us, and that we can be freed spontaneously from the law of sin and of death when we trust in this law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no effort involved for this law to deliver us from the other law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not need to will, to do anything, or to hold on to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not need to be that busy when the Lord's Spirit is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we fear that the Lord's Spirit will not work in us unless we rush in to help Him in times of temptation, we have not seen the Spirit as a law within us yet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May we see that the Holy Spirit is a spontaneous law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way of deliverance from sin is not through the exercise of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we exercise our will, we will end up in failure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has given us another law which spontaneously frees us from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The problem of one law can only be resolved by another law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no effort involved when we try to overcome one law with another law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have mentioned before that gravity is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It pulls every object down to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But helium is a gas which is lighter than air.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we seal it in a tight balloon, the balloon will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It will rise spontaneously; there is no need to fan it or support it by any force.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As soon as we let go, the balloon will rise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The rising is a law, and we do not need to do anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, no effort is involved when we deal with the law of sin and of death by the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose someone scolds you or strikes you without cause.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is possible for you to overcome the situation even without realizing what has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the whole thing is over, you may wonder how you did not get angry when you were scolded.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You should have been very angry at the other person's word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But surprisingly you overcame the situation without even realizing it!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Indeed, all victories are unconscious victories because the law of the Holy Spirit is operating and upholding us, not our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This kind of spontaneous victory is genuine victory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once you experience this, you will realize that only the indwelling Spirit can keep you from sin; you do not have to will not to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is also the indwelling Holy Spirit who is enabling you to overcome; you do not have to will to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since this law dwells in you, you are delivered from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You are in Christ Jesus, and the law of the Spirit of life is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Spontaneously, you are free.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as you do not rely on your own will and effort, the Holy Spirit will bring you into victory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, victory over sin has nothing to do with our effort.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We did not exert any effort when the law of sin directed us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Similarly, we do not need to exert any effort in order for the law of the Holy Spirit to free us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Genuine victory is one that requires no effort on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is nothing for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can lift up our eyes and say to the Lord, "All is well."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our past failures were the result of a law and today's victories are also a result of a law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The former law is powerful, but the present law is more powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The former law is indeed potent in bringing us to sin, but the present law is more absolute in saving us from condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the law of the Spirit of life is expressed through us, its power is far greater than that of the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we see this, we will truly be freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Bible does not say that we can overcome sin with our will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It speaks only of freedom from sin: "The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The law of the life-giving Spirit has pulled us out of the realm of the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The law of sin and of death is still present, but the one on whom it worked is no longer there.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every saved person should be clear about the way to deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First, we must see that sin is a law in us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we do not see this, we cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Second, we need to see that the will cannot overcome the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Third, we need to see that the Holy Spirit is a law, and this law frees us from the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The sooner a new believer realizes this way of deliverance, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In fact, no one needs to wait for many years before seeing the way of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You do not need to suffer many hardships before experiencing freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many brothers and sisters have wasted their time unnecessarily; they have shed many tears of defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you want to experience less pain and tears, you should realize from the start that the way to deliverance lies in these words: "The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This law is so perfect and powerful that it will save you to the uttermost; there is no need to do anything to help it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This law frees you from sin completely, sanctifies you wholly, and fills you with life spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brothers and sisters, do not think that the Holy Spirit within us only expresses His life through us occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we think this way, it proves that we only know the Spirit; we do not know the law of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The law of the Spirit expresses His life continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It remains the same at all times and in all places.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We do not have to tell this law to behave in a certain way; it behaves the way it does without our guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Once the Lord opens our eyes, we will see that the treasure within is not just the Holy Spirit or a life, but a law as well.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then we will be released, and the problem of sin will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May God open our eyes to see this way of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May He open our eyes to see this secret to victory, and may we have a good start on this straight path.</S>
