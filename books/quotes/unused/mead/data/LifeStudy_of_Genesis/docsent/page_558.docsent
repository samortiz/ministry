   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7 Concerning Judah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we consider these verses, we need to be impressed with the fact that in the first group, composed of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, Christ has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not see Christ in Reuben, in Simeon, or in Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What we see in Levi is his absoluteness, his desperation, and his faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was due to these characteristics that the Lord gave him the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although Levi had the priesthood with the Urim and Thummim, we do not see Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only when Judah comes does Christ appear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Judah typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In fact, we may even substitute the name of Christ for Judah in this prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Jacob had twelve sons, Christ came only out of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Revelation 5:5 He is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, because Christ came out of Judah, He belongs to Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to understand verses 8 through 12, we must apply these verses to Christ and substitute the name of Christ for Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can all testify from our experience that once we were Reubens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Were you not a sinful Reuben before you were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Were you not, like Reuben, one boiling over with lust?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also were Simeons, those who were natural and filled with the natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything we did was according to our lusts and our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But praise the Lord that we were saved and became a Levi!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we are qualified to come into the presence of God and, with the Urim and Thummim, to receive God's vision and God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, as priests, we can bring others into God's presence and learn the Lord's mind regarding them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is not your experience somewhat like this?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although you may be the least among the saints, day by day you come into the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As you stand in His presence, you sense that there is something shining and enlightening within you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At times you bring others to the Lord and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps you say, "O Lord, remember my father, my brother-in-law, and my sister-in-law."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Neither Reuben nor Simeon had a function like this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only Levi did.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And we also have it today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are no longer Reuben and Simeon; rather, we are today's Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, although I had been a Levi for years, I can testify that I had little experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, in addition to the experience of Levi, we need the experience of Judah, that is, the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is good to come into the presence of the Lord to receive enlightenment, revelation, and vision, and it is good to bring others into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, we still need Christ as a young lion, the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Have you ever experienced Him as a strong lion?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the young lion, Christ is for fighting, for putting His hand on the neck of His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To place the hand on the neck of our enemies means to defeat them, to subdue them, and to gain the victory over them.</S>
