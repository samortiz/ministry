The Followers of Christ Discovering His Resurrection<br>and Receiving the Revelation That Christ<br>in His Humanity Was Born in His Resurrection<br>to Be the Firstborn Son of God<br>with His Many Brothers Constituting the Body</H2><P>The followers of Christ discovered His resurrection and received the revelation that Christ in His humanity was born in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God with His many brothers constituting the Body (Matt. 28:1-10; John 20:1-18; Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:11-12). This discovery was made not by the brothers but by the sisters, and the revelation was given to them. Then the sisters brought the news to the brothers. The revelation was that the very Christ who was in the flesh was born in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God and that all His believers were born at that same time to be the many sons of God and the many brothers of Christ who constitute His Body, the church.</P><P>The resurrected Christ said to Mary, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (John 20:17). Concerning the believers being Christ's brothers, Hebrews 2:11 says, "Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers." The next verse, a quotation of Psalm 22:22, goes on to say, "I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You." By declaring the Father's name to His brothers, the Lord Jesus made them the church. This is a great matter in the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e.

The Satanic Chaos with the Chief Priests,<br>the Pharisees, and the Elders</H2><P>The resurrection of Christ was accompanied by the chaos with the chief priests, the Pharisees, and the elders. In this situation also, God did not remove the chaos but allowed it to remain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Chief Priests and Pharisees<br>Sending Soldiers to Guard<br>the Grave of Christ</H2><P>On the day after Christ's crucifixion, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate and asked him to give orders for the grave to be secured until the third day (Matt. 27:62-64). Pilate told them to take a guard and to make the tomb secure. Then they went and secured the grave, sealing the stone (vv. 65-66). Nevertheless, on the third day Christ came forth from the grave in resurrection.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
