</ol><h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW TESTAMENT AND GOD&#8217;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:7b; Matt. 1:22; Luke 24:25-27, 44-46; Rom. 1:2; 1 Cor. 15:3-4; Col. 1:25-27; Eph. 1:9-10; 3:9-11; Rom. 14:17; Rev. 21:2, 10-11</h1><p>In this series of messages we shall cover the conclusion of the New Testament. Because the New Testament contains twenty-seven books, it is difficult to speak on the conclusion of the New Testament. In this message we shall consider the New Testament and God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class=head2>Related to the Old Testament</h2><p>The New Testament is related to the Old Testament. This relationship is indicated by a portion of Hebrews 10:7: &#8220;In the roll of the book it is written concerning Me.&#8221; This refers to the Old Testament, which gives us a full record of Christ, either by plain words or by types (Luke 24:27, 44, 46; John 5:39, 46).<p>Augustine once said that the New Testament is contained in the Old and that the Old Testament is explained in the New. We may put the matter this way: The New Testament is in the Old contained, and the Old Testament is in the New explained. This means that the New Testament is in the Old Testament and that the Old Testament is explained by the New Testament.<h2 class=head3>The Central Line concerning Christ</h2><p>What does it mean to say that the New Testament is contained in the Old Testament? What are the contents of the New Testament that are contained in the Old Testament? Some might say that in the Old Testament we have many promises, prophecies, types, and shadows concerning Christ. This, of course, is correct. The focal point of all the promises, prophecies, types, and shadows in the Old Testament is Christ. However, we must go further to ask this question: What kind of Christ has been promised, prophesied, typified, and shadowed in the Old Testament? Are you able to give a brief description of such a Christ?<p>It is easy to see, even without revelation, that the Old Testament presents Christ as the King. According to Genesis 3:15, Christ is the One who crushes the head of the serpent. This verse, however, does not speak of the central matters concerning what Christ is. The central line concerning Christ in the Old Testament is that Christ is the eternal God incarnated to be a man who lived on earth, died on the cross, resurrected, ascended, and descended. These seven major points are the central line regarding Christ as promised, prophesied, typified, and shadowed in the Old Testament. Concerning Christ&#8217;s being the eternal God, Micah 5:2 says that His origin is from eternity. Furthermore, Isaiah 9:6 speaks of Him as the mighty God.<p>For what purpose did Christ, the eternal God, become incarnate, live on earth, die on the cross, resurrect from among the dead, ascend to the heavens, and descend? Those with a superficial knowledge of the Scriptures might say, &#8220;Christ became a man, lived on earth, was crucified, resurrected, ascended, and descended in order to rescue me from hell and bring me to heaven.&#8221; In the light of the New Testament, we can strongly say that Christ, the eternal God, was incarnated, lived on earth, died on the cross, resurrected from among the dead, ascended to the heavens, and descended for the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people for the producing of the church. Although the word &#8220;church&#8221; cannot be found in the Old Testament, certain persons typify the church. For example, both Eve and Rebekah typify the church. Hence, both Christ and the church are contained in the Old Testament.<h2 class=head3>God&#8217;s Dispensing</h2><p>In the Old Testament we can also see the matter of God&#8217;s dispensing. Genesis 1:27 says, &#8220;God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him.&#8221; Why did God create man in His own image? In answering this question we may use the illustration of a hand and a glove. A glove is made in the image of a hand for the purpose of containing the hand. Likewise, God created man in His own image so that man might contain God. If we receive even a little wisdom from God, we shall realize that He created man in His own image with the intention of coming into man and dwelling in him.<p>This understanding is confirmed by Romans 9:23, which speaks of God making &#8220;known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory.&#8221; Here we see that man was made a vessel to contain the glory of God. Since man was created to contain the glory of God and since the glory of God is actually God Himself expressed, man was created in God&#8217;s image for the purpose of containing God. God&#8217;s intention in creating man in this way was to enter into man. The word &#8220;image&#8221; in Genesis 1:27 indicates that God&#8217;s intention is to come into the man created by Him.<p>In what way does God come into man? It is not in a way that can be compared to putting apples into a box. In order to answer the question concerning how God comes into man, we need to consider chapter two of Genesis. According to this chapter, after creating man God placed him in front of the tree of life with the intention that man would eat of the fruit of this tree and thereby take God into him. As we shall see, this involves the mingling of God with man.<p>Some oppose the biblical truth of the mingling of God and man. To oppose this truth is to be in darkness.<p>In John 6 the Lord Jesus says that He is the heavenly bread for us to eat (vv. 32, 53-54, 56-58). In the same chapter the Lord twice says, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (vv. 35, 48). The bread of life is the life supply in the form of food, like the tree of life (Gen. 2:9), which is also the life supply &#8220;good for food.&#8221; The food we eat eventually is mingled with our being. If the food taken in by us does not mingle with us, we must have poor digestion. The food that we eat and digest is assimilated into our being. The food becomes our tissue, bone, flesh, and skin. This means that the food eaten, digested, and assimilated by us actually becomes us. This surely is a matter of mingling. Therefore, it would certainly be incorrect to say that the food we eat is not mingled with us.<p>The thought of mingling is implied in Genesis 2. God does not enter into a man in a way that is like putting apples into a box. On the contrary, God comes into us in a way that is like food entering into our being to become one with us. In Genesis 1 we see that man was created by God in His image. Then in Genesis 2 the man created by God is placed in front of the tree of life. This indicates that God wants man to receive Him as food. Here we have the dispensing of God into man.<p>Eating implies both dispensing and mingling. When a mother serves food to her family, she dispenses the food to them. As the members of her family eat the food, it is dispensed into them. After the food is dispensed, it is mingled with those who eat it. Likewise, in Genesis 1 and 2 we have God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into man and His mingling of Himself with man.<p>How can God be dispensed into man and mingled with man? This can be accomplished only by the Triune God being incarnated, living on earth, dying on the cross, resurrecting, ascending, and descending. In this way God dispenses Himself into us and mingles Himself with us.<p>The Bible is profound. Because the Bible is a profound book, we should not stay on the surface of the Word. Instead, we need to see what is revealed in the depths of the Scriptures. We need to see not only that in the Old Testament Christ is promised, prophesied, typified, and shadowed; we need to see what kind of Christ is promised, prophesied, typified, and shadowed in the Old Testament. As we have pointed out, this Christ is the eternal God who was incarnated, lived on earth, died, resurrected, ascended, and descended. We also need to see God&#8217;s purpose for Christ to be such a One.<p>The content of the New Testament is God&#8217;s New Testament economy. As we shall see, God&#8217;s New Testament economy is the dispensing of God into His chosen people for the producing of the church. This eternal economy of God, the content of the New Testament, is contained in the Old Testament.<h2 class=head2>The Fulfillment of the Old Testament</h2><p>The New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament. Matthew 1:22 and 23 indicate this: &#8220;Now all this took place that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.&#8221; This Son brought forth of a virgin is the seed of the woman prophesied in Genesis 3:15. Therefore, the birth of Christ was a great fulfillment of prophecies in the Old Testament.<p>The first prophecy in the Old Testament is Genesis 3:15. After the fall of man, after the serpent had worked himself into man, God promised that the seed of the woman would crush the serpent. This promise concerning the seed of the woman was the first prophecy in the Bible. This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 1:22 and 23. In Galatians 4:4 Paul says that Christ was born under the law and was also born of a woman. Therefore, Christ came not only to fulfill the law, but also to fulfill the promise that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent.<p>In Isaiah 7:14 there is another prophecy concerning Christ: &#8220;Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son.&#8221; According to Matthew 1:23, the name of this Son was called Emmanuel, which means &#8220;God with us.&#8221; Therefore, the fulfillment of this promise brought God into man.<p>Luke 24:25-27 and 44-46 also indicate that the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament. Verses 25 through 27 say, &#8220;He said to them, O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory? And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.&#8221; As verse 44 indicates, the Scriptures included the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.<p>Luke 24:44-46 go on to say, &#8220;He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all the things must be fulfilled which have been written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me. Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures; and He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day.&#8221; The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms are the three sections of the entire Old Testament, that is, &#8220;all the Scriptures&#8221; (v. 27). The Savior&#8217;s word here unveils that the entire Old Testament is a revelation of Him and that He is its center and content. The fact that the Lord opened the mind of His disciples to understand the Scriptures indicates that to understand the Scriptures requires our mind to be opened by the Lord Spirit through His enlightening (Eph. 1:18).<p>Romans 1:2 speaks of the gospel of God which &#8220;He promised before through His prophets in the holy Scriptures.&#8221; This gospel, which concerns His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord (Rom. 1:3), was promised by God through the prophets in the Scriptures. This indicates that the gospel of God was not an accident but was planned and prepared by God. Before the foundation of the world, God planned to have this gospel. Therefore, numerous times in the holy Scriptures, from Genesis through Malachi, God spoke in promise through the prophets regarding the gospel of God. Hence, Romans 1:2 is a further demonstration of the fact that the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament.<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:3 and 4 Paul says, &#8220;For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&#8221; Again, the Scriptures refer to the Old Testament. Christ&#8217;s death for our sins, His burial for our termination, and His resurrection for our germination with life took place according to the prophecies of the Old Testament (Isa. 53:5-8, 10-12; Psa. 22:14-18; Dan. 9:26; Isa. 53:9; Psa. 16:9-10; Hosea 6:2). These three matters are the basic matters among the first things of the gospel. The fact that Paul says that Christ&#8217;s death, burial, and resurrection were according to the Scriptures is a further proof that the Old Testament is fulfilled in the New Testament.<p>Bible students often say that the prophecies concerning Christ in the Old Testament are fulfilled in the New Testament. For example, Micah 5:2 says, &#8220;But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.&#8221; This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 2:4-6 and Luke 2:4-7. Yes, here we have an instance of the fulfillment of the Old Testament in the New Testament. However, we need to go on to see something deeper concerning the New Testament as the fulfillment of the Old Testament.<p>If we have a deeper understanding of the fulfillment of the Old Testament in the New Testament, we shall see that Christ came not only to fulfill the prophecies but also to fulfill God&#8217;s eternal dispensation, which is God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people for the producing of the church. God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people was promised, prophesied, typified, and shadowed in the Old Testament, and it was fulfilled by Christ&#8217;s coming in the New Testament. Therefore, Christ came not merely to fulfill the prophecies concerning His birth, death, and resurrection; He came, in particular, to fulfill the promises, prophecies, types, and shadows concerning God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people for the producing of the church.<h2 class=head2>The Development and the Reaping of the Seed Sown in the Old Testament</h2><p>The New Testament is the development and reaping of the seed sown in the Old Testament. Bible teachers are accustomed to saying that the divine revelation in the Bible is progressive. I also have spoken about the divine revelation in this way. However, this way of considering the divine revelation in the Scriptures is rather shallow. Actually, instead of merely progressing, the divine revelation in the Bible is developing.<p>Certain Bible teachers have said that nearly all the seeds of the truths are sown in the book of Genesis. After years of studying the Bible, I have come to agree with this saying. The seeds of nearly all the truths have been sown in Genesis and then grow throughout the Scriptures.<p>Growth is a matter of development. First, a seed is sown into the soil, and then the seed grows. While it grows, it develops. After a grain of wheat is sown into the ground, it grows and develops until it eventually brings forth many grains. When the wheat is ripe, that is the time for the reaping of the harvest. In like manner, the divine truths in the Bible are sown as seeds, mainly in the book of Genesis. These seeds develop through the Old Testament and especially in the New Testament, until reaching the time of &#8220;harvest&#8221; in the book of Revelation. In Revelation 14 we have a vision concerning the reaping of the ripened harvest. It is important for us to see that whatever is sown as a seed in the Old Testament is developed in the New Testament and is eventually reaped as a harvest in Revelation.<p>Now we need to ask a crucial question: What was sown as a seed in the Old Testament? Christ is the seed that is sown in the Old Testament and that develops throughout the Scriptures. In Genesis 3:15 God promised fallen mankind that as the seed of woman Christ would come to crush the head of the serpent. The Bible goes on to reveal that this seed is developed into the seed of Abraham, the seed of Isaac, and the seed of Jacob. In the book of Isaiah we see the further development of this seed into the One born of a virgin and called Emmanuel, the mighty God, and even the everlasting Father (Isa. 7:14; 9:6). Eventually, in the New Testament, the seed sown in the Old Testament will produce many grains, and these grains will become a harvest reaped in the book of Revelation. From this we see that the New Testament is the development and reaping of the very Christ sown in the Old Testament, developed throughout the books of the Bible, and reaped as a harvest in the last book of the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>The Completion of the Divine Revelation</h2><p>The New Testament is the completion of the divine revelation. In Colossians 1:25 Paul says, &#8220;I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.&#8221; The word of God is the divine revelation. This was not completed before the New Testament. In the New Testament the apostles, especially Paul, completed the word of God in the mystery of God, which is Christ, and in the mystery of Christ, which is the church, to give us a full revelation of God&#8217;s economy. At the time of Paul the word of God included the Old Testament and the word preached by the early apostles. Although the word of God preached by the early disciples grew and multiplied (Acts 12:24), it was not yet completed according to God&#8217;s economy. For this completion, God&#8217;s revelation to Paul was needed. According to the stewardship of God, Paul became a minister of the church to complete the word of God. Consider what a lack there would be if we did not have the Epistles of Paul. Without them, there would be no completion of the word of God.<p>Paul received the revelation of Christ as the mystery of God. In Colossians 2:2 he speaks of the &#8220;full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.&#8221; In Ephesians 3:4 Paul speaks of the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God in Colossians 2:2 is Christ, whereas the mystery of Christ in Ephesians 3:4 is the church. Paul was also given the revelation concerning the dispensation of God (2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 3:14-19). Therefore, the completion of the word of God includes the great mystery of Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32), the full revelation concerning Christ, the Head (Col. 1:26-27; 2:19; 3:11), and the full revelation concerning the church, the Body (Eph. 3:3-6).<p>In Colossians 1:26 and 27 Paul speaks of &#8220;the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&#8221; This mystery is Christ Himself within us as our life today and our glory in the future. At present, this glory is our hope. From these verses we see that the completion of the divine revelation concerns Christ coming to dispense God into us as a mystery and as a hope of glory.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW TESTAMENT AND GOD&#8217;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:7b; Matt. 1:22; Luke 24:25-27, 44-46; Rom. 1:2; 1 Cor. 15:3-4; Col. 1:25-27; Eph. 1:9-10; 3:9-11; Rom. 14:17; Rev. 21:2, 10-11</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to consider the New Testament and God&#8217;s New Testament economy. We have seen that the New Testament is related to the Old Testament, that it is the fulfillment of the Old Testament, that it is the development and the reaping of the seed sown in the Old Testament, and that it is the completion of the divine revelation. Now we shall go on to see that the New Testament is the revelation of God&#8217;s New Testament economy (Col. 1:26-27).<h2 class=head2>The Revelation of God&#8217;s New Testament Economy, Unveiling Seven Major Items</h2><p>The New Testament is the revelation of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. This revelation unveils seven major items: God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem. These seven items are seven persons. God is a person, and Christ and the Spirit also are persons. The believers may be considered a corporate person; likewise, the church is a corporate person. Some, however, may have a problem regarding the kingdom as a person. Nevertheless, we strongly say that the kingdom is a person.<p>We need to consider in more detail the kingdom being a person. Let us use the animal kingdom as an illustration. What is the animal kingdom? The animal kingdom is a totality of all the animals. Hence, the animal kingdom is all the animals. If there were not any animals, there would not be an animal kingdom. The principle is the same with the plant kingdom. The plant kingdom consists of plants. If there were no plants, there would not be a plant kingdom. Likewise, the human kingdom consists of mankind. If we see into the depths of the teaching of the Bible concerning the kingdom, we shall realize that the kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself developed and enlarged into a kingdom. The kingdom of God is the Savior, the Lord Jesus, as the seed of life sown into His believers, God&#8217;s chosen people (Mark 4:3, 26), and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in the divine life. Therefore, the kingdom truly is a person. This is clearly proved in Daniel 2:34-35 by the stone cut out without hands, signifying the God-prepared Christ, which, after smiting the great image upon its feet to break all the parts of the great image, all the worldly powers, becomes a great mountain and fills the whole earth, signifying the coming kingdom of God (Rev. 11:15). This indicates that the Christ prepared by God, as a stone, will develop, at His coming back, into the kingdom of God, as a great mountain, that fills the whole earth.<p>The kingdom is actually another aspect of the church. We should not think that the church is one thing and that the kingdom is another, that the church is one person and that the kingdom is another person. Actually, the church and the kingdom are one person in two aspects.<p>Romans 14:17 says, &#8220;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This verse is a strong proof that the church in the church age is the kingdom of God because the context here deals with the church life in the present age. John 3:3 and 5 reveal that regeneration is the present entrance into the kingdom of God. Acts is a book concerning the spreading of the gospel and the establishing of the church, yet in Acts 1:3 the Lord Jesus spoke with His disciples for forty days concerning the kingdom of God to prepare them for this work. Following this, in Acts 8:12; 20:25; 28:23-31, the disciples preached the kingdom of God along with their preaching of Jesus Christ for the establishing of the churches. Furthermore, in 1 Corinthians 6:9; Galatians 5:21; and Ephesians 5:5 Paul, according to the context, considers the kingdom of God equivalent to the church. He and his co-workers were working for the church, yet in Colossians 4:11 he says that they were laboring for the kingdom of God. The word of the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16:18-19 also reveals clearly that the kingdom is the church. In Revelation 1:9 John indicates that he and the other believers were already in the kingdom. If we consider Romans 14:17 in the context of the whole book of Romans, we shall see that the kingdom of God in this verse certainly refers to the church.<p>The church today is the kingdom of God. Since the church is a corporate person and the church is the kingdom, it would not be logical to say that the kingdom is not a person. The church is a corporate person, and the kingdom is also a corporate person.<p>Like the church and the kingdom, the New Jerusalem is a person. When some hear that the New Jerusalem is a person, they may say, &#8220;The New Jerusalem is a city. How can you say that the city is a person?&#8221; The Bible indicates that the New Jerusalem is a person in Revelation 21, where we are told that the New Jerusalem is &#8220;prepared as a bride adorned for her husband&#8221; (v. 2) and that she is &#8220;the bride, the wife of the Lamb&#8221; (v. 9). Is not a wife a person? Since the New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb and the wife is a person, then the New Jerusalem is a person, a corporate person.<p>The seven major items unveiled in the revelation of God&#8217;s New Testament economy are all persons. God, Christ, and the Spirit are individual persons, whereas the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem are corporate persons.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2><h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Household Management, God&#8217;s Household Administrative Arrangement, the Divine Dispensation</h2><p>What is God&#8217;s New Testament economy? God&#8217;s New Testament economy is God&#8217;s household management, God&#8217;s household administrative arrangement, the divine dispensation (plan). By dispensation we mean here an arrangement, that is, a plan.<p>This economy, this dispensation, is revealed in Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9. Ephesians 1:10 says, &#8220;Unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;dispensation&#8221; here is oikonomia, from which we get the English word &#8220;economy.&#8221; God has purposed to have an economy. All the kingdoms in the universe, the angelic kingdom, the human kingdom, the animal kingdom, and the plant kingdom, are for this economy, this dispensation, and are moving toward its completion.<p>The Greek word rendered &#8220;dispensation&#8221; in Ephesians 1:10 can also be translated &#8220;stewardship&#8221; or &#8220;household arrangement.&#8221; The word &#8220;administration&#8221; may also be used because eventually this dispensation, this stewardship and household arrangement, will become an eternal administration. The entire universe will eventually be under one administration. Although the word administration may be used here, I prefer the words dispensation, stewardship, and household arrangement.<p>In relation to God&#8217;s purpose, the word &#8220;economy&#8221; is unfamiliar to many Christians. The Greek word for economy, oikonomia, is used two other times in Ephesians. We have seen that in Ephesians 1:10 Paul speaks of a dispensation, or economy, of the fullness of the times, in which all things will be headed up in Christ. Then in 3:2 he speaks of the stewardship of the grace of God, and in 3:9, of the dispensation of the mystery. In 3:9 Paul says, &#8220;To bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.&#8221; God&#8217;s mystery is His hidden purpose. His purpose is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Hence, there is the dispensation of the mystery of God. This mystery was hidden in God from the ages, that is, from eternity and through all past ages, but now it has been brought to light to the New Testament believers.<p>In 1 Timothy 1:4 Paul speaks of &#8220;God&#8217;s dispensation which is in faith.&#8221; Once again, the Greek word rendered &#8220;dispensation&#8221; is oikonomia. In Greek the words &#8220;God&#8217;s dispensation&#8221; here also mean God&#8217;s household economy. This is God&#8217;s household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people so that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ. Paul&#8217;s ministry was centered on this economy of God (Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17).<h2 class=head3>A Plan Made by God according to His Good Pleasure</h2><p>God&#8217;s New Testament economy is a plan made by God according to His good pleasure. Concerning this, Ephesians 1:9 says, &#8220;Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself.&#8221; God&#8217;s good pleasure is the desire of His heart. This good pleasure was what God purposed in Himself for a dispensation, for a plan (v. 10). This plan made by God was according to His good pleasure, the desire of His heart.<p>God&#8217;s good pleasure has been purposed by God in Himself. This means that God Himself is the initiation, origination, and sphere of His eternal purpose. God has a plan, a desire, and according to His plan, He has a purpose. The existence of the universe is according to God&#8217;s purpose. Heaven, earth, millions of items, and the human race are all according to God&#8217;s purposed desire. Hence, in the universe there is a desire, God&#8217;s desire. Because this desire has been purposed by God, no one and nothing can overthrow it. God purposed this desire in Himself; He did not take counsel with anyone else regarding it.<p>We have seen that Ephesians 1:9 speaks of God&#8217;s good pleasure. Everyone desires pleasure. If we desire pleasure, then certainly God does also. Every living thing desires pleasure. In fact, the more living you are, the more pleasure you need. Because God is the most living One, He surely needs the most pleasure. If we, as fallen sinners, require pleasure, then how much more does God, the living One, have a deep need for it?<p>Unlike the book of Romans, which begins from the perspective of the condition of fallen man, the book of Ephesians was written from the perspective of God&#8217;s good pleasure, the desire of His heart. What, then, is God&#8217;s good pleasure? God&#8217;s good pleasure is to dispense Himself into us. This is the unique desire of God. We may say that God is &#8220;dreaming&#8221; of dispensing Himself into us. His longing, His aspiration, is to dispense Himself into His chosen people.<p>Many Christians neglect God&#8217;s desire to dispense Himself into us. Instead of caring for this matter, they may pay attention to teachings concerning how to be holy, spiritual, and victorious. Many have never heard that God wants to do one thing-to dispense Himself into us.<p>In a sense, a believer may be &#8220;holy&#8221; without having much of God dispensed into him. However, that kind of holiness is not genuine, thus not stable. But if God is dispensed into our being, we shall be genuinely holy. Actually, holiness is nothing other than God dispensed into us subjectively. The objective God is holy only to Himself and by Himself. But the subjective God-the God dispensed into us-becomes our subjective holiness. Therefore, to us, the real holiness is God dispensed into our being. It is God&#8217;s good pleasure, the desire of His heart, to dispense Himself into us for our everything.<h2 class=head3>An Eternal Plan God Made in Christ</h2><p>God&#8217;s economy is an eternal plan made by God in Christ. Regarding this, Ephesians 3:11 says, &#8220;According to the purpose of the ages which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221; The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past.<p>God made His eternal economy in Christ. The Christ revealed in the Bible is the embodiment of the Triune God and all the processes through which He has passed, including incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension. In such a Christ God made His eternal economy. Christ, therefore, is the element, sphere, means, goal, and aim of God&#8217;s eternal economy. Christ is everything in God&#8217;s economy. In fact, all the contents of the eternal economy of God are simply Christ. Christ is the center, circumference, element, sphere, means, goal, and aim of this economy. According to Ephesians 3, this economy was made in Christ.<h2 class=head3>To Dispense God Himself into His Chosen People in His Trinity</h2><p>God&#8217;s New Testament economy is His plan to dispense Himself into His chosen people in His trinity. In what way does God dispense Himself into His people in His trinity? This dispensing has three steps. First, it is of God the Father. The Father is the source, the origin. Second, this dispensing is through God the Son, who is the course. Third, God&#8217;s dispensing is in God the Spirit, who is the instrument and sphere. Through these steps of God the Father, through God the Son, and in God the Spirit God dispenses Himself into His chosen people.<h2 class=head3>For the Producing of the Church as the Kingdom of God Consummating in the New Jerusalem</h2><p>God&#8217;s New Testament economy to dispense Himself into His chosen people is for the producing of the church (Eph. 3:10). This dispensing brings forth the church for the manifestation of the multifarious wisdom of God according to His eternal purpose made in Christ (Eph. 3:9-11). This means that through the dispensing of God in His trinity the church is produced to exhibit God&#8217;s manifold wisdom.<p>We have pointed out that the church today is the kingdom of God. Therefore, the dispensing of God into us produces the church as the kingdom of God. 1 Corinthians 4:17 and 20 show that the kingdom is the church life today. In verse 17 Paul refers to his ways &#8220;which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.&#8221; Then in verse 20 he says, &#8220;The kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.&#8221; These verses show that the kingdom of God is the church everywhere, and the church everywhere is the kingdom. The kingdom is here because the church is here.<p>The church as the kingdom of God will have a consummation, and this consummation will be the New Jerusalem for the eternal expression of the Triune God. Revelation 21:2 says, &#8220;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&#8221; The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints redeemed by God throughout all generations. It is the bride of Christ as His counterpart (John 3:29) and the holy city of God as His habitation. As the bride of Christ, New Jerusalem comes out of Christ, &#8220;her husband,&#8221; and becomes His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, and became his counterpart (Gen. 2:21-24). The New Jerusalem is prepared as a bride for her husband by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ. As the holy city of God, she is wholly sanctified unto God and fully saturated with God&#8217;s holy nature to be His habitation.<p>In both the Old and New Testaments, God likens His chosen people to a spouse (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32) and a dwelling place for Himself (Exo. 29:45-46; Num. 5:3; Ezek. 43:7, 9; Psa. 68:18; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; 1 Tim. 3:15). The spouse is for His satisfaction in love, and the dwelling place is for His rest in expression. Both of these aspects will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem. In her God will have the fullest satisfaction in love and the utmost rest in expression for eternity.<p>Revelation 21:10 and 11 say, &#8220;He carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal.&#8221; The glory of God is the expression of God, God expressed. We have been ordained for this glory and called to it (1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12). We are being transformed into this glory (2 Cor. 3:18) and shall be brought into it (Heb. 2:10). Eventually we shall be glorified with Christ (Rom. 8:17, 30) to bear the glory of God for God&#8217;s expression in the New Jerusalem. Therefore, God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people for the producing of the church as the kingdom of God will consummate in the New Jerusalem as His eternal expression.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR A VISION OF GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h2><p>Throughout the years we have given many messages on God&#8217;s New Testament economy. However, according to my observation, most of the saints who have received these messages still need a clear vision of God&#8217;s economy. We need a vision of the central matter in the Bible-the desire of God&#8217;s heart to dispense Himself into His chosen people in His trinity for the producing of the church, which is the kingdom of God that will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal expression of the Triune God.<p>We need a vision of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. It is not adequate merely to know about it. You may know about a certain person without ever having seen him. To see a person is very different from merely knowing about him. Likewise, seeing the vision of God&#8217;s New Testament economy is different from simply hearing about it. I hope that all the saints will spend much time to pray, both individually and corporately, regarding this. We need to say, &#8220;Lord, I cry out to You concerning God&#8217;s economy. I need a vision of the New Testament economy. Lord, I have been saved for a long time, but I have not yet seen the vision that the New Testament reveals God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Lord, cause me to see that the Triune God wants to dispense Himself into our being so that the church may be produced as the kingdom of God in order that God may have an eternal consummation to express Himself in a corporate way eternally.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>DISPENSATION AND DISPENSING</h2><p>It is important that we make a distinction between the words &#8220;dispensation&#8221; and &#8220;dispensing.&#8221; According to the dictionary, dispensation is a noun form of the verb &#8220;dispense.&#8221; But according to New Testament usage, the word dispensation refers to God&#8217;s arrangement, God&#8217;s plan.<p>We have seen that dispensation is the translation of the Greek word oikonomia, which is composed of two words: oikos, which means house, and nomos, which means law. Oikonomia denotes household regulations or household management. Because this word refers to a household administration and management, it implies a plan. In Ephesians 3 the word dispensation means a plan, an arrangement. Therefore, when we use the word dispensation, we mean God&#8217;s household management, God&#8217;s arrangement, God&#8217;s plan. When we use the word dispensation, we do not mean dispensing, which is the act of God&#8217;s dispensing Himself into us. Nevertheless, in God&#8217;s dispensation the crucial matter is the dispensing of the Triune God into us.<p>If we are clear concerning the difference between dispensation and dispensing, we shall not say that we are under God&#8217;s dispensation but rather are under His dispensing. To be under God&#8217;s dispensation is to be under His administrative government. To be under God&#8217;s dispensing is to be under His dispensing action, His act of dispensing Himself into us. If we use the word dispensation to refer to God&#8217;s dispensing, others may misunderstand us and think that we are speaking of the plan made by God. Therefore, let us use the words dispensation and dispensing according to biblical usage, making it clear that dispensation denotes God&#8217;s administrative arrangement and dispensing, His act of dispensing Himself into us.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to consider God&#8217;s person. God&#8217;s person is simply God&#8217;s being. Many more particulars concerning God&#8217;s person are revealed in the New Testament than are unveiled in the Old Testament. As we consider the various aspects of God&#8217;s person, we shall see what kind of God intends to dispense Himself into us. You may realize that God desires to dispense Himself into you. But what kind of God is being dispensed into you? Actually it is very difficult to answer this question.<p>The different points related to God&#8217;s being are found here and there throughout the New Testament. God&#8217;s way of revealing this is to present a little in one place and a little more in another place. Hence, in Matthew, John, and all the other books of the New Testament we find the many points concerning God&#8217;s person. These points may be compared to the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that need to be put together in order to form a complete picture. We need to collect all the points concerning God&#8217;s person found in the New Testament and put them together in order to see a picture of the kind of God who is being dispensed into us.<p>In the New Testament God&#8217;s person is revealed both in plain words and in parables and signs.<h2 class=head1>A. IN PLAIN WORDS</h2><p>In plain words, there are at least twenty-nine items as follows:<h2 class=head2>1. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit</h2><p>The God who is dispensing Himself into us is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit certainly are not three Gods. God is one, yet He is triune.<h2 class=head3>Baptized into the Triune God</h2><p>We see the Triune God in Matthew 28:19: &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; In this verse there is one name for the divine Trinity-the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The name is the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize anyone into the name of the Trinity is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is.<p>Matthew and John are two books in which the divine Trinity is more fully revealed, for the participation and enjoyment of God&#8217;s chosen people, than in all the other books of Scripture. John unveils the mystery of the Godhead in the Father, Son, and Spirit, especially in chapters fourteen through sixteen, for our experience of life. Matthew discloses the reality of the divine Trinity in the one name for all Three, for the constitution of the kingdom. In the opening chapter of Matthew, the Holy Spirit (v. 18), Christ the Son (v. 18), and God the Father (v. 23) are on the scene for the producing of the man Jesus (v. 21), who, as Jehovah the Savior and God with us, is the embodiment of the Triune God. In chapter three Matthew presents a picture of the Son standing in the water of baptism under the opened heaven, the Spirit as a dove descending upon the Son, and the Father out of the heavens speaking concerning the Son (vv. 16-17). In chapter twelve the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father (v. 28). In chapter sixteen the Son is revealed by the Father to the disciples for the building of the church (vv. 16-19). In chapter seventeen the Son entered into transfiguration (v. 2) and was confirmed by the Father&#8217;s word of delight (v. 5) for a miniature display of the manifestation of the kingdom (16:28). Eventually, in the closing chapter, after Christ, as the last Adam, had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into the realm of resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples, in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection, to charge them to make the heathen the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the person, the reality, of the Trinity. According to Matthew, such a baptism into the reality of the Father, Son, and Spirit is for the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. The heavenly kingdom cannot be organized with human beings of flesh and blood (1 Cor. 15:50) as an earthly society; it can be constituted only of people who are immersed into union with the Triune God and who are established and built up with the Triune God who is wrought into them.<h2 class=head3>The Grace of Christ, the Love of God, and the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Another verse that reveals the Triune God is 2 Corinthians 13:14: &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment (John 1:17; 1 Cor. 15:10), the love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16) as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation. These are not three separate matters but three aspects of one thing, just as the Lord, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods but three &#8220;hypostases...of the one same undivided and indivisible&#8221; God (Philip Schaff). The love of God is the source, since God is the origin. The grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God. The fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God with all His attributes. Here the grace of the Lord is mentioned first because 2 Corinthians is a book on the grace of Christ (1:12; 4:15; 6:1; 8:1, 9; 9:8, 14; 12:9).<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 is strong proof that the Trinity of the Godhead is not for the doctrinal understanding of systematic theology, but for the dispensing of God Himself in His Trinity into His chosen and redeemed people. In the Bible the divine Trinity is never revealed merely as a doctrine. Rather, it is always revealed or mentioned in regard to the relationship of God with His creatures, especially with men created by Him and even the more with His chosen and redeemed people. The first divine title used in God&#8217;s divine revelation concerning His creation, Elohim in Hebrew, is plural in number (Gen. 1:1). This implies that God, as the Creator of the heavens and the earth for man, is triune, and He created the universe in His trinity. Concerning the creation of man in His own image, after His own likeness, He used the plural pronouns, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our,&#8221; referring to His trinity (Gen. 1:26) and implying that He will be one with man and express Himself through man in His trinity. Later, in Genesis 3:22 and 11:7 and Isaiah 6:8, He referred to Himself again and again as &#8220;us&#8221; concerning His relationship with man and with His chosen people.<p>In order to redeem man so that He might still have the position to be one with man, God became incarnated (John 1:1, 14) in the Son and through the Spirit (Luke 1:31-35) to be a man, and He lived a human life on the earth, also in the Son (Luke 2:49) and by the Spirit (Luke 4:1; Matt. 12:28). At the beginning of the Lord&#8217;s ministry on earth, the Father anointed the Son with the Spirit (Matt. 3:16-17; Luke 4:18) for reaching men and bringing them back to Him. Just before He was crucified in the flesh and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), the Lord unveiled His mysterious trinity to His disciples in plain words (John 14-17), stating that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son (14:9-11), that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son (14:16-20), that the Three, coexisting and coinhering simultaneously, are abiding with the believers for their enjoyment (14:23; 16:7-10; 17:21-23), and that all the Father has is the Son&#8217;s, and all the Son possesses is received by the Spirit to be disclosed, revealed, to the believers (16:13-15). Such a Trinity is altogether related to the dispensing of the processed God into His believers (14:17, 20; 15:4-5), so that they may be one in and with the Triune God (17:21-23).<p>After His resurrection, the Lord charged His disciples to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). As we have pointed out, this is to bring the believing ones into the Triune God, into an organic union with the processed God, who has passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and has entered into resurrection. It is based upon such an organic union that at the conclusion of 2 Corinthians Paul blesses the Corinthians with the blessed Trinity in the participation of the Son&#8217;s grace with the Father&#8217;s love through the Spirit&#8217;s fellowship. In this trinity God the Father operates all things in all the members in the church, which is the Body of Christ, through the ministries of the Lord, God the Son, by the gifts of God the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:4-6).<h2 class=head3>The Triune God Revealed in Ephesians</h2><p>The entire divine revelation in the book of Ephesians concerning the producing, existing, growing, building up, and fighting of the church as the Body of Christ is composed of the divine economy-the dispensing of the Triune God into the members of the Body of Christ. Chapter one unveils how God the Father chose and predestinated these members in eternity (vv. 4-5), God the Son redeemed them (vv. 6-12), and God the Spirit sealed them as a pledge (vv. 13-14), thus imparting Himself into His believers for the formation of the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (vv. 18-23). Chapter two shows us that in the divine Trinity all the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, have access unto God the Father through God the Son, in God the Spirit (v. 18). This also indicates that the Three coexist and coinhere simultaneously, even after all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. In chapter three the apostle prays that God the Father will grant the believers to be strengthened through God the Spirit into their inner man so that Christ, God the Son, may make His home in their hearts, that is, to occupy their entire being, that they might be filled unto all the fullness of the processed Triune God (vv. 14-19). This is the climax of God in His trinity to be experienced and participated in by the believers in Christ for His full expression. Chapter four portrays how the processed God as the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father, is mingled with the Body of Christ (vv. 4-6) for the experience of the divine Trinity by all its members. Chapter five exhorts the believers to praise the Lord, God the Son, with the songs of God the Spirit and to give thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, God the Son, to God the Father (vv. 19-20). This is to praise and thank the processed God in His divine trinity for our enjoyment of Him as the Triune God. Chapter six instructs us to fight the spiritual warfare by being empowered in the Lord, God the Son, putting on the whole armor of God the Father, and wielding the sword of God the Spirit (vv. 10-11, 17). This is the experience and enjoyment of the Triune God by the believers even in spiritual warfare.<h2 class=head3>The Triune God in First Peter and in Revelation</h2><p>In his writings the apostle Peter confirms this Trinity of God for the believers&#8217; enjoyment by referring them to the election of God the Father, the sanctification of God the Spirit, and the redemption of Jesus Christ, God the Son, by His blood (1 Pet. 1:2).<p>John the apostle also strengthens the revelation of the divine Trinity for the believers&#8217; participation in the processed Triune God. In the book of Revelation he blesses the churches in different localities with grace and peace from God the Father, Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from God the Spirit, the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from God the Son, Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth (1:4-5). This blessing of John to the churches also indicates that the processed Triune God, in all He is as the eternal Father, in all He is able to do as the sevenfold intensified Spirit, and in all He has attained and obtained as the anointed Son, is for the believers&#8217; enjoyment so that they may be His corporate testimony as the golden lampstands (1:9-11, 20).<p>It is evident, therefore, that the divine revelation of the Trinity of the Godhead in the holy Word, from Genesis through Revelation, is not for the study of theology, but for the understanding of how God in His mysterious and marvelous trinity dispenses Himself into His chosen people so that we, as His chosen and redeemed people, may, as indicated in Paul&#8217;s blessing to the Corinthian believers in 2 Corinthians 13:14, participate in, experience, enjoy, and possess the processed Triune God now and for eternity.<p>Concerning the Triune God, Revelation 1:4 and 5 say, &#8220;Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.&#8221; He &#8220;who is and who was and who is coming&#8221; is God the eternal Father. The seven Spirits who are before God&#8217;s throne are the operating Spirit of God, God the Spirit. Jesus Christ, to God the faithful Witness, to the church the Firstborn of the dead, and to the world the Ruler of the kings of the earth, is God the Son. This is the Triune God. As God the eternal Father, He was in the past, He is in the present, and He is coming in the future. As God the Spirit, He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God&#8217;s operation. As God the Son, He is the Witness, the testimony, the expression, of God; the Firstborn of the dead for the church, the new creation; and the Ruler of the kings of the earth for the world. From such a Triune God, grace and peace are imparted to the churches.<p>The seven Spirits in Revelation 1:4 are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because they are ranked among the Triune God in verses 4 and 5. As seven is the number for completion in God&#8217;s operation, in God&#8217;s move, so the seven Spirits must be for God&#8217;s move on earth. In substance and existence God&#8217;s Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God&#8217;s operation God&#8217;s Spirit is sevenfold. It is like the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2: in existence it is one lampstand standing, but in function it is seven lamps shining.<p>In Matthew 28:19 the sequence of the Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Here the sequence is changed. The seven Spirits of God are listed in the second place instead of the third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God in the dark situation of the degraded churches. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit&#8217;s speaking in 2:7-11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13; and 22:17.<p>At the opening of most of the Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned, from whom grace and peace are given to the receivers. However, in Revelation 1:4 and 5 the Spirit also is included, from whom grace and peace are imparted to the churches. This also signifies the crucial need of the Spirit of God for God&#8217;s move in the degradation of the churches.<h2 class=head3>Modalism, Tritheism, and the Pure Revelation of the Triune God according to the Bible</h2><p>The New Testament reveals that our God is triune. During the centuries three main schools of teaching concerning the Trinity have emerged: modalism, tritheism, and the pure revelation according to the Bible. Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time, but are merely three temporary manifestations of the one God. Tritheism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods. We should have nothing to do with modalism, for that extreme view concerning the Trinity is a heresy. It is also a great heresy to teach that there are three Gods.<p>According to the natural law in God&#8217;s creation, there is the law of balance. Nothing can exist without having two sides. For example, the earth exists because of two forces: centrifugal force thrusts the earth away, and centripetal force holds it back. This is the balance of power. All the truths in the Bible also have two sides. In order to hold a biblical truth properly, we must hold both sides of it. The pure revelation of the Triune God in the Bible occupies a central position between the extremes of modalism and tritheism.<p>Because the truths in the Bible have two sides, there are two aspects to the Trinity: the aspect of the one-in-three and the aspect of the three-in-one. Modalism is an extreme on the side of the three-in-one. There is, of course, ground in the Scriptures for the side of the three-in-one, but modalism, going to an extreme, far beyond the confines of the Bible, neglects and even annuls the side of the one-in-three. Because modalism goes beyond the confines of the Scriptures concerning the aspect of the one, it is a heresy on the extreme of the one. Tritheism is the opposite extreme, the extreme of the three. Tritheism emphasizes the side of the three, going beyond the confines of the Scriptures concerning the aspect of the three, and neglects the side of the one. It also has scriptural ground because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit certainly are three. But tritheism, like modalism, also goes beyond the confines of the Bible and becomes a heresy. Therefore, both modalism and tritheism, being extremes, are heresies.<p>The Bible is not at either of these extremes; it stands in the center, testifying the twofoldness of the truth of the Trinity. In this matter, the Scriptures are balanced. The Bible, true to the principle of balance in God&#8217;s creation, is balanced and in the center; it does not go to an extreme. Regarding the truth of the Triune God, we also should be balanced and avoid the heretical extremes of both modalism and tritheism.<p>Throughout the years I have given many messages on the Triune God. If certain sentences in those messages are taken out of context, it may appear that I teach modalism. However, if certain other sentences are taken out of context, it may appear that I also teach tritheism. Of course, I teach neither modalism nor tritheism.<p>Augustine, a leader in teaching the divine Trinity, was sometimes accused of being modalistic and at other times was accused of being tritheistic. Because he taught that the Father, Son, and the Spirit are one God, not three separate Gods, he was accused of teaching modalism. But because he strongly emphasized that God is three-the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit-he was also accused of teaching tritheism. Likewise, when we point out the Scriptures that reveal that our God is absolutely one, that the Son is even called the Father (Isa. 9:6), and that the Son is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), we have been falsely accused of teaching modalism. But when our writings are considered fairly and completely, it will become evident that we teach neither modalism nor tritheism but the pure revelation of the Triune God according to the Scriptures.<p>What is the error in modalism? Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time. Rather, modalism claims that the Father ended with the Son&#8217;s coming and that the Son ceased with the Spirit&#8217;s coming. The modalists say that the Three of the Godhead exist respectively in three consecutive stages. They do not believe in the coexistence and coinherence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Unlike them, we believe in the coexistence and coinherence of the Three of the Godhead; that is, we believe that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all exist essentially at the same time and under the same conditions. However, in the divine economy, the Three work and are manifested respectively in three consecutive stages. Yet even in Their economical works and manifestations the Three still remain essentially in Their coexistence and coinherence. The Father chose us in the Son and by the Spirit (Eph. 1:4; 1 Pet. 1:2a). The Son accomplished redemption for us with the Father and by the Spirit (John 8:29; Heb. 9:14). The Spirit works in us as the Son (John 14:26; 2 Cor. 3:17) with the Father (John 15:26). Their works and manifestations are economical, but their coexistence and coinherence are eternal. All the Three are eternal essentially. Isaiah 9:6 says that the Father is eternal, Hebrews 1:12 and 7:3 indicate that the Son is eternal, and Hebrews 9:14 speaks of the eternal Spirit. Therefore, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not consecutive but eternal in Their existence, in Their being.<p>God is uniquely one but triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 3:16-17; 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 2:18; 3:14-16; Rev. 1:4-5). The Godhead is distinctively three, but the Father, Son, and Spirit certainly are not three Gods separately. The New Testament tells us definitely that God is one (1 Cor. 8:4; 1 Tim. 2:5).<p>Some Christians have believed that the Father is one Person and that the Son is another Person, but the Spirit is merely a power. Others believe that the Three of the Godhead-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-are three separate Gods. These concepts are heretical. According to the divine revelation of the holy Word, we believe that our God is uniquely one. We have only one God, who is triune.<p>Because our mentality is limited, we are not able to explain the Triune God thoroughly. Actually we cannot even define ourselves very well. How, then, could we define the Triune God adequately and thoroughly? This is impossible. We can only believe what is clearly revealed in the New Testament: God is one but triune.<h2 class=head3>Distinct but Not Separate</h2><p>Certain of today&#8217;s fundamental Bible teachers are actually tritheistic, perhaps unconsciously. These teachers say not only that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct but also that They are separate. We can say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct, but not that They are separate. We cannot separate the Son from the Father, or the Father and the Son from the Spirit, because all three coexist and coinhere. In the Gospel of John the Son said that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him (10:38; 14:10-11). Since the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son, how can They be separated? The Lord Jesus also said that He and the Father are one (John 10:30). This is further proof that the Father and the Son, although distinct, cannot be separated. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct but not separate, because they are three and yet one.<h2 class=head3>The Triune God in Us</h2><p>We need to see that the God who is dispensing Himself into us is triune. Do you realize that the Triune God is in you? According to the New Testament, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us (Eph. 4:6; Col. 1:27; John 14:17). Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us, in our experience we sense that there is just One in us. This One who dwells in us is the Triune God.<p>Martin Luther warns us not to approach the matter of the divine Trinity by reasoning:<p class=indent1>We should live in this simplicity and not venture forth on this deep and tremendously vast sea of dispute about such questions. For this article [the Trinity] is very slippery, first because of its subtlety, then also because of our weakness. It is, therefore, complete folly and a most perilous undertaking to wish to search into these things more subtly. For if we could do this, we would not need the Scriptures for a guide. No, neither would this Teacher and King be necessary for us. Moreover, those who neglect the Scriptures and approach such questions with confidence in their own mental power are the teachers of God, not His pupils....If reason disturbs you here and questions arise like...Are there, then, two gods? answer: There is only one God, and still there is the Father and the Son. How is this possible? Respond with humility: I do not know....<p>I surely cannot explain the divine Trinity adequately. I only present the facts from the New Testament concerning this great truth so that you all may be impressed with this divine fact that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into our being in His trinity. Do not exercise your mentality too much to explore it. Rather, exercise your spirit to experience and enjoy the marvelous dispensing of the Triune God as the Father, Son, and Spirit.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to be on the person of God.<h2 class=head2>2. The God and Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ</h2><p>In Ephesians 1:3 Paul speaks of God as &#8220;the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; Since Jesus Christ is God, why does Paul speak of the God of Jesus Christ? How can God be His God? Furthermore, Paul mentions the Father of Jesus Christ. How can Christ, being God, have a Father? God is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of Man, and God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God. According to His humanity, God is His God; and according to His divinity, God is His Father.<p>Paul&#8217;s praise to the God of the New Testament in Ephesians 1:3 is deep and profound. It encompasses the entire New Testament economy. Here we have not only creation, indicated by the title &#8220;God,&#8221; but also incarnation, indicated by the title &#8220;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; The first revelation of God in the Bible is in creation, for the Bible opens with the words, &#8220;In the beginning God created....&#8221; Following creation is the incarnation. One day God the Creator became incarnated. The Word that was with God and was God became flesh (John 1:1, 14) to be a man. When God Himself became a man, the God who created all things became His God. &#8220;The God of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; indicates that the Lord Jesus was a man. If He were only God, God could never be His God. In order for God to be His God, He had to become a man. For this, incarnation was needed. The God whom the Jews worship is only the God of creation, not the God of incarnation. We today worship not only the God of creation but also the God of incarnation. In incarnation the God of creation became the very God of the Man Jesus. At the same time, God is also the Father of Christ as the Son of God. In Christ&#8217;s humanity, God is His God; in His divinity God is His Father.<p>Furthermore, as the title &#8220;God&#8221; refers to creation, so the title &#8220;Father&#8221; should refer to the impartation of life. This took place in the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. On the day of His resurrection His word to Mary in John 20:17 indicates that God is not only His Father, but also His believers&#8217; Father. It is through His resurrection that God the Father becomes His believers&#8217; Father. This is the Father&#8217;s impartation of life to His many children.<p>In Ephesians 1:17 Paul goes on to speak of &#8220;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.&#8221; In verse 3 Paul speaks of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, putting God and the Father together. But here he mentions Them separately, saying, &#8220;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.&#8221; In incarnation the Lord Jesus Christ, God Himself (Phil. 2:6), became a man. As a man, He is related to God&#8217;s creation; therefore, God the Creator is His God. The incarnation brought God the Creator into man, God&#8217;s creature. The title &#8220;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; implies that God the Creator has come into man. Whenever we speak of God in this way, we imply that God is no longer merely the Creator outside of His creature, man, but that He has been brought into humanity. We, the fallen creatures, have been redeemed. Incarnation indicates that God is for our enjoyment. We can enjoy God because He has come into humanity for our redemption. Divinity becomes our enjoyment in Jesus.<p>By His work of creation God became the Creator. After creation He took the step of incarnation, thereby coming into His creature, man. By and in incarnation the Creator and the creature became one. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was the uniting of God and man. Through crucifixion the Lord accomplished redemption. As a result, we, the fallen creatures, were redeemed. The Jews, however, have no concept of God&#8217;s incarnation and redemption. But we Christians have God in creation, incarnation, and redemption. How much more we have than the Jews!<p>In John 20:17 the Lord told Mary to say to His brothers, &#8220;I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.&#8221; This indicates that the Lord as a resurrected man takes God as His God and the Father as His Father. Furthermore, this verse reveals that His Father and God has become His believers&#8217; Father and God.<p>Why did the Lord tell Mary that He was ascending to the Father and to God? On the one hand, the Lord is the Son of God; therefore, He would see the Father in the person of the Son. On the other hand, He is still the Son of Man; therefore, He would see God in the person of man. We His believers, also are men on the one hand and sons of God on the other. Because we are men, God is God to us. Because we are the sons of God, God is also the Father to us. Because we are now both men and sons of God, we have both God and the Father.<p>All the believers as human beings have become brothers to the Lord and sons to the Father through the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, because they have received the same life as He. Through His life-imparting death and resurrection the Lord has made His believers one with Him. Therefore, His Father is also His believers&#8217; Father, and His God is also their God. In His resurrection they have both the Father&#8217;s life and God&#8217;s nature, just as He does. In making them His brothers He has imparted the Father&#8217;s life and God&#8217;s nature into them. In making His Father and His God theirs He has brought them into His position-the Son&#8217;s position-before the Father and God. Thus, in life and in nature inwardly and in position outwardly they are the same as He.<p>John 20:17; Ephesians 1:3, 17; and Revelation 1:6 were all written after the Lord&#8217;s ascension. We have seen that in John 20:17 the Lord was about to ascend to His Father and God and that in Ephesians 1:3 and 17 Paul speaks of the God of our Lord Jesus Christ. Furthermore, Revelation 1:6 says that Christ has &#8220;made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father.&#8221; As in John 20:17 and Ephesians 1:3 and 17, &#8220;His God&#8221; refers to the Lord&#8217;s relationship as a man to God, and &#8220;His Father&#8221; refers to His relationship as the Son to the Father. Therefore, the New Testament emphasizes the fact that the God who created us and redeemed us, and who is imparting and dispensing Himself into us, is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head2>3. The God of Glory</h2><p>In the Bible glory is God expressed. Whenever God is expressed, that is glory. But whenever God is hidden, concealed, there is no glory expressed. When God is seen, there is glory. You can never see God without seeing His glory. While the unseen God is God, the seen God is glory. God&#8217;s glory was seen as the children of Israel journeyed from Egypt to the good land (Exo. 13:21). During the day God was seen as the cloud, and during the night He was seen as the pillar of fire-that was glory. In the Gospel of John we read that the Word was God, that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and that we all beheld His glory (John 1:1, 14). John 1:18 says, &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&#8221; There is glory in the declaration of God. When we see God, we see glory.<p>In Acts 7:2, as Stephen was testifying before the Sanhedrin, he said, &#8220;The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham....&#8221; The glory here might have been visible glory, as when the cloud and the fire appeared to Israel (Exo. 16:10; 24:16-17; Lev. 9:23; Num. 14:10; 16:19; 20:6; Deut. 5:24) and filled the tabernacle and temple (Exo. 40:35; 1 Kings 8:11). It was the God of such glory who appeared to Abraham and called him. His glory was a great attraction to Abraham. It separated, sanctified, him from the world unto God (Exo. 29:43), and it was a great encouragement and strength which enabled him to follow God (Gen. 12:1, 4).<p>Stephen&#8217;s word about the God of glory fits in with God&#8217;s New Testament economy. In his second Epistle Peter tells us that God has called us by His glory and to His glory (2 Pet. 1:3). Because we were called by the glory of God our Savior (2 Pet. 1:1), we eventually received the Lord Jesus, realizing that He is better than anything and anyone else.<p>The God of glory called Abraham, and Abraham was attracted and caught by that glory. The principle is the same with us today. We all have been caught by the Lord in His glory. We have been captured by His glory. One day the God of glory came to us through the preaching of the gospel, and we were attracted and convinced and began to appreciate Him. During that time, the God of glory transfused some element of His being into us, and we believed in Him spontaneously. To be attracted by the God of glory means that God transfused Himself into His called ones without their realizing it or being conscious of it. This can be compared to radium treatment practiced in modem medicine. The patient is placed under the X ray, unconscious of the beams that are penetrating him. We may say that God is the strongest &#8220;radium.&#8221; If we stay with Him for a period of time, He will transfuse Himself into us. This transfusion will cause infusion, saturation, and permeation. Once God has transfused Himself into us, we cannot escape; we must believe in Him.<h2 class=head2>4. The Father of Glory</h2><p>In Ephesians 1:17 Paul uses the term &#8220;the Father of glory.&#8221; As we have pointed out, glory is God expressed. Hence, the Father of glory is God expressed through His many sons. The title &#8220;Father&#8221; implies regeneration, and the word &#8220;glory&#8221; implies expression. Therefore, the title &#8220;Father of glory&#8221; implies regeneration and expression. We have been regenerated by God, and we are His expression.<p>We have already been regenerated, but in the future we shall be glorified and express God&#8217;s glory (Rom. 8:30). The regeneration of many sons and the expression of God are the consummation of the divine economy. Through His crucifixion the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption for us. As a result, we, the fallen creatures, have been redeemed. Then we were regenerated to become sons of God the Father so that we may express Him. On the day we are glorified, God will be fully expressed from within us. In this way we shall become His expression in full.<p>Hebrews 2:10 says that God is leading many sons into glory. The last step of God&#8217;s great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory. Romans 8 tells us that God&#8217;s work of grace upon us began with His foreknowing through His predestination, calling, and justification and will end with His glorification (vv. 29-30). Romans 8 tells us that the whole creation eagerly expects the revelation, the glorification, of the sons of God, hoping that the creation itself will enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (vv. 19-20). This will be accomplished by the Lord&#8217;s coming back (Phil. 3:21), at which time we shall appear with Him in glory (Col. 3:4). This is our hope (Col. 1:27). This glorification of the sons of God, as the goal of God&#8217;s salvation, will last through the millennial kingdom and will be manifested in fullness in the New Jerusalem for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23).<h2 class=head2>5. The Father of Every Family in Heaven and on Earth</h2><p>Ephesians 3:14 and 15 say, &#8220;For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on the earth is named.&#8221; Here Paul does not refer to God but to the Father. The Father in verse 14 is used in a broad sense, signifying not only the Father of the household of faith (Gal. 6:10), but the Father of every family in the heavens and on the earth. The Father is the source not only of the regenerated believers, but also of the God-created mankind (Luke 3:38), of the God-created Israel (Isa. 63:16; 64:8), and of the God-created angels (Job 1:6). The Jews&#8217; concept was that God was Father only to them. Hence, Paul prayed to the Father of all the families in the heavens and on the earth according to his revelation, not as the Jews, who prayed only to the Father of Israel according to the Jewish concept.<p>The Greek word rendered &#8220;family&#8221; in Ephesians 3:15 may also be translated &#8220;fatherhood,&#8221; implying a family. Since God is the source of the angelic family in the heavens and all the human families on earth, so it is of God that every family in the heavens and on earth is named, just as producers give names to their products and fathers give names to their children.<p>Luke 3:38 indicates that, through creation, God is the Father of mankind, for in this verse Adam is called &#8220;the son of God.&#8221; This does not mean that Adam was born of God and possessed the life of God. Adam was created by God (Gen. 5:1-2), and God was his origin. Based upon this, he was supposed to be the son of God, even as the heathen poets considered all mankind to be the offspring of God (Acts 17:28). They were only created by God, not regenerated of Him. This is absolutely and intrinsically different from the believers in Christ being the sons of God. They have been born, regenerated, of God and possess God&#8217;s life and nature (John 1:12-13; 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:4).<p>In Acts 17:28 Paul says, &#8220;For in Him we live and move and are, as even some poets among you have said, For we also are His offspring.&#8221; The words &#8220;in Him we live and move and are&#8221; denote that man&#8217;s life and existence and even his actions are of God. This does not mean that man has God&#8217;s life and lives, exists, and acts in God as do the believers in Christ, who are born of God, possess His life and nature, and live, exist, and act in God&#8217;s person.<p>All men are God&#8217;s offspring in the sense that Adam was called a son of God. Because God is the Creator, the source, of all men, He is the Father of them all (Mal. 2:10) in a natural sense, not in the spiritual sense, as He is the Father of all the believers (Gal. 4:6), who are regenerated by Him in their spirit (1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:5-6).<h2 class=head2>6. The One Whom No One Knows Except the Son and He to Whom the Son Reveals Him</h2><p>In Matthew 11:27c the Lord Jesus says that no one knows &#8220;the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;know&#8221; here indicates full knowledge, not mere objective acquaintance. Concerning the Son, only the Father has such knowledge; and concerning the Father, only the Son has such knowledge. Hence, to know the Father requires the Son&#8217;s revelation (John 17:6, 26). The Greek word rendered &#8220;wills&#8221; in Matthew 11:27 means to deliberately exercise the will through counsel.<p>In John 17:6 the Lord Jesus said to the Father, &#8220;I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world.&#8221; The name referred to here is the very name Father. The names God and Jehovah were adequately revealed to man in the Old Testament, but not the name Father, though it is slightly mentioned in Isaiah 9:6; 63:16; and 64:8. In Old Testament times God&#8217;s people mainly knew that God was Elohim, that is, God, and Jehovah, that is, the ever-existing One, but they knew very little about the title Father. The Son came and worked in the Father&#8217;s name (John 5:43; 10:25) to manifest the Father to the men whom the Father gave Him and to make the Father&#8217;s name known to them (John 17:26), the name which reveals the Father as the source of life (John 5:26), for the propagation and multiplication of life, of whom many sons are born (John 1:12-13) for His expression. Hence, the Father&#8217;s name, revealed by the Son, is very much related to the divine life. We can know the Father in the way of the divine life only through the Son&#8217;s unveiling of Him.<h2 class=head2>7. The Source of All</h2><p>As the Father of all families both in the heavens and on earth (Eph. 3:14-15), God is the source of all. All things are out of Him. Romans 11:36 says, &#8220;Out of Him and through Him and to Him are all things.&#8221; In the past, all things were out of Him; in the present, all things are through Him; and in the future, all things will be to Him. All things came into being out of God in the past, all things exist through Him in the present, and all things will be to Him in the future. All things are of Him, through Him, and for Him.<p>First Corinthians 8:6 says, &#8220;There is one God, the Father, of whom are all things.&#8221; This verse tells us again that God who is the Father is the source of all things. Here the Father refers not to God as the Father of the regenerated believers but to Him as the source of all things. This is proved by the words &#8220;of whom are all things.&#8221; All things are out of God as the source; hence, God is called the Father. Not only is He the believers&#8217; Father in regeneration, but He is the Father of all created things in creation, for all things have come out of Him.<p>Hebrews 2:10 tells us that God, who is leading many sons into glory, is the One &#8220;for whom are all things and through whom are all things.&#8221; In order to lead many sons into glory, God needs the heavens, the earth, and all things. All things which God created for the accomplishment of His purpose exist through Him in the present, and will be for Him in the future. It is God who maintains all things in the universe so that they may serve His purpose.<h2 class=head2>8. The Father of Spirits</h2><p>In Hebrews 12:9 God is called the Father of spirits: &#8220;Furthermore, we have had the fathers of our flesh as discipliners and we respected them; shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?&#8221; Here &#8220;the Father of spirits&#8221; is contrasted with &#8220;the fathers of our flesh.&#8221; In natural birth, we were born of our father in our flesh. Hence, they are the fathers of our flesh. In regeneration we are born of God (John 1:13) in our spirit (John 3:6). Hence, He is the Father of our spirits.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider further aspects of God&#8217;s person revealed in the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>9. The Head of Christ</h2><p>First Corinthians 11:3 says, &#8220;I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.&#8221; Christ is God&#8217;s anointed One, appointed by God. Hence, He is under God, and God as the Originator is His Head. This refers to the relationship between Christ and God in the divine government. In the universe, especially in God&#8217;s governmental administration, there is order. God is the Head over Christ, Christ is the Head over every man, and man is the head over the woman.<h2 class=head2>10. The Savior of All</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 1:1 Paul says, &#8220;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope.&#8221; God our Savior (1 Tim. 4:10; Titus 2:13) and our Savior God (1 Tim. 2:3; Titus 1:3; 2:10; 3:4) are titles particularly ascribed to God in the three books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, books that take God&#8217;s salvation as a strong base for the teachings concerning God&#8217;s New Testament economy (1 Tim. 1:15-16; 2:4-6; 2 Tim. 1:9-10; 2:10; 3:15; Titus 2:14; 3:5-7). It was according to the command of such a saving God, a Savior God, not according to the command of the law-giving God, a demanding God, that Paul became an apostle.<p>First Timothy 2:3 says, &#8220;This is good and acceptable in the sight of our Savior God.&#8221; In 1 Timothy Paul emphasizes the Savior God. Hence, in this verse he speaks not of the God of grace nor of the God of mercy, but of the Savior God, the God who saves us. In 1 Timothy 4:10 Paul goes on to speak of &#8220;the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.&#8221;<p>In Titus 1:3 Paul again speaks of &#8220;the command of our Savior God.&#8221; Then in Titus 2:10 he speaks concerning &#8220;the teachings of our Savior God.&#8221; Our Savior is not only Christ, but God Triune embodied in Christ, as indicated in Titus 2:13. Our Savior God desires not only to save us, but also to teach us the full knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 2:4). Hence, there is the teaching of our Savior God, which may be adorned, beautified, by the transformed character of the most vile persons saved by His grace.<p>In Titus 3:4 Paul tells us that &#8220;the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared.&#8221; It is the kindness and love of our Savior God that has saved us and made us different from others.<p>Jude 25 also speaks of God our Savior: &#8220;To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority before all time, and now, and unto all eternity. Amen.&#8221; Here we see that the only God is our Savior. To such a Savior may there be glory, majesty, might, and authority throughout all ages. Glory is the expression and splendor; majesty, the greatness in honor; might, the strength in power; and authority, the power in ruling.<h2 class=head2>11. Abba Father of the Believers</h2><p>In His person God is Abba Father of the believers. &#8220;Abba&#8221; is an Aramaic word, thus a Hebrew word, and &#8220;Father&#8221; is the translation of the Greek word pater. Such a term was first used by the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane while praying to the Father (Mark 14:36). The combination of the Hebrew title with the Greek expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father. Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father.<p>The Father is the source of life. This is indicated by the Lord&#8217;s word in John 5:26: &#8220;The Father has life in Himself.&#8221; In the New Testament, especially in the Gospel of John, the Father denotes the source of life. Even in a human family the father is the source of the life of that family. As the father of a family is the very source and origin of life, so the name Father reveals the Father as the source of life.<p>The Father, the source of life, is for propagation and multiplication of life. The Father&#8217;s life is for propagation and multiplication. Of the Father, who is the source of life, and who is for the propagation and multiplication of life, many sons are born for His expression (John 1:12-13).<p>The name Father is very much related to the divine life. Without having the divine life, God could not be the Father. How is it possible for a man to be a father? It is possible only by life. A father is a producer. A father produces not by manufacturing but by begetting. A father has a begetting life. Likewise, the Father has begotten us through His life. Whenever we call Him Father, we need to understand that this title is realized by the divine life. Without His life, the name Father is merely an empty term, without content or reality.<p>What is the revelation behind the name Father? Father is the name for the relationship of life. When I say, &#8220;Abba Father,&#8221; I indicate that I have His life and that I was born of Him. In the New Testament God is revealed as the Father who regenerates many sons. He is the source of life;<p>hence, He is the Father. It is His intention to bring forth many sons by regenerating them with His life. In the book of Matthew the Lord taught His disciples to call God Father, saying, &#8220;Our Father who is in the heavens&#8221; (6:9). Whenever we call God our Father, we should realize that He is our genuine Father. He is not our father-in-law, and we are not His adopted children. Our Father is our Father in life, our genuine Father. We call Him Father because we were born of Him and have His life.<p>When the two terms &#8220;Abba&#8221; and &#8220;Father&#8221; are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate. &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; is sweetness intensified. Therefore, the sense we have when calling in this way is very sweet and intimate.<p>Although the Spirit of sonship has come into our spirit, the Spirit cries in our hearts, &#8220;Abba, Father.&#8221; This indicates that our relationship with our Father in the sonship is sweet and intimate. For example, when a son calls his father &#8220;daddy,&#8221; there may be a sweet and intimate sense deep within him. However, the sense is not the same if he tries to say the same thing to his father-in-law. The reason is that with the father-in-law there is no relationship in life. How sweet it is when little children, enjoying a relationship in life with their fathers, tenderly say, &#8220;daddy.&#8221; In like manner, how tender and sweet it is to call God, &#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221; Such an intimate calling involves our heart as well as our spirit. The Spirit of sonship in our spirit cries, &#8220;Abba, Father,&#8221; from our heart. This proves that we have a genuine, bona fide relationship in life with our Father. We are His real sons, His genuine sons, and He is our genuine Father.<h2 class=head2>12. The Only God</h2><p>In the New Testament God is clearly revealed as being the only God. First Timothy 1:17 says, &#8220;Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages, Amen!&#8221; In Romans 16:27 Paul declares, &#8220;To the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever and ever! Amen.&#8221; Jude 25 says that God our Savior is the only God. Furthermore, in 1 Corinthians 8:4 and 6 Paul says that &#8220;there is no God but one&#8221; and that &#8220;to us there is one God, the Father.&#8221; Our God is uniquely one; He is utterly distinct from the many false gods.<h2 class=head2>13. The Invisible God</h2><p>Colossians 1:15 speaks of the invisible God. Although God is invisible, the Son of His love (Col. 1:13), &#8220;the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance&#8221; (Heb. 1:3), is His image, expressing what He is.<p>Other verses that tell us that God is invisible are 1 Timothy 1:17; 6:16; Hebrews 11:27; and I John 4:12. John 1:18 says, &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&#8221; According to chapter one of the Gospel of John, although God is invisible, the Father&#8217;s only begotten Son has declared God by the Word, life, light, grace, and reality. The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized. The invisible God is fully declared in the Son through these five things.<h2 class=head2>14. The Living God</h2><p>A number of verses in the New Testament reveal that God is the living God. In Matthew 16:16 the Lord Jesus is called the Son of the living God. In this verse the living God is in contrast to dead religion. The living God, who is embodied in Christ, has nothing to do with dead religion.<p>In 1 Timothy 3:15 we see that the church, the house of God, is the church of the living God. In speaking of the church as the house of God, Paul specifically refers to God as the living God. The living God who lives in the church must be subjective to the church rather than merely objective. An idol in a heathen temple is lifeless. The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living. Because God is living, the church is also living in Him, by Him, and with Him. A living God and a living church live, move, and work together. The living church is the house and the household of the living God.<p>In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul refers not merely to God but to the living God. God is living, and now He lives, dwells, moves, and works in the church. Therefore, the church is the church of the living God.<p>In Hebrews 3:12 there is a warning with respect to the living God: &#8220;Beware, brothers, lest there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God.&#8221; Our God is the living God. Unbelief is evil because it insults Him as the living One.<p>Regarding the living God, Hebrews 9:14 says, &#8220;How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself spotless to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.&#8221; Hebrews is not a book which teaches religion, but a book which reveals the living God. If we would have contact with this living God, we need to exercise our spirit (Heb. 4:12) and have a blood-purified conscience. The blood of Christ purifies our conscience to serve the living God.<p>Hebrews 9:14 speaks of dead works and of the living God. Before we were regenerated we were dead in trespasses and sins (Eph. 2:1; Col. 2:13). Therefore, whatever we did, bad or good, was dead works before the living God. But now we may serve the living God with a conscience purified by the blood of Christ.<p>Hebrews 10:31 says, &#8220;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&#8221; Hebrews 10 charges the Hebrew believers to come forward according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy and not to drift back to the old Judaism. Then it warns them that if they would fall away from God&#8217;s New Testament way, they will be dealt with by God who is living. Since He is living He will judge His people.<p>Hebrews 12:22 speaks of the city of the living God. As a book dealing with the dead Judaism, Hebrews reveals God as the living God from different angles. Here it tells us that the New Testament believers have come to the city of the living God, which is the heavenly Jerusalem, in contrast with the earthly Jerusalem, which has been given up by God in His New Testament economy (Matt. 23:37-38). Since God is living in every way, the Hebrew believers should remain only in the things which fit in with the living God.<h2 class=head2>15. The Immortal One Dwelling in Unapproachable Light</h2><p>God is also the immortal One dwelling in unapproachable light. Concerning this, 1 Timothy 6:16 says, &#8220;Who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see, to whom be honor and eternal might. Amen.&#8221; Although the Father dwells in unapproachable light, we not only can approach Him in Christ, but we also can have fellowship with Him. We can approach the Father because we are no longer in darkness. He is in the light, and we are in the light also (1 John 1:5, 7). Furthermore, this immortal One who dwells in unapproachable light is being dispensed into us.<h2 class=head2>16. A Consuming Fire in His Holiness and Severity</h2><p>Hebrews 12:29 says, &#8220;Our God is also a consuming fire.&#8221; He is a consuming fire in His holiness and severity. God is holy; holiness is His nature. Whatever does not correspond to His holy nature He, as the consuming fire, will consume. Thus He is severe, expressing His holiness in severity. If the Hebrew believers, to whom the Epistle of Hebrews was addressed, would have turned aside to Judaism, which was common, unholy, in the sight of God, it would have made them unholy, and the holy God as the consuming fire would have consumed them.<p>God is not only righteous but also holy. To satisfy God&#8217;s righteousness we need to be justified through the redemption of Christ. To meet the demands of His holiness we need to be sanctified, to be made holy, by the heavenly, present, and living Christ. Romans emphasizes the matter of justification (Rom. 3:24) for God&#8217;s righteousness (Rom. 3:25-26), whereas Hebrews emphasizes the matter of sanctification (Heb. 2:11; 10:10, 14, 29; 13:12) for God&#8217;s holiness (Heb. 12:14). For this it was necessary for the Hebrew believers to separate themselves from unholy Judaism unto the holy God who has fully expressed Himself in the Son under the New Testament. Otherwise, they would defile themselves with their old profane religion and suffer the holy God as a consuming fire.<h2 class=head2>17. The Almighty</h2><p>A number of verses tell us that God is the almighty One (Rev. 1:8; 4:8; 19:6, 15; 2 Cor. 6:18). The book of Revelation unveils God as the Almighty. In the Hebrew language the title &#8220;God&#8221; means the mighty One, the One who is mighty, powerful. But in Revelation we see that God is not only mighty but also almighty. As the almighty One, He is powerful in every way, in every aspect, in everything, and with everyone.<h2 class=head2>18. The Only True God</h2><p>In John 17:3 the Lord Jesus addresses the Father as &#8220;the only true God.&#8221; This indicates that only God is the reality, the truth. Anything that is without Him is not true, not a reality. The Lord came with God as the truth, the reality (John 1:14), to make our life real. In order that we may know this reality, the true God, the Lord has given us the eternal life. His word in John 17:2-3 implies that eternal life has the ability to know the true God. In order to know the true God, we need His divine life, the eternal life. Because as believers we have been born of His divine life, we are able to know Him as the true God. The life of the true God certainly is able to know the true God. Since we have the life of the true God, we have the ability to know the only true God.<p>First John 5:20 says, &#8220;We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.&#8221; In this verse &#8220;Him who is true&#8221; denotes the true God. To know Him who is true actually means to experience, enjoy, and possess the true God. We need the true God&#8217;s life, the eternal life, in order to experience, enjoy, and possess Him as the true One.<p>In 1 John 5:20 the expression &#8220;Him who is true&#8221; is used twice. A better translation would be &#8220;the true One.&#8221; To speak of God simply as God may be to speak in a rather objective way. However, the term &#8220;the true One&#8221; is subjective; it refers to God becoming subjective to us. The God who is objective becomes the true One in our life and experience subjectively. The true One is the reality. The Son of God has, through His incarnation, death and resurrection, given us an understanding so that we may know, that is, experience, enjoy, and possess, this divine reality. Now the God who was once merely objective to us has become our subjective reality.<p>The last part of 1 John 5:20 says, &#8220;This is the true God and eternal life.&#8221; The word &#8220;this&#8221; refers to the God who has come through incarnation and has given us the ability to know Him subjectively as the true One, making us one with Him organically in His Son Jesus Christ. All this is the true God and eternal life to us. All that this true God is to us is eternal life to us so that we may partake of and enjoy Him as everything to our regenerated being.<h2 class=head2>19. The Only Sovereign</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 6:15 Paul, when he was under Caesar&#8217;s rule, tells us that God is the only Sovereign, indicating that God is the only Ruler, the only Potentate, who has the most absolute and the highest authority and power. Hence, He is the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords. Caesar was under Him. Undoubtedly the apostle who was imprisoned under Caesar was encouraged by knowing God as such a Sovereign.<h2 class=head2>20. The Sovereign Lord, Holy and True</h2><p>In Revelation 6:10 the martyred saints called God the &#8220;sovereign Lord, holy and true.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;sovereign Lord&#8221; is despotes, denoting a slave&#8217;s master who has absolute sovereign power over the slave, as in Acts 4:24; Luke 2:29; Jude 4; 1 Timothy 6:1-2. The saints who suffered martyrdom for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus recognized the very God, whom they served and who allowed them to be martyred, as such a sovereign Master, who is holy (distinct from all things) and true (truthful) in His nature and character and has made them holy (sanctified, separated) and true (truthful, faithful) to Him (cf. Rev. 3:7 and note 3).<h2 class=head2>21. The King of the Ages</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 1:17 Paul speaks of God as the King of the ages. Here &#8220;ages&#8221; actually means eternity. This word needs to be understood in relation to the decline of the church. When Paul was in prison, the churches began to decline, and the situation was very disappointing. Many<p>were discouraged. Even some of Paul&#8217;s co-workers left him. But he had a strong faith with an absolute assurance that the very God in whom he believed, the One who had entrusted him with the gospel of glory, is the King of the ages, the One with the absolute authority for eternity, who never changes. No earthly king can be called the King of the ages. Caesar was a temporary ruler, but how different is our God! The God whom Paul served truly is the King of the ages, the King of eternity. The One whom we serve and who is being dispensed into us is the King of the ages.<h2 class=head2>22. The King of Kings and the Lord of Lords</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 6:15 Paul also tells us that God is &#8220;the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords,&#8221; indicating that God is the highest Authority in the entire universe. Hence, He is the only Sovereign in whom the apostle trusted.<h2 class=head2>23. The Incorruptible</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 1:17 we see that as the King of the ages, God is the incorruptible. He never changes in His nature, power, and any kind of His attributes; He always remains the same. Everything except Him is corruptible. The church may decline, deteriorate, and become degraded, but God is incorruptible.<h2 class=head2>24. The Eternal God</h2><p>Romans 16:25 to 26 tells us that God, who has given the command to make the hidden mystery known to all the nations, is eternal. This indicates that God remains immutable, not subject to any change due to any kind of environments and circumstances. Since the God who gives this command is eternal, remaining unchangeable forever, so is this command.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>In this message we shall conclude our study of the aspects of God&#8217;s person revealed in the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>25. The One Who Is, Who Was, and Who Is Coming</h2><p>Twice in the book of Revelation we are told that God is the One who is, who was, and who is coming. This is the meaning of the name Jehovah. In Hebrew Jehovah means &#8220;I am that I am.&#8221; His being the I Am signifies that He is the One who exists from eternity to eternity. This title is composed basically of the verb &#8220;to be.&#8221; Apart from God, Jehovah, all else is nothing. He is the only One who is, the only One who has the reality of being. The verb &#8220;to be&#8221; should not be applied absolutely to anyone or anything except Him. He is the only self-existent and ever-existent being. In the universe all things are nothing. Only God is the One who is, who was, and who is coming. In the past He was, in the present He is, and in the future He will be.<p>Hebrews 11:6 says that &#8220;he who comes forward to God must believe that He is.&#8221; According to this verse, God is, and we must believe that He is. God is, but we are not and all things are not either. As the One who is, who was, and who is coming, God is the self-existing One and the ever-existing One, the One whose being depends on nothing apart from Himself and the One who exists eternally, having neither beginning nor ending. Before anything else came into existence, God was. After so many things have passed out of existence, God will still be. God was, God is, and God will be.<p>As the self-existing One and ever-existing One, God is the reality of every positive thing. The Gospel of John reveals that He is all we need: life, light, food, drink, the pasture, the way, and everything. Therefore, this title of God indicates not only that He exists eternally but also that, in a positive sense, He is everything. Do you need life? God is life. Do you want light? God is light. Do you desire holiness? God is holiness. God exists from eternity to eternity, and He is everything. This is our God.<p>It is necessary that we know God as the One who is, who was, and who is coming. Heaven and earth may pass away, but God is. Are you discouraged by your weakness? One day your weaknesses will cease to exist, but God will still be. Do not believe in anything other than God. Do not believe either in your weakness or in your strength, for both your weakness and your strength will pass away. However, when they are gone, God will continue to be the One who is. Oh, we must believe in Him as the ever-existing One! If we know God as the One who is, who was, and who will be, we shall be greatly encouraged, especially during difficult times.<h2 class=head2>26. The Alpha and the Omega</h2><p>God is also the Alpha and the Omega (Rev. 1:8; 21:6). The eternal and almighty God is the Alpha, the beginning for the origination, and the Omega, the ending for the completion of His eternal purpose. In the book of Genesis He was the Alpha, and in the book of Revelation He is the Omega. Whatever He has originated He will complete. Governmentally He continues His universal operation, which He originated from eternity and will bring to completion.<p>Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. The fact that God is the Alpha and the Omega indicates that He is the entire &#8220;alphabet&#8221; needed for composing the story of the universe. He is also the &#8220;letters&#8221; used in writing the history of our personal lives. How meaningful it is that our God is the Alpha and the Omega!<h2 class=head2>27. The Judge of All</h2><p>According to Hebrews 12:23, God is the Judge of all. In Hebrews 12:22-24 is a list of the eight positive items to which the New Testament believers have come. The fifth of the eight items is God the Judge of all. God is the Creator and the Lord, the Owner, of all things, and He is just in all things and with all things. As such a God He must keep all things right in His eyes. He must justify the right and condemn the wrong. Hence, He is the Judge of all. In the list of the eight positive items, the item next to God the Judge of all is the spirits of just men who had been made perfect. These just men were the Old Testament saints who had been made perfect, that is, rectified, by God as the Judge of all who rectifies the wrongdoings of His chosen people to make them perfect. Hebrews is a book dealing with the Hebrew believers who were wrong both in their concept concerning God&#8217;s New Testament economy and in their act to drift back to the old Judaism. For this, God will judge them (Heb. 10:26-31), to rectify their error that eventually they might be made perfect by God as the Judge of all. Thus they were told in chapter twelve that the very God to whom they had come is the Judge of all. This should have warned them to rectify themselves of their error that they would not need God as the Judge of all to judge them that they might fit in with His justice.<h2 class=head2>28. The Lord</h2><p>A number of verses in the New Testament indicate that God is the Lord (Matt. 1:20, 22; Acts 3:19-20; Rev. 1:8). God, the almighty One, is the Lord. His being the Lord means that He is the Owner of the universe. We may say that He is the &#8220;Landlord&#8221; of the whole universe. He is the Ruler, the Authority. What we or others say means nothing, but what God says means everything because He is the Lord. When He says, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; it means yes, and when He says, &#8220;No,&#8221; it means no. God is the Lord, the Owner, the Authority.<h2 class=head2>29. The Architect and Maker of the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Hebrews 11:10 indicates that God is the Architect and the Maker of the New Jerusalem. Referring to Abraham, this verse tells us, &#8220;He waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Maker is God.&#8221; This is &#8220;the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem&#8221; (Heb. 12:22), &#8220;the Jerusalem above&#8221; (Gal. 4:26), &#8220;the holy city, New Jerusalem&#8221; (Rev. 21:2; 3:12), which God has prepared for His people (Heb. 11:16), and the tabernacle of God in which God will dwell with men for eternity (Rev. 21:3). As the patriarchs waited for this city, so we also seek it (Heb. 13:14).<p>The Greek word rendered &#8220;Architect&#8221; in Hebrews 11:10 is technites, an artificer, one who does a thing by rules of art; hence, an architect. The Greek word translated &#8220;Maker&#8221; is demiourgos and literally means one who works for the people. In general usage it came to denote a builder or maker. In Hebrews 11:10 both technites and demiourgos are used of God. The former speaks of God as the Architect, the Designer of the New Jerusalem; the latter, as the actual Maker or Framer of the city.<p>Some translations of Hebrews 11:10 obscure the fact that God is an Architect, the Architect of the New Jerusalem. Consider the New Jerusalem as it is revealed in the New Testament. Who other than God is capable of designing such a city? Only God as the supreme Architect is able to design it. The New Jerusalem was designed by the eternal, divine Architect.<h2 class=head1>B. IN PARABLES AND SIGNS</h2><h2 class=head2>1. The Householder in the Parable of the Evil Husbandmen</h2><p>The person of God is also revealed in the parables of the New Testament. In the parable of the evil husbandman (Matt. 21:33-46) God is the Householder. Concerning this, Matthew 21:33 says, &#8220;There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and leased it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.&#8221; The householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem (Isa. 5:1), and the husbandmen are the leaders of the Israelites (Matt. 21:34). In this parable we see that as the Householder God sent His slaves, the prophets. Later, the Householder sent His Son, the Lord Jesus. Eventually, the Householder destroyed the evil husbandmen and leased the vineyard to other husbandmen. This was fulfilled when Titus and his army destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. The &#8220;other husbandmen&#8221; in this parable were the apostles, who took care of the church, the kingdom of God (Matt. 21:41) in the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>2. The King in the Parable of the Marriage Feast</h2><p>God is the King in the parable of the marriage feast (Matt. 22:1-14). Concerning this, Matthew 22:2 says, &#8220;The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a marriage feast for his son.&#8221; The &#8220;king&#8221; here is God, and the &#8220;son&#8221; is Christ. First, according to this parable, God sent &#8220;his slaves,&#8221; the first group of the New Testament apostles, to call those who were invited to the marriage feast (v. 3). Later He sent &#8220;other slaves,&#8221; the apostles sent later by the Lord (v. 4). In verses 6 and 7 we see that the King, angry with those who mistreated His slaves and killed them, &#8220;sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.&#8221; These were the Roman troops under Titus which destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70.<h2 class=head2>3. The Friend in the Parable of Persisting Prayer</h2><p>Luke 11:5-8 speaks of a parable illustrating the persisting prayer. In this parable God to whom we pray is likened to our friend, and we are likened to His friend, indicating that in prayer God is intimate to us and we are intimate to Him in a mutual love. This picture of intimacy between friends annuls the religious concept of &#8220;reverence&#8221; in our prayer to God.<h2 class=head2>4. The Lord in the Parable of the Unfruitful Fig Tree</h2><p>In Luke 13:6-9 we have the parable of the unfruitful fig tree. In this parable God is the Lord (v. 8). This parable indicates that God as the owner of the fig tree planted in His vineyard came in the Son to the Jewish people as a fig tree planted in God&#8217;s promised land as the vineyard to seek fruit from them. He had been seeking for three years (v. 7), and He did not find any. He wanted to cut them down, but the Son as the vinedresser prayed for them that God the Father would tolerate them until He died for them (dug the ground around the fig tree-v. 8) and gave them fertilizer (threw on manure), hoping that they would then repent and produce fruit. Otherwise, they would be cut down. The passages in Luke 11:29-32 and 42-52, unveiling the Jewish people as an evil generation, confirm this interpretation.<p>In this parable the Jewish people are regarded by God as a fig tree. When God did not find fruit on this tree, He was thinking to cut it down. But the vinedresser, the Lord Jesus, begged the Father not to do this until, by means of His death and resurrection, He dug around the tree and threw on manure. Then if the tree still did not bring forth fruit, it could be cut down. This is actually what took place. Because the Jews did not repent, even after the Lord Jesus died and resurrected and the Spirit came, the &#8220;fig tree&#8221; was &#8220;cut down.&#8221; This happened in A.D. 70 when Titus brought his Roman army to Jerusalem and destroyed it. That destruction of Jerusalem was the cutting down of the fig tree.<h2 class=head2>5. The Master of the House in the Parable of a Great Dinner</h2><p>In Luke 14:15-24 God is &#8220;the master of the house&#8221; (v. 21) in the parable of the great dinner. This great dinner is different from the marriage feast in Matthew 22:2-14. That marriage feast was for the reward of the kingdom. This great dinner is for God&#8217;s full salvation. God, as the &#8220;certain man&#8221; (Luke 14:16), has prepared His full salvation as a great dinner, and He sent the first apostles as His slaves to invite the Jews (vv. 16-17). But because they were occupied by their riches, such as land, cattle, or a wife, they refused His invitation (vv. 18-20). Then God sent the apostles to invite the street people-the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame. Because of their poverty and misery, they received God&#8217;s invitation (vv. 21-22a). Yet God&#8217;s salvation still had room for more. Therefore, He sent His slaves to go out further into the Gentile world, as &#8220;the roads and hedges,&#8221; to compel the Gentiles to come in and fill up the room of His salvation (vv. 22b-23; Acts 13:46-48; Rom. 11:25).<h2 class=head2>6. The Loving and Receiving Father in the Parable of the Prodigal Son</h2><p>In the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32) God is revealed as the loving and receiving father (vv. 20-24). The prodigal son gathered everything he received from his father and traveled into a distant country where he squandered his estate, living dissolutely (v. 13). After he had spent all of what he took from the father and had fallen into a severe famine (v. 14), he became aware of his condition and made a resolution to go back to his father (vv. 17-18). &#8220;While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion; and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately&#8221; (v. 20). The father&#8217;s seeing the son did not happen by chance. Rather, the father went out of the house to look for his prodigal&#8217;s return. When the father saw his son, he ran to him and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately. This indicates that God the Father runs to receive a returning sinner. What eagerness this shows! The father&#8217;s falling on his son&#8217;s neck and kissing him affectionately shows a warm and loving reception. The father then said to his slaves, &#8220;Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet; and bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry; because this son of mine was dead and lives again, was lost and was found!&#8221; (Luke 15:22-24a).<h2 class=head2>7. The Unrighteous Judge in the Parable of Persisting Prayer</h2><p>In the parable concerning persisting prayer in Luke 18:1-8 the unrighteous judge refers to the righteous God (vv. 6-7). The &#8220;widow&#8221; in verse 3 signifies the believers. In a sense, the believers in Christ are a widow in the present age because their husband Christ (2 Cor. 11:2) is absent from them. The believers in Christ also have an opponent, Satan the Devil, concerning whom we need God&#8217;s avenging. We ought to pray persistently for this avenging and not lose heart. Verse 8 indicates that God&#8217;s avenging of our enemy will be at the Savior&#8217;s coming back (2 Thes. 2:6-9).<p>This parable indicates the suffering we have from our opponent during the Lord&#8217;s apparent absence. During His apparent absence, we are a widow and our opposer is troubling us all the time. While our opposer is persecuting us, it seems that our God is not righteous, for He allows His children to be unrighteously persecuted. For example, John the Baptist was beheaded, Peter was martyred, Paul was imprisoned, and John was exiled. Throughout the centuries thousands upon thousands of faithful followers of the Lord Jesus have suffered unrighteous persecution. Even today we are still undergoing unrighteous mistreatment. Our God seems to be unrighteous, since He does not come in to judge and vindicate. When our Husband is apparently absent and we are left on earth as a widow, temporarily our God seems to be an unrighteous judge. Although He appears to be unrighteous, we still must appeal to Him, pray persistently, and bother Him again and again.<p>On the one hand, this parable indicates that the Judge is sovereign. This means that whether or not He judges is up to Him. Seemingly without reason, He may either listen to the widow or not listen to her. This parable reveals that God is the sovereign Lord and that He judges whenever He chooses. On the other hand, this parable indicates that we need to bother the Lord by praying persistently. The significance of this parable is profound. We all need to know God as He is revealed here.<h2 class=head2>8. A Jasper Stone and a Sardius</h2><p>This item and the next two are all figures in the book of Revelation to portray what God is. In the book of Revelation God makes His revelation known to us &#8220;by signs&#8221; (Rev. 1:1), that is, by symbols with spiritual significance. John received a revelation so divine, mysterious, and profound in many respects that no human words can explain them adequately. Thus they are made known by signs. Revelation 4:2 and 3 say, &#8220;There was a throne set in heaven, and One sitting upon the throne, and He who was sitting was like in appearance to a jasper stone and a sardius.&#8221; According to Revelation 21:11, jasper is &#8220;a most precious stone...clear as crystal.&#8221; Its color must be dark green, which signifies life in its richness. Jasper here, as Revelation 21:11 indicates, signifies God&#8217;s communicable glory in His rich life (John 17:22, 2). It is the appearance of God, which will also be the appearance of the holy city, New Jerusalem. The city&#8217;s wall and its first foundation are built with it (Rev. 21:18-19).<p>Sardius is a most precious stone in the color of red, which signifies redemption. Whereas jasper indicates God as the God of glory in His rich life, sardius signifies God as the God of redemption. On the breastplate of the high priest in the Old Testament, the first stone was sardius and the last jasper (Exo. 28:17, 20). This signifies that God&#8217;s redeemed people have their beginning in God&#8217;s redemption and their consummation in God&#8217;s glorious appearance in life.<h2 class=head2>9. The Temple in the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Revelation 21:22 indicates that God is the temple in the New Jerusalem: &#8220;And I saw no temple in it, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.&#8221; The Greek word for temple in this verse, naos, does not denote the whole temple in a common way including the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place. Rather, it denotes the inner temple, the Holy of Holies. This inner temple is the Lord God, signifying that God will be the place in which we, His redeemed, dwell and serve Him. In the New Jerusalem we shall dwell in God. God Himself will be the dwelling place of all His serving ones.<h2 class=head2>10. The Light in the New Jerusalem</h2><p>In Revelation 21:23 we see that God is the light in the New Jerusalem: &#8220;And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&#8221; The temple of the city is God Himself, and the light is also God Himself. The Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light. Because this divine light will illumine the holy city, there will not be the need of natural light or man-made light. God Himself will be the light in the holy city.<p>In these messages we have considered many aspects of God&#8217;s person. We may have exhausted the New Testament in this matter. As we consider all the aspects of God&#8217;s person, we can see what kind of God is dispensing Himself into us.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS NATURE</h1><p>In the foregoing messages we covered many aspects of God&#8217;s person. In this message we shall go on to consider God&#8217;s nature.<h2 class=head1>A. PARTAKERS OF THE DIVINE NATURE</h2><p>Recently I read a letter written by the dean of a certain Bible college. That letter accused me of teaching heresy because I say, according to the New Testament, that the believers have God&#8217;s nature. Perhaps the one who made this false accusation is not familiar with 2 Peter 1:4, a verse that tells us that we are partakers of the divine nature. To partake of God&#8217;s nature is to enjoy it and to participate in it. We can testify that day by day we not only possess the divine nature but also enjoy it. As believers, we certainly have the divine nature within us. Certain sufferings and hardships we cannot bear by ourselves; however, we are able to bear them by the divine nature.<h2 class=head2>1. Enjoying What God Is</h2><p>We need to pay close attention to the matter of being partakers of the divine nature. 2 Peter 1:4 says, &#8220;Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises, that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.&#8221; Through the precious and exceedingly great promises given by God, we, the believers in Christ, who is our God and Savior, have become partakers of His divine nature in an organic union with Him. We have entered into this union through faith and baptism (John 3:15; Gal. 3:27; Matt. 28:19). The virtue of this divine nature carries us into God&#8217;s glory, into the full expression of the Triune God.<p>Through the &#8220;precious and exceedingly great promises&#8221; we may become partakers of the divine nature. We receive the divine life simply by believing, and the divine nature is the substance of the divine life. Although we received the divine life at the time we believed, the divine nature must be continually enjoyed by us. This enjoyment requires the grace of God. The more we enjoy the divine nature, the more we have His virtue, and the more we are brought into His glory.<p>To partake of the divine nature is to enjoy what God is. In order that we may enjoy all that He is, God will do many things for us according to His precious and exceedingly great promises. This will enable us to enjoy His nature, what He is. One of His precious and exceedingly great promises is that His grace is sufficient for us (2 Cor. 12:9). God&#8217;s sufficient grace will work within us day by day so that we may enjoy His nature.<p>The divine nature refers to the riches of what God is. Whatever God is, is in His nature. Therefore, when we partake of the divine nature, we partake of the divine riches. Having received the divine life at the time of our regeneration, we must go on to enjoy what God is in His nature.<p>This enjoyment is both for the present and for eternity. For eternity we shall continue to partake of the divine nature. This is illustrated by the tree of life and the river of water of life in Revelation 22:1 and 2. Out from the throne of God and the Lamb the river of life flows. This signifies God flowing out to be the enjoyment of His redeemed. That flowing river will saturate the entire city of New Jerusalem, and the tree of life that grows in and along the river will supply the redeemed with God as their life supply. This is a picture of what it means to partake of the divine nature.<h2 class=head2>2. Constituted of God&#8217;s Nature</h2><p>Just as we are constituted physically of the food we eat, so we, believers in Christ, should be constituted of the God of which we partake. This should be our experience day by day. If we enjoy God and partake of Him, we shall be constituted of Him. We shall be thoroughly constituted of God&#8217;s nature.<p>We all are constituted physically of the food we eat. For example, someone may eat so much fish and be constituted of fish to such an extent that he even smells of fish. In like manner, we may become so constituted of God that we express God in all that we are and do. We may even give off a divine &#8220;fragrance.&#8221; If we partake of God day by day, eventually we shall partake of Him unconsciously. When others contact us, they will see in us the expression of the Triune God. All the saints need to be saturated with the nature of God. The more we are saturated with God, the more we shall express Him.<p>To be a partaker of the divine nature is to be a partaker of the elements, the ingredients, of God&#8217;s being. When we partake of God, the aspects of what God is become our enjoyment. This is to enjoy the constituents of the divine nature.<h2 class=head2>3. A Cycle of Escaping and Partaking</h2><p>In 2 Peter 1:4 there is a condition for becoming partakers of the divine nature: It is &#8220;having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.&#8221; The more we escape this corruption, the more we shall enjoy the nature of God. Likewise, the more we partake of the divine nature, the more we shall escape the corruption that is in the world by lust. This is a cycle, a cycle of escaping and partaking and of partaking and escaping. If this cycle of partaking and escaping works within us in a strong, rapid way, it will be difficult for us to take in any of the corruption of the world. The divine nature will strengthen us to stay away from corruption. Then the more we stay away from the corruption of the world, the more we shall enjoy the riches of the divine nature. This is the experience of God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head2>4. A Continual Enjoyment</h2><p>To have eternal life is a matter once for all, but to partake of the divine nature is a continual matter. Although we have the divine life once for all, we cannot enjoy the divine nature once for all. During the course of our Christian life on earth, and even in eternity, we shall still be partaking of the divine nature.<p>The divine nature denotes what God is. We may again use eating food as an illustration of partaking of the divine nature. When we eat chicken, for example, we partake of the chicken nature. What the chicken is becomes our nourishment. When we eat chicken, we are actually eating the chicken nature, which includes various nourishing elements. These elements, or ingredients, are the constituents of the chicken nature. The principle is the same with the divine nature. Through God&#8217;s promises we are partaking of God&#8217;s nature with all the divine ingredients. Just as we do not eat food once for all, so we do not partake of the divine nature once for all. For eternity, as portrayed by the tree of life and the river of water of life in Revelation 22, we shall be partaking of the divine nature.<h2 class=head2>5. Born of God to Have the Divine Life and Nature</h2><p>We have seen that the divine nature denotes what God is, that is, the constituents of God&#8217;s being. Because we are children of God born of Him, we possess God&#8217;s life and also His nature for our enjoyment. Because I have proclaimed this truth according to the Bible, some have condemned me and falsely accused me of teaching deification. They say that I am deifying myself and teaching that the church is God and should be worshipped as a part of God. We utterly repudiate this false accusation! A child born of American parents will certainly be American. Then what about those who have been born of God? Through our new birth, regeneration, we have been born of God, and we are God&#8217;s children. Because we have been born of God, in life and in nature we are the same as God. In this sense, those who are born of God are divine. But we definitely do not participate in the Godhead, and we certainly do not become an object of worship. We have God&#8217;s life and nature, but we do not become part of the Godhead.<p>Certain early church fathers taught concerning the deification of the believers. But they did not teach that the believers attained to the Godhead, or that they would ever be worshipped as God. Rather, they meant that Christians, those who have been regenerated of God, have God&#8217;s life and nature. We, the regenerated ones, are the same as God in life and nature, but we are not the same as God in position in the Godhead. Concerning this, we need to be very careful. It would be heretical to teach deification in the sense of claiming that believers attain to the Godhead. But it is according to the Scriptures to teach that because we have been born of God, we possess the divine life and the divine nature and that, in these aspects, we have become the same as God. We definitely cannot participate in the Godhead, or have the position to be worshipped by others as God. Nevertheless, through regeneration we have God&#8217;s life and nature.<p>We need to come back to the pure Word of God and to tell others that whoever believes in the Son of God is born of God and has the right, the authority, to become a child of God (John 1:12-13). As such, he has the right to partake of, to enjoy, the nature of God. Therefore, we have God&#8217;s life, we are enjoying God&#8217;s nature, and we have the position of God&#8217;s children. But we definitely do not have the position of the Godhead, the position to be worshipped by others as God. Praise the Lord that we have the position, the ability, and the provision to become partakers of the divine nature! Day by day we should partake of God&#8217;s nature and enjoy what He is, that is, enjoy the constituents of God&#8217;s rich being.<h2 class=head1>B. SPIRIT, LOVE, AND LIGHT</h2><p>What is God&#8217;s nature? According to the New Testament God is Spirit (John 4:24), love (1 John 4:8, 16), and light (1 John 1:5). The expressions, &#8220;God is Spirit,&#8221; &#8220;God is love,&#8221; and &#8220;God is light,&#8221; are not used in a metaphoric sense, but in a predicative sense. These expressions denote and describe the nature of God.<p>In His nature God is Spirit, love, and light. Spirit denotes the nature of God&#8217;s person; love, the nature of God&#8217;s essence; and light, the nature of God&#8217;s expression. Both love and light are related to God as life, which life is of the Spirit (Rom. 8:2). God, Spirit, and life are actually one. God is Spirit, and Spirit is life. Within such a life are love and light. When this divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when this divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth.<p>The Gospel of John reveals that the Lord Jesus has brought grace and truth to us (John 1:14, 17) so that we may have the divine life (John 3:14-16), whereas the Epistle of 1 John unveils that the fellowship of the divine life brings us to the very sources of grace and truth, which are the divine love and the divine light. First John is the continuation of the Gospel of John. In the Gospel it was God in the Son coming to us as grace and truth so that we may become His children. In the Epistle of 1 John it is we, the children, in the fellowship of the Father&#8217;s life, coming to the Father in order to participate in His love and light. The former was God coming out to the outer court to meet our need at the altar with His grace and truth (Lev. 4:28-31); the latter is we entering into the Holy of Holies to contact Him at the ark in the divine love and light (Exo. 25:22). This is further and deeper in the experience of the divine life.<p>God is Spirit. This refers to His person. God is also love and light. Love refers to His essence, and light, to His expression. Both God&#8217;s love and light are related to His life. This life is actually God Himself. Life is also the Spirit.<p>When this life was manifested, it came with grace and truth. When we received the Lord Jesus, we received life, and now we enjoy grace and truth. This life brings us back to God to enjoy His love and light. First, God came to us so that we may receive grace and truth. Now we go back to the Father and contact Him as the source of grace and truth, and this source is love and light. Therefore, in the fellowship of the divine life we are being brought back to God to enjoy His love as the source of grace and His light as the source of truth.<p>This understanding of love and light is not derived from human reasoning; it comes from the divine revelation in the Word. In this revelation we have a number of items for our enjoyment, comparable to the many courses of a feast. We have God, the Spirit as the nature of God&#8217;s person, love as the nature of God&#8217;s essence, and light as the nature of God&#8217;s expression. When we have all these divine things, it means that we have been brought back to God the Father. When we are brought back to God the Father, we meet Him and enjoy Him as love, which is the source of grace, and light, which is the source of truth. How marvelous that in the fellowship of the divine life we enjoy the divine light and the divine love! Thus, in our experience we may enjoy God&#8217;s nature; that is, we may enjoy God as Spirit, love, and light.<h2 class=head1>C. GOD&#8217;S NATURE BEING DISPENSED INTO US FOR OUR LIVING IN SPIRIT, LOVE, AND LIGHT</h2><p>According to His New Testament economy, God is now dispensing Himself into us. Surely what God dispenses into us is what He is in His nature. When God is dispensed into us, His nature is also dispensed into us. For God to dispense Himself into us means that He is dispensing Himself into us with what He is in His nature.<p>Every day my wife gives me vitamins with my food. Each vitamin has its own nature. When I take the vitamins into me, I also take in the nature of the vitamins. Taking vitamins is also an illustration of God&#8217;s feeding us with Himself. God is the best feeder. Daily He is feeding us with divine vitamins. God is feeding us with the &#8220;vitamins&#8221; of His nature.<p>We have seen that God&#8217;s nature includes Spirit as the nature of God&#8217;s person, love as the nature of God&#8217;s essence, and light as the nature of God&#8217;s expression. Since God is dispensing Himself in His nature into us, the more we are under God&#8217;s dispensing, the more we have of His Spirit, love, and light.<p>Apart from God&#8217;s dispensing, human beings have only the flesh, the soulish mind, emotion, and will, and a dormant spirit. As a result, they live only in a fleshly, psychological way. But if we are daily under God&#8217;s dispensing, we shall have more and more Spirit. Eventually, others will be able to sense the Spirit in what we do and say.<p>We need to experience God&#8217;s dispensing in our marriage life. Married brothers and sisters, how do you react when your husband or wife gives you a difficult time? If you react in a negative way, this indicates that you are not under God&#8217;s dispensing. If you are under His dispensing and are receiving the Spirit into you more and more, you will not react in your flesh or in your emotion. Instead, you will react with the Spirit.<p>Because God is love as well as Spirit, the more we are under His dispensing, the more love we have. Actually, the more God&#8217;s nature is dispensed into us, the more we become love. This means that we not only have love but that we are love. When the New Testament says that God is love, this does not mean that God merely has love but that He is love. Through God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into us, we become love in the sense of being constituted of God as love. When love as the nature of God&#8217;s essence is dispensed into us, we shall react to others in love. Only one kind of love is genuine, and that is the love that comes out of God&#8217;s dispensing. When we are under God&#8217;s dispensing, we react with genuine love, which is God Himself.<p>When we are under God&#8217;s dispensing, our living will not only be with Spirit and love, but also with light. Our natural love is in darkness. Only one kind of love is full of light, and that is the love that comes from God&#8217;s dispensing.<p>If we are under God&#8217;s dispensing day by day, we shall behave with Spirit, with love, and with light. With how much Spirit, love, and light do you behave in your daily life? This is a test of whether or not you are under God&#8217;s dispensing.<p>In the foregoing messages we have seen that God&#8217;s person has many aspects, and in this message we have seen that He has a nature which is Spirit, love, and light. If we are under the dispensing of such a God, certainly He will infuse us with His nature, that is, with Himself as Spirit, the nature of His person, love, the nature of His essence inwardly, and light, the nature of His expression outwardly.<p>Suppose a certain brother is continually under God&#8217;s dispensing in a full way. When you contact him, you will sense that he lives and behaves with much Spirit. With him you will not see any sign of the flesh or the soul but of the Spirit. Furthermore, you will also sense love and light. When you are with him, you will have the sense that you are being enlightened. Such a brother is constituted of Spirit, love, and light because he is under the dispensing of the God who, in His nature, is Spirit, love, and light.<p>To live with Spirit, love, and light is very different from living only according to ethical, moral teachings. The New Testament reveals the dispensing of a God whose person is of many aspects and whose nature is Spirit, love, and light. If we are one with Him and if we are daily under His dispensing, we shall be those who spontaneously live a life that is full of Spirit, love, and light.<p>We need to consider all the aspects of what God is in His person. Although God&#8217;s person has many aspects, in nature He is very simple: He is Spirit, love, and light. If we are under His dispensing, our reactions will indicate to others that we have much Spirit, love, and light, even that we are constituted of Spirit, love, and light.<p>If we are under God&#8217;s dispensing, surely we shall participate in God&#8217;s nature as Spirit, love, and light. Then we shall become those who are living in Spirit, love, and light in the sense that we have been constituted of these elements of God&#8217;s nature. In our living there will be no need for us to perform, to act deliberately. Rather, we shall simply live a life according to the divine nature.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS ATTRIBUTES</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to consider the many attributes of God revealed in the New Testament. Attributes refer to something more than virtues. When we speak of God&#8217;s attributes, we refer to all that belongs to God. Of course, when the things that belong to God become our experience, they become our virtues. Therefore, with God there are attributes, and with us there are virtues. For instance, life is an attribute of God, not a virtue. But when the life of God becomes our experience, it produces virtues. Hence, with respect to God we use the word &#8220;attributes,&#8221; but in relation to ourselves we use the word &#8220;virtues.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>A. LIFE</h2><p>The divine life may be considered as the first and the basic attribute of God. Although the word &#8220;life&#8221; is used many times in the New Testament, the phrase &#8220;the life of God&#8221; is found only once. Ephesians 4:18 is the unique verse that speaks of the life of God: &#8220;Being darkened in their understanding, estranged from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart.&#8221; The life of God is eternal, uncreated. Man did not receive this life at the time of creation. After being created, man with the created human life was placed before the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9) to receive the uncreated divine life. But man fell into the vanity of his mind and became darkened in his understanding. In such a fallen condition man is not able to touch the life of God until he repents (has his mind turned to God) and believes in the Lord Jesus to receive God&#8217;s eternal life (Acts 11:18; John 3:16).<p>Actually in the whole universe only the life of God can be counted as life. First John 5:12 says, &#8220;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&#8221; This verse indicates that unless we have the life of God we do not have life. In the sight of God only His life is life. Therefore, when the life of God is mentioned in the New Testament, it is treated as if it is the unique life (John 1:4; 10:10; 11:25; 14:6).<p>The life of God is divine and eternal. The word &#8220;divine&#8221; means being of God, having the nature of God. The word &#8220;eternal&#8221; means being uncreated, without beginning or ending, existing by itself, and ever, unchangeably existing. The life of God is uncreated, without beginning or ending, self-existing, ever-existing, and never changing.<p>The life of God, being divine and eternal, is immortal and unchangeable; it remains the same and continues living even after passing through any kind of blow or destruction. All other kinds of life in the universe-angelic life, human life, animal life, and plant life-are mortal and changeable. Only the life of God is divine and eternal, immortal and unchangeable. No matter what kind of blow or destruction it undergoes, it remains unchanged and stays forever the same. Therefore, from the standpoint of eternity only the life of God is life. According to the divine and eternal nature of the life of God, God&#8217;s life is the unique life. Because the life of God is the unique life, whenever the New Testament in the original Greek speaks of this life, it uses the word zoe, which refers to the highest life (John 1:4; 1 John 1:2; 5:12).<p>God&#8217;s intention in His creation of man was that man would partake of the fruit of the tree of life and thereby receive the eternal life of God. But in the fall Satan&#8217;s evil nature was injected into man. As a result, man had to be barred from the tree of life. According to Genesis 3:24, the Lord &#8220;drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.&#8221; Thus, man was estranged from the life of God. The cherubim, the flame, and the sword signify God&#8217;s glory, holiness, and righteousness. These three things kept sinful man from receiving God&#8217;s eternal life. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He fulfilled all the requirements of God&#8217;s glory, holiness, and righteousness. Therefore, through the redemption of the Lord Jesus, the way has been opened for us to contact God as the tree of life once more. This is the reason Hebrews 10:19 says that we have &#8220;boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus.&#8221; The tree of life is in the Holy of Holies. As believers in Christ, we have been brought back to the tree of life, and the divine life in the Holy of Holies may now be our daily enjoyment. The unbelievers, however, are still estranged from the life of God.<h2 class=head1>B. LOVE</h2><p>The divine love, as we have seen in the preceding message, is the nature of God&#8217;s essence. Thus, it is an essential attribute of God. John 3:16 tells us that &#8220;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,&#8221; and 1 John 4:9 says, &#8220;In this the love of God was manifested to us, that God has sent His Son, the only begotten, into the world that we might live through Him.&#8221; As in 1 Timothy 1:15, the &#8220;world&#8221; refers to fallen mankind, whom God so loved that, by making them alive through His Son with His own life, they might become His children. In this the love of God has been manifested.<p>First John 4:10 goes on to say, &#8220;In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins.&#8221; The word &#8220;this&#8221; refers to the following fact: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins. In this fact is the higher and nobler love of God. The divine love as God&#8217;s essential attribute is mainly expressed in sending His Son to redeem us and impart God&#8217;s life into us that we may become His children.<p>Ephesians 2:4 says, &#8220;God, being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us.&#8221; The object of love should be in a lovable condition, but the object of mercy is always in a pitiful situation. Hence, God&#8217;s mercy reaches further than His love. God loves us because we are the object of His selection. But we became pitiful by our fall, even dead in our offenses and sins; therefore, we need God&#8217;s mercy. Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us from our wretched position to a condition that is suitable for His love. The nobler love of God as His essential attribute needs His attribute of mercy to reach us in the deep pit of our fallen life.<h2 class=head1>C. LIGHT</h2><p>The divine light, as we have seen in the foregoing message, is the nature of God&#8217;s expression. Thus, it is an expressive attribute of God. Revelation 21:23 says, &#8220;The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&#8221; In the millennium the light of the sun and the moon will be intensified (Isa. 30:26). But in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth there will be no need of the sun nor of the moon. The sun and the moon will be in the new heaven and new earth, but they will not be needed in the New Jerusalem, for God, the divine light, will shine much more brightly.<p>In the New Jerusalem the Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light. Because such a divine light will illumine the holy city, it will have no need of any other light, whether created by God or made by man. There will be no need of natural light. Although the sun and moon will be in the new heaven and new earth, we shall not have any need for them, because our dwelling place will be much brighter than either of them. Man-made light will not be needed either. God Himself will be the light in the holy city.<p>Revelation 21:23 also says that the Lamb, Christ, is the lamp. God is the light, and Christ is the lamp. The light needs the light-bearer. This indicates that we should not separate Christ from God or God from Christ. Actually, God and Christ are one light. God is the content, and Christ is the light-bearer, the expression. As the light is in the lamp to be its content and to be expressed through the lamp, so God the Father is in the Son to be expressed through the Son.<p>Revelation 22:5 also refers to light as a divine attribute: &#8220;Night shall be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and the light of the sun, for the Lord God shall illumine them.&#8221; Being illumined by the Lord God will be one of the blessings to God&#8217;s redeemed in eternity. We shall have no need of a lamp, the light made by man, nor of the sun, the light created by God. God Himself will shine upon us, and we shall live under His illumination. God Himself will be the light, and Christ will be the lamp, shining out God to enlighten the entire city.<p>In the New Jerusalem the divine light will be both the inward light and the outward glory for expression. This light will shine in and through the precious stone, as a jasper stone, signifying the transformed believers (Rev. 21:11). God as the light within the Lamb as the lamp will shine through the city. Within this city there will be shining light. Outside the city the light will express God&#8217;s glory, so that the entire city will bear the glory of God. The glory of God is God Himself shining out of the city through the transparent wall of jasper (Rev. 21:18).<p>Today the divine light as God&#8217;s expressive attribute is applied to us in our Christian life. First John 1:5-7 tells us that God is light, and that if we fellowship with Him we should walk in the divine light. This indicates that we can enjoy this expressive attribute of God even in this age before the New Jerusalem will come in the new heaven and the new earth.<h2 class=head1>D. RICHES</h2><p>The divine riches are an aggregate of a particular attribute of God in many respects. Romans 2:4 speaks of the riches of God&#8217;s kindness, forbearance, and longsuffering. Kindness, forbearance, and longsuffering are God&#8217;s attributes mainly toward the sinners, in which there are the divine riches. The book of Ephesians speaks of God&#8217;s riches in mercy (2:4), God&#8217;s surpassing riches of grace (1:7; 2:7), and God&#8217;s riches of glory (3:16). Romans 9:23 also speaks of God&#8217;s riches of glory. The divine riches in the divine attributes of mercy, grace, and glory are mainly toward the believers. The riches of God&#8217;s grace surpass every limit. These are the riches of God Himself for our enjoyment today, which will be publicly displayed, exhibited, to the whole universe for eternity. The riches of God&#8217;s glory are for God&#8217;s expression in the believers as God&#8217;s vessels, being indwelt and fully occupied by Christ to express God (Eph. 3:16-19; Rom. 9:23). Romans 11:33 speaks of the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God. The divine riches in all God&#8217;s attributes are deep, with an untraceable depth just as God&#8217;s wisdom and knowledge are untraceable.<h2 class=head1>E. FULLNESS</h2><p>Another attribute of God is fullness. Colossians 1:19 says, &#8220;For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.&#8221; What is the fullness spoken of in this verse? Many would answer that it is the fullness of the Godhead. Although this is correct, here Paul does not modify the word &#8220;fullness&#8221; by a phrase such as &#8220;of the Godhead&#8221; or &#8220;of God.&#8221; He simply says that all the fullness was pleased to dwell in Christ. There is something known as the fullness, and this fullness is pleased to dwell in Christ. In Colossians 1:19 fullness denotes not the riches of what God is but the expression of these riches. All the expression of the rich being of God, both in creation and in the church, dwells in Christ. Therefore, fullness in Colossians 1:19 means expression.<p>If something has no fullness, it cannot be expressed. But if a thing has fullness, it can be expressed. For example, if we have very little love, our love cannot be expressed. But if our love is full, the fullness of our love will be its expression. In the same principle, the fullness in Colossians 1:19 is the expression of all that God is in His riches.<p>It is significant that in Colossians 1:19 Paul speaks of the fullness as the fullness, using no word to modify it. This indicates that he is speaking of the unique fullness. To modify the fullness in any way might imply that it is not unique. In order to preserve the uniqueness of the fullness, Paul does not use a modifier. Hence, the fullness here is simply the fullness.<p>The fullness, the expression of God, is a person. Many of the personal pronouns in the verses following Colossians 1:19 refer to the fullness as a person. Verses 19 and 20 say that in Christ the fullness was pleased to dwell, and &#8220;through Him to reconcile all things to Him.&#8221; If the fullness were not a person, how could it be pleased to dwell in Christ? The fact that the fullness can be pleased indicates that it is a person. The fullness was pleased not only to dwell in Christ, but through Him to reconcile all things to Him. In verses 19 and 20 two infinitives-to dwell and to reconcile-are joined by a conjunction. Hence, the fullness was pleased to dwell and to reconcile. The phrase &#8220;through Him&#8221; is used twice in verse 20, both times referring to Christ as the active instrument through which reconciliation was processed. But what is the antecedent of the pronoun &#8220;Him&#8221; to whom all things are reconciled? The antecedent is the fullness in verse 19. This is the reason that in his New Translation, J. N. Darby uses the pronoun &#8220;itself&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8221; in verses 20 and 22 to refer to the fullness in verse 19. However, the Greek pronouns should not be regarded as neuter but as masculine. This means that instead of saying &#8220;it,&#8221; we should say &#8220;Him.&#8221; Therefore, all things have been reconciled to the fullness. In verses 21 and 22 we who were enemies have been reconciled by the fullness in the body of His flesh through death so that we may be presented holy and blameless and without reproach before the fullness. How meaningful is this understanding of the passage! It is the fullness that dwells in Christ, it is the fullness that reconciles us, and it is to the fullness that we shall be presented. This fullness is God Himself expressed. This fullness was pleased to dwell in Christ, to reconcile us, and to present us to Himself.<p>We have seen that in Colossians 1:19 the fullness is the expression of God, even God Himself. This fullness does not denote the riches of what God is; rather, it denotes the expression of these riches, the full expression of God in all His rich being. The rich being of God is expressed both in the old creation and in the new creation. In Colossians 2:9 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; Once again, the word fullness refers not to the riches of God but to the expression of God&#8217;s riches. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead but the expression of the riches of what God is. It is crucial for us to see that the fullness of the Godhead is the expression of the Godhead, that is, the expression of what God is in His riches. The Godhead is expressed in both the old creation, the universe, and in the new creation, the church.<p>In Colossians 1:19 and 2:9 we see two aspects of the fullness. According to 1:19, all the fullness was pleased to dwell in Christ. According to 2:9, all the fullness dwells in Christ bodily. This implies the physical body which Christ put on in His humanity. It indicates that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ as the One who has a human body. Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but it did not dwell in Him bodily. After He became incarnate, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way, and it dwells in His glorified body (Phil. 3:21) now and forever. For eternity Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of God, the embodiment of the expression of all that God is in His unlimited and untraceable riches.<p>In Ephesians 3:19 we have a further word concerning the fullness of God: &#8220;And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8221; Some translations of this verse say, &#8220;filled with all the fullness of God.&#8221; According to this rendering, the fullness of God is the element, the essence, with which we are filled. But this is a mistaken understanding of this verse. Here Paul is saying that we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God, that is, we shall be filled to be the expression of God. When we are strengthened into our inner man, when Christ makes His home in our hearts, and when we are rooted and grounded in love (Eph. 3:16-17), we are filled unto all the fullness of God. In our spirit we are filled unto all the fullness of God to become His expression.<p>Furthermore, Ephesians 3:19 does not say that we are filled with the riches of God; this verse says that we are filled unto the fullness of God. This means that we are filled to become the expression of God. The expression of God today is the church, which is the Body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23).<p>When Christ makes His home in our hearts and when we are strong to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ and to know by experience His knowledge-surpassing love, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God. All this fullness dwells in Christ. Now, through His indwelling, Christ imparts the fullness of God into our being. When we are filled unto all the fullness of God, we become the expression of God, which is what the church should be.<p>The &#8220;fullness of God&#8221; implies that the riches of what God is become His expression. When the riches are in God Himself, they are His riches. When the riches of God are expressed, they become His fullness (John 1:16).<p>When we make a distinction between the riches and the fullness, some may try to argue by quoting John 1:16: &#8220;For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.&#8221; Then they may say, &#8220;John 1:16 declares that of His fullness we have all received. Isn&#8217;t this fullness the same as the riches? How can you make a distinction between riches and fullness?&#8221;<p>When Christ was on earth with His disciples, would you say that the riches of God were there with Him, or that the fullness of God was there with Him? If the riches had been with Him but not the fullness, something would have been lacking. There would have been no completion, no fullness. When the Lord Jesus came, He no doubt brought all the riches of God with Him. However, with Him there were not only the riches of God, but there was also the fullness of God. This is the reason John 1:16 says that we all have received of His fullness. The fullness is the completion of the riches. In Greek the word for &#8220;fullness&#8221; means completion. Hence, it is correct to render this Greek word as &#8220;completeness.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;of&#8221; in John 1:16 means &#8220;out from&#8221; or &#8220;out of.&#8221; Thus, out of the fullness of Christ, the completeness of all the riches of God, we have all received. When Christ came, He did not come only partially filled with the riches of God. On the contrary, He was filled with the unlimited riches of God to the brim. Hence, the fullness, the completeness of what God is in His riches, was present with Him. This fullness, this completeness, is the expression of God. According to the New Testament, the fullness of God is the expression through the completion of the riches of God.<p>According to John 1:16, the fullness of God came with Christ, who is the embodiment of God&#8217;s fullness. With Christ, the expression was an individual matter. This expression, therefore, needs to be enlarged, to be expanded, from an individual matter to a corporate one. The church is to be the fullness of God in a corporate way. In the church God is expressed not through an individual but corporately through the Body. Therefore, the fullness of God is embodied in the church. The church as the embodiment of the fullness of God is the expression of the Triune God.<p>In these verses in chapter three of Ephesians concerning the economy of God resulting in the fullness of God, we see the Triune God. The Father (v. 14) answers and fulfills the apostle&#8217;s prayer through the Spirit (v. 16) so that Christ the Son (v. 17) may make His home in our hearts. As a result, we are filled unto the fullness of the Triune God. This is the dispensing of the Triune God into our being to make us His corporate expression.<p>According to Ephesians 3, the Triune God is not the object of doctrinal debate; the Triune God is for the dispensing of Himself into the believers so that they may be filled unto the fullness of God. Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us through His Spirit so that Christ might make His home in our hearts and thereby fully occupy our inward being with the result that we might be filled unto the expression of the Triune God. How glorious and how marvelous! This is God&#8217;s economy, and this is also His New Testament revelation. Thus the fullness of God as His attribute is eventually nothing less than Christ with the church as His Body.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINE</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS ATTRIBUTES</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider more of God&#8217;s attributes.<h2 class=head1>F. HOLINESS</h2><p>Holiness is one of the main attributes of our God. Revelation 4:8 says, &#8220;The four living creatures...have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming.&#8221; The mentioning of &#8220;holy&#8221; three times, as in Isaiah 6:3, implies the thought of God being triune, as the mentioning of God&#8217;s existence with three tenses does. The emphasis here is that the Triune God is holy and is triply holy, referring to the quality of God&#8217;s nature-God&#8217;s being. What God is, is holy. To partake of God&#8217;s holiness (Heb. 12:10) is to partake of the quality of His nature, of what He is.<p>First Peter 1:15 and 16 say, &#8220;According to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also become holy in all your manner of life; because it is written, You shall be holy, because I am holy.&#8221; The Holy One is the Triune God-the choosing Father, the redeeming Son, and the sanctifying Spirit (1 Pet. 1:1-2). The Father has regenerated His elect, imparting His holy nature into them (1 Pet. 1:3); the Son has redeemed them with His blood from the vain manner of life (1 Pet. 1:18-19); and the Spirit has sanctified them according to the Father&#8217;s holy nature, separating them from anything that does not fit in with God&#8217;s nature so that they, by the holy nature of the Father, may become holy in all manner of life, even as holy as God Himself is.<p>We become holy through the sanctification of the Spirit, based on regeneration, which brings us the holy nature of God and issues in a holy life. The Father has regenerated us to produce a holy family-a holy Father with holy children. As holy children we should walk in a holy manner of life. Otherwise the Father will deal with our unholiness. He begot us with His life inwardly so that we might have His holy nature; He disciplines us outwardly so that we may partake of His holiness (Heb. 12:9-10).<p>These words &#8220;holy&#8221; and &#8220;holiness&#8221; have been spoiled by today&#8217;s teachings. In the Bible the word holy should not be understood according to the natural concept. Some think that holiness is sinlessness. According to this concept, someone is holy if he does not sin. This thought is absolutely mistaken. Holiness is neither sinlessness nor perfection. Holy not only means sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common. Only God is different, distinct, from all things in His nature. Hence, He is holy; holiness is the distinct quality of His nature, as one of His attributes.<p>The way God makes us holy is to impart Himself, the Holy One, into us so that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature. For us, God&#8217;s chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of His nature (2 Pet. 1:4) and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself. This is different from mere sinless perfection. This makes our being holy, like God Himself is in His nature.<p>To be holy is to be separated unto God from everything other than God. It also means to be different, distinct, from all that is not God. Thus, we become not common but different. In the universe God alone is holy. He is different from everything and is distinct. Therefore, to be holy means to be one with God in His distinction. You may be sinless and perfect, but if you are not one with God, you are not holy. When God gets into us, we are holy. When we get into God, we are more holy. And when we are mingled with God, we are most holy. We become holy by having God in us, we become more holy by being in God, and we become the holiest by being mingled, permeated, and saturated with God. This will eventually issue in the New Jerusalem, which is called the holy city (Rev. 21:2, 10), a city that not only belongs to God and is for God, but is filled with God, saturated with God, and one with God, a holy entity sanctified with God.<h2 class=head1>G. RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>Another attribute of God is righteousness. God is righteous as well as holy. Whereas holiness is related to God&#8217;s inward nature, righteousness is related to God&#8217;s outward acts, ways, actions, and activities. Everything God does is righteous.<p>What is the righteousness of God? The righteousness of God is what God is in His action with respect to justice and righteousness. God is just and right. Whatever God is in His justice and righteousness constitutes His righteousness.<p>Revelation 15:3 says, &#8220;Great and wonderful are Your works, Lord God the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations.&#8221; God&#8217;s works are His acts, whereas God&#8217;s ways are His governing principles. God&#8217;s ways are righteous in His principles. If you know God&#8217;s ways, you will not need to wait to see His works in order to praise Him. Although His works have not yet come, you will know they will come because you know the governing principles by which God does things. God&#8217;s ways are righteous according to His principles.<p>In Romans 1:16b and 17a Paul says that the gospel &#8220;is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek. For the righteousness of God is revealed in it.&#8221; In John 3:16 God&#8217;s love is the source and motive of God&#8217;s salvation. In Ephesians 2:5 and 8 God&#8217;s grace is the basic element of God&#8217;s salvation. But here God&#8217;s righteousness is the power of God&#8217;s salvation. Legally speaking, both love and grace can fluctuate, but not righteousness. This is true even the more with God&#8217;s righteousness. Because God&#8217;s righteousness is revealed in the gospel, the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.<p>According to John 3:16, salvation is out of God&#8217;s love, and according to Ephesians 2:5 and 8, salvation is by God&#8217;s grace. But in Romans 1:17 Paul says that salvation comes by the righteousness of God. Neither love nor grace is related to the law. No law forces us to love or to give grace. Whether we love or not we are still lawful, and whether we extend grace or not we are still legal. In a sense, God is not bound to love us. Furthermore, He is not legally bound to show us grace. Righteousness, on the contrary, is very much related to the law. Because Christ has fulfilled all the righteous requirements of God&#8217;s law, God is bound to save us. If you say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, You are my Savior,&#8221; you can turn to God and say, &#8220;God, You must forgive me, whether You like it or not. You are righteous if You forgive me, but You are unrighteous if You do not forgive me.&#8221; We can say this to God because Christ has fulfilled all the righteous requirements of the law, and, as a result, God is bound by His righteousness to save us. Righteousness, therefore, is a mighty bond God cannot escape-He must save us because He is righteous.<p>First John 1:9 says, &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221; God is faithful in His word (1 John 1:10) and righteous in the blood of Jesus His Son (1 John 1:7). His word is the word of the truth of His gospel (Eph. 1:13), which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ (Acts 10:43), and the blood of Christ has fulfilled His righteous requirements that He may forgive us our sins (Matt. 26:28). If we confess our sins, He, according to His word and based on the redemption through the blood of Jesus, forgives us, because He must be faithful in His word and righteous in the blood of Jesus. Otherwise, God would be unfaithful and unrighteous.<p>In Romans 3:21 Paul speaks a further word concerning the righteousness of God: &#8220;But now without law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.&#8221; To say that the righteousness of God has been manifested without law means that the righteousness of God is not based on our doing; that is, it is not based on our keeping the law. Although the righteousness of God has existed for ages, it was not manifested to us until we believed in the Lord Jesus and called on His name. Then the righteousness of God was revealed to us. When God&#8217;s righteousness is revealed, it is manifested. It is manifested to us when we believe in the Lord.<p>The manifestation of God&#8217;s righteousness is mentioned twice in the book of Romans. Romans 1:17 says that the righteousness of God is revealed out of faith to faith. Then Romans 3:21 says that the righteousness of God has been manifested without the law. Now apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested through faith of Jesus Christ (Rom. 3:22).<p>By forgiving us God shows forth His righteousness. He makes a declaration to the whole universe that because He is righteous, He must forgive us for our sins. Because His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, was put to death by Him on the cross on our behalf, God is legally obligated to forgive us. Whether He is happy with us or not, He must forgive us according to His righteousness. God knows that whenever a person points to the resurrected and ascended Christ as a &#8220;receipt&#8221; for sin, God must forgive that one. In this matter the righteous God has no choice.<p>Whenever our conscience condemns us because of our failures, we need to remember to stand upon the foundation of God&#8217;s righteousness. You may be fervent for the Lord today. But in the future you may fail Him and become very disappointed with yourself, unable to believe that God could ever forgive you. At such a time you need to praise God for His righteousness. Tell Him that no matter how much you have failed, Christ is still at His right hand as the receipt for payment for all your debts (Heb. 1:3). Our experience may fluctuate, but God remains righteous forever. Whenever we confess our sins, claim the blood of Jesus, and appeal to God&#8217;s righteousness, God has no choice except to forgive us.<p>Our experience of Christ rests on the foundation of God&#8217;s righteousness. The foundation is not our fervency or victory; it is God&#8217;s righteousness, the unshakable foundation of God&#8217;s throne (Psa. 89:14). God has shown forth His righteousness by forgiving us of our sins. In this way God has proved that He is righteous. Now such righteousness of God is our solid foundation.<p>We have seen that both love and grace may change, but righteousness is solid and steadfast. God is free either to love us or not to love us; however, He is bound by His righteousness. Because Christ died to fulfill God&#8217;s righteous requirements, God has put Himself into a position where He is legally bound to forgive everyone who believes in Christ. God is bound by His own righteousness to forgive us. Therefore, the righteousness that is the foundation of God&#8217;s throne is also the foundation of our salvation. Can the foundation of God&#8217;s throne be shaken? Certainly not. Likewise, the foundation of our salvation cannot be shaken.<p>If we consider ourselves, we shall realize that we are not lovable or worthy of God&#8217;s grace. We simply do not deserve anything from God. But God is righteous. He put Christ to death on our behalf, and He has recognized the death of Christ as the full payment of our debt. Therefore, we can boldly say to God, &#8220;If You do not deal with me according to Your righteousness, Your throne will be shaken. The important issue is not whether or not I shall be saved or perish; it is whether or not You will allow the foundation of Your throne to be shaken. God, I remind You of Your righteousness. Christ has died for my sins, and He is now at Your right hand as proof that You have received His payment for all my debts. According to Your righteousness, You have no choice except to forgive me. You are legally bound to forgive me of my sins. O Father God, I appreciate Your love and grace. But now I stand before You in Your righteousness. Because You are righteous, You must forgive me.&#8221; Have you ever prayed to God in this way? It pleases Him when we pray like this. This is a prayer that knows God&#8217;s righteousness and appeals to God according to His righteousness. Our God is righteous, and the gospel of Christ is the power of God because the righteousness of God is revealed in it. Such a divine righteousness is a strong attribute of God.<h2 class=head1>H. WISDOM</h2><p>Romans 11:33 speaks of God&#8217;s wisdom: &#8220;O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How inscrutable are His judgments, and untraceable His paths!&#8221; At the very end of the book of Romans Paul says, &#8220;To the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever and ever! Amen&#8221; (Rom. 16:27). Wisdom is different from cleverness and deeper than cleverness. It is possible to be clever without being wise. For example, a criminal may be very clever, but he is altogether lacking in wisdom. God is very wise, and the universe reveals His wisdom.<p>It is important to see the difference between wisdom and knowledge. Wisdom is both higher and deeper than knowledge. Wisdom is seen in the initiation of something, for example, in the formulation of a new invention, and knowledge is seen in the practical application. If you have only knowledge and lack wisdom, you will not be able to initiate anything or invent anything. God is the unique Initiator. He has initiated many things, not by His knowledge but by His wisdom. When He comes in to apply what He has initiated, He displays His knowledge.<p>Ephesians 3:10 speaks of the multifarious wisdom of God being made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies through the church. The Greek word translated &#8220;multifarious&#8221; indicates that God&#8217;s wisdom has many sides, aspects, and directions.<p>Only through problems can all the aspects of God&#8217;s wisdom be manifested. This means that, in a sense, God needs problems and troubles: He even needs an adversary, Satan. Without Satan, God&#8217;s wisdom cannot be fully manifested. Satan has created many opportunities for God&#8217;s wisdom to be manifested in a multifarious way. The rebellion of Satan is within the realm of troubles for God&#8217;s wisdom. If it were not for Satan&#8217;s rebellion, God&#8217;s wisdom could not be made known in a full way. If you are a person full of wisdom, the more troubles and difficulties you have, the more wisdom you will express. But if everything related to you is peaceful and without problems, you will have no opportunity to express your wisdom. You need problems in order to display your wisdom. Likewise, God needs problems in order to display His wisdom. Whatever the enemy of God does gives God the opportunity to show forth His wisdom.<p>Another aspect of God&#8217;s wisdom is revealed in 1 Corinthians 1:30, where we are told that of God we are in Christ Jesus, &#8220;who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&#8221; For Christ to be our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption requires much wisdom on God&#8217;s part. Many aspects of God&#8217;s wisdom are manifested in His making Christ our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Our experience of Christ in these matters is according to God&#8217;s manifold wisdom.<p>Furthermore, in His wisdom God is able to make us the church. Sometimes God may say, &#8220;Look, Satan, I have taken the very people whom you have ruined and I have made them into the church. Do you have the wisdom to do such a thing? You do not have this wisdom, but I have it.&#8221;<p>In the sight of God the most marvelous thing in the universe is the church, for through it His multifarious wisdom is made known to Satan and his angels. The day is coming when Satan and his angels will be put to shame. They will realize that everything they have done has given God the opportunity to manifest His wisdom. In the same principle, our failures, mistakes, defeats, and wrongdoings have also given God opportunities to display His wisdom. We are God&#8217;s chosen people, and even through our failures He manifests His multifarious wisdom. Such a wisdom is also a strong attribute of our God.<h2 class=head1>I. PRUDENCE</h2><p>Ephesians 1:8 indicates that there is a difference between wisdom and prudence. In this verse, Paul, speaking of the riches of God&#8217;s grace says, &#8220;Which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence.&#8221; Wisdom is what is within God to plan and purpose a will concerning us; prudence is the application of God&#8217;s wisdom. First, God planned and purposed in His wisdom, and then He applied what He had planned and purposed for us with prudence. Wisdom was mainly for God&#8217;s plan in eternity, and prudence is mainly for God&#8217;s execution of His plan in time. What God planned in eternity in His wisdom He is now executing in time in His prudence.<p>We may say that prudence is a &#8220;stairway&#8221; connecting cleverness, which is on a lower level, to wisdom, which is on a higher level. In order to go up to wisdom from cleverness, we need prudence. If a certain person chooses not to remain in his cleverness but to advance to wisdom, he must ascend up the stairway of prudence. We may also say that prudence is a proper cleverness. Those who are prudent will not do things in a foolish way. This kind of prudence is also a divine attribute in God&#8217;s move.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TEN</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS ATTRIBUTES</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to consider God&#8217;s attributes.<h2 class=head1>J. FAITHFULNESS</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:9 says, &#8220;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&#8221; This word is a continuation of 1 Corinthians 1:8, strengthening the thought with the assurance of God&#8217;s faithfulness. In His faithfulness He will confirm the believers till the end, making them unreprovable in the day of the Lord&#8217;s return. In His faithfulness He has called us into the fellowship, the participation in His Son, and He will keep us in this participation and enjoyment in His fullness. His fullness is an assurance to us for this enjoyment.<p>First John 1:9 also reveals God&#8217;s faithfulness: &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221; God is faithful in His word (1 John 1:10), the word of the truth of His gospel (Eph. 1:13), which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ (Acts 10:43). If we confess our sins, He, according to His word, forgives us, because He must be faithful in His word.<p>In 1 Corinthians 10:13 Paul says, &#8220;No temptation has taken you except that which is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not let you be tempted beyond what you are able, but will with the temptation make also the way out, that you may be able to endure it.&#8221; On the one hand, we should take heed not to be tempted, lest we fall. On the other hand, God in His faithfulness will not allow any temptation to befall us beyond what we are able to endure, but will always make a way out for us. This is a word of promise and encouragement.<p>First Thessalonians 5:23 and 24 say, &#8220;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He who calls you, who also will do it.&#8221; Here we see that the faithful God who has called us will also sanctify us wholly and preserve our entire being complete. This is Paul&#8217;s word of assurance to the believers concerning the faithfulness of God. Surely this divine faithfulness is a sweet attribute of God.<h2 class=head1>K. TRUTHFULNESS</h2><p>In addition to faithfulness, God has the attribute of truthfulness. In Romans 3:7 and 15:8 the word &#8220;truth&#8221; actually denotes truthfulness. Although truthfulness is very close to faithfulness, there is a difference between these two attributes of God. Faithfulness must have a basis, and the basis of faithfulness is truthfulness. The truthfulness, genuineness, trustworthiness, of God is a divine attribute in God&#8217;s dealing with us.<h2 class=head1>L. SIMPLICITY</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 1:12 Paul speaks of the singleness, or simplicity, of God. Have you ever realized that God is simple? Simplicity is one of His attributes.<p>God is wise and almighty, but He is also single and very simple. When we talk to certain brothers, we find that they are extremely complicated. But our God is simple with us. Whenever we talk to Him, we find that He is not full of complications. When He says &#8220;white&#8221; or &#8220;black,&#8221; He means white or black, not gray.<p>No matter how God may feel about us at a particular time, He is always simple with us. Imagine what would happen to us if God were not simple and if He thought about us in a complicated way. Would you like God to consider your situation and examine you in a complicated way? None of us would be favored by God if He were to deal with us in this way. But because of God&#8217;s simplicity, His singleness, we have received unreserved blessing from Him all the time.<p>The source of confusion and division among Christians is the complications within the believers. If all Christians became simple, there would be no problems. The problems in a local church always come from complications. This was the situation among the Corinthians, to whom Paul wrote concerning his conducting himself in the simplicity of God. The simplicity of God is a divine attribute, an attribute of what God is in His faithfulness. To love and enjoy Christ in simplicity (2 Cor. 11:3) is to experience God in His attribute of simplicity.<h2 class=head1>M. SINCERITY</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 1:12 Paul speaks not only of the simplicity of God but also of the sincerity of God. Sincerity follows simplicity and comes out of simplicity. A sincere person is always simple. I do not trust those who are complicated, because they are too clever. However, I can trust those who are simple, for I know that, being simple, they are sincere. When we have simplicity, singleness, we shall also have sincerity. Because Paul conducted himself in the simplicity of God, he was truly sincere, living in the divine attribute of sincerity.<h2 class=head1>N. GOODNESS</h2><p>In Luke 18:18 a &#8220;certain ruler&#8221; questioned the Lord Jesus, saying, &#8220;Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&#8221; Jesus said to him, &#8220;Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One-God&#8221; (v. 19). This verse reveals that God, and only God, is good. Goodness is another attribute of God.<p>What does the word &#8220;good&#8221; mean in regard to God? In Greek it is agathos, describing &#8220;that which, being good in its character or constitution, is beneficial in its effect&#8221; (Vine). Thus it denotes something being essentially, absolutely, and consummately beneficial. God, being good, is essentially, absolutely, and consummately beneficial to man. His goodness, in this sense, is a beautiful item of His attributes.<h2 class=head1>O. MERCY</h2><p>Romans 9:16 says, &#8220;So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy.&#8221; Mercy is the most far reaching of God&#8217;s attributes. Mercy goes further than grace. God&#8217;s love does not reach as far as His grace, and His grace does not reach as far as His mercy. If I am in a good condition and my standing matches yours, and you give me a gift, that is grace. But if I am in a pitiful condition and my standing is far removed from yours, and you give me something, that is mercy. If I come to you as your dear friend, and you give me a gift, that is grace. However, if I am a poor, unclean beggar, unable to do anything for myself, and you give me a gift, that is mercy. This illustrates the fact that God&#8217;s mercy is more far reaching than His grace. Grace extends only to a situation that corresponds to it. But mercy goes much further, reaching into a situation that is poor and unworthy of grace. According to our natural condition, we were far removed from God, totally unworthy of His grace. We were eligible only to receive His mercy.<p>God&#8217;s mercy does not depend on man&#8217;s good condition. Rather, God&#8217;s mercy is shown in man&#8217;s pitiful condition. It reaches beyond His grace.<p>It is God&#8217;s mercy that has reached us. None of us was in a condition that corresponded to His grace. We were so poor and pitiful that there was the need for God&#8217;s mercy to extend to our fallen condition. God&#8217;s mercy has brought us into His grace. How we need to realize this and worship God for His mercy! Even now, after being saved and having shared in the riches of God&#8217;s life, we still, in some ways, are in a condition that needs God&#8217;s mercy to reach us. This is the reason Hebrews 4:16 says that first we need to obtain mercy, and then we can find grace for timely help. Oh, how much we need God&#8217;s mercy! We should treasure His mercy as much as we appreciate His grace. It is always God&#8217;s mercy that qualifies us to participate in His grace.<p>In Romans 9:16 Paul says that &#8220;it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy.&#8221; Our concept is that the one who wills will gain what he wills to obtain and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after. If this were the case, then God&#8217;s selection would be according to our effort and labor. But it is not so. On the contrary, God&#8217;s selection is of God who shows mercy. We do not need to will or to run, for God has mercy on us. If we know God&#8217;s mercy, we shall not put our trust in our effort. Neither shall we be disappointed by our failures. The hope for our wretched condition is in God&#8217;s mercy.<p>Romans 11:32 says, &#8220;For God has shut up all in disobedience that He might show mercy to all.&#8221; Man&#8217;s disobedience affords God&#8217;s mercy an opportunity, and God&#8217;s mercy brings man salvation. How marvelous is God&#8217;s mercy!<p>God&#8217;s mercy and His grace are both the expression of His love. When we are in a pitiful condition, His mercy reaches us and brings us into a state where He is able to favor us with His grace. Luke 15:20-24 says that when the father saw the prodigal son returning, he had compassion on him. This is the deeper mercy, an expression of the father&#8217;s affectionate love. Then the father clothed his son with the best robe and fed him with the fatted calf. This is grace, which also manifests the father&#8217;s love. God&#8217;s mercy reaches further than His grace, bridging the gap between us and God&#8217;s grace.<p>Often, because of our pitiful condition, we need to receive mercy before we can find grace. We come to the throne of grace (Heb. 4:16) like beggars, in somewhat the same condition as was the prodigal son when he came to his father. A beggar, like the prodigal, needs mercy. When we come to the throne of grace, we may have the sense that we are pitiful and say, &#8220;Father, I am not worthy of anything.&#8221; But the Father may say, &#8220;You are unworthy, but I am merciful. My mercy reaches you and qualifies you to receive my favor. My mercy brings Me to you that I may clothe you with the best robe.&#8221; God&#8217;s mercy is always available to us.<p>If we would serve God in His New Testament economy, we need to know that it is wholly a matter of God&#8217;s sovereign mercy. Through many years of experience I have become strongly and deeply convinced that everything that happens to us is of God&#8217;s mercy. All is a matter of God&#8217;s mercy. The more we see this, the more we shall spontaneously bear our responsibility before the Lord. However, even the bearing of responsibility is of God&#8217;s mercy. Why is it that some believers are willing to bear their responsibility and that others are not? The answer lies in God&#8217;s mercy. In Romans 9:15 Paul quotes the Lord&#8217;s words, &#8220;I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.&#8221; Because of God&#8217;s mercy we responded to the gospel when others did not respond, we received a word about Christ as life when others refused to receive it, and we took the way of the Lord&#8217;s recovery when others drew back from taking this way.<p>Regarding His recovery, God has mercy on whom He will have mercy. We are not in the Lord&#8217;s recovery because we are more intelligent than others or because we seek the Lord more than others do. Our being here is altogether due to the mercy of God. If you consider how the Lord brought you into the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, you will worship Him for His mercy. Concerning the gospel, the ministry of life, and the church life, God has had mercy on us. How we must praise Him for His sovereign mercy, and worship Him for His mercy!<p>Ephesians 2:4 says, &#8220;God, being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us.&#8221; Here we see that God is rich in mercy because of His great love toward us. The object of love should be in a lovable condition, but the object of mercy is always in a pitiful situation. God&#8217;s mercy reaches us for His love. God loves us because we are the object of His selection. But we became pitiful by our fall, even dead in our offenses and sins. Therefore, we need God&#8217;s mercy to reach us. Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us from our wretched position to a condition that is suitable for His love. This most far-reaching attribute of God should cause our heart to react to His love.<h2 class=head1>P. COMPASSION</h2><p>Romans 9:15 mentions both God&#8217;s mercy and His compassion: &#8220;He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.&#8221; Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 1:3 says, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement.&#8221; What is the difference between mercy and compassion? It is somewhat difficult to differentiate them. Although compassion is close to mercy, compassion is deeper, finer, and richer than mercy. Mercy is somewhat outward, but compassion is inward. Furthermore, compassion is more long lasting than mercy. Therefore, compassion is both deeper and longer lasting than mercy.<p>The Greek word for mercy, eleos, refers to the kind of response that is motivated by the wretched condition of the poor party. Mercy refers more to the action or manifestation in response to wretchedness. The Greek word for compassion in Romans 9:15 and 2 Corinthians 1:3 is oiktirmos. The basic root of this word refers to the inward organs of man which were believed to be the center of tender affections in man. Hence, this Greek word for compassion refers to the inward feeling that originates in the heart of the affectionate party. This feeling is not mild but deeply affectionate. Compassion, therefore, refers to the inward feeling that resides in the one who looks upon wretchedness. It is the deepest of words showing the inward affection of God for man in his pitiful condition.<p>With these definitions in view, we may consider Romans 9:15 again for a full contrast, translating the verse in this way: &#8220;I will display My kind act of mercy to whom I will display My kind act of mercy, and I will have the deepest feeling of compassion upon whom I will have the deepest feeling of compassion.&#8221; The former refers to God&#8217;s outward doing motivated by our wretched state; the latter refers to His inward affection originating in His loving essence. We all should appreciate such a sweeter affectionate attribute of God.<h2 class=head1>Q. GRACE</h2><p>Ephesians 2:7 says, &#8220;That He might display in the ages which are coming the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.&#8221; In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul testifies, &#8220;But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.&#8221; The grace of God is a matter of tremendous significance. It is important for us to find out the genuine and proper meaning of the grace of God in the New Testament. If we would understand what the grace of God is as revealed in the New Testament, we need a clear view of the New Testament as a whole.<p>When I was young, I was taught that grace means that we do nothing and that God does everything for us. According to this teaching, anything we do is work, not grace, but whatever God does for us is grace. However, according to the New Testament, grace is actually what God is to us for our enjoyment (John 1:16-17; 2 Cor. 12:9). Grace is actually God in Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment in our experience. Grace is mainly not the work God does for us; grace is the Triune God Himself dispensed into our being and experienced as our enjoyment. In brief, grace is the Triune God experienced and enjoyed by us. The New Testament reveals that grace is nothing less than God in Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment.<p>John 1:17 says that grace came through Jesus Christ. This indicates that grace is somewhat like a person. The personification of grace is God Himself. Paul realized this when he said, &#8220;Not I, but the grace of God with me&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:10). For Paul, grace was a living person. In Paul this person became the very grace by which he labored. Therefore, grace is God Himself; it is what God is to us for our enjoyment. When God is enjoyed by us, that is grace. Grace is the very God in His Son Jesus Christ to be our portion so that we may enjoy all He is.<p>We need to emphasize the fact that grace is God as our enjoyment. When God becomes our portion for us to enjoy, that is grace. Do not consider grace as something less than God. Grace is nothing less than the Triune God enjoyed by us in a practical way as our portion. Concerning this definition of grace, the first stanza of Hymns 497 says:<p class=hbody>Grace in its highest definition is God in the Son to be enjoyed by us; It is not only something done or giv&#8217;n, But God Himself, our portion glorious.<p>Grace is God not in doctrine, but in our experience, for grace is God in Christ with all He is for our enjoyment. This includes life, strength, comfort, rest, light, righteousness, holiness, power, and the other divine attributes. When we enjoy God and participate in Him, that is grace.<p>We have pointed out that in Ephesians 2:7 Paul indicates that God will &#8220;display in the ages which are coming the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.&#8221; To display the riches of God&#8217;s grace is to exhibit them to the whole universe. The riches of God&#8217;s grace surpass every limit, for they are the riches of God Himself for our enjoyment. The riches of God&#8217;s grace will be publicly displayed for eternity.<p>In Ephesians 2:8 Paul goes on to say that we are saved by grace. In Ephesians grace denotes God dispensed into us. Therefore, to be saved by grace means to be saved by God dispensed into us in Christ. Most Christians, however, regard grace as a thing, not as a person. To them, grace is merely a gift freely given. According to this concept of grace, we were sinners who did not deserve God&#8217;s salvation, but God saved us freely by giving us His unmerited favor. This, however, is a superficial understanding of what it means to be saved by grace. Ephesians reveals that saving grace is God Himself in Christ wrought into our being. Hence, to be saved by grace actually means to be saved by the dispensing of the Triune God into us.<p>According to Ephesians, salvation is the transmission of God into us as grace. It was not a simple matter for God to be transmitted into us as grace. It was necessary for Him to be processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. By being processed in this way, He is now able to transmit Himself into us. When the processed God is transmitted into us, He becomes saving grace to us in our experience. This grace is not only amazing grace; it is abounding grace. Grace is the processed God transmitted into our being.<p>If you read Ephesians 1 and 2 with much prayer, you will see that God processed and transmitted into our being is the saving grace and the abounding grace. We have been saved by the transmission of this processed God. In His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus, God has saved us by His grace. In the ages to come-in the millennium and eternity-God will display this grace publicly to the whole universe.<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul speaks three times concerning grace. Twice he speaks of the grace of God, and once, of &#8220;His grace.&#8221; In this verse grace is the Triune God becoming life and everything to us. It was by this grace that Saul of Tarsus, the foremost of sinners (1 Tim. 1:15-16), became the foremost apostle, laboring more abundantly than all the apostles.<p>First Peter 4:10 speaks of the varied grace of God: &#8220;Each one according as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.&#8221; The varied grace of God is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered to us in many aspects. As good stewards, by the gift we have received we should minister to the church and to the saints such grace, not mere doctrine.<p>In 1 Peter 5:10 we have a word concerning &#8220;the God of all grace.&#8221; In this verse &#8220;all grace&#8221; refers to the riches of the bountiful supply of the divine life in many aspects ministered to us in the many steps of the divine operation in God&#8217;s economy. The term &#8220;the God of all grace&#8221; is unique; it is found in the New Testament only in 1 Peter 5:10. Peter does not say merely that God is the God of grace; he says that God is the God of all grace. As believers, we should be encouraged by the fact that our God is the God of all grace. This divine grace is an outstanding attribute of our God who has favored us with it in Christ.<h2 class=head1>R. PEACE</h2><p>Another attribute of God is peace. The New Testament speaks about both the peace of God and the God of peace. Concerning the God of peace, Romans 16:20 says, &#8220;The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.&#8221; Concerning the peace of God, Philippians 4:7 says, &#8220;And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.&#8221; The peace of God is actually God as peace, infused into us through our fellowship with Him by prayer, as the counterpoise of troubles and the antidote to anxiety (John 16:33). The God of peace mounts guards over our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus. He patrols before our hearts and thoughts in Christ.<p>The peace of God and the God of peace are one. When God is with us, peace is with us also. The genuine peace we enjoy is God Himself. The way to enjoy the God of peace is by praying to have fellowship with Him.<p>In 1 Thessalonians 5:23 Paul says, &#8220;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly.&#8221; Here we see that the God of peace is the Sanctifier. His sanctification brings in peace. When we are wholly sanctified by Him from within, we enjoy His peace in every way.<p>In our experience peace is a condition that results from grace, that issues from the enjoyment of God our Father. When we enjoy God as grace, we are in a condition that is full of rest and satisfaction. This is peace. Grace is a substance, whereas peace is a condition. The substance of grace is God Himself, and the condition of peace is that which issues out of our enjoyment of God as grace. We all can testify of the peace we have when we enjoy God as grace. We have the divine substance as our enjoyment, and we have the heavenly condition. This is the peace which we enjoy.<p>The fact that peace is the issue of grace is indicated by the way Paul greets the saints in Ephesians 1:2 and in other Epistles: &#8220;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; This peace results from the enjoyment of God as grace which is also an attribute of the God whom we enjoy in Christ.<h2 class=head1>S. JOY</h2><p>Romans 15:13 says, &#8220;The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace,&#8221; indicating that joy is one of God&#8217;s attributes. God is the God of enjoyment. In our experience, if we enjoy God as grace, we shall have peace, and if we have peace, we shall have joy.<h2 class=head1>T. HOPE</h2><p>Romans 15:13 speaks twice of hope which is also one of God&#8217;s attributes. &#8220;The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; God is the God of hope. When He fills us with joy and peace, we abound in hope. Those who are without joy and peace cannot have hope. But if we enjoy God as grace and thereby have peace and joy, we shall be full of hope.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS ATTRIBUTES</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>In this message we shall conclude our study of God&#8217;s attributes.<h2 class=head1>U. ENCOURAGEMENT</h2><p>In Romans 15:5 God is called the God of encouragement. Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 1:3 says, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement.&#8221; Encouragement, as an attribute of God, is slightly different from comfort and consolation. The Greek word rendered encouragement in 2 Corinthians 1:3 has the sense of cheered. Encouragement is related to hope. If we have hope, we shall have encouragement.<p>Paul experienced God as the God of all encouragement. In 2 Corinthians 1:4 he testifies that the God of encouragement &#8220;encourages us in all our affliction, that we may be able to encourage those who are in every affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God.&#8221; First we need to experience the encouragement of God. Then we shall be able to encourage others with the encouragement we have experienced of God. Hence, we are encouraged so that we may be able to encourage others. This requires experience.<h2 class=head1>V. KINDNESS</h2><p>The New Testament reveals the divine attribute of kindness. Romans 2:4 says, &#8220;Do you despise the riches of His kindness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?&#8221; Romans 11:22, speaking of the kindness of God and His severity, emphasizes the attribute of God&#8217;s kindness. Furthermore, Ephesians 2:7 declares, &#8220;That He might display in the ages which are coming the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Kindness is a benevolent goodness which issues out of mercy and love. It is in such kindness that the grace of God is given to us. Titus 3:4-5 says, &#8220;When the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared,...He saved us.&#8221; It is the kindness and love of our Savior God that has saved us and made us different from others.<h2 class=head1>W. FORBEARANCE</h2><p>Regarding the way God deals with sinners, Romans 2:4 refers to His excellent attribute of forbearance. God forbears with fallen man for a purpose. His purpose in showing forbearance is to accomplish His economy. If God did not show forbearance to man, there would be no way for God to fulfill His purpose of accomplishing His economy.<p>The Bible reveals that in His economy God has exercised great forbearance. Immediately after the fall of man, God began to show forbearance in His dealings with man. If you read Genesis 3 from the viewpoint of forbearance, you will see how forbearing God was with fallen man. God exercised His understanding, fully realizing man&#8217;s situation and need. God also exercised His wisdom to deal with fallen man.<p>For the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, for the carrying out of His economy, God has always exercised forbearance. With His forbearance, it is full of understanding, wisdom, patience, consideration, sympathy, mercy, kindness, love, and grace. Even the rich supply of life is included in God&#8217;s forbearance. God never commands us to do anything without considering our need and granting us His supply. God&#8217;s forbearance always includes His adequate supply to meet our need.<p>God dealt with different people in different ways. He dealt with Adam in one way, with Abel in another way, and with Cain in yet another way. In this we see God&#8217;s forbearance.<p>In the Scriptures there are different dispensations, different ways, God deals with man. These dispensations are actually related to forbearance. For God to deal with people in a particular way during a certain age is for Him to show forbearance.<p>God makes known His forbearance by dealing with us in a way that is reasonable, suitable, and considerate. God never disciplines anyone without proper consideration. He often waits a long period of time before chastising someone. God certainly is forbearing in dealing with us.<h2 class=head1>X. LONGSUFFERING</h2><p>Romans 2:4 also speaks of God&#8217;s longsuffering. This also is a divine attribute. Longsuffering is something more than patience. It means to suffer long. &#8220;Longsuffering is that quality of self-restraint in the face of provocation which does not hastily retaliate or promptly punish; it is the opposite of anger, and it is associated with mercy&#8221; (Hogg and Vine).<h2 class=head1>Y. ENDURANCE</h2><p>In Romans 15:5 God is called the God of endurance. How shall we differentiate longsuffering and endurance? Longsuffering is patience toward the troubling persons, whereas endurance is patience toward the afflicting things. Toward us who give Him trouble, God has His longsuffering; toward the troubles we make, He has endurance. Both longsuffering and endurance are His attributes, which we, as His children should participate in toward people and environment.<h2 class=head1>Z. JEALOUSY</h2><p>Second Corinthians 11:2 says, &#8220;For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.&#8221; Jealousy is usually regarded as a negative thing, but it is one of God&#8217;s attributes. The most jealous one in the universe is God. He is jealous whenever we love anything or anyone in place of Him. He wants us to love Him uniquely, singly, wholly.<p>The jealousy of God is like the jealousy of a husband over his wife. No husband could tolerate his wife&#8217;s loving another man besides him. Likewise, God is jealous over us. Jealousy, therefore, is one of His attributes.<p>Knowing that our God is jealous, we should let His jealousy be ours that we would care only for Him, love Him, and allow no one and nothing to replace Him in our hearts. Furthermore, our love for Him should be pure, our mind should be single, and our entire being should be focused on Him. As the jealous One, He cannot tolerate anyone who does not love Him solely and wholly.<h2 class=head1>AA. SEVERITY</h2><p>Romans 11:22 shows that another attribute of God is severity: &#8220;Behold then the kindness and severity of God; on those who fell, severity; but on you the kindness of God, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.&#8221; God has both kindness and severity. Although He is kind, He is also very severe. Both kindness and severity are divine attributes.<h2 class=head1>BB. IMPARTIALITY</h2><p>Impartiality is an attribute of God. Concerning this, Peter says in Acts 10:34, &#8220;I surely perceive that God is not a respecter of persons.&#8221; In Romans 2:11 Paul says, &#8220;There is no respect of persons with God.&#8221; Furthermore, in Ephesians 6:9 Paul says, &#8220;The masters, do the same things toward them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in the heavens, and there is no respect of persons with Him.&#8221; These verses also indicate that God is impartial.<h2 class=head1>CC. IMMORTALITY</h2><p>First Timothy 6:16 declares that God &#8220;alone has immortality.&#8221; Literally, the Greek word for &#8220;immortality&#8221; is athanasia, which means deathlessness, denoting freedom from death. Only God possesses immortality in Himself; immortality is an essential element of His being.<h2 class=head1>DD. IMMUTABILITY</h2><p>Another of God&#8217;s attributes is immutability. For God to be immutable means that He is not changeable or variable. Regarding this attribute, James 1:17 says, &#8220;All good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no variableness or shadow cast by turning.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;variableness&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;variation.&#8221; The Father is the Creator, the source, of the lights, of the heavenly luminaries. With Him there is no shadow cast by turning, as there is with the heavenly orbs in the moon turning its dark side to us, or in the sun being eclipsed by the moon, for He is not variable, not changeable. Because God is unchangeable, immutable, Hebrews 6:17 speaks of &#8220;the unchangeableness of His counsel.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>EE. GLORY</h2><p>Another marvelous attribute of God is glory. Acts 7:2 says, &#8220;The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham.&#8221; Acts 7:55 says, &#8220;Looking intently into heaven, he [Stephen] saw the glory of God.&#8221; Glory is the expression of God, God expressed in splendor. God&#8217;s glory was a great attraction to Abraham, separating him from the world unto God. God&#8217;s glory was also a great encouragement and strength, enabling Abraham to follow God (Gen. 12:1, 4).<p>Second Peter 1:3 says that God has called us to, or by, His own glory. Furthermore, 1 Peter 5:10 says that God has called us into His eternal glory. According to 2 Timothy 2:10, God&#8217;s salvation is with eternal glory. This indicates that eternal glory is the ultimate goal of God&#8217;s salvation (Rom. 8:21). God&#8217;s salvation leads us into His glory (Heb. 2:10).<p>In the Gospel of John we read that the Word, who was God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, and that we beheld His glory (John 1:1, 14). John 1:18 goes on to say, &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&#8221; There is glory in the declaration of God. When we see God, we see glory.<p>Romans 3:23 says, &#8220;All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.&#8221; Man was made by God in His image in order that man may express Him for His glory. But man sinned. Now instead of expressing God, man expresses sin and his sinful self. Therefore, man is short of God&#8217;s glory. Nevertheless, we have been ordained for God&#8217;s glory and called to it (1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Thes. 2:12). As believers, we are being transformed into this glory (2 Cor. 3:18) and shall be brought into it (Heb. 2:10). Eventually we shall be glorified with Christ (Rom. 8:17, 30) to bear the glory of God for God&#8217;s expression in the New Jerusalem.<p>Romans 9:23 says, &#8220;What if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory.&#8221; God created us as His vessels to contain Him and express Him. God makes known the riches of His glory upon us, His vessels, which He has prepared unto glory. We were predestinated by His sovereignty to be His containers, vessels of honor, to express what He is in glory. This will be fully revealed in the New Jerusalem.<p>An outstanding feature of the New Jerusalem is that it has the glory of God (Rev. 21:11), His expression. The entire city of New Jerusalem will bear the glory of God, which is God Himself shining out through the city. Actually, the glory of God will be the content of the New Jerusalem, for this city will be completely filled with His glory. This indicates that the city is a vessel to contain God and express Him. The glory of God is actually God Himself being manifested. The fact that the New Jerusalem is full of God&#8217;s glory means that God is manifested in this city. The church life today should also have God&#8217;s glory, manifesting and expressing Him in this marvelous divine attribute.<h2 class=head1>FF. HONOR</h2><p>Revelation 4:9 says that the living creatures &#8220;give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever.&#8221; Revelation 5:13 says, &#8220;And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying: To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.&#8221; These verses from Revelation indicate that honor is another attribute of God. Whereas glory-God Himself expressed-refers to a condition, honor refers to a high position, in particular to the dignity that is related to such a position.<h2 class=head1>GG. MAJESTY</h2><p>Another attribute of God is majesty. Jude 25 says, &#8220;To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority before all time, and now, and unto all eternity. Amen.&#8221; Here majesty denotes greatness in honor. The fact that God has the attribute of majesty indicates that He is the greatest One with His dignity. We may also say that majesty is the totality of glory and honor. Because God has glory and honor, He also has majesty.<h2 class=head1>HH. SOVEREIGNTY</h2><p>God not only has glory, honor, and majesty; He also has sovereignty. Sovereignty is also one of God&#8217;s attributes. He is sovereign. Sovereignty indicates God&#8217;s unlimited authority and power. God&#8217;s position is also unlimited. We are not able to say how high is God&#8217;s position. Likewise, we cannot measure God&#8217;s glory and majesty. As the sovereign One, there is no limit to His authority, power, and position.<p>Although the words &#8220;sovereign&#8221; or &#8220;sovereignty&#8221; are not used in Romans 9:20 and 21, these verses certainly refer to God&#8217;s sovereignty: &#8220;But, O man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, Why did you make me thus? Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?&#8221; We all need to realize who we are. We are God&#8217;s creatures, and He is our Creator. As His creatures, we should not resist His purpose (v. 19) or answer back to Him, the Creator. This is the reason Paul asks, &#8220;Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, Why did you make me thus?&#8221; Paul then goes on to indicate that as the Potter God has authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor. God is the Potter, and we are the clay. As the Potter, God is sovereign. He has authority over the clay. If He wills, He can make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor. This does not depend on our choice-it depends on God&#8217;s sovereignty.<p>These verses from Romans 9 indicate that God has sovereignly created us to be His vessels, His containers, according to His predestination. Second Timothy 2:20 and 21 convey the same thought, saying that we are vessels unto honor. However, being vessels unto honor is not the result of our choice; it originates with God&#8217;s sovereignty. It is of God&#8217;s sovereignty that He makes His glory known by creating vessels of mercy to contain Himself. This is a deep word. God&#8217;s sovereignty is the basis of His selection. His selection depends on His sovereignty.<p>In Romans 9:22 Paul continues, &#8220;What if God, willing to show forth His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction?&#8221; What should we say about this? We have nothing to say. God is the Potter, and He has the authority. Human beings are simply clay.<p>In Romans 9:23 and 24 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;And what if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory, even us, whom He has also called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the nations?&#8221; This depends on God&#8217;s sovereignty. God has the authority to make the ones He has selected and called, not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles, vessels of mercy to contain Him in order that His glory might be manifested. According to His sovereign authority, He has prepared us unto this glory. We were predestinated by His sovereignty to be His containers. This is the climax of our usefulness to God. This is the goal of God&#8217;s selection according to His sovereignty.<h2 class=head1>II. AUTHORITY</h2><p>Jude 25 indicates that God has authority as one of His attributes. Authority is power in ruling. Regarding the divine attribute of authority, the Lord Jesus says in Luke 12:5, &#8220;I will show you whom you should fear: fear Him who, after killing, has authority to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear this One.&#8221; God alone has the authority to cast one into Gehenna.<p>A policeman in uniform illustrates the difference between power and authority. Although the policeman may not have much strength, he has the authority to direct traffic. A boxer, on the contrary, may have much more strength than a policeman, but he does not have any authority. Authority is greater than power. God, of course, has both authority and power.<h2 class=head1>JJ. POWER</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:24 speaks of God&#8217;s power, which is a crucial item of the divine attributes. &#8220;To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God&#8217;s power and God&#8217;s wisdom.&#8221; Christ crucified is God&#8217;s power. This power of God destroys Satan, judges the world, deals with sin, crucifies the fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation, and annuls the ordinances. It is the power of crucifixion, the power of the wonderful death of Christ. This power not only deals with the negative things, but also carries out God&#8217;s plan. Whereas the divine wisdom is for God&#8217;s planning and purposing, the divine power is for carrying out what is planned and purposed by God.<p>Ephesians 1:19 says, &#8220;The surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength.&#8221; God&#8217;s power toward us is surpassingly great. It is according to the operation of the might of His strength. It is the power which God wrought in Christ (Eph. 1:20a). God&#8217;s power toward us is the same power which God wrought in Christ. First it has raised Christ from among the dead. This power has overcome death and Hades where the dead are held. Because of this power, death and Hades could not hold Christ (Acts 2:24).<p>Second, God&#8217;s great power which God wrought in Christ has seated Him at God&#8217;s right hand in the heavenlies far above all (Eph. 1:20b-21). God&#8217;s right hand, where Christ has been seated by the surpassingly great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place of supreme authority.<p>Third, God&#8217;s great power which God wrought in Christ has subjected all things under Christ&#8217;s feet (Eph. 1:22a). To seat Christ far above all is one thing; to subject all things under His feet is another. The former is Christ&#8217;s transcendency; the latter is the subjection of all things to Him.<p>Fourth, God&#8217;s great power which God wrought in Christ gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church (Eph. l:22b). The headship of Christ over all things is a gift from God to Him. It was by God&#8217;s great power that Christ received the headship in the universe.<p>In these verses God&#8217;s great power which God wrought in Christ, is revealed in four aspects: resurrection power, transcending power, subjecting power, and heading-up power. This fourfold power is to the church. The phrase &#8220;to the church&#8221; in verse 22 implies a transmission. Whatever Christ, the Head, has attained and obtained is now being transmitted to the church, His Body.<p>Actually, God&#8217;s great power which He wrought in Christ is the Triune God, who has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and who has been installed in us as the all-inclusive power. The Apostle Paul prayed that we may have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know the surpassing greatness of this divine power. Surely we need to pray the same prayer!<h2 class=head1>KK. STRENGTH</h2><p>Ephesians 1:19 speaks of the might of God&#8217;s strength, and Revelation 5:12 also refers to it. God has the attribute of strength as well as power. Inherently God has strength. According to M. R. Vincent, the Greek word ischuos for strength in Ephesians 1:19 and Revelation 5:12 denotes indwelling strength. It is intrinsic, not outward.<h2 class=head1>LL. MIGHT</h2><p>Finally, God has the attribute of might. Ephesians 1:19 speaks of &#8220;the might of His strength.&#8221; Revelation 1:6 declares, &#8220;To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever.&#8221; In Revelation 5:13 all the creatures say, &#8220;To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.&#8221; Jude 25 ascribes might to God, and 1 Timothy 6:16 says that to Him should be &#8220;honor and eternal might.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;might&#8221; (kratos) denotes manifested power. Strength is greater than might, power is greater than strength, authority is greater than power, and sovereignty is greater than authority. Our God has might, strength, power, authority, and sovereignty. All these are His attributes.<p>In these messages we have seen the many aspects of what God is in His person. We have also considered God&#8217;s attributes. This God is now dispensing Himself into us. This means that God with all that He is and with all that He has is being dispensed into us. The more we are under God&#8217;s dispensing, the more the divine attributes are infused into our being. While God is dispensing Himself into us, He is dispensing all that He is and has.<p>Let us quickly review the divine attributes: life, love, light, riches, fullness, holiness, righteousness, wisdom, prudence, faithfulness, truthfulness, simplicity, sincerity, goodness, mercy, compassion, grace, peace, joy, hope, encouragement, kindness, forbearance, longsuffering, endurance, jealousy, severity, impartiality, immortality, immutability, glory, honor, majesty, sovereignty, authority, power, strength, and might. How wonderful that these attributes are being dispensed into us! As we remain under God&#8217;s dispensing day by day, His attributes will be dispensed and infused into us. After God&#8217;s attributes have been dispensed and infused into us, they will all become our virtues.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWELVE</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS GOOD PLEASURE</h1><p>In this message we shall consider:<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S GOOD PLEASURE-GOD&#8217;S HEART&#8217;S DESIRE</h2><p>Ephesians 1:5 says, &#8220;Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&#8221; Ephesians 1:9 goes on to say, &#8220;Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself.&#8221; God has a will in which is His good pleasure. This good pleasure is the desire of His heart. God&#8217;s good pleasure is the delight of His heart.<h2 class=head1>A. TO HAVE MANY SONS</h2><p>God&#8217;s good pleasure, God&#8217;s heart&#8217;s desire, is to have many sons. God has predestinated us, marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4), unto a certain destiny. The destiny of God&#8217;s marking us out beforehand is sonship. The goal of God&#8217;s predestination is to have many sons. This is God&#8217;s heart&#8217;s desire and is emphatically revealed in the book of Romans.<p>The central thought of the book of Romans is that God&#8217;s salvation makes sinners His sons with His life and nature to express Him so that they may become constituents of the Body of Christ for His expression.<p>Romans 8:14 says, &#8220;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&#8221; The Spirit&#8217;s leading in our daily life is a sign that we are the sons of God. As sons of God, we have God&#8217;s life and nature. The Spirit&#8217;s leading always corresponds with God&#8217;s life and nature to prove that we are sons of God.<p>Romans 8:15 says, &#8220;You have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.&#8221; As sons of God, we cry, &#8220;Abba, Father.&#8221; Through the dispensing of the Triune God, we have truly become God&#8217;s sons in life; hence, we can call Him, &#8220;Abba, Father.&#8221; As sons of God, we have within us the life of God, the nature of God, and the Spirit of the Son of God.<p>Romans 8:29 goes on to say, &#8220;Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.&#8221; In the initial stage we are children of God (Rom. 8:16). In the advanced stage we are sons of God (Rom. 8:14). Romans 8:29 does not say that we shall be conformed to the image of the children of God; it says that we shall be conformed to the image of the Son of God. Through the process of conformation, the firstborn Son of God, Jesus Christ, will have many brothers. As the Son of God, Christ was the unique, only begotten Son. Now through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, He has become the firstborn Son of God, and the many sons of God, who are His brothers, are being conformed to His image.<p>In Romans 1:4 the Firstborn of God is designated, but in 8:29 the many sons of God are conformed. The designation of the Firstborn of God is the work on the prototype; the conformation of the many sons of God is the work of mass production. Having gained the prototype, God is now seeking to have the mass production in order to produce many sons in the image of the Firstborn.<p>God&#8217;s goal according to His good pleasure, the desire of His heart, is to produce many sons. This goal of producing many sons of God requires redemption, the imparting of life, and the living by this life so that they may be regenerated, transformed, and conformed to the image of the Firstborn of God. God uses His firstborn Son as a prototype, a model, a pattern, to produce many sons. Thus, God&#8217;s only begotten Son has become the Firstborn among many brothers. This is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God into us.<p>Hebrews 2:10 says that God is &#8220;leading many sons into glory.&#8221; The many sons here are the many brothers in Romans 8:29. The last step of God&#8217;s great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory. Romans 8 tells us that God&#8217;s work of grace upon us began with His foreknowing through His predestination, calling, and justification and will end with His glorification (vv. 29-30). Romans 8 also says that the whole creation eagerly expects the revelation, the glorification, of the sons of God, hoping that the creation itself will enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (vv. 19-21). This will take place at the Lord&#8217;s coming back, at which time we shall appear with Him in glory (Col. 3:4). This glorification of the sons of God, as the goal of God&#8217;s salvation, will last through the millennial kingdom and will be manifested in full in the New Jerusalem for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23).<p>The Triune God is still working today to bring His many sons into glory. We are sons of God, but we are not yet in glory. One day we shall all be in glory. That will be the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). Our body has not yet been redeemed, but one day it will be transfigured into a glorious body (Phil. 3:21). This redemption of our body is our full sonship.<p>Revelation 21:7 says, &#8220;He who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he shall be a son to Me.&#8221; This speaks of the sons of God in eternity in the New Jerusalem. Here &#8220;overcomes&#8221; means to overcome by believing, as in 1 John 5:4 and 5. This overcoming qualifies all believers to participate in the New Jerusalem with all its enjoyment as a common portion of God&#8217;s eternal salvation for His sons. Actually, the sons of God in the New Jerusalem will be the constituents of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be a composition of all the regenerated sons of God to fulfill the desire of God&#8217;s heart.<h2 class=head1>B. FOR THE EXPRESSION OF HIS SON</h2><p>It is God&#8217;s good pleasure, the desire of His heart, to have many sons for the expression of His Son. As we have seen, Romans 8:29 says that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son. To have us conformed to the image of His Son is for the expression of His Son. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &#8220;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.&#8221; This corresponds with Romans 8:29 that we, the sons of God, should be transformed and conformed to the image of the Son of God to express Him. In Philippians 1:20, the Apostle Paul, one of God&#8217;s many sons, says that Christ shall be magnified in his body, whether through life or through death. This is to express the Son of God. In Philippians 1:21 Paul continues to say, &#8220;To me to live is Christ.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s life was one that expressed Christ the Son of God. First John 3:2 says, &#8220;If He is manifested, we shall be like Him.&#8221; To be like the Lord is also to express the Son of God. According to God&#8217;s desire and His plan, we, as the sons of God, should express His Son today, and we are destined to express His Son at the coming of His Son.<p>Concerning the expression of the Son of God, Ephesians 1:23 indicates that His Body is the fullness of the One who fills all in all. This fullness is the expression of Christ the Son of God. Christ, who is the embodiment of the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such a great Christ needs the Body, constituted of the many sons of God, for His complete expression. As the expression of the unsearchably rich Christ, the church is the unlimited expression of the unlimited Christ. The church is the fullness of Christ, who is Himself the embodiment of the fullness of God (Col. 2:9). It is God&#8217;s desire that the church today be such an expression of Christ, His Son. Eventually in Revelation 21 the New Jerusalem, which is the composition of all the sons of God (Rev. 21:7) and the consummation of the church, will be a corporate expression of Christ the Son of God, who will be the temple within the holy city and the lamp to shine out through the city (vv. 22-23).<h2 class=head1>C. THAT HE MAY BE EXPRESSED IN THE SON THROUGH THE SPIRIT</h2><p>God desires to have many sons for the expression of His Son so that He may be expressed in the Son through the Spirit. Through the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, the firstborn Son of God, God has produced millions of sons. These sons are for the expression of His Son. God&#8217;s desire is to have many sons to express His Son, who is now the Firstborn among many brothers. When this Son is expressed, God is expressed in the Son through the Spirit.<p>Paul refers to the expression of God in Ephesians 3:19 when he speaks of our being &#8220;filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8221; The fullness of God here is the corporate expression of God by the church. To be filled unto all the fullness of God is to be filled with the result that we, as the church, become the corporate expression of God. In Ephesians 3 Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us with power through His Spirit into our inner man so that Christ might make His home in our hearts and that we might know Christ&#8217;s dimensions-the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth-that we might be filled unto, resulting in, the fullness of God, which is His corporate expression, the church.<p>In Ephesians 3:19 we have the expression of God, and in Ephesians 3:16 we have a word concerning the Spirit. God&#8217;s many sons are the expression of His Son so that God Himself may be expressed in the Son through the Spirit. This is God&#8217;s good pleasure, His heart&#8217;s desire.<h2 class=head1>D. BY HIS DISPENSING</h2><p>For God to be expressed in the Son through the Spirit needs God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people to produce a corporate expression. In Ephesians 3 the Father answers and fulfills the apostle&#8217;s prayer through the Spirit that Christ the Son may make His home in our hearts. As a result, we are filled unto the fullness of God. This is the dispensing of the Triune God into our being for His corporate expression. This expression is in the church today, and it will consummate in the New Jerusalem, the eternal corporate expression of the Triune God.<p>God desires to dispense Himself into His chosen people for the producing of the church so that He may be expressed in a corporate way. We have seen the many aspects of God&#8217;s person and the items of His attributes. All the aspects of God&#8217;s person and all the items of His attributes are the ingredients of God as our food to be dispensed into our being.<h2 class=head1>E. LIFE AS THE MEANS AND EATING AS THE WAY</h2><p>According to Genesis 1, God created man in His image with the intention of dispensing Himself into man. The way this dispensing is carried out is portrayed in chapter two of Genesis. God&#8217;s way to dispense Himself into man is through man&#8217;s eating of Him as the tree of life. The eating of the tree of life implies two things: first, that life is the means for God to dispense Himself into us; second, that eating is the way God is dispensed into us. If we would have God&#8217;s dispensing, we need both life as the means and eating as the way.<p>The matter of eating is found throughout the Bible, from the beginning in Genesis to the end in Revelation. We have the tree of life in Genesis 2, and we have the tree of life again in Revelation 22. Between Genesis 2 and Revelation 22 there is a line related to eating. At the time of the Passover the children of Israel ate the meat of the lamb in order to receive the life supply (Exo. 12:3-5, 8-9). Then in the wilderness they were sustained by manna (Exo. 16:14-15). Manna was their food, and by eating manna they received the supply of life. Eventually, the children of Israel entered into the good land, and there they enjoyed the rich produce of the land (Josh. 5:12). Three times a year the people came together to eat the produce of the good land before God and with God. In their feasts they were eating, and God was eating as well.<p>In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus in John 6 says that He is the bread of life and that we need to eat Him (vv. 35, 51, 56-57). If we eat Him as the bread of life, we shall live by Him. Paul speaks also about eating the spiritual food in his Epistles. In 1 Corinthians 10:3 he says, &#8220;All ate the same spiritual food.&#8221; In Revelation 2:7 and 22:14 the Lord speaks about eating the tree of life.<p>The record regarding the spiritual eating in the Bible is a strong indication and implication that God intends to dispense Himself into our being by means of life and by the way of eating. God is life to us, and the way we take Him as life is to eat Him. God is our food, and we eat Him. God is not only our food-He is our feast. This is revealed in the Scriptures.<p>God is not mainly teaching us but dispensing Himself into us. God&#8217;s dispensing is a divine feeding. God is constantly feeding us. He feeds us with Himself as food.<p>During the past centuries there have been those who received God&#8217;s dispensing, the saints who contacted God all the time. Even though they may not have known the word &#8220;dispensing&#8221; or had the adequate knowledge about eating God, they took God into them as their food. For the most part, they ate God by eating the Word. The Word conveys God as its content. Apart from God as the content of the Word, the Word is empty. Hence, to eat the words of the Bible is actually to eat God conveyed in the Word. In the past, the godly ones who spent much time contacting God spontaneously and even unconsciously were under God&#8217;s dispensing. The aspects of God&#8217;s person and the items of His attributes are infused into us as the ingredients of God as our food by His dispensing. We may not be able to remember all the aspects of God&#8217;s person or all the items of His attributes, but as long as we are under His dispensing, these ingredients are infused into us. Simply eat God, and all that He is and has will be dispensed into you. Eating is the way to experience God&#8217;s dispensing for His expression.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS MANIFESTATION</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw that God&#8217;s good pleasure, God&#8217;s heart&#8217;s desire, is to have many sons for the expression of His Son so that He may be expressed in the Son through the Spirit. For this purpose, God has manifested Himself, first in Christ as an individual expression in the flesh and then in the church, the Body of Christ, as the enlarged corporate expression in the flesh. Ultimately, God will be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the consummated corporate expression in the new heaven and new earth. In this message we shall consider God&#8217;s manifestation in these three stages.<h2 class=head1>A. IN CHRIST AS AN INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION IN THE FLESH</h2><p>God&#8217;s manifestation was first in Christ as an individual expression in the flesh. Concerning this, Colossians 2:9 says, &#8220;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; In this verse &#8220;fullness&#8221; does not refer to the riches of God; instead, it refers to the expression of the riches of God. What dwells in Christ is the expression of the riches of what God is. We need to see that the fullness of the Godhead is the expression of the Godhead and that this expression is in Christ individually.<p>Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead. This means that the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily form. The fact that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that it dwells in Him in a way that is both real and practical. This implies the physical body which Christ put on in His humanity. It indicates that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ as the One who has a human body. Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but it did not dwell in Him bodily. After He became incarnate, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in Him in a bodily way. Thus, He is the manifestation of God, the individual expression of God, in the flesh.<p>The expression &#8220;the fullness of the Godhead&#8221; refers to the entire Godhead, to the complete God, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Because the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, it would not be correct to say that the fullness of the Godhead includes only God the Son and not also God the Father and God the Spirit. Since the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the fullness of the Godhead must be the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, Christ is not only the Son of God but the entire God.<p>John 1:1 and 14 also reveal that God was manifested in Christ as an individual expression in the flesh. Verse 1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; In verse 14, this Word, which is God, became flesh. This refers to the incarnated Christ. In the beginning He was not only with God but He is the very God. The incarnated Christ is God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16).<p>John 1 further says, &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#8221; (v. 18). This tells us that Christ, being the only begotten Son of God, is the expression of God. No one has ever seen God, yet He declares God. The Father is the invisible God, the hidden God; Christ is the manifested God.<p>When we say that Christ is the Word, we are saying that He is the expression of God. I may have a great deal of feeling within me, but if I have no words, my feelings cannot be expressed. But when my feelings are expressed in words, then you are able to understand them. Christ is the Word of God. Although no one knows God, Christ as the Word speaks for God, defines God, and even declares God.<p>Because God is abstract, mysterious, and invisible, there is the need for God to be the Word in order to explain Himself, define Himself, and reveal Himself. The Word in John 1:1 refers to the defined God, the explained and expressed God, the God revealed and made known to human beings. This Word is our Lord Jesus Christ, the living Word of God. The Word is the embodiment of the Triune God. Although the Triune God is mysterious, He is nonetheless embodied in the Word. The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of the mysterious and invisible God. The Triune God embodied in the Word is explained, defined, and expressed.<p>In John 1:14, the Word, the embodiment of the Triune God, became flesh. In the incarnated Christ God is expressed in a man in the flesh. This is according to God&#8217;s plan. God&#8217;s plan is to manifest Himself in man and through man in the flesh.<p>John 1:14 continues to say that the Word, after becoming flesh &#8220;tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father), full of grace and reality.&#8221; This indicates that the Word was incarnated to declare God. As the manifestation of God, Christ declared God in a way that was full of grace and reality. He declared God by presenting Himself as grace and reality. God, the very God of enjoyment, becomes grace and reality to us in Christ for our enjoyment. Through enjoying Him we gain Him as grace and reality. He declares God to man in the way of enjoyment.<p>When we enjoy God in Christ as grace and realize Him in Christ as reality, we find the unsearchable riches of Christ. John 1:16 says, &#8220;Of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.&#8221; In the incarnated Christ dwells all the fullness, the expression of the riches of God (Col. 2:9). Through His incarnation in Christ, we can receive the riches of grace and reality out of His divine fullness.<p>Christ as the Father&#8217;s only begotten Son declared God by the Word, life, light, grace, and reality (John 1:1, 4, 9, 14). The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized. It is by these things that God is declared in the Son as His individual expression. Christ explained, defined, declared, and expressed God, by being the Word incarnated to be life and light to man with grace and reality for man&#8217;s enjoyment. It is in this way, God was declared to man in the Son.<h2 class=head1>B. IN THE CHURCH-THE BODY OF CHRIST-<br>AS THE ENLARGED CORPORATE EXPRESSION IN THE FLESH</h2><p>We have pointed out that the fullness of God is the expression of God. According to John 1:16, the fullness of God came with Christ, who is the embodiment of God&#8217;s fullness. With Christ, the expression of God was an individual matter. This expression needs to be enlarged from an individual to a corporate expression. The church is to be the enlarged corporate expression of God in the flesh. This means that the church should be the fullness, the expression of God, in a corporate way. In the church God is expressed not through an individual but corporately through the Body of Christ. Because the fullness of God is embodied in the church, the church is the corporate expression of the Triune God.<p>First Timothy 3:15 and 16 indicate that God is manifested in the church-the Body of Christ-as the enlarged corporate expression in the flesh: &#8220;The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness, who was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.&#8221; In Greek the antecedent of &#8220;who&#8221; is omitted but easily recognized, that is, Christ who was God manifested in the flesh as the mystery of godliness. The transition from &#8220;the mystery...&#8221; to &#8220;who&#8221; implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness (Col. 1:27; Gal. 2:20). This mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living is also the manifestation of God in the flesh.<p>These verses imply that not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body is the manifestation of God in the flesh. When a church grows in Christ with the growth of God (Col. 2:19), it will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world. Then the church becomes the continuation of Christ&#8217;s manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness-Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh.<p>In 1 Timothy 3:15, the Greek word for &#8220;house&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;household.&#8221; The household, the family, of God is the house of God. The house and the household are one thing-the assembly of the believers (Eph. 2:19; Heb. 3:6). The reality of this house as the dwelling place of the living God is in our spirit (Eph. 2:22). We need to live in our spirit so that God can be manifested in this house as the living God.<p>The church, as the house and household of the living God, is the pillar and base of the truth. The pillar supports the building, and the base holds the pillar. The church is such a supporting pillar and holding base of the truth. The truth is the reality, referring to the real things which are revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. This economy is composed of Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the contents of the reality of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. The church as the house and household of the living God is both the pillar which bears the truth, the reality of God&#8217;s New Testament economy, and the base which upholds the pillar.<p>Such a church is the continuation, the enlargement and expansion of God manifested in the flesh. This manifestation of God is the church as the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth. The church is, then, the increase, the enlargement, of the manifestation of God in the flesh. This is God manifested in the flesh in a wider way. This is according to the New Testament principle of incarnation, which is God manifested in the flesh.<p>First Timothy 3:16 begins with the words, &#8220;And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness.&#8221; The conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; here indicates that the speaking about the church in verse 15 is not finished yet, and that the church is something even more than the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. The church is also the mystery of godliness. According to the context, godliness refers to the living of God in the church, that is, God as life lived out in the church to be expressed. The church life is the expression of God. Both Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the mystery of godliness, expressing God in the flesh.<h2 class=head1>C. IN THE NEW JERUSALEM AS THE CONSUMMATE CORPORATE EXPRESSION IN THE NEW CREATION</h2><p>The final stage of God&#8217;s manifestation will be in the New Jerusalem as the consummated corporate expression in the new creation. Revelation 21:1-3 says, &#8220;I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more. And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men and He shall tabernacle with them.&#8221; In eternity past God purposed to have a corporate expression so that He might be fully expressed and glorified (Eph. 3:9-11; 1:9-11). For this, He created the heavens, the earth, and mankind. Eventually, the old heaven and the old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed into the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 3:10-13) into which the New Jerusalem will come for God&#8217;s eternal expression.<h2 class=head2>1. The Holy City</h2><p>The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the holy city, &#8220;the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem&#8221; (Heb. 12:22). The designation &#8220;holy city&#8221; signifies that the New Jerusalem is a city sanctified and separated unto God for fulfilling His purpose. It is both sanctified and separated unto God positionally and sanctified and saturated with God dispositionally. It is holy both extrinsically and intrinsically. It is an entity, entirely and thoroughly holy, that fits in with God&#8217;s holy nature for God&#8217;s expression to fulfill His heart&#8217;s desire.<p>Today the church, as the manifestation of God in the flesh, is the house of God, whereas in the new heaven and new earth the New Jerusalem, as the manifestation of God in the new creation, will be the city of God. The city is much bigger than the house, signifying that the New Jerusalem, as the manifestation of God in His new creation, will be the enlargement and consummation of the church to express God in eternity.<p>As the old Jerusalem was the center and capital of God&#8217;s kingdom in the nation of Israel, the New Jerusalem will be the administrative center of the eternal kingdom of God in the new universe for the manifestation of God for the ages to come.<p>At the beginning of the Scripture in God&#8217;s old creation there was a garden, the garden of Eden (Gen. 2:8). At the end of the Scripture in God&#8217;s new creation there will be a city, the city of the New Jerusalem. The garden and the city at the two ends of the Scripture reflect each other, with the tree of life which is in both of them as the link (Gen. 2:9; Rev. 22:2). The garden was the issue of God&#8217;s creation; whereas the city will be the consummation of God&#8217;s building, a building which God has been carrying out through all the dispensations: the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of the law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom, of the old creation. Out of His old creation through all the dispensations, God has been doing His building work in the way of regeneration and resurrection. The ultimate result and the ultimate consummation of this building work will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as God&#8217;s manifestation in His new creation for eternity. It is not a creation by God&#8217;s divine power in the way to call things not being as being; but it is a building by God&#8217;s divine life in the way to regenerate the things which exist with the resurrection life that they may be one with God in His divine life and nature for His expression.<h2 class=head2>2. The Bride of the Lamb and the Tabernacle of God</h2><p>The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth is the bride, the wife (Rev. 21:9) of the Lamb Christ as His counterpart (John 3:29) and the tabernacle of God as His habitation (Rev. 21:3). Christ and God are one. They are one God, but triune. And the tabernacle is one entity with two aspects to meet the different needs of its Triune God. To Christ, the Lamb, the Redeemer, the New Jerusalem is His bride as His counterpart for His satisfaction. To God, the Originator, the Creator, the New Jerusalem is His tabernacle as His habitation for His rest. As the bride of the Lamb, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ, her Husband, and becomes His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, and became His counterpart (Gen. 2:21-24). She is prepared by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ the Lamb. As the tabernacle of God, the New Jerusalem is built by God with what He is. It is wholly constituted of the nature of God to be His habitation.<p>In both the Old and the New Testaments God likens His chosen people to a spouse (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32) and a dwelling place for Himself (Exo. 29:45-46; Num. 5:3; Ezek. 43:7-9; Psa. 68:18; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; 1 Tim. 3:15). The spouse is for His satisfaction in love, and the dwelling place is for His rest in expression. Both aspects will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem. In her, God will have the fullest satisfaction in love and the uttermost rest in expression for eternity.<h2 class=head2>3. Its Components</h2><p>Revelation 21:12 says that on the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel, and Revelation 21:14 tells us that on the twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. The twelve tribes represent the Old Testament saints and the twelve apostles, the New Testament saints. This indicates that all the saints of both the Old Testament and New Testament are the components, the constituent, of the New Jerusalem for God&#8217;s expression. All the saints are God&#8217;s regenerated and transformed children. They are the sons of God spoken of in Revelation 21:7, having God&#8217;s life and nature, different from the peoples spoken of in Revelation 21:3, who are the nations around the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21:24 and 22:2. The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the aggregate of all the sons of God, who have been redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified for the building of the New Jerusalem as God&#8217;s consummate manifestation for eternity.<h2 class=head2>4. Its Base</h2><p>Revelation 21:18 says, &#8220;The city was pure gold, like pure glass,&#8221; and Revelation 21:21 says, &#8220;The street of the city was pure gold as transparent glass.&#8221; Since the street of the city is gold, gold must be the base of the city, on which is the street. Gold, in typology, signifies God in His divine nature. The divine nature of God is the base of the city. This indicates that the New Jerusalem is wholly constituted of the nature of God, which is pure and transparent as the pure and transparent glass without any mixture, with which and in which nothing can be covered. This affords God a pure and transparent expression for His consummate manifestation in the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head2>5. Its Gates</h2><p>Revelation 21:13 and 21 tell us that the New Jerusalem has &#8220;on the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates...and the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl.&#8221; Pearl signifies Christ with His life-releasing death and His life-secreting resurrection to cause the sinners to be regenerated with His divine life that they may become parts of the New Jerusalem as its entrance. This entrance brings in the blending (signified by the number twelve) of the Triune God (signified by the number three) with the created man (signified by the number four, implied in the four times of three gates) for the manifestation of the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>6. Its Wall and the Foundation of Its Wall</h2><p>Revelation 21:18-20 tell us that the building material of its wall was jasper, and that the foundation of the wall of the city was adorned with twelve precious stones the first of which was also jasper. Jasper, with its dark green color, a sign of being rich in life, signifies the appearance of the very God who is rich in life. This indicates that the New Jerusalem is built with all the redeemed saints who have been transformed into precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12; 1 Peter 2:2-5), the leading category of which is jasper, bearing the very appearance of their God who is rich in life, and shining with the light like a most precious stone, even jasper stone, clear as crystal, for the expression of the transforming God in His manifestation in the new creation for eternity.<p>The transformation of the saints, from their natural being into precious stones, which signify the riches of Christ in different splendors with the appearance of God&#8217;s life in its richness, is done by the Spirit. The New Jerusalem is composed of three categories of precious materials: gold, signifying God in His divine nature; pearls, signifying Christ in His life-releasing death and life-secreting resurrection; and precious stones, signifying the Spirit in His transforming work. God is embodied in Christ (Col. 2:9), and Christ is realized as the Spirit (John 14:16-20). The Three are one, especially in the believers&#8217; experience of life. God&#8217;s nature is His divine life which is the very life Christ released through His death and is secreting in His resurrection into His believers. With this life the Spirit transforms the believers, making them precious materials for the building of the New Jerusalem to express the processed Triune God in what the Three of the Godhead are and have done, in His marvelous manifestation in the ages to come in eternity.<h2 class=head2>7. Its Temple</h2><p>In Revelation 21:22 the Apostle John tells us that he saw no temple in the New Jerusalem, for the temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. Since God and the Lamb are the temple, they could not dwell in it, and it is not their dwelling place. It is the dwelling place of all the redeemed saints who serve the Triune God by dwelling in Him. On the one hand, the New Jerusalem, which is composed of all the redeemed saints, as the habitation of God, is the tabernacle; on the other hand, the New Jerusalem, which is constituted of the processed Triune God, as the dwelling place of all the redeemed saints, is the temple. Thus, the New Jerusalem is the mutual dwelling of both the redeeming God and His redeemed. It is both the tabernacle and the temple; the tabernacle is the redeemed and the temple is the redeeming God. This indicates strongly that the redeeming God is mingled with His redeemed, through the processes He has gone through and the procedures they have shared in, for His expression in His eternal manifestation.<h2 class=head2>8. Its Glory and Its Light</h2><p>Revelation 21:11 and 23 tell us that the New Jerusalem has the glory of God and her light was like a most precious stone, as jasper stone, clear as crystal. It has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumines it, and its lamp is the Lamb. The glory of God, which is God expressed, illumines the New Jerusalem. Hence, the glory of God, with God as its substance, essence, and elements, is the light of the New Jerusalem, which shines in the Lamb as its lamp. The expressed glory of God, or the God of glory expressed, is the light shining in Christ as the lamp through the jasper wall of the New Jerusalem like the most precious jasper, which bears God&#8217;s appearance rich in life. The appearance of God rich in life goes with the shining for God&#8217;s expression in His final and consummated manifestation.<h2 class=head2>9. Its Throne</h2><p>Revelation 22:1 and 3 tell us that the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in the New Jerusalem and that a river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. According to the context of this portion of the Word, the throne of God and of the Lamb is the center of the New Jerusalem, on which the redeeming God, as indicated by the expression &#8220;God and the Lamb&#8221;, carries out His administration, based upon His redemption, in His eternal kingdom in the new heaven and new earth, to keep everything in the universe in the order that serves the purpose for His expression in His eternal manifestation. This is the goal of His redemption.<h2 class=head2>10. Its Street</h2><p>Revelation 21:21 says, &#8220;The street of the city was pure gold as transparent glass,&#8221; and Revelation 22:1 says that a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of the street of the city. The street signifies the way, and the street being pure gold indicates that the nature of God is the way in the New Jerusalem. Everything in the New Jerusalem which is constituted of God in His nature, is according to the divine nature and corresponds to it. Hence, the river of water of life, which is the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God, proceeds in the middle of this street and is bright as crystal, without any opaqueness and obscureness.<p>Because it is one street that proceeds out of the throne to reach all the twelve gates of the city, it should be spiral that passes through the entire city. In this way the one street, proceeding out of one throne, is able to reach and serve the twelve gates, indicating that the genuine oneness is kept in the holy city. The redeemed came into the city through twelve gates from four directions, but they all are gathered into one street which is according to the nature of God and corresponds to it.<h2 class=head2>11. Its Supply</h2><p>Revelation 22:1-2 says, &#8220;A river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruits each month.&#8221; The river of water of life, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, signifies the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God, flowing out of God and the Lamb. In the flow of the river is the water of life with the tree of life as a vine going on the two sides of the river. The water of life signifies the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2) as the spiritual drink (Rev. 21:6), and the tree of life signifies Christ as the spiritual food (Rev. 22:14), to supply the entire New Jerusalem, which is composed of all the saints, the sons of God, that they may be nourished and sustained forever. This kind of supply with the Spirit as the spiritual drink and Christ as the spiritual food began in the individual manifestation of God in John 7:33-39 and 6:35, 51. This supply indicates that the processed Triune God is the supply of the New Jerusalem, and that this supply is the dispensing of the redeeming God into His redeemed for His expression in His eternal manifestation.<p>The river of the water of life with the tree of life growing in it comes out of the throne of God&#8217;s administration and flows in the middle of the golden street. This indicates that the divine supply for the New Jerusalem is related to the authority (throne) and nature (gold) of God. Apart from God&#8217;s authority and God&#8217;s nature there is no possibility for God to have an expression in His manifestation.<h2 class=head2>12. The Mingling of God with Man</h2><p>According to the intrinsic significance of all the above points, the New Jerusalem is really a marvelous mingling of the processed Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, built and glorified tripartite people for His glorious and utmost expression in His consummated manifestation for eternity, in the new creation of resurrection, no longer in the natural flesh, as His individual manifestation in Christ and His corporate manifestation were in the past.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to consider God&#8217;s work as revealed in the New Testament. Our God is a working God. The Lord&#8217;s word in John 5:17 indicates this: &#8220;My Father is working until now.&#8221; In the New Testament we see God&#8217;s work in eternity past, in His old dispensation, in His new dispensation, and in eternity future, with many aspects.<h2 class=head1>A. IN ETERNITY PAST</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Making the Divine Economy</h2><p>In eternity past God made the divine economy, His eternal plan (Eph. 1:9-11; 3:9-11; 1 Tim. 1:4b). The Greek word translated &#8220;dispensation&#8221; in Ephesians 1:10; 3:9; and 1 Timothy 1:4 is oikonomia, the anglicized form of which is &#8220;economy.&#8221; The Greek word means the law of a household or household administration. It denotes God&#8217;s household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people so that He may have the church as His corporate expression. Economy equals dispensation, arrangement, plan. In simple words, we may say that in eternity past God made a plan, a divine, eternal plan.<h2 class=head2>2. Choosing the Believers before the Foundation of the World</h2><p>After God made His eternal plan, He chose the believers: &#8220;According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love&#8221; (Eph. 1:4). God&#8217;s choosing is His selection. From among numberless people He selected us, and this He did in Christ before the foundation of the world. Christ was the sphere in which we were selected by God. Outside of Christ we are not God&#8217;s choice.<p>The phrase &#8220;before the foundation of the world&#8221; means in eternity past. God chose us according to His infinite foresight before He created us. This implies that the world, which is the universe, was founded for man&#8217;s existence to fulfill God&#8217;s eternal purpose. God selected us not only before we were created, but even before the foundation of the world. Nothing of His creation had yet come into existence when He selected us.<p>God chose us in eternity past. The fact that we were chosen in eternity past means that our salvation began before the foundation of the world and before time. The word &#8220;chosen&#8221; implies that some were selected and that others were not selected. We praise the Lord that we are among the chosen ones. If we turn to our spirit and contact the Lord regarding this matter, we shall realize that just as God is eternal, so His choosing of us was also eternal.<h2 class=head2>3. Predestinating the Believers before the Foundation of the World</h2><p>God&#8217;s work in eternity past also included His predestinating-marking out-the believers before the foundation of the world. Concerning this, Ephesians 1:5 says, &#8220;Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;predestinated&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;marked out beforehand.&#8221; Marking out beforehand is the process, while predestination is the purpose to determine a destiny beforehand. God first selected us and then marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world, unto a certain destiny. The destiny of God&#8217;s marking us out beforehand is sonship. We were predestinated to be sons of God even before we were created. Hence, as God&#8217;s creatures, we need to be regenerated by Him so that we may participate in His life to be His sons. Sonship implies not only the life of a son but also the position of a son. God&#8217;s marked-out ones have both the life to be His sons and also the position of sons.<p>God predestinated us according to His foresight (1 Pet. 1:2). This indicates that our relationship with God was initiated by Him according to His foreknowledge.<p>Furthermore, God predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ. &#8220;Through Jesus Christ&#8221; means through the Redeemer, who is the Son of God. Through Him we have been redeemed to be the sons of God with the life and position of God&#8217;s sons.<p>Ephesians 1:5 says that God predestinated us unto sonship according to the good pleasure of His will, which is His purpose. God has a will in which is His good pleasure. God predestinated us to be His sons according to this pleasure, according to the desire of His heart.<p>Ephesians 1:4 says that God has chosen us to be holy, and verse 5 says that He has predestinated us unto sonship. &#8220;To be holy&#8221; is the procedure, and &#8220;unto sonship&#8221; is the goal. We have been predestinated unto sonship. In other words, God has chosen us to be holy so that we might be His sons. Thus, to be holy is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the goal. God does not merely want a group of holy people; He desires many sons. It may seem to us that it is adequate for God to choose us to be holy. We may be fully satisfied with this. Nevertheless, God has chosen us to be holy for a purpose that we might be the sons of God.<p>When I was young, I loved Ephesians 1:4 and 5. However, at first I thought that God had predestinated me unto heaven. Then I thought that I was predestinated unto salvation. Many of us may have thought the same thing, reading into the Bible something of our own concept. But Ephesians 1:5 does not say that God has predestinated us unto heaven or unto salvation. It says that we have been predestinated unto sonship. God made a firm decision before the foundation of the world that we would be His sons. In eternity past, God, through His foresight, marked us out from among a vast number of people to be His sons. It was not initiated by us in time; it was initiated by God in eternity.<h2 class=head2>4. Probably Making a Counsel among the Trinity of the Godhead concerning the Coming Creation and Redemption</h2><p>In eternity past God probably also made a counsel among the Trinity of the Godhead concerning the coming creation and redemption, as indicated, or implied, by Acts 2:23, which says, &#8220;This man [Jesus], delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to the cross and killed.&#8221; A bracketed insertion in  translation of Acts 2:23 says that &#8220;the determined counsel...of God&#8221; was decided &#8220;in the council held by the Trinity.&#8221; In eternity past God should have made a plan according to His good pleasure. Then according to this plan, He selected us and marked us out. In His foreknowledge God knew that the creation would become fallen. Therefore, probably among the Trinity of the Godhead there was a conference concerning the coming creation and redemption. A decision was made regarding how to create the universe and how to redeem it after it had become fallen. This indicates that the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion was not an accident in human history, but a purposeful fulfillment of the divine counsel determined by the Triune God.<p>Christ&#8217;s death was also according to the foreknowledge of God. Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be His redeeming Lamb (John 1:29) for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:20). This was done according to God&#8217;s eternal purpose and plan, not accidentally. Hence, in the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain (Rev. 13:8).<p>According to the revelation we have collected from Acts 2:23, 1 Peter 1:20, and Revelation 13:8, the redemption accomplished by Christ through His crucifixion is a great thing in the heart of God for the carrying out of His eternal plan according to His good pleasure.<h2 class=head1>B. IN THE OLD DISPENSATION</h2><p>God&#8217;s work in the old dispensation was His work in the Old Testament. The old dispensation was God&#8217;s old administrative arrangement or economy. In the Old Testament as well as in the New, God had an economy, a dispensation, an administrative arrangement.<h2 class=head2>1. Creating the Universe</h2><p>In Acts 17:24 Paul speaks of God as &#8220;the God who made the world and all things in it.&#8221; This was a very strong inoculation against both the atheistic Epicureans, who did not acknowledge the Creator, and the pantheistic Stoics (v. 18). In his preaching in Acts 14:15 Paul also spoke of the &#8220;living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all the things in them.&#8221;<p>According to Ephesians 1:5 and 9, the motive of God&#8217;s creation was His desire and pleasure. God carried out the work of creation in order to fulfill His good desire and to satisfy His good pleasure.<p>God&#8217;s creation fulfills His desire and accomplishes His purpose; it also reveals His desire in the universe and manifests His purpose in eternity. Anything we make expresses our desire. Although we may not say very much, the thing we make manifests our purpose. When God created the heavens and the earth, He certainly had a purpose. By His creation we can see that God had a desire and a purpose. First, God&#8217;s purpose in His creation is to glorify the Son of God (Col. 1:15-19). Second, God&#8217;s creation manifests God. Although God&#8217;s divine power and His divine characteristics are invisible, man can have some understanding of them through the things made by God (Rom. 1:20).<p>Why did God create the heavens and the earth? According to the Bible, the heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man. Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man with a spirit is for God.<p>The basis of God&#8217;s work in creation was God&#8217;s will and plan (Eph. 1:10). Revelation 4:11 says that all things were created according to God&#8217;s will. God is a God of purpose, having a will of His own pleasure. He created all things for His will that He might accomplish and fulfill His purpose. God has a will, and according to that will He conceived His plan. According to that will and plan, He created all things.<p>Although creation was God&#8217;s work, the means of His creation were the Son of God (Col. 1:15-16; Heb. 1:2b) and the Word of God (Heb. 11:3; John 1:1-3). The New Testament clearly tells us that God created the universe through Christ as the Son of God and the Word of God. Speaking of Christ as the means of creation, Colossians 1:16 says, &#8220;Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&#8221; Regarding Christ as the Word, John 1:3 says, &#8220;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.&#8221;<p>Only God can create. To create means to bring something into existence out of nothing. God is the unique Creator.<h2 class=head2>2. Creating Man and Determining Mankind&#8217;s Appointed Seasons and the Boundaries of Dwelling</h2><p>After creating the universe, God created man and determined mankind&#8217;s appointed seasons and the boundaries of dwelling. Concerning this, Acts 17:26 says, &#8220;And He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, determining their appointed seasons and the boundaries of their dwelling.&#8221; The &#8220;one&#8221; here refers to Adam. God not only created mankind but determined mankind&#8217;s appointed seasons and boundaries of dwelling. The migrations to America in its times and boundaries is a strong proof of this word. After creating mankind, God preserved America. After it was discovered by the Europeans, a great many people migrated here. This was according to God&#8217;s sovereignty. God determined the seasons and boundaries of the United States for the sake of His purpose concerning the working out of His recovery.<h2 class=head2>3. Dealing with Fallen Mankind from Adam to Noah</h2><p>As part of His work, God dealt with fallen mankind from Adam to Noah. The history of this is recorded in the Old Testament, but it is nevertheless referred to in the New Testament. In the New Testament we can see certain things God did in Old Testament times.<h2 class=head3>a. Rejecting Cain and Justifying Abel</h2><p>In His dealing with fallen mankind, God rejected Cain and justified Abel. &#8220;By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained testimony that he was righteous, God testifying to his gifts&#8221; (Heb. 11:4). According to typology, Abel&#8217;s more excellent sacrifice was a type of Christ, who is the real &#8220;better sacrifices&#8221; (Heb. 9:23).<p>Cain offered to God the fruit of his own labor. He brought the fruit of the ground with no blood for shedding. This means that he had rejected God&#8217;s way of redemption, which he must have heard from his parents. God&#8217;s way of redemption was that of a sacrifice in which blood was shed, for without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins (Heb. 9:22). Instead of caring for God&#8217;s way, Cain invented his own way of worshipping God according to his concept. God, however, did not accept Cain&#8217;s offering. Although Cain should have realized that what God wanted was a sacrifice with the shedding of blood, he did not offer such a sacrifice. Rather, Cain worshipped God according to his own concept, without the shedding of blood. His offering was an insult to God, an abomination in His sight, and He rejected it.<p>In contrast to Cain, Abel did not present his sacrifice according to his concept, but according to God&#8217;s way of salvation. He worshipped God according to His revelation. Abel realized that he needed an offering with the shedding of blood. Because Abel knew that he had been born of fallen parents and that he was sinful, he offered some firstlings of his flock with the shedding of blood for redemption. Therefore, Abel was justified by God.<h2 class=head3>b. Translating Enoch from Death</h2><p>Hebrews 11:5 says, &#8220;By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him. For before his translation he obtained the testimony that he was well-pleasing to God.&#8221; God&#8217;s work in the old dispensation included His translating Enoch from death. The reason God took Enoch away was that he should not see death. His being kept away from death was God&#8217;s ultimate salvation. Enoch enjoyed and partook of God&#8217;s salvation to the fullest.<p>Enoch was the first person to be raptured. Because the first mention of a thing in the Bible establishes the principle for that thing, the case of Enoch, the first mention of the rapture, establishes the principle of rapture. The principle of rapture is to be matured in life by walking with God. Enoch walked with God for three hundred years, and then God took him away (Gen. 5:22-24).<p>Before Enoch was translated by God, &#8220;he obtained the testimony that he was well-pleasing to God.&#8221; Hebrews 11:6 goes on to say, &#8220;Now without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing to Him; for he who comes forward to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him out.&#8221; This verse, since it follows verse 5, indicates that Enoch not only walked with God but that he also believed. Enoch believed that there was a God, and he sought out God by believing that He is a Rewarder. It must have been his believing in God and his seeking God that motivated him to walk with God. Eventually, Enoch was rewarded by God. God gave him the reward of being translated so that he would not see death.<h2 class=head3>c. Judging the Ungodly Generation with a Flood and Delivering Noah and His Family out of the Corrupted Generation</h2><p>In His old administrative arrangement God judged the ungodly generation with the flood and delivered Noah and his family out of the corrupted generation. Second Peter 2:5 tells us that God &#8220;did not spare the ancient world, but guarded Noah, the eighth, a herald of righteousness, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly.&#8221; To say that Noah was the eighth means that he was one of the eight (1 Pet. 3:20). Noah was a herald of righteousness. To be righteous and godly or unrighteous and ungodly is crucial with respect to God&#8217;s governmental judgment (2 Pet. 2:5-9). To be righteous is to be right with man before God, and to be godly is to express God before man. This was the manner of life Noah lived, which saved him from God&#8217;s governmental judgment according to His righteousness.<p>Noah did not preach the gospel; he preached God&#8217;s righteousness over against the corruption of his generation. Peter speaks of righteousness here because his emphasis is on God&#8217;s government. Noah&#8217;s preaching of righteousness was related to God&#8217;s government. God told Noah that He would wipe out the world and that Noah should preach righteousness to his generation. God exercised His judgment upon that corrupted generation by bringing a flood upon the world of the ungodly.<p>Concerning Noah, Hebrews 11:7 says, &#8220;By faith Noah, having been warned concerning things not yet seen, being devout, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house, through which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.&#8221; While Noah was preaching righteousness to his generation, he was building the ark. Noah built the ark by faith according to God&#8217;s revelation, not according to his own concept. His building of the ark was absolutely against the tide of his generation. By preparing the ark &#8220;he condemned the world.&#8221; No one besides Noah&#8217;s family appreciated that work. After Noah entered into the ark, God shut him in (Gen. 7:16). When the flood came upon the ungodly generation, Noah and his family were in the ark, protected, preserved, and saved.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider further God&#8217;s work in the old dispensation, in His old administrative arrangement.<h2 class=head2>4. Calling Abraham, the Father of the Chosen Race, out of the Idolatrous Generation</h2><p>In his testimony before the Jewish religionists, Stephen spoke concerning God&#8217;s calling Abraham, the father of the chosen race, out of the idolatrous generation: &#8220;The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, and said to him, Go out of your land and from your relatives, and come into the land which I will show you&#8221; (Acts 7:2-3). Abraham was called by God. Adam was the father and head of the created race, but Abraham was the father and head of the called race. As recorded in Genesis, the history of the created race culminated in the building of the tower and city of Babel. Names of idols were written on this tower, indicating that the created race had given up God and had turned to idolatry. Then God came in to call Abraham out of the idolatrous generation. According to Acts 7:2-3, God called Abraham out of his land and from his relatives.<p>By the time God called Abraham, man had forsaken God. Man&#8217;s forsaking of God was signified by his building a city for protection. Furthermore, man had built a tower as a sign of self-exaltation. Furthermore, mankind had turned from God to idols. Abraham, therefore, was called out of an idolatrous generation.<p>The calling of Abraham was originated by God Himself. It was not initiated by the called one. Although Abraham was the father of the called race, the calling did not originate with him. One day, while he was in Mesopotamia worshipping other gods (Josh. 24:2), God appeared to him and called him. God was the Originator of the calling of Abraham.<p>Although God&#8217;s calling of Abraham took place in time, something prior to that-God&#8217;s selection-took place in eternity past. Before the foundation of the world, God selected Abraham and also predestinated him. Then, in time, while Abraham was worshipping other gods, having no thought that he would be called by God, God appeared to him as the God of glory and called him.<p>It was the God of glory that appeared to Abraham. God&#8217;s glory was a great attraction to Abraham, and it separated him from the idolatrous generation unto God. This appearing strengthened Abraham to accept God&#8217;s calling. According to Abraham&#8217;s situation in Mesopotamia, without the attraction and encouragement of God&#8217;s glory, it would not have been possible for Abraham to accept God&#8217;s calling. But the God of glory appeared to him and transfused Himself into him, so that he answered God&#8217;s calling.<p>God did not appear to Abraham without speaking to him. When He came to Abraham, He called him. Calling means speaking. According to Acts 7:3, the God of glory said to Abraham, &#8220;Go out of your land and from your relatives, and come into the land which I will show you.&#8221; This was God&#8217;s speaking to Abraham. Such a speaking should have also enabled him to accept God&#8217;s calling.<p>God&#8217;s calling signifies a new beginning. When God created man, there was a beginning. But the man God created for Himself became fallen and forsook God. Therefore, God came in to call out Abraham so that He might have a new beginning. At the time of His calling of Abraham, God began to have a new beginning.<p>God&#8217;s calling also signifies a transfer of race. God&#8217;s new beginning with man through His calling is a transfer of race. God&#8217;s calling of Abraham meant that He had given up the race of Adam and had chosen Abraham with his descendants as the new race to be His people for the fulfilling of His eternal purpose. This was a transfer from the created Adamic race to the called Abrahamic race (Gal. 3:7-9, 14; Rom. 4:16-17). When we say that God&#8217;s calling is a new beginning, we need to understand that this new beginning is a transfer of race.<p>God&#8217;s intention in calling Abraham was to bring him back to Himself as the tree of life. According to Genesis 1, man was not only created by God but also for God and to God that man might express God&#8217;s image and exercise His dominion. In Genesis 2 God was represented by the tree of life. The fact that the man created by God was placed in front of the tree of life indicates that man should continually eat of this tree. Man needed to come to God, contact God, and have God transfused into him. However, man failed to do this and instead went to the wrong source, the tree of knowledge. As a result, the man who was made to God turned away from Him. This is the meaning of man&#8217;s fall.<p>God appeared to call Abraham out of such a fallen condition. This means that God wanted to bring man back to Himself. When God called Abraham out of Mesopotamia, His intention was to bring him back to Himself. In calling Abraham, God was bringing him back to the tree of life. When God appeared to him, that was the appearing of the tree of life. As Abraham spent time in the presence of God, he enjoyed the tree of life. Every time this happened God&#8217;s essence was transfused into him. In this way God trained Abraham to be totally transfused and permeated with God and to no longer act by himself that God may be everything to him.<h2 class=head2>5. Promising Abraham That through His Seed, Christ, the Blessing of the Gospel Would Come to All the Families of the Earth</h2><p>As part of His work in the old dispensation, God promised Abraham that through his seed, Christ, the blessing of the gospel would come to all the families of the earth. Galatians 3:8 says, &#8220;The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham: In you all the nations shall be blessed.&#8221; In Galatians 3:14 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&#8221; Then in verse 16 Paul continues, &#8220;To Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed. He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one, And to your seed, who is Christ.&#8221; Because verse 14 combines the promise of the Spirit with the blessing of Abraham, this verse is extremely important. The blessing of Abraham is the blessing promised by God to Abraham (Gen. 12:3) for all the nations of the earth. This promise was fulfilled, and this promise has come to the nations in Christ through His redemption by the cross. The context of verse 14 indicates that the Spirit is the blessing God promised to Abraham for all the nations and which has been received by the believers through faith in Christ. This Spirit is the compound Spirit and is actually God Himself processed in His trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, for us to receive as our life and our everything.<p>The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 1:12). Because Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the promised land. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God&#8217;s bountiful supply for us to enjoy. What kind of Spirit could be the blessing God promised to Abraham? What Spirit could be the all-inclusive blessing, which is Christ as the land? It must be the Spirit, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.<p>Paul&#8217;s word concerning the Spirit should remind us of John 7:39: &#8220;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&#8221; The Spirit in Galatians 3:14 and John 7:39 is the ultimate expression of the Triune God. The Spirit denotes the processed God. The Father is the source. The Son of God as the course was incarnated, lived on earth, was crucified, and was resurrected. Incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection are all aspects of a process. In resurrection, Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit. No doubt, the life-giving Spirit is the very Holy Spirit who gives life. This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed God. As the good land is an all-inclusive type of Christ, and as Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9) has become the Spirit, so the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit as the processed God, is eventually the good land to us, the New Testament believers, as the fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise to Abraham that all the nations of the earth would be blessed in him.<p>In Galatians 3:14, the blessing of the promise is the Spirit, and in Galatians 3:16 the promises were made to Abraham&#8217;s seed, which is Christ. On the one hand, the Spirit is the all-inclusive Christ. On the other hand, the Spirit, as the blessing of the promise, was given to Christ as the seed. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him as the seed, as life. This seed is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the reality of the good land. The Christ whom we received as the seed is the Spirit typified by the good land. Christ came into us as the seed, but as we live by Him He becomes the land (the all-inclusive Spirit) which is our portion. This is the fulfillment of God&#8217;s word in promising Abraham that through his seed the blessing of the gospel would come to all the families of the earth.<h2 class=head2>6. Condemning Sodom and Gomorrah to Ruin by Fire</h2><p>Second Peter 2:6 says, &#8220;Having reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, He condemned them to ruin, having set an example to those who intend to live an ungodly life.&#8221; In the old dispensation, God condemned Sodom and Gomorrah to ruin by fire. This He did as an example to those who would live an ungodly life. To live an ungodly life is to live in the flesh in the lusts of men, not in the will of God (1 Pet. 4:2); it is to work out the desire of the nations (1 Pet. 4:3) and to live in a vain, ungodly manner of life (1 Pet. 1:18). People who live such an ungodly life should be warned by this example.<h2 class=head2>7. Choosing the Children of Israel, the Descendants of Abraham, and Making Them His People as a Type of the Church</h2><p>In His old administrative arrangement God chose the children of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, and made them His people as a type of the church (Rom. 9:11-13; Acts 7:38). In the Old Testament the church is not mentioned in plain words. However, there are types that portray the church. The children of Israel, as the chosen people of God, are the greatest, collective type of the church, in which we can see that the church is chosen and redeemed by God, enjoys Christ and the Spirit as the life supply, builds God&#8217;s habitation, inherits Christ as its portion, degrades and is captured, is recovered, and awaits Christ&#8217;s coming. What a work that in the old dispensation God prepared such an all-inclusive type of the church!<p>Paul applies the history of the children of Israel to the New Testament church life. In Hebrews and 1 Corinthians he points out clearly that what happened to the children of Israel is a type of us (1 Cor. 10:6). The entire history of Israel is a story of the church. The Bible, then, contains two histories-the history of Israel and the history of the church. The history of the children of Israel is a type, and the history of the church is the fulfillment of the type. Thus, the entire Bible gives us one revelation, the revelation of God&#8217;s economy concerning the church. In the Old Testament we have a type, a picture, of God&#8217;s economy concerning the church, whereas in the New Testament God&#8217;s economy concerning the church is fulfilled.<h2 class=head2>8. Giving the Law and Making the Old Covenant</h2><p>Part of God&#8217;s work in the old dispensation was to give the law and to make the old covenant. John 1:17 says, &#8220;The law was given through Moses.&#8221;<p>The law was also given to expose what man is and where man is. The best way for man to be exposed is to cause his situation to be seen in the light of God&#8217;s attributes. The Ten Commandments are composed mainly of four divine attributes: holiness, righteousness, light, and love. God is holy and righteous; He is also light and love. If you look into the Ten Commandments, you will see that they embody the divine holiness, righteousness, light, and love. For this reason, the law became God&#8217;s testimony. In other words, the Ten Commandments testify that God is holy and righteous and that God is light and love. God used this testimony to expose man. As man stands before this testimony, his sinfulness is exposed.<p>When the law was given, the children of Israel promised to obey God&#8217;s commandments (Exo. 19:8). Before the children of Israel responded in this way, the atmosphere around Mount Sinai was not threatening. But when the people declared that they would keep God&#8217;s commandments, the atmosphere changed and became terrifying. God exercised His holiness, and the people were not allowed to approach further. Frightened by the manifestation of God&#8217;s holiness, they asked Moses to go to God on their behalf. This indicates that the function of the law is to expose fallen mankind.<p>When God gave the law, He knew that the people would not be able to keep it. But He still gave it in order to expose the people. As the law functions to expose people, it keeps them. The law was used by God as a custodian to keep His people, just as a fold keeps a flock of sheep during the winter or during a storm. The time before the coming of Christ can be compared to a winter season. God used the law as a fold to guard the people. Paul makes this basic principle clear in Galatians 3:23: &#8220;Before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed.&#8221; In verse 24 he goes on to say, &#8220;So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.&#8221; These verses reveal clearly that the law functions as a custodian. As it exposed man&#8217;s transgression, it guarded God&#8217;s people until Christ came.<p>In the old dispensation God not only gave the law to His people; He also made a covenant with them. Concerning this, Hebrews 9:18-20 says, &#8220;Neither was the first covenant dedicated without blood. For when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded to you.&#8221; The sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifices was the sealing of the covenant and the completion of the official enactment of the covenant.<p>A covenant involves two or more parties. Here the covenant was between God and His people. This making of a covenant was a tremendous matter. Using today&#8217;s words, this covenant was an agreement or a contract. The proper way for a contract to be enacted today is for the participating parties to sign it. A time is set, and an official document is prepared. Then all the parties concerned sign this document. In some cases, the parties make an oath or a pledge. Without such an official enactment, the contract would exist as a written statement, but it would not be binding on either party. Although the law had been given to the people through Moses, there was still the need for the covenant to be enacted. Therefore, after God gave the law, He made a covenant between Him and His people.<p>God&#8217;s covenant in the old dispensation was enacted upon His promise. A promise is a common, ordinary word without confirmation. After God made His promise, He sealed it with an oath. He swore by His Godhead that His promise was confirmed. Once His promise was confirmed by an oath, it immediately became the covenant sealed by God. If you read the Old Testament carefully, you will see that God&#8217;s promises were all sealed by His oath. That the promises have become a covenant means that they cannot possibly be altered. Once the promises were confirmed by God&#8217;s oath, having been made unalterable, there was no possibility of change. The promise had been sealed; it was no longer a promise but a covenant confirmed by God&#8217;s oath.<h2 class=head2>9. Promising David, the King of the Chosen Race, That the Fruit of His Loins Would Be the Coming Messiah-Christ</h2><p>God promised David, the king of the chosen race, that the fruit of his loins would be the coming Messiah-Christ. Regarding this, Acts 2:30 and 31 say, &#8220;Being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins he would seat One upon his throne, he, seeing this beforehand, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that He was neither left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;fruit&#8221; in verse 30 is karpos, used for Christ only in the sense of offspring here and in Luke 1:42. It is used for the fruit of the tree of life in Revelation 22:2. Christ is the branch of Jehovah (Isa. 4:2) and of David (Jer. 23:5), and the fruit of Mary and of David, that we may eat of Him as the tree of life. To promise that such a Christ would come was a great thing and was a glad tiding. God did this to King David in the old dispensation as a great blessing to His chosen people.<h2 class=head2>10. Promising the Coming Gospel of the New Dispensation through the Prophets among the Chosen Race</h2><p>God&#8217;s work in His old administrative arrangement included promising the coming gospel of the new dispensation through the prophets among the chosen race. The word &#8220;gospel&#8221; means glad tidings, good news. The gospel is news that gladdens those who hear it. It is good news from God, from the heavens.<p>In Romans 1:1b-3a Paul speaks of the gospel which &#8220;He promised before through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&#8221; The gospel of God concerns a person, Christ. Of course, such matters as forgiveness and salvation are included in the gospel, but they are not the central point. The gospel of God concerns the Person of the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord. The gospel is not a doctrine nor a teaching nor a religion; it is a Person.<p>This gospel was promised by God through the prophets in the Scriptures. The gospel of God was not an accident; it was planned and prepared by God. The Bible shows us that this gospel was planned by God in eternity past. Before the foundation of the world, God planned to have this gospel. Therefore, numerous times in the Scriptures, from Genesis through Malachi, God spoke in promise through the prophets regarding the gospel. This indicates that if we would understand the content of the gospel as the good news, we need to know the Old Testament. The Old Testament is not merely a record of creation and history. In it are revealed crucial elements pertaining to the gospel.<p>We have seen God&#8217;s work in eternity past. God made the divine economy, chose the believers before the foundation of the world, predestinated the believers unto sonship, and probably made a counsel among the Trinity of the Godhead concerning creation and redemption. We have also seen God&#8217;s work in the old dispensation: the work of creating the universe, creating man and determining mankind&#8217;s seasons and boundaries, dealing with fallen mankind from Adam to Noah, calling Abraham, promising Abraham that through his seed the blessing of the gospel would come to all the families of the earth, condemning Sodom and Gomorrah to ruin by fire, choosing the children of Israel and making them His people, giving the law and making the old covenant, promising David that the fruit of his loins would be the coming Messiah, and promising the coming gospel of the new dispensation through the prophets among the chosen race.<p>Now we need to ask why God did all this work in eternity past and in the old dispensation. For what purpose did He work in this way? The answer is that God did all this for the purpose of dispensing Himself into His chosen people. This is the underlying thought in the Bible. The central subject, the underlying thought, in the Scriptures is that God wants to dispense Himself into His chosen people so that He may have a corporate expression that consummates in the New Jerusalem. This was God&#8217;s purpose for making the divine economy, His eternal plan. This was God&#8217;s purpose in choosing the believers, predestinating them, and making a counsel among the Trinity of the Godhead. This was God&#8217;s purpose in creating the universe, in creating man and determining man&#8217;s seasons and boundaries, and in doing so many other things in His old administrative arrangement. The purpose of God&#8217;s work in eternity past and in the old dispensation was the dispensing of Himself into His chosen people for the producing of the church as His corporate expression consummating in the New Jerusalem as the eternal expression of the Triune God.<p>These messages on the conclusion of the New Testament are not concerned with mere doctrine, theology, or teaching. The focus of these messages is the vision of the divine dispensing of the Triune God into us. It is not my intention that you simply know all the items of God&#8217;s person or all the aspects of His attributes. Rather, my intention is that we would see the rich ingredients of the divine food that we are taking in day by day so that we may participate in the dispensing of the Triune God into us.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>The record of the New Testament reveals God&#8217;s New Testament economy, which is God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people for the producing of a corporate Body to express Him. In Ephesians Paul gives us a very high word concerning God&#8217;s eternal economy. In Ephesians 1 and 3 we see that the economy of God was made for the purpose of producing a church in Christ. If you read Ephesians 1:9-11 and 3:9-11, you will see not only the economy made by God in Himself according to His good pleasure, but also the goal of God&#8217;s economy. The goal of God&#8217;s economy is to have the church, which is the corporate expression of God. The church as God&#8217;s corporate expression is the consummation of God&#8217;s economy.<p>We have pointed out that according to the principle revealed throughout the Bible, the means of God&#8217;s dispensing Himself into us is the divine life, and the way is our eating of Him. Ephesians 1 and 3 show us the economy of God, but in these chapters we do not see either the means or the way for God&#8217;s dispensing. But if we read the other books written by Paul, we shall see that the means of God&#8217;s dispensing Himself is life and the way for God to dispense Himself is our eating of Him as our food.<p>After God made His economy, He did the work of selection and predestination. Concerning this, Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say, &#8220;According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love, having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&#8221; Here we see that both God&#8217;s choosing and His predestinating are for sonship.<p>The only way to produce sons is begetting, and begetting is a matter of dispensing. How can the Father beget children? The Father begets children by dispensing Himself in His life into those who are to become His children. Perhaps you have never realized that begetting, or propagating, involves the dispensing of life. When Adam begot children, he dispensed his life into them. Through such a dispensing the earth is filled with Adam&#8217;s descendants. Just as Adam&#8217;s descendants are produced by the dispensing of human life, so God&#8217;s sons are produced by the dispensing of the divine life.<p>If the Father&#8217;s life had not come into us, how could we be His sons? This would be impossible. Sonship requires the Father&#8217;s life. We are neither God&#8217;s sons-in-law nor His adopted sons; we are sons in God&#8217;s life and nature. Because we have been born of God and because God has been born into us, we now have God in us. The only way we can be God&#8217;s sons is for Him to dispense Himself into us.<p>For the carrying out of His dispensing, God in eternity past made a counsel with Himself to make certain decisions. First, God decided to create man. Without creating man God would not be able to select certain ones to be His sons. After deciding to create man, God also decided how mankind would be distributed on earth. He made a decision concerning seasons and boundaries so that it would be possible for the chosen ones to be ready and available to receive God&#8217;s dispensing.<p>After God created man and man became fallen, God did not give up on man. Instead, He came in to deal with fallen mankind from Adam to Noah. If we had the record concerning only Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah, we would not know what God&#8217;s goal is. But as we go on to the record concerning Abraham, we can see God&#8217;s goal. God told Abraham that through his seed all the families of the earth would be blessed. Who is the seed of Abraham? Abraham&#8217;s seed is Christ, the incarnated God. God&#8217;s promise to Abraham, therefore, points toward His dispensing.<p>After giving further promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God eventually chose the children of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, and made them His people as a type of the church. They were a people separated for a particular purpose, and that purpose was God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people to make them His expression on earth. This expression is the church, of which Israel was a type.<p>After giving the law and making the old covenant, God promised David, the king of the chosen race, that the fruit of his loins would be the coming Messiah, the Christ. This promise is also related to God&#8217;s dispensing. As we consider God&#8217;s work in the old dispensation, in His old administrative arrangement, we need to have a clear understanding that this work is with a view to God&#8217;s dispensing. The &#8220;arrow&#8221; of God&#8217;s work in the Old Testament always moves toward the goal of God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into His people to produce a corporate expression of Himself.<p>Finally, in His work in the old dispensation God promised the coming gospel of the new dispensation through the prophets among the chosen race. Prophecies were given concerning the propagation of the gospel. If we read the Old Testament carefully, we shall see this matter.<h2 class=head1>C. IN THE NEW DISPENSATION</h2><p>Having considered God&#8217;s work in eternity past and in the old dispensation, let us now go on to view His work in the new dispensation, in His new administrative arrangement-economy.<h2 class=head2>1. Sending John the Baptist to Prepare the Way for Christ</h2><p>First, in His work in the new dispensation God sent John the Baptist to prepare the way for Christ. The New Testament opens with the record of John the Baptist, who was sent by God to prepare the way so that Christ, the Dispenser, might come. When John was asked who he was, he answered, &#8220;I am not the Christ&#8221; (John 1:19-20). Concerning himself, John the Baptist said, &#8220;I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as Isaiah the prophet said&#8221; (John 1:23). The One whose way John was preparing was the very Christ who would carry out God&#8217;s dispensing.<p>Luke 3:2 says, &#8220;In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness.&#8221; It was according to prophecy that John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness. This indicates that the introduction of God&#8217;s New Testament economy by John was not accidental, but was planned and foretold by God through Isaiah the prophet. This implied that God intended His New Testament economy to begin in an absolutely new way. John the Baptist did his preaching not in the holy temple within the holy city, where the religious and cultured people worshipped God according to their scriptural ordinances, but in the wilderness, not keeping any regulation of the old way. This indicates that the old way of the worship of God according to the Old Testament was repudiated and that a new way was about to be brought in.<p>Luke 3:3 goes on to say, &#8220;And he came into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.&#8221; John the Baptist&#8217;s work was mainly to preach the baptism of repentance. To baptize someone is to immerse, to bury, him in water. Hence, baptism signifies death. John came to baptize the people in order to indicate that the repentant ones were good only for burial. This baptism also signifies the termination of the old person and that a new beginning may be realized in resurrection through Christ as the Dispenser. Therefore, following John&#8217;s ministry Christ came. John&#8217;s baptism not only terminated those who repented but also ushered them to Christ for His dispensing.<p>John&#8217;s preaching the baptism of repentance was for the forgiveness of sins. The Greek word translated &#8220;for&#8221; also means unto. Repentance with baptism is for, and results in, forgiveness of sins, so that the obstacle of man&#8217;s fall may be removed and man may be reconciled to God.<p>Luke 3:4 through 6 say, &#8220;As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight. Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked places shall become straight, and the rough places smooth roads; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.&#8221; To prepare the way of the Lord and to make His paths straight means to change people&#8217;s minds, turning their minds toward the coming Savior. It also means to make their hearts right, to straighten every part of their hearts through repentance, so that Christ may enter into them to be their life.<p>Ravine, mountain, crooked places, and rough places are figures of speech describing the condition of men&#8217;s hearts toward God and toward each other and the relationships among men (Luke 1:16-17). Both the condition of men&#8217;s hearts and their relationships need to be dealt with for the way to be prepared for the Savior&#8217;s coming to dispense Himself into God&#8217;s chosen people.<p>&#8220;Flesh&#8221; in the word &#8220;all flesh will see the salvation of God&#8221; refers to fallen men, and &#8220;salvation&#8221; denotes the Savior as the salvation of God. John&#8217;s ministry was to prepare the way that all men might see Christ the Savior as the salvation of God.<h2 class=head2>2. Sending His Son in the Likeness of the Flesh of Sin That He Might Redeem Those under Law That We Might Receive the Sonship</h2><p>God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin that He might redeem those under law so that we might receive the sonship. Romans 8:3 speaks of &#8220;God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&#8221; The flesh is of sin, and the Son of God did indeed become flesh (John 1:14; Heb. 2:14). However, He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but had no participation in the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). This was typified by the brass serpent lifted up by Moses for sinful Israelites (Num. 21:9; John 3:14). The brass serpent was in the form, the likeness, of an actual serpent, but it did not have the poison of a serpent. In like manner, Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have the sinful nature of the flesh of sin.<p>The subject of Romans 8:3 is God. God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. God was wise. He knew that He could not send His Son to be the flesh of sin, for, if He did that, His Son would have been involved with sin. Therefore, He sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, as typified by the brass serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness. Christ does not have the nature of sin. God sent Him only in the likeness of the flesh of sin.<p>God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin in order to redeem us from under the law so that we might receive the sonship. Galatians 4:4 and 5 say, &#8220;When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship.&#8221; The fullness of time in verse 4 denotes the completion of the Old Testament time, which occurred at the time appointed of the Father. In this verse Paul describes the Son as &#8220;come of a woman, come under law.&#8221; The woman is, of course, the virgin Mary (Luke 1:27-35). The Son of God came of her to be the seed of woman, as promised in Genesis 3:15. Furthermore, Christ was born under law, as revealed in Luke 2:21-24, 27, and He kept the law, as the four Gospels reveal.<p>God&#8217;s chosen people were shut up by the law under its custody (Gal. 3:23). Christ was born under the law in order to redeem them from its custody so that they might receive the sonship and become sons of God.<p>According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, God&#8217;s economy is to produce sons. Sonship is the focal point of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. God&#8217;s New Testament economy is the dispensing of Himself into His chosen people to make them His sons. Christ&#8217;s redemption is to bring us into the sonship of God so that we may enjoy the divine life. God&#8217;s New Testament economy is not to make us keepers of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose. God&#8217;s New Testament economy is to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God&#8217;s promise, which was given for His eternal purpose. God&#8217;s eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10). Hence, He predestinated us unto sonship (Eph. 1:5) and regenerated us to be His sons (John 1:12-13).<p>Galatians 4:4 says that God sent forth His Son when the fullness of the time had come. God sent Christ at exactly the right time. Earlier would have been too soon, and later would have been too late. Christ came when the time was right. It was at the appointed time, at the fullness of time. For this reason, the Son&#8217;s coming was full of meaning.<p>First, God sent John the Baptist to prepare the way for Christ, and then He sent His Son. God sent His Son that we might receive the sonship. To receive the sonship is to receive the dispensing of the divine life. Therefore, the sending of both John the Baptist and of Christ were for the dispensing of the divine life into God&#8217;s chosen people.<h2 class=head2>3. Being Incarnated</h2><p>By sending His Son God Himself was incarnated. Actually, God sent His Son through the incarnation. The New Testament way of speaking about the incarnation is to say that the Word, which is God, became flesh (John 1:1, 14) and that God was manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16).<p>It was surely a marvelous thing for God to come into man and to be born of mankind through a virgin. Our God became a man! In creation He was the Creator. But though He created all things, He did not enter into any of the things He created. Even in creating man He only breathed the breath of life into him (Gen. 2:7). He was still outside man. His breath, according to Job 33:4, gave man life; however, He Himself did not come into man. Until the incarnation He was separate from man. But with the incarnation He personally entered into man. He was first conceived and then remained in the virgin&#8217;s womb for nine months, after which He was born.<p>It is important for us to realize that it was the entire God and not only the Son of God who was incarnated. The Word, which was God, became flesh. We need to realize that this God, who the Word was, is not only a partial God, that is, not only God the Son but God the Son, God the Father, and God the Spirit, the entire God. The New Testament does not say that the Word, who became flesh, was God the Son. Rather, the New Testament says that in the beginning was the Word, and this Word was the entire Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. It was the entire God, the complete God, that became flesh. The whole God was manifested in the flesh.<h2 class=head2>4. Coming with the Son and Working within the Son</h2><p>When God the Father sent the Son, He came with Him and worked within Him. The Gospel of John reveals that the Father, who is the source and the Initiator, sent the Son (John 5:24, 30, 36-38; 13:20; 14:24). There are two Greek words used for the English word &#8220;sent,&#8221; one of which means to be sent with a special commission. This indicates that the Father sent the Son as an envoy with a special commission.<p>The New Testament reveals that the Father sent the Son and that He came with the Son (John 17:8). As a rule, if someone sends you to a certain place, that person will remain where he is, and you will go to the designated place. But when the Father sent the Son, it was not like this. When He sent the Son, He came with the Son.<p>John 6:46 says, &#8220;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father.&#8221; In his note on this verse J. N. Darby says that the Greek preposition translated &#8220;from&#8221; here has the sense of &#8220;from with.&#8221; The Lord was not only from God but also with God. This means that while He was from God, God was still with Him. When the Son came, the Father came with Him. John 8:16 also indicates that God came with the Son: &#8220;I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.&#8221; In verse 29 of the same chapter the Lord clearly said, &#8220;He who sent Me is with Me.&#8221; Furthermore, in John 16:32 the Lord said, &#8220;I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.&#8221; All these verses indicate that, in His work in the new dispensation, God came with the Son.<p>Other verses reveal that God worked within the Son. John 14:10 and 11 say, &#8220;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me; but if not, believe Me because of the works themselves.&#8221; The Father remained and worked in the Son. The Father not only came with the Son, but He remained and worked with Him. John 14:10 and 11 tell us clearly that when the Son spoke, the Father worked in Him.<p>The Father sent the Son, and the Father was with the Son; that is, the Father came with the Son. In the divine economy the Father sent the Son, and when the Son came, the Father came with the Son. Therefore, Acts 10:38 says, &#8220;God was with Him.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>5. Anointing the Son to Carry Out His Commission</h2><p>When the Son became thirty years of age, God anointed Him for the carrying out of His commission. Matthew 3:16 and 17 speak of this: &#8220;Having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him; and behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight.&#8221; Because the Lord Jesus was baptized, fulfilling God&#8217;s righteousness, the heavens were opened to Him, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and the Father spoke concerning Him. Before the Spirit of God descended and came upon Him, the Lord Jesus had been born of the Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20), which proved that He already had the Spirit of God within Him. That was for His birth. Now, for His ministry, the Spirit of God descended upon Him. That was for the fulfillment of Isaiah 61:1; 42:1; and Psalm 45:7 to anoint Him to carry out His God-given commission.<p>The Lord Jesus was inaugurated into His ministry by two steps: baptism in water and the anointing of the Holy Spirit. After the Lord Jesus was baptized, God the Father sent the Holy Spirit upon Him economically, anointing Him for His ministry.<p>In Luke 4:18 and 19 we have a further word regarding God&#8217;s anointing the Son for the carrying out of His ministry: &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.&#8221; Here we see that the Spirit of the Lord was upon the Son because God had anointed Him to bring good news to the poor. The Greek word rendered &#8220;bring good news&#8221; is euaggelizo, which means to evangelize, to announce good news. To preach the gospel was the first commission of the Savior as God&#8217;s anointed One, the Messiah. Furthermore, God had sent Him to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, which is the New Testament age typified by the year of jubilee (Lev. 25:8-17), a time when God accepts the returned captives of sin and when the oppressed under the bondage of sin may enjoy the release of God&#8217;s salvation. The point we are emphasizing here, however, is that part of God&#8217;s work was to anoint the Son.<p>Another verse that speaks of God&#8217;s work in anointing Christ is Acts 10:38: &#8220;Jesus, the One from Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and power, who went about doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the Devil, for God was with Him.&#8221; God anointed Christ also to do good and to heal all the sick who were oppressed by the Devil. This proves that God was with Him.<h2 class=head2>6. Demonstrating Jesus by Works of Power and Wonders and Signs</h2><p>Acts 2:22 says, &#8220;Jesus the Nazarene, a man demonstrated by God to you by works of power and wonders and signs, which God did through Him in your midst.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;demonstrated&#8221; here literally means to point out, to exhibit, to show forth, in the sense of proving by demonstrating, thus bringing about an approval. This indicates that the Lord&#8217;s work was God&#8217;s demonstration of Him, His exhibition of Him. While Christ was ministering, whatever He did was an exhibition of the work done by God through Him. In the four Gospels we have the exhibition of a wonderful person, the God-man, who was fully tested, proved, and approved by God.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider further God&#8217;s work in the new dispensation, in His new administrative arrangement.<h2 class=head2>7. Passing through Death in the Son</h2><p>God&#8217;s work in the new dispensation includes His passing through death in the Son. The phrase &#8220;the blood of Jesus His Son&#8221; in 1 John 1:7 indicates this. The blood shed on the cross for our redemption was not only the blood of Jesus, but also the blood of the Son of God. This implies that while Jesus was dying on the cross, God went through death in Him.<p>It is significant that 1 John 1:7 speaks of &#8220;the blood of Jesus His Son.&#8221; The name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; denotes the Lord&#8217;s humanity, which was needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood for men, and the title &#8220;His Son&#8221; denotes the Lord&#8217;s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood. Thus, the blood of Jesus His Son indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man for redeeming the fallen men with the divine surety for its eternal efficacy, an efficacy that is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time. Thus, the redemption accomplished by the God-man is eternal (Heb. 9:12).<p>Another verse which indicates that God passed through death in the Son is Acts 20:28: &#8220;Shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood.&#8221; God obtained the church by paying the price of &#8220;His own blood.&#8221; &#8220;His own blood,&#8221; as the blood of God, proves the fact that God died on the cross.<p>More than two centuries ago, Charles Wesley wrote a hymn that speaks of God dying for us. In this hymn Wesley says:<p class=hbody>Amazing love! How can it be<br>That thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</p><p>In this hymn Wesley goes on to say, &#8220;&#8217;Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!&#8221; Here Wesley declares that God died for us. Charles Wesley saw the vision concerning this and declared in his hymn that God died for us.<p>The God who died for us is not the God before incarnation. Prior to incarnation, God certainly did not have blood, and He could not have died for us. It was after the incarnation, in which God was mingled with humanity, that He died for us. Through incarnation, our God, the Creator, the eternal One, Jehovah, became mingled with man. As a result, He was no longer only God-He became a God-man. As the God-man, He surely had blood and was able to die for us.<h2 class=head2>8. Forsaking Christ Economically When He Was Judging Christ as Our Substitute Made Sin for Us and Bearing Our Sins</h2><p>When God was judging Christ as our Substitute made sin for us and bearing our sins, God forsook Christ economically. Regarding this, Matthew 27:45 and 46 say, &#8220;Now from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, &#8221;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221; The sixth hour is our twelve o&#8217;clock noon, and the ninth is our three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. The Lord Jesus was crucified at the third hour, at our nine o&#8217;clock in the morning (Mark 15:25), and He suffered on the cross for six hours. In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God&#8217;s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God for the accomplishment of our redemption. During that time God counted Him as our suffering Substitute for sin (Isa. 53:10). Hence, darkness came over all the land because our sin and sins and all negative things were dealt with there, and God forsook Him because of our sin. God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners (1 Pet. 3:18), bearing our sins (1 Pet. 2:24; Isa. 53:6) and being made sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21). This means that God judged Him as our Substitute for our sins. In the sight of God Christ became a great sinner. Because Christ was our Substitute and was even sin in the sight of God, God judged Him and even forsook Him.<p>According to the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours. During the first three hours, men did many unrighteous things to Him. They persecuted and mocked Him. Thus, in the first three hours the Lord suffered man&#8217;s unrighteous treatment. But at the sixth hour, twelve noon, God came in, and there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour, until three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. The coming of darkness was God&#8217;s doing, and in the midst of it the Lord cried out the words quoted in Matthew 27:46. When the Lord was suffering the persecution of man, God was with Him, and He enjoyed the presence of God. But at the end of the first three hours, God forsook Him, and darkness came. Unable to tolerate this, the Lord shouted loudly, &#8220;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221; As we have pointed out, God forsook Him because He was our Substitute bearing our sins. Isaiah 53 reveals that this was the time God put our sins on Him. In the three hours from twelve noon to three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, the righteous God put all our sins upon this Substitute and judged Him righteously for our sins. God forsook Him because during these hours He was a sinner there on the cross; He was even made sin. On the one hand, the Lord bore our sins; on the other hand, He was made sin for us. Therefore, according to His righteousness, God judged Him and forsook Him economically.<p>The Lord was born of the begetting Spirit, who is God reaching man, as the divine essence, who never left Him essentially. Even when He was on the cross crying out, &#8220;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221; He still had the begetting Spirit (God in the essential sense) as the divine essence. Then who left Him? It was the anointing Spirit (God in the economical sense), through whom He presented Himself as the God-man to be the all-inclusive sacrifice to God (Heb. 9:14), who left Him economically. After God accepted Christ as the all-inclusive offering, the anointing Spirit left Him. But although the anointing Spirit left Him economically, the Lord still had the begetting Spirit essentially.<p>When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross under God&#8217;s judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being. Nevertheless, He was forsaken by the righteous and judging God economically.<h2 class=head2>9. Condemning Sin in the Flesh through the Death of Christ in the Flesh</h2><p>As part of His work in His new administrative arrangement, or economy, God condemned sin in the flesh through the death of Christ in the flesh. Concerning this, Romans 8:3 says, &#8220;For, the law being impossible in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&#8221; Here we see that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin and condemned sin in the flesh. God solved the problem of sin by sending His own Son &#8220;in the likeness of the flesh of sin.&#8221; Christ became flesh (John 1:14), but He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin. There was no sin in His flesh. He had only the likeness of the flesh of sin, not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin.<p>The phrase &#8220;the likeness of the flesh of sin&#8221; contains three important words: likeness, flesh, and sin. To say only &#8220;the flesh of sin&#8221; would indicate sinful flesh. Paul, however, adds &#8220;in the likeness,&#8221; indicating that in Christ&#8217;s human nature there was no sin, even though that nature did bear the likeness, the appearance, of the flesh of sin. Furthermore, Paul does not say that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh and stop there. He adds &#8220;of sin.&#8221; The word &#8220;likeness&#8221; denotes strongly that Christ&#8217;s humanity does not have sin, but still that His humanity was in some way related to sin.<p>In doing the work of condemning sin in the flesh through the death of Christ in the flesh, God was wise. He knew that He should not send His Son to be the flesh of sin, for if He had done that, His Son would have been involved with sin. Therefore, God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, as typified by the brass serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness (Num. 21:9), as mentioned by the Lord Himself in John 3:14. The Lord&#8217;s word in John 3:14 indicates that the brass serpent was a type of Himself on the cross in our stead. When Jesus was on the cross, in the sight of God He was in the form of the serpent. Satan is the serpent, and the sin that was injected into man&#8217;s body, transmuting it into the flesh of sin, is the nature of Satan. Hence, the flesh of sin actually means the flesh with the nature of Satan. The Bible says that Jesus, the Son of God, became flesh. However, this absolutely does not mean that Christ became the flesh with the nature of Satan, because Romans 8:3 says that God sent Him in the likeness of the flesh of sin, thereby indicating that Christ assumed only the likeness of the flesh of sin, not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin.<p>In another verse, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Paul says that Christ &#8220;did not know sin.&#8221; This means that He had no sin and that He did not know sin in an experiential way by contact or personal experience (cf. John 8:46; 1 Pet. 2:22; Heb. 4:15; 7:26). Yet 2 Corinthians 5:21 also says that this One who had no sin was made sin for us by God. Although this verse says that Christ was made sin, it does not mean that He was sinful in nature, for He was sent only in the likeness of the flesh of sin. The brass serpent had the form of the serpent, but it did not have the poison of the serpent. Christ was made sin in form. Within Him there was no sin; He had nothing to do with the nature of sin. He was made only in the likeness of the flesh of sin for us.<p>Romans 8:3 says not only that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but also that God sent Him &#8220;concerning sin.&#8221; Some versions render the Greek here as &#8220;an offering for sin.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s thought is that sin is a problem to us and makes our flesh weak before the law (Rom. 8:3a). Not only our flesh but also sin needs to be dealt with. So God sent His Son not only in the likeness of the flesh of sin but also concerning sin, that is, for sin, for the problem of sin. In this way, God condemned sin and dealt with our flesh to resolve the problem.<p>Sin was condemned in the flesh of Christ on the cross. Sin is the nature of Satan. Satan&#8217;s nature, that is, sin, was in the flesh, and Christ put on the likeness of this flesh of sin, the likeness of the flesh in which sin, the nature of Satan, dwelt. Then Christ took this flesh to the cross and crucified it. In this way God condemned sin in the flesh through the death of Christ in the flesh.<p>The sin in the flesh condemned by God may be called personified sin. This personified sin is described in Romans 5 through 7, where we are told that sin reigns (5:21; 6:12), that it can lord it over us (6:14), that it deceives us (7:11), and that it dwells in us (7:17, 20). This personified sin in the flesh, which can force us to do things against our will, is actually Satan moving in our sinful flesh. Therefore, when God condemned sin in the flesh, He also destroyed Satan, the Devil (Heb. 2:14).<h2 class=head2>10. Tearing the Veil to Open the Way to the Holy of Holies</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, God tore the veil to open the way to the Holy of Holies. Matthew 27:51 says, &#8220;Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.&#8221; This signifies that the separation between God and man was abolished, because the flesh (signified by the veil) of sin taken by Christ in its likeness (Rom. 8:3) had been crucified (Heb. 10:20). The words &#8220;from the top to the bottom&#8221; indicate that the tearing of the veil was God&#8217;s doing from above. Because sin had been judged and the flesh of sin had been crucified, the separation between God and man was taken away. Now the way to enter into the presence of God is open for us.<p>Hebrews 10:19 and 20 also speak of God&#8217;s tearing the veil to open the way for us to enter into the Holy of Holies: &#8220;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.&#8221; The Holy of Holies today is in heaven, where the Lord Jesus is (Heb. 9:12, 24). How, then, can we enter it while we are still on earth? The secret is our spirit (Heb. 4:12). The Christ who is in heaven is also now in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). He, as the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51), joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies, and here we meet with God who is on the throne of grace.<p>According to Hebrews 10:20, we enter the Holy of Holies by a new and living way, which Christ dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh. The way into the Holy of Holies has been cut. The Greek word translated &#8220;new&#8221; in this verse means freshly slain. Through Christ&#8217;s death on the cross, the way has been freshly slain for us. What was slain? Not only the flesh but the entire old creation. In this verse, the veil, which is Christ&#8217;s flesh, signifies the old creation, including us. On the veil were cherubim (Exo. 26:31), which signify the creatures (Ezek. 10:15). When the veil was torn, the cherubim were also torn, signifying that when the flesh of Christ, which is typified by the veil, was crucified, all the creatures also were crucified with His flesh. We have seen that when the Lord Jesus died, the veil in the temple was torn from the top to the bottom, meaning that it was torn by God in the heavens. The old creation has been slain, and a new and living way to enter into the Holy of Holies has been opened by God. Now through the riven veil of the flesh and by the blood of Jesus we can enter into the Holy of Holies.<p>The veil in Hebrews 10:20 is the second veil (Heb. 9:3) within the tabernacle which, as we have seen, typifies the flesh of Christ. When Christ&#8217;s flesh was crucified, this veil was torn, thus opening the way for us, who were excluded from God signified by the tree of life (Gen. 3:22-24), to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact Him and take Him as the tree of life for our enjoyment.<h2 class=head2>11. Wiping Out the Handwriting in Ordinances by Nailing It to the Cross</h2><p>When Christ was crucified, God wiped out the handwriting in ordinances, nailing it to the cross. Speaking of God, Colossians 2:14 says, &#8220;Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;wiping out&#8221; can also be translated blotting out, obliterating, erasing, or annulling (a decree of law). The Greek word for &#8220;handwriting&#8221; denotes a legal document, a bond. Here it refers to the written law. The ordinances, or decrees, refer to the ceremonial law with its rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship. These ordinances God has taken out of the way by nailing them to the cross. This is to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances (Eph. 2:15).<p>Ordinances, rituals, and ceremonies of the law have been crucified in Christ&#8217;s death. Not only were sin, the natural man, the world, and Satan crucified; the law was also crucified. As evil men were putting Christ on the cross, God was nailing the law to the cross. Although the law had been given by God through angels, God Himself nailed it to the cross of Christ. Just as sin has been condemned (Rom. 8:3), so the law has been crucified. God does not want the law to remain in between Christ and us. What He desires is for us to live together with the risen Christ without any interruption.<h2 class=head2>12. Stripping Off the Rulers and the Authorities, Making a Display of Them Openly, and Triumphing Over Them in the Cross</h2><p>Colossians 2:15 says, &#8220;Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;He&#8221; refers to God. When Christ was on the cross, God not only wiped out the ordinances of the law, but also stripped off the rulers and the authorities and made a display of them openly, triumphing over them. The rulers and the authorities are evil angels, fallen angels that are subordinates of Satan working for him. While the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, these rulers and authorities, these fallen angels, were very busy. Actually, during the time of Christ&#8217;s crucifixion; there was an invisible spiritual conflict between God and these evil rulers and authorities. God won the victory, stripped off the rulers and authorities, and made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross.<p>After God created the heavens, the earth, and other items in the universe, an archangel rebelled, and many angels followed him. This archangel became Satan, and his followers became the evil rulers, powers, and authorities in the heavenlies. And after man was created, Satan induced man to fall and man became sinful. The rebellion of the angels and the fall of man put God into a difficult situation. God&#8217;s way to deal with this difficulty was the cross. First, God became a man, thereby putting humanity on Himself. Then Christ, God incarnate, went to the cross and was crucified. While He was dying on the cross, many things took place. God judged sin and the sinful old man. At the same time, He nailed the law to the cross. When God was nailing the law to the cross, the evil angels were present and very active. But God stripped them off through the cross.<p>While Christ was laboring on the cross to accomplish redemption, God was working. At the time of the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion, the cross was the center of the universe. The Savior, sin, Satan, we, and God were all there. God was judging sin and nailing the law to the cross. As He was doing this, the rulers and authorities gathered around God and Christ. Both God and Christ were working. Christ&#8217;s work was His crucifixion, whereas God&#8217;s work was to judge sin and all the negative things and to nail the law with its ordinances to the cross. The rulers and authorities who had gathered around God and Christ were also working, busy in the attempt to frustrate the work of God and Christ, pressing in closely around God and Christ. If they had not pressed in closely, how could God have stripped them off? The words &#8220;stripping off indicate that they were very close, as close as our garments are to our body. By stripping off the rulers and authorities God made a display of them openly. He openly put them to shame and triumphed over them. What a great matter this is!<p>The word &#8220;triumph&#8221; implies fighting. It indicates that a war was raging. While Christ was accomplishing redemption and God was dealing with the law and with negative things, the rulers and authorities came to interfere, pressing in close to God and Christ. At that very juncture God stripped them off, triumphed over them, and made a display of them openly, putting them to shame.<p>Now that the law and the evil angels have been set aside, God has a clear ground and a peaceful environment to enliven His chosen ones. He has a proper atmosphere to carry out the pleasant task of dispensing Himself into the very ones He chose in eternity past. As the life-giving Spirit, the Triune God, having stripped off the rulers and authorities, is giving life to us by dispensing Himself into our being.<h2 class=head2>13. Raising Up Christ from the Dead</h2><p>In His work God also raised up Christ from the dead. Acts 2:24 says, &#8220;Whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.&#8221; Here and in verse 32 Peter says that God raised up the Lord Jesus. Considering Christ as God, the New Testament tells us that He Himself rose from the dead (Rom. 14:9). But regarding the Lord as a man, the New Testament says that God raised Him from the dead (Rom. 8:11). God&#8217;s raising up Christ from the dead was His approval of Christ to be the Messiah. Through the resurrection of Christ God was declaring that the resurrected Christ was the real Messiah, the One anointed and appointed by God to carry out His eternal commission.<p>In Acts 3:15 Peter again speaks about Christ&#8217;s being raised up by God from the dead: &#8220;The Author of life you killed, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.&#8221; Although the Author of life, Christ, as the Originator of life, had been killed, God raised Him from the dead. Considering the Lord Jesus as a man, Acts 3:15 again tells us that He was raised up from the dead by God.<h2 class=head2>14. Sending His Spirit Essentially in the Son&#8217;s Name</h2><p>In John 14:26 the Lord told the disciples that the Father will send the Holy Spirit as the Comforter in His name. This took place in Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Through Christ&#8217;s resurrection God sent His Spirit essentially in the Son&#8217;s name. The Son came in the Father&#8217;s name (John 5:43), because the Son and the Father are one (10:30). The Spirit is sent in the Son&#8217;s name, because the Spirit and the Son are also one (2 Cor. 3:17). John 14:16-20 proves that the Spirit, who is the Spirit of reality, sent by the Father, is the reality, the realization, of the Son. John 15:26 says that the Son will send the Spirit from with the Father, and the Spirit comes from with the Father. This, compared with John 14:26, which says that the Father will send the Spirit, indicates that the Son and the Father are one in sending the Spirit, and the Spirit, in His coming, is not only one with the Son, as indicated by His coming in the Son&#8217;s name in John 14:26, but also one with the Father, as indicated by His coming with the Father in John 15:26. This is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-reaching man eventually as the Spirit.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to see God&#8217;s work in His new administrative arrangement, particularly in Christ&#8217;s ascension.<h2 class=head2>15. Seating Christ in the Heavens, Subjecting All Things under His Feet, and Giving Him to Be Head over All Things to the Church</h2><p>Ephesians 1:20-22 says, &#8220;Raising Him [Christ] from among the dead, and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming.&#8221; God has not only raised Christ from among the dead but also has seated Christ &#8220;at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming&#8221; (Eph. 1:20b-21). God&#8217;s right hand, where Christ has been seated by the great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place with supreme authority. The &#8220;heavenlies&#8221; refers not only to the third heaven, the highest place in the universe, where God dwells, but also to the state and atmosphere of the heavens in which Christ was seated by God&#8217;s power. &#8220;Rule&#8221; refers to the highest office; &#8220;authority,&#8221; to every kind of official power; &#8220;power,&#8221; to the might of authority; and &#8220;lordship,&#8221; to the preeminence which power establishes. The authorities include not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, good or evil, but also the human, earthly ones.<p>Ephesians 1:22 goes on to say that God has subjected all things under Christ&#8217;s feet. To seat Christ far above all is one thing; to subject all things under Christ&#8217;s feet is another. The former is a matter of transcendency; the latter is a matter of the subjection of all things to Christ.<p>The last part of Ephesians 1:22 says, &#8220;And gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&#8221; The headship of Christ over all things is a gift from God to Him. Through God&#8217;s great power Christ has received the headship in the universe. It does not mean that God gave Christ to the church as a gift; it means that God gave Christ a gift-the headship over all things. A great gift was given to Christ by God, and this gift is the headship over all things.<p>God&#8217;s giving Christ to be the Head over all things is to the church. The phrase &#8220;to the church&#8221; implies a transmission. What God gave Christ to be is to the church; it is transmitted to the church. The church shares it. Through the transmission that is to the church, the church shares with Christ in all His attainments and obtainments.<p>The word &#8220;to&#8221; in Ephesians 1:22 indicates God&#8217;s dispensing. In His work in the new dispensation God passed through death in the Son, condemned sin in the flesh, tore the veil, wiped out the handwriting in ordinances, stripped off the principalities and powers, raised up Christ from the dead, seated Christ in the heavens, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. Because the church is the issue of the ascended Christ, the church is free from sin, from the ordinances of the law, and from the rulers and authorities in the air. The church is organically united to the Head over all things. The church is now the place where God can dispense Himself into His people. The church is the organ that receives directly all of God&#8217;s dispensing.<h2 class=head2>16. Making Jesus Both Lord and Christ</h2><p>Acts 2:36 speaks of God&#8217;s work in making Jesus both Lord and Christ: &#8220;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ- this Jesus whom you crucified.&#8221; As God, the Lord was the Lord all the time (Luke 1:43; John 11:21; 20:28). But as man, He was made the Lord in His ascension after He brought His humanity into God in His resurrection.<p>God made Jesus the Lord, as the Lord of all (Acts 10:36), to possess all. God made Him the Lord to possess the whole universe, God&#8217;s chosen people, and all positive things, matters, and persons. God has made Christ the Lord not only of God&#8217;s chosen people but also of the angels and of all those who will be in the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth. This means that Christ has been made the Lord of the heavens, the earth, and of everything and everyone He has redeemed.<p>Acts 2:36 tells us that God has also made Jesus to be Christ. As God&#8217;s sent One and anointed One, Jesus was Christ from the time He was born (Luke 2:11; Matt. 1:16; John 1:41; Matt. 16:16). But as such a One He was also officially made the Christ of God in His ascension. God made Him to be the Christ to carry out His commission.<h2 class=head2>17. Exalting Jesus to Be a Leader and Savior, to Give His Chosen People Repentance and Forgiveness of Sins</h2><p>Acts 5:31 says, &#8220;This One God has exalted to His right hand as a Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.&#8221; God exalted the Man Jesus, rejected and killed by the Jewish leaders, as the highest leader, the Prince, the Ruler of the kings to rule over the world (Rev. 1:5; 19:16), and the Savior to save God&#8217;s chosen people. &#8220;Leader&#8221; is related to His authority, and &#8220;Savior&#8221; to His salvation. Because He has been exalted by God, Christ rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God&#8217;s chosen people to receive His salvation (Acts 17:26-27; John 17:2). &#8220;To give repentance...and forgiveness of sins&#8221; to God&#8217;s chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior. His sovereign ruling causes and leads God&#8217;s chosen people to repent, and His salvation based upon His redemption affords them forgiveness of sins.<p>Repentance is for forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4). On God&#8217;s side, forgiveness of sins is based upon His redemption (Eph. 1:7). On man&#8217;s side, forgiveness of sins is through repentance. Now we need to repent and receive forgiveness. Repentance and forgiveness are two steps by which we are made ready to receive the dispensing of the Triune God so that we may be the church.<p>The goal of God&#8217;s work in the new dispensation is for His dispensing of Himself into us. God did all the things we have covered in this message for the goal of making everything ready and having His chosen people available for His dispensing. Dispensing is God&#8217;s unique goal. We all need to pray. &#8220;Lord, dispense Yourself into me. O Lord, infuse me with Yourself.&#8221; Our need today is to receive more and more of God&#8217;s dispensing.<h2 class=head2>18. Making Christ the High Priest</h2><p>Sin frustrates people from enjoying God&#8217;s dispensing. When God condemned sin in the flesh through the death of Christ in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), He dealt with this hindrance to His dispensing. When Christ was crucified, God also wiped out the handwriting in ordinances (Col. 2:14) and stripped off the rulers and authorities, making a display of them openly and triumphing over them in the cross (Col. 2:15). After this, God raised up Christ from the dead, seated Him in the heavens, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:20-22). God has also made Jesus both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). Furthermore, He has exalted Jesus to be a Leader and Savior so that He may give His chosen people repentance and forgiveness of sins (Acts 5:31). Now we need to see that, in His work, God has made Christ the High Priest.<p>Hebrews 5:5 and 6 say, &#8220;Christ did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest, but He who said to Him, You are My Son, this day I have begotten You; as also in another place He says, You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.&#8221; Verse 5 contains a quote from Psalm 2:7: &#8220;You are My Son, this day I have begotten You.&#8221; This refers to Christ&#8217;s resurrection (Acts 13:33), which qualified Him to be our High Priest. For Christ to be our High Priest, He had to partake of our humanity and enter with this humanity into resurrection. With His humanity He can sympathize with us and be merciful to us (Heb. 4:15; 2:17). In resurrection, with His divinity, He can do everything for us and be faithful to us (Heb. 7:24-25; 2:17).<p>The context of the quotation of Hebrews 5:6, from Psalm 110, refers to Christ in His ascension and enthronement (Psa. 110:1-4). Ascension and enthronement are further qualifications for Christ to be our High Priest (Heb. 7:26). Christ was not only raised up from the dead by God, but He also ascended to the height of the universe.<p>God has made Christ our High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec. The order of Melchisedec is higher than the order of Aaron. The order of Aaron was for the priesthood only in humanity, whereas the order of Melchisedec is for the priesthood in both humanity and divinity.<p>Melchisedec came forth to minister bread and wine to Abraham after Abraham had fought to rescue Lot. He is a type of Christ as God&#8217;s High Priest. Christ is now a priest according to the order of Melchisedec, and His work is to come to us, today&#8217;s Abrahams, with bread and wine. When we come to the table, we enjoy the bread and wine supplied by our High Priest, our Melchisedec. The bread and wine on the table signify the body and blood of Christ who, as the embodiment of God, has been processed so that He may be ministered into us. The bread and wine contain the elements of Christ in His death and resurrection, that are being dispensed into us. As today&#8217;s Abrahams, we enjoy the supply of our Melchisedec, a supply of the riches of Christ, that is for God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into us.<p>According to the Bible, there are two orders of the priesthood-the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec. The order of Melchisedec came before that of Aaron. The Aaronic priesthood deals with sin on the negative side. The ministry of Melchisedec, on the contrary, is positive. Melchisedec did not appear to Abraham with an offering to take away sin; he came with bread and wine to nourish Abraham. As such a High Priest, Christ ministers to us Himself in the bread and wine, as the embodiment of the processed God for our nourishment.<p>The book of Hebrews reveals that although Christ has completed His redemptive work, He is very active as our High Priest, ministering Himself into us in the processed bread and wine for our daily supply. This is why God made Christ a High Priest not according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchisedec. Today Christ is not the sacrifice-offering High Priest; He is the bread-and-wine-ministering High Priest. He has redeemed us with Himself in His humanity as the sacrifice on the earth, and now He feeds us with Himself in His divinity as the supply of life in the heavens. His priesthood according to the order of Melchisedec is for God&#8217;s original purpose of dispensing Himself into us to produce a corporate expression for Himself.<h2 class=head2>19. Designating Christ to Be the Judge of the Living and the Dead</h2><p>Acts 10:42 says, &#8220;He charged us to proclaim to the people and solemnly testify that this is the One who was designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.&#8221; Christ has been designated, by God, the Judge of all mankind. He will judge both the living and the dead. At His coming back the resurrected Christ will be the Judge of the living before the millennium on His throne of glory (Matt. 25:31-46). This is related to His second coming (2 Tim. 4:1). Christ will also be the Judge of the dead after the millennium on the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). Thus, Romans 2:16 says, &#8220;God shall judge the secrets of men...by Jesus Christ.&#8221;<p>Acts 17:31 says, &#8220;Because He has set a day in which He is about to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a Man whom He has designated, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from among the dead.&#8221; God has designated Christ to judge the inhabited earth at a day set by Him. This refers to the day when Christ will judge the living on the throne of His glory before the millennium. Because on that day He will judge the inhabited earth, it should refer only to His judgment on the living. God has designated Him to execute this judgment because He is a Man (John 5:27), and God&#8217;s raising Him from among the dead is a strong proof of this.<p>God has given the authority of all judgment to Christ that all men may honor Him as they honor God (John 5:22-23), and He will judge according to the will of God (John 5:30). As the Son of God (John 5:25), He can give life (John 5:21), and as the Son of Man, He can execute judgment (John 5:27). He is one with the Father in the matter of enlivening, and He is also one with Him in the matter of judgment.<h2 class=head2>20. Pouring Out His Spirit Economically upon His Slaves</h2><p>After God seated Christ in the heavens, made Him both Lord and Christ, exalted Him to be a Leader and a Savior, made Him the High Priest, and designated Him to be the Judge of the living and the dead, He poured out His Spirit upon His slaves. Concerning this, Acts 2:17 and 18 say, &#8220;It shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams; and upon My slaves, both men and women, I will pour out of My Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy.&#8221; The pouring out of the Spirit here differs from the breathing of the Spirit into the disciples out of the mouth of Christ on the day of His resurrection (John 20:22). The pouring out of God&#8217;s Spirit was from the heavens after Christ&#8217;s ascension. The former is the essential aspect of the Spirit breathed into the disciples as life for their living; the latter is the economical aspect of the Spirit poured out upon them as power for their work. The same Spirit is both within the believers essentially and upon them economically.<p>The poured-out Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God. The Triune God became incarnate, and then He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, after which He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death to solve all problems. Then He was buried and raised up from the dead, entering into resurrection and becoming a life-giving Spirit. After His resurrection, He ascended to the heavens to be made Lord, Christ, Savior, Leader, High Priest, and Head of all things. After passing through such a process, He became the Spirit, and the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.<p>The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was not merely the so-called Holy Spirit, as is commonly taught. Rather, according to the entire revelation of the Bible, this Spirit was the Triune God consummated, through the process of incarnation unto ascension, as the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was the consummation of the Triune God. When this Spirit was poured out, the processed Triune God was poured out, and this outpouring included the elements of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension.<p>The outpouring of the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God is a great blessing to God&#8217;s chosen people. Now God&#8217;s people can receive in full the dispensing of this consummated God. From the day of Pentecost until now, God&#8217;s chosen people have been under this dispensing. We may be under such a divine dispensing day by day and even moment by moment. It is a great thing to be under this dispensing, which is the issue of God&#8217;s marvelous work in the New Testament.<p>This dispensing could not take place at the time of John the Baptist, or when Peter was traveling with the Lord Jesus. The reason the divine dispensing could not be experienced then was that the Triune God had not yet been consummated. But by the time Christ came to His disciples after His resurrection and told them to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19), the Triune God had been consummated. It certainly is good news, glad tidings, to hear that the Triune God has been consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit to dispense Himself into us.<p>God has poured out the all-inclusive Spirit as His consummation upon the whole Body of Christ including all of us. This outpouring is God dispensing Himself into His chosen people in a full way. Today we are under this outpouring, this dispensing. May we all see this vision that God has poured out the all-inclusive consummated Spirit and that we all are under this marvelous dispensing.<h2 class=head2>21. Sending the Resurrected Christ to His Chosen People</h2><p>After God poured out the consummated Spirit upon the Body of Christ, He sent the resurrected Christ back to His chosen people. Acts 3:26 speaks of this: &#8220;To you first, God, having raised up His Servant, has sent Him to bless you in turning away each one of you from your wickedness.&#8221; God has sent back the resurrected and ascended Christ to the Jews first by pouring out His Spirit on the day of Pentecost. Hence, the very consummated Spirit God poured out is the Christ God raised and exalted to the heavens. When the apostles preached and ministered this Christ, the consummated Spirit was ministered to people.<p>At the time Peter spoke the word recorded in Acts 3:26, Christ as God&#8217;s Servant had ascended to the heavens and was still there. Nevertheless, Peter told the people that God had sent Christ to bless them. Actually, God has received Christ into the heavens. But here Peter says that God has sent this ascended One to the people. In what way did God send the ascended Christ to the Jews? God sent Him by pouring out the consummated Spirit. That was God&#8217;s way of sending the ascended Christ to the people. This implies that the outpoured Spirit is actually the ascended Christ Himself. When the outpoured Spirit came to the people, that was Christ, the ascended One, sent by God to them. From this we see that the poured-out Spirit is identical to the ascended Christ. In God&#8217;s economy for the experience of His people, the ascended Christ and the poured-out Spirit are one. In God&#8217;s economy Christ and the Spirit are one for the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us and for our enjoyment of this dispensing.<p>We have heard much that God will send Christ back in the future, at the time of the second advent. But according to Acts 3:26, God has already sent back the ascended Christ. First He was sent to the Jews and then to Gentiles throughout the world.<p>The first time Christ was sent by God He was sent in the flesh. After His ascension He was sent back by God as the Spirit. Christ today is the Spirit. When the all-inclusive Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost, that was God&#8217;s sending of Christ. The outpouring of the Spirit was the descension of Christ. In chapter two of Acts the Spirit was poured out, and Peter received this outpouring of the Spirit. Then in chapter three Peter says that God has sent Christ back to His people. God honored Christ, glorified Christ, and sent Him back. Even while Peter was speaking to the people, Christ was there. He was present not as the Christ in the flesh but as the pneumatic Christ, who is the Spirit. Therefore, as part of His work, God has sent the resurrected Christ to His chosen people as the Spirit.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(6)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider more aspects of God&#8217;s work in the new dispensation.<h2 class=head2>22. Calling, Forgiving, Justifying, Reconciling, Receiving, Regenerating, Washing, Sanctifying, and Glorifying the Believers</h2><p>God&#8217;s work includes His calling, forgiving, justifying, reconciling, receiving, regenerating, washing, sanctifying, and glorifying the believers. Let us briefly consider these matters one by one.<h2 class=head4>a. Calling the Believers</h2><p>Romans 8:30, speaking of God, says, &#8220;Whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.&#8221; Here we see that we have been called by God. According to 1 Corinthians 1:9, God has called us &#8220;into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&#8221; To be called into the fellowship of God&#8217;s Son is to be called into the partaking of, the participating in, His Son. This is to be called to partake of and to participate in the all-inclusive Christ. God has called us into such a fellowship so that we may partake of and participate in Christ and enjoy Him as our God-given portion.<p>First Thessalonians 2:12 says that God has called us &#8220;into His own kingdom and glory.&#8221; The kingdom here is the sphere in which the believers worship and enjoy God under the divine ruling with the view of entering into His glory.<p>Paul speaks of God&#8217;s calling in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 and 14. &#8220;God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, to which also He called you through our gospel unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;which&#8221; in verse 14 refers to salvation and belief in the preceding verse. God chose us unto salvation and belief in eternity, and then in time He called us to salvation and belief unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord. Salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and the belief of the truth are the procedures; obtaining the glory of our Lord is the goal.<p>In 2 Timothy 1:9 Paul says that God &#8220;has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose.&#8221; God has not only saved us to enjoy His blessing, but also called us with a holy calling, a calling for a particular cause, to fulfill His purpose. The purpose here is God&#8217;s plan according to His will to place us into Christ, making us one with Him to share His life and position so that we may be His testimony.<p>In his second Epistle Peter gives us a word regarding God&#8217;s calling, saying that God &#8220;has called us to His own glory and virtue&#8221; (2 Pet. 1:3). Glory is the expression of God, God expressed in splendor. Literally, the Greek word rendered &#8220;virtue&#8221; means excellency. Virtue denotes the energy of life to overcome all obstacles and to carry out all excellent attributes. Glory is the divine goal, and virtue is the energy and strength of life to reach the goal.<p>In 1 Peter 2:9 we are told that God has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. Darkness is the expression and sphere of Satan in death; light is the expression and sphere of God in life. God has called us, delivered us, out of Satan&#8217;s death-realm of darkness into His life-realm of light (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13).<h2 class=head3>b. Forgiving the Believers</h2><p>In addition to calling us, God has forgiven us. Ephesians 4:32 tells us that God in Christ forgave us, and Colossians 2:13 says that God has forgiven us all offenses. According to Hebrews 8:12, God will by no means remember our sins. This means God will forget our sins. To forgive means to forget, for the forgetting of sins is the real forgiveness of sins. Without forgetting, forgiveness is not real. Hence, God not only forgives our sins but also forgets them.<p>First John 1:9 tells us that God is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins. To forgive us is to release us from the offense of our sins. The forgiveness of sins is the basic element of God&#8217;s gospel (Luke 24:47; Acts 5:31; 10:43; 13:38). Through this, the believers who receive Christ become the children of God (1 John 2:12; John 1:12-13).<h2 class=head3>c. Justifying the Believers</h2><p>A number of verses in Romans speak of God justifying the believers. Romans 8:30 says that those &#8220;whom He called, these He also justified.&#8221; Then 8:33b declares, &#8220;It is God who justifies.&#8221; According to Romans 3:24, we are &#8220;justified freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus,&#8221; for God is just and justifies the one who is of the faith of Jesus (v. 26). Justification is God&#8217;s action in approving people according to His standard of righteousness. God&#8217;s righteousness is the standard, not ours. No matter how righteous we are, we cannot be approved by God according to our righteousness. Although we may be right with everyone-our parents, our children, our neighbors and friends-our righteousness will never justify us before God. We may justify ourselves according to our standard of righteousness, but this does not enable us to be justified by God according to His standard. But when God justifies us, we are approved by Him according to the standard of His righteousness.<p>How can God justify us, approving us according to His standard of righteousness? He can do this because the work of justification is based on the redemption of Christ. When the redemption of Christ is applied to us, we are justified. If there were no such redemption, it would be impossible for us to be justified by God. Christ&#8217;s redemption is the basis of God&#8217;s justification.<p>In Romans 3:30 Paul says, &#8220;It is one God who shall justify the circumcision out of faith and uncircumcision through faith.&#8221; God is one. This one God justifies both the Jews and the Gentiles. Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, it is the one God who has justified all of us so that we may be one as the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head3>d. Reconciling the Believers</h2><p>God has also reconciled us to Himself. Romans 5:10 says, &#8220;While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.&#8221; Colossians 1:21 and 22 also indicate that as enemies we have been reconciled to God. Originally, we were not only sinners but also enemies of God. Through the redeeming death of Christ, God has justified us, the sinners, and has reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself. Because we were sinners, we needed redemption. Because we were also enemies of God, we needed reconciliation to Him. This took place when we believed in the Lord Jesus. We have received God&#8217;s justification and reconciliation by faith.<p>Colossians 1:20 and 22 tell us that it was through Christ as the active instrument that God&#8217;s work of reconciliation was processed, that to reconcile us to God is to make peace with God for us, and that this was accomplished through the blood of Christ. Through the death of Christ God has reconciled us to Himself in order that we may be presented holy, blameless, and without reproach before Him.<h2 class=head3>e. Receiving the Believers</h2><p>Romans 14:3 indicates that God receives the believers. God receives us according to His Son. As long as a person receives His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, as his Savior, God receives him immediately. God&#8217;s receiving is based on Christ&#8217;s receiving, and Christ&#8217;s receiving is in accordance with our faith in Him. Once we have believed in Christ, we are received by God. God&#8217;s receiving ushers us into the enjoyment of the Triune God and all that He has prepared and accomplished in Christ for us as our eternal portion.<h2 class=head3>f. Regenerating the Believers</h2><p>First Peter 1:3 says, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.&#8221; Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God&#8217;s full salvation. Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God. Regeneration enlivens us with God&#8217;s life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God. Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope. Such regeneration takes place through the resurrection of Christ from among the dead. When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him. Thus, we were resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6). In His resurrection the divine life was imparted to us and made us the same as Christ in life and nature. This is the basic factor of our regeneration.<p>To be regenerated is to receive another life, God&#8217;s divine life, in addition to our human life. Through regeneration God imparts His divine life into us. We all have been born of His divine life. This is to be regenerated by God.<p>James 1:18 also speaks of God&#8217;s work in regenerating the believers: &#8220;Having purposed, He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures.&#8221; God brought us forth, regenerated us, of His own will, by His intention, to carry out His purpose, so that we might be the firstfruit of His creatures. To be the firstfruit of God&#8217;s creatures is to be the vigorous life that matures first. This is by the divine birth, our regeneration (John 3:5-6), which is carried out according to God&#8217;s eternal purpose.<p>God brought us forth, regenerated us, by the word of truth. The word of truth is the word of the divine reality, the word of what the Triune God is (John 1:14, 17). This word is the seed of life by which we have been regenerated (1 Pet. 1:23).<h2 class=head3>g. Washing the Believers</h2><p>First John 1:9 speaks of God&#8217;s cleansing, or washing, the believers: &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221; Whereas to be forgiven is to be released from the offense of our sins, to be cleansed is to be washed from the stain of unrighteousness. In this verse &#8220;unrighteousness&#8221; and &#8220;sins&#8221; are synonyms. All unrighteousness is sin (1 John 5:17). Both refer to our wrongdoings. &#8220;Sins&#8221; indicates the offense of our wrongdoings against God and man; &#8220;unrighteousness&#8221; indicates the stain of our wrongdoings, that we are not right either with God or with men. The offense needs God&#8217;s forgiveness, and the stain requires His cleansing. Both God&#8217;s forgiveness and God&#8217;s cleansing are needed for the restoration of our broken fellowship with Him so that we may enjoy Him in uninterrupted fellowship with a good conscience void of offense (1 Tim. 1:5; Acts 24:16).<h2 class=head3>h. Sanctifying the Believers</h2><p>In his work in the new dispensation God also sanctifies the believers: &#8220;The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; (1 Thes. 5:23). The God of peace is the Sanctifier. His sanctification brings in peace. When we are wholly sanctified by Him from within, we have peace with Him in every way.<p>The Greek word for &#8220;sanctified&#8221; means set apart, separated unto God, from things common or profane. However, to be sanctified involves more than being separated from a common, worldly position to a position that is for God, as illustrated in Matthew 23:17 and 19, where the gold is sanctified by the temple and the gift by the altar in changing their position, and in 1 Timothy 4:3-5, where food is sanctified by the saints&#8217; prayer. To be sanctified is also a matter of disposition, that is, a matter of being transformed from the natural disposition to a spiritual one, as indicated in Romans 12:2 and 2 Corinthians 3:18. This involves a long process, beginning from regeneration, passing the whole Christian life (1 Thes. 4:3; Heb. 12:14; Eph. 5:26), and being completed at the time of rapture, at the maturity of life.<p>According to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, God is sanctifying the believers wholly. This means that He is sanctifying us entirely, thoroughly, to the consummation. God sanctifies us wholly so that no part of our being, either of our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane.<h2 class=head3>i. Glorifying the Believers</h2><p>In His work in the new dispensation God also glorifies the believers. Romans 8:30 says, &#8220;Whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.&#8221; Since glorification will occur in the future, why does Paul use the past tense and say &#8220;glorified&#8221;? Have you been glorified? Although in our experience we have not been glorified, the Bible says that we have been glorified already. Everything mentioned in verse 30 is an accomplished fact-predestinated, called, justified, and glorified. The reason Paul speaks this way here is that although we are subject to time, God is not. He is the God of eternity. With Him, as the eternal God, there is no time. Therefore, in the sight of God, we have already been glorified. According to His concept, this has already been accomplished. Our glorification is secured and ensured in the eternal God Himself. According to our experience, glorification will take place in the future. But according to God&#8217;s view, it has already occurred. With God everything is timeless. In His sight, our predestination, calling, justification, and glorification are eternal matters.<p>According to Romans 5:2, we &#8220;boast in hope of the glory of God.&#8221; Romans 9:23 says that we are &#8220;vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory.&#8221; This glory will be in the revelation of the coming kingdom in which we, as sons of God, shall participate (Rom. 8:21). God has called us into this glory (1 Thes. 2:12; 2 Thes. 2:14; 1 Pet. 5:10), and Christ Himself is the hope of this glory (Col. 1:27) which we are expecting and for which we are waiting. We shall share this glory at the day of our glorification.<p>Romans 8:30 does not say that we shall be put into glory; rather, this verse indicates that we shall be glorified. As we have pointed out, glory is the expression of God. Christ, the hope of glory, has been sown into us as the seed of glory, and this seed will grow until it reaches the stage of blossoming, at which time the glory will come out. For God to glorify us means that the glory that has been sown into us, saturates our whole being, and is expressed through us. When our whole being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us. This is what it means for God to glorify us. When we experience this glorification, we shall be in the expression of God.<p>We have considered nine aspects of God&#8217;s work in relation to the believers: calling, forgiving, justifying, reconciling, receiving, regenerating, washing, sanctifying, and glorifying. We have been called, forgiven, justified, reconciled, received, regenerated, and washed. We are being sanctified, and we shall be glorified. All these matters are related to God&#8217;s dispensing. God&#8217;s calling, forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, receiving, regeneration, washing, and sanctifying are for His dispensing of Himself into us. The final step-glorification-is for the dispensing of God in full. We need to see that all these aspects of God&#8217;s work with respect to the believers are for the goal of His dispensing of Himself into us.<h2 class=head2>23. Sending Forth the Spirit of His Son into the Believers&#8217; Hearts</h2><p>Galatians 4:6 says, &#8220;Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&#8221; God&#8217;s Son is the embodiment of the divine life (1 John 5:12). Hence, the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). God gives us His Spirit of life not because we are lawkeepers but because we are His sons. As law-keepers we have no right to enjoy God&#8217;s Spirit of life. As sons of God we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life. Such a Spirit, the Spirit of the Son of God, is the focus of the blessing of God&#8217;s promise to Abraham (Gal. 3:14).<p>In verses 4 through 6 of Galatians 4 the Triune God is producing many sons for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. God the Father sent forth God the Son to redeem us from the law so that we might receive the sonship. He also sent forth God the Spirit to impart His life into us so that we might become His sons in reality.<p>Galatians 4:4 and 6 speak of two kinds of sending. Verse 4 says that God sent forth His Son, and verse 6, that God sent forth the Spirit of His Son. According to the promise in Genesis 3:15, Christ came under law as the seed of the woman in order to redeem those who were under law, that they might receive the sonship. The goal of Christ&#8217;s redemption, therefore, is sonship. Through His redemption Christ has opened the way for us to possess God&#8217;s sonship. However, if God had not sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, our sonship would be empty. It would be a sonship in position or form, not a sonship with reality. The reality of sonship, which depends on life and maturity, comes only by the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son. Thus, Galatians 4:6 declares that God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts.<p>We should not think that the Spirit of the Son is a person separate from the Son. Actually, the Spirit of the Son is another form of the Son. The One who was crucified was Christ, but the One who enters into the believers is the Spirit. In crucifixion for our redemption this One was Christ, but in the indwelling to be our life He is the Spirit. When the Son died on the cross, He was Christ, but when He enters into us, He is the Spirit. First He came as the Son under the law to qualify us for sonship and to open the way for us to share in this sonship. After He had finished this work, He became, in resurrection, the life-giving Spirit and comes to us as the Spirit of the Son. Thus, first God the Father sent the Son to accomplish redemption and to qualify us for sonship. Then He sent the Spirit of the Son to vitalize the sonship and to make it real in our experience. Today sonship actually depends upon the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son.<p>Galatians 4:6 says that God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts. Actually the Spirit of God came into our spirit at our regeneration (John 3:6; Rom. 8:16). Because our spirit is hidden in our hearts (1 Pet. 3:4) and because the word in Galatians 4:6 refers to a matter that is related to our feeling and understanding, both of which belong to our heart, this verse says that the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son was sent into our hearts.<h2 class=head2>24. Giving Life to the Believers</h2><p>Romans 8:11 says &#8220;If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&#8221; The God of resurrection who raised Christ from among the dead gives life, the divine life, to the believers&#8217; mortal bodies to strengthen their bodies and even make their dying bodies alive through His Spirit who indwells our spirit. It is by this that a believer can give life to a sinning brother as mentioned in 1 John 5:16. This brother does not give life to others by himself; he gives life to others by being one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17), thus he can impart, through the life-giving Spirit, the Lord&#8217;s life to others in the fellowship of the Lord&#8217;s divine life.<h2 class=head2>25. Making the Believers to Grow in Life</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 3:6-7 the Apostle Paul, the master planter in God&#8217;s farm, tells us that only God gives the growth to the believers, the spiritual plants on God&#8217;s farm. Regardless of how much Paul can plant and Apollos can water, they cannot give growth to the plants. God is the only One who makes us to grow, because He is the unique source of life with the unique life-supply. The growth God gives to us is the growth in life, which is crucially needed for us to be transformed into precious materials, the precious stones, for God&#8217;s building (1 Cor. 3:9-12a).<h2 class=head2>26. Operating in the Believers in Life</h2><p>Philippians 2:13 says, &#8220;It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&#8221; Philippians is a book showing us the way to experience Christ. In this verse it tells us that for us to experience Christ, God operates in us both the willing inwardly and working outwardly, that we may live Christ as our life for God&#8217;s good pleasure, as Christ did in His humanity while He was on the earth. God&#8217;s operating in us is to carry out our salvation in our daily life as indicated by the proceeding verse, even in murmurings and reasonings as pointed out in the following verse.<h2 class=head2>27. Operating all Things in the Believers</h2><p>In speaking about spiritual gifts, concerning the distributions of operations, the Apostle Paul says, in 1 Corinthians 12:6, that God operates &#8220;all things in all.&#8221; In God&#8217;s new dispensational work, He also operates all things, especially, according to the context of 1 Corinthians 12:6, the things related to the exercise of the Spirit&#8217;s gifts for the Lord&#8217;s ministries. To carry out His New Testament economy in and through all the believers God operates all things in the believers according to His desire. This is mainly done in the church meetings through the believers&#8217; functions in the exercise of the Spirit&#8217;s gifts for the Lord&#8217;s ministries under God&#8217;s diverse operations. This is the way that God in His divine Trinity works in the believers, according to His New Testament economy, to accomplish His eternal purpose for the expression of Himself in His manifestation.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY</h1><h1 class=title>GOD-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(7)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover several more items of God&#8217;s work in His new dispensation, and then we shall go on to consider God&#8217;s work in eternity future.<h2 class=head2>28. Caring for and Guarding the Believers and Making a Way out of Temptation for Them</h2><p>God cares for the believers and guards them; He also makes a way out of trials for them. Concerning God&#8217;s caring for the believers, 1 Peter 5:7 says, &#8220;Casting all your anxiety on Him, because it matters to Him concerning you.&#8221; The word &#8220;casting&#8221; here means throwing upon, that is, committing to, giving up to. The verb denotes a once-for-all act. The words &#8220;all your anxiety&#8221; indicate that the whole lot of our anxiety throughout our entire life, our whole life with all its anxiety, should be cast on God. We need to learn how to throw the burden of our anxiety upon God. Although the verb &#8220;casting&#8221; indicates a once-for-all act, because we are weak, we may need to cast our anxieties upon God again and again.<p>The reason we may cast all our anxiety on God is that &#8220;it matters to Him&#8221; concerning us. The words &#8220;it matters to Him concerning you&#8221; may also be rendered, &#8220;He cares for you.&#8221; God has a loving concern for the believers, especially the persecuted ones. Because He cares for them faithfully, they can cast their care upon Him, especially in their persecution.<p>In Philippians 4:7 Paul says, &#8220;The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;guard&#8221; here may also be rendered &#8220;mount guard over.&#8221; The God of peace patrols, or stands guard, before our hearts and thoughts in Christ. The heart is the source, and the thoughts are the issue. The peace of God guards both our hearts and our thoughts. This means that in Christ Jesus the peace of God patrols as a guard who goes back and forth before our hearts and thoughts. The peace of God which patrols within our inner being in such a way keeps us calm and tranquil. Even though we may have many troubles and much anxiety, nothing will disturb us. The peace of God infused into us keeps us calm even as it guards us.<p>Jude 24 speaks of God as the One &#8220;who is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before His glory without blemish in exultation.&#8221; Here the writer indicates clearly that although he has charged the believers to endeavor in the things mentioned in verses 20 through 23, yet only God our Savior is able to guard them from stumbling and to set them before His glory without blemish in exultation.<p>First Corinthians 10:13 tells us that God provides a way out of temptation for the believers: &#8220;No temptation has taken you except that which is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not let you be tempted beyond what you are able, but will with the temptation make also the way out, that you may be able to endure it.&#8221; God in His faithfulness will not allow any temptation to befall us beyond what we are able to endure, but will always make a way out for us. Paul&#8217;s word is both a comfort and a correction. We may think that temptations are too strong to be resisted. But Paul says that no temptation has taken us except that which is common to man. He also assures us that God is faithful and will not allow us to be tempted beyond what we are able to bear, but with the temptation will provide a way out so that we may be able to endure it. This is a word of promise and encouragement.<h2 class=head2>29. Encouraging the Believers</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 1:3-4, the Apostle Paul blessed God as the God of all encouragement, who encourages him and his co-workers in all their afflictions, that they may be able to encourage the afflicted ones through the encouragement with which they are encouraged by Him. Further, in 2 Corinthians 7:6, he considered God as the One who encourages those who are cast down, and this God has encouraged him and his co-workers, even by the coming of Titus. Encouragement is slightly different from comfort and consolation, with the sense of cheering. It indicates that God not only comforts and consoles us, but also cheers us, making us happy with His goodness. This is also one of God&#8217;s kind works in us.<h2 class=head2>30. Perfecting, Establishing, Strengthening, and Grounding the Believers</h2><p>First Peter 5:10 says, &#8220;The God of all grace, who called you into His eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you.&#8221; According to what Peter says here, our sufferings are only for a little while, but God&#8217;s glory is eternal. After we have suffered a little while, the God of all grace will personally perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us.<p>The word &#8220;Himself&#8221; in this verse indicates God&#8217;s personal activity in the work of grace. The Greek word rendered &#8220;perfect&#8221; literally means restore. It implies repairing, adjusting, putting in order again, mending, perfectly joining together, thoroughly equipping, well furnishing, and thus, perfecting, completing, educating. In Greek the word &#8220;establish&#8221; literally means to set fast, to confirm. The same word was used by the Lord in His charge to Peter in Luke 22:32. The meaning of &#8220;strengthen&#8221; is very close to that of establish. Literally, the Greek word rendered &#8220;ground&#8221; means to lay a basis for. It is a derivation of the word that means foundation. Hence, it is to ground solidly, as in Matthew 7:25, Ephesians 3:17, and Hebrews 1:10.<p>There is a progress in these four divine acts of grace. Perfecting leads to establishing, establishing to strengthening, and strengthening to grounding in the God of all grace-the Triune God in His dispensing as the solid foundation. First God perfects us. Through the suffering of persecution we are perfected. Then after perfecting us, God establishes us. When we are established, we no longer wander, and we are no longer changeable. After God establishes us, He strengthens us, empowers us, and, eventually, grounds us in Himself as the Triune God.<p>Romans 16:25 tells us that it is according to the gospel and the preaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept in silence in times eternal, that the God who is of power establishes us. This indicates that God&#8217;s establishing of us is a great matter. It is according to the preaching of Christ according to the revelation of the mystery hidden in times eternal.<p>Ephesians 3:16 is another verse that speaks of God&#8217;s strengthening the believers: &#8220;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&#8221;<p>The word &#8220;strengthened&#8221; is modified by four phrases: &#8220;According to the riches of His glory,&#8221; &#8220;with power,&#8221; &#8220;through His Spirit,&#8221; and &#8220;into the inner man.&#8221; First, we are strengthened according to the riches of the Father&#8217;s glory, and then we are strengthened with power, the resurrection power referred to in Ephesians 1:19-20. Furthermore, the Father strengthens us by the indwelling Spirit. This does not mean that the Spirit is not with us, or that the Spirit will come down from the heavens to strengthen us. The strengthening Spirit has been with us since God regenerated us. He is still within us now. Through this indwelling Spirit the Father strengthens us from within. According to verse 16, we are strengthened into the inner man. The inner man is our regenerated spirit with God&#8217;s life as its life. It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), indwelt by the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:11, 16), and mingled with the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 6:17). In order to experience Christ unto all the fullness of God, we need to be strengthened by God into the inner man.<h2 class=head2>31. Disciplining the Believers</h2><p>Referring to the Hebrew believers&#8217; suffering of persecution, Hebrews 12:5-11 considers the persecution as God the Father&#8217;s discipline of the believers who are God&#8217;s genuine sons (v. 7). It says, &#8220;Whom the Lord loves He disciplines and scourges every son whom He receives&#8221; (v. 6), and all the believers as God&#8217;s sons have become partakers of the Father&#8217;s discipline (v. 8). It charges that we as sons of God do not make light of God&#8217;s discipline (v. 5), but rather respect the Father as a discipliner and be much in subjection to Him who is the Father of our spirits, that we may live (v. 9). The Father disciplines us for our profit that we might partake of His holiness (v. 10) which is the very characteristic of His holy nature. This is God our Father&#8217;s finer work in dealing with us as His sons. His work of making us holy is related to the Spirit&#8217;s transformation work (2 Cor. 3:18), which is carried out through the divine dispensing inwardly and the environmental dealings outwardly.<p>Hebrews 12 goes on to tell us that &#8220;indeed all discipline for the present does not seem to be a matter of joy but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it.&#8221; (v. 11). God&#8217;s discipline not only makes us to partake of His holiness but also yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness. Peace is the fruit of righteousness (Isa. 32:17). Holiness refers to the inward nature, whereas righteousness refers to the outward behavior, that is, to make us right outwardly both with God and man, that in such a situation of righteousness, we may enjoy peace as a sweet fruit, a peaceable fruit of righteousness.<h2 class=head2>32. Causing All Things to Work Together for Good to Those Who Love God and Who Are Called according to the Purpose</h2><p>Romans 8:28 says, &#8220;We know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose.&#8221; In Greek the word translated &#8220;all things&#8221; refers to all matters, all persons, and all things. God the Father is sovereign and He arranges everything. He knows what we need. In His sovereignty, He causes all things, all matters, and all persons to work together for good to those who love Him and who have been called by Him to the end that He may fulfill His purpose.<p>God has determined our destiny beforehand, and this destiny cannot be fulfilled without the divine arrangement that causes all things to work together for us. Our destiny is to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). We are not yet fully in the image of the firstborn Son of God, but God the Father is causing all things to work together for good so that His purpose of having many sons conformed to the image of the firstborn Son may be fulfilled.<p>God&#8217;s intention is to bring us into full sonship, so we need to grow. No doubt growth comes from inward nourishment, but this nourishment needs the coordination of the outward environment. Here is the need of God&#8217;s sovereignty to arrange our environment that all things may work together for our good according to His purpose.<h2 class=head2>33. Answering the Believers&#8217; Prayers</h2><p>John 16:23b; Matthew 6:6; Luke 18:7-8; James 5:14-16; Philippians 4:6-7; and Revelation 6:10-11 and 8:3-5, indicate strongly that God answers the believers&#8217; prayers. Answering our prayers involves a lot of doings in God&#8217;s work for our good. Hence it is also an item of God&#8217;s work in His New Testament economy.<h2 class=head2>34. Crushing Satan under the Believers&#8217; Feet</h2><p>Romans 16:20 says, &#8220;The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.&#8221; This promise indicates that God is working to crush our enemy Satan under our feet. Though this is something negative, it is still an item of God&#8217;s work for us in His new dispensation for the accomplishment of His eternal plan that He may have a complete manifestation for His eternal expression.<h2 class=head2>35. Building the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Hebrews 11:10 tells us that God is the Architect and Maker of the holy city, the New Jerusalem (Heb. 12:22a; Rev. 21:2). This indicates that God is the Builder of the New Jerusalem. This building work of God began in perfecting the Old Testament saints, beginning with the patriarchs in the old dispensation. It continues more intensively in producing the matured believers in the new dispensation. Actually the entire Bible is a full record of God&#8217;s work in building the New Jerusalem as His complete manifestation for His full expression in eternity, throughout all the dispensations in the old creation: the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom. The New Jerusalem is a composition of all the perfected saints of the Old Testament and all the matured believers of the New Testament. This is the greatest among the works of God for the accomplishment of His eternal economy, the great part of which is being carried out in the New Testament dispensation.<h2 class=head2>36. Giving Christ the Revelation of the Things to Come concerning the Church, Israel, and the World</h2><p>Revelation 1:1 speaks of the &#8220;revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves what must swiftly take place.&#8221; As a conclusion of the divine revelation in the Holy Scripture, God gave Christ this last revelation concerning the three categories of people in the universe: the church, Israel, and the world. The church is under the heavenly Christ&#8217;s discipline and perfection that it may usher in the kingdom of God and of Christ and be consummated in the New Jerusalem for God&#8217;s expression in eternity. Israel is under God&#8217;s sovereign care that it may also be consummated in the New Jerusalem for God&#8217;s eternal manifestation. The world is absolutely under God&#8217;s judgment that it may be brought to its ultimate destiny- the eternal perdition in the lake of fire.<h2 class=head2>37. Bringing Many Believers into Glory</h2><p>Hebrews 2:10 says that God is &#8220;leading many sons into glory.&#8221; These many sons are the many brothers in Romans 8:29 and the many grains in John 12:24. The last step of God&#8217;s great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory, into the expression of God. Romans 8:29-30 tell us that God&#8217;s work of grace upon us began with His foreknowing, continued through His predestination, calling, and justification, and it will end with His glorification. This will be accomplished by the Lord&#8217;s coming back (Phil. 3:21), at which time we shall appear with Him in glory (Col. 3:4). This glorification of the sons of God, as the goal of God&#8217;s salvation, will be manifested in fullness in the New Jerusalem for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23).<p>In His prayer to the Father the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;The glory which You have given Me I have given to them&#8221; (John 17:22). The glory into which God is leading us is the glory which He has already given us. Although glory has been given to us already, we still need to enter into it.<p>We have been called into glory and this glory was designed according to God&#8217;s wisdom in eternity past (1 Thes. 2:12; 1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Cor. 2:7). When Christ appears, we shall appear with Him in His glory (Col. 3:4). The glory in which we shall appear with Christ is not merely some objective shining or brightness; it is the subjective radiation of the divine life from within us, like the blossom of certain flowers.<p>Through regeneration the life of glory has come into us, and now we have a seed of glory within us. The life that we have within us as a seed is the life of glory. This is Christ in us, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). Eventually this seed will blossom, and thereby we shall be brought into glory. It will be like the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus (Matt. 17:1-2). When the Lord was transfigured on the mountaintop, it was not that the shekinah glory suddenly came upon Him from the heavens; it was that the divine glory shone from within Him. Likewise, the glory into which we shall be brought is the out-shining of the very glory that is within us right now.<h2 class=head2>38. Sending the Appointed Christ to His Chosen People at the Times of Restoration</h2><p>At the times of restoration God will send the appointed Christ to His chosen people, to Israel. Concerning this Acts 3:20 and 21 say, &#8220;He may send Him who has been appointed for you, Christ Jesus, whom heaven must indeed receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old.&#8221; The times of restoration of all things are the times of restoration in the millennium, as prophesied in Isaiah 11:1-10 and 65:18-25 and referred to by Christ in Matthew 17:11 and 19:28. The times of restoration of all things will be brought in by Christ&#8217;s coming back, when God sends Him to Israel in order to restore His chosen people.<h2 class=head2>39. Returning to Rebuild the Fallen Tabernacle of David- to Restore the Nation of Israel</h2><p>Acts 15:16 says, &#8220;After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen; and I will rebuild its ruins, and I will erect it again.&#8221; The tabernacle of David is the kingdom of Israel and to rebuild the tabernacle of David is to restore the nation of Israel (Acts 1:6). In the Old Testament the Lord promised the Jewish people that the Messiah, the anointed One, would come to inherit the throne of David and restore the Jewish nation, the nation of Israel (Gen. 49:10; 2 Sam. 7:13, 16; Psa. 2:8-9; 72:1-20; 89:4; 110:2-3; Isa. 9:6-7; 11:1-5, 10; Jer. 23:5-6; 30:9; 33:14-17; Ezek. 21:27; 34:23-24; 37:24, 28; Dan. 2:35, 44; 7:14; Hosea 3:5; Amos 9:11-12; Zech. 3:8; 6:12-13; 9:9-10). When the Lord Jesus came the first time, the Jewish people were expecting the Messiah to restore His kingdom (Luke 2:25; 3:15; 7:19; John 1:41; 7:27, 41). However, it will not be until the Lord&#8217;s second coming that He will restore the Messianic kingdom (Matt. 23:39). The kingdom which the Messiah will restore-the kingdom of the Messiah or the kingdom of Israel to be restored in the future-will be the earthly part of the millennium, the tabernacle of David which God will rebuild, and which will be the kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41; Rev. 11:15). Then Christ as the Son of Man, David&#8217;s royal descendant, will sit on the throne of David and reign as the King over the house of Jacob, the Jewish people (Luke 1:32-33), ruling over the nations on the earth during the millennium (Psa. 2:8; 72:8; Dan. 7:14; 2:35, 44).<h2 class=head2>40. Setting Up His Kingdom in the Millennium</h2><p>God will set up His kingdom in the millennium. Matthew 13:43 refers to this: &#8220;Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&#8221; The kingdom of the Father is the heavenly part of the millennium, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers. The &#8220;righteous&#8221; in this verse are the overcomers, who will be the light shining in the kingdom of their Father. In the heavenly part of the millennium, which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of the Father, the overcoming saints will reign with Christ as co-kings.<p>Revelation 20:6 indicates that the overcomers &#8220;shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years.&#8221; This thousand-year reign refers to the kingdom of the Father, which God will set up in the millennium. In this part of the millennium Christ and the overcomers will reign for the Father&#8217;s expression and satisfaction.<h2 class=head2>41. Putting All the Enemies under the Feet of Christ at the End of the Millennium</h2><p>At the end of the millennium God will put all the enemies under the feet of Christ. First Corinthians 15:25 says, &#8220;For He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.&#8221; The longer Christ reigns, the more enemies are put under His feet. Eventually, at the end of the millennium, the last age of the old creation, every enemy will have been put under the feet of Christ. The word &#8220;until&#8221; indicates this and points to the end of the thousand years. That will be the time when God has put every enemy under Christ&#8217;s feet.<h2 class=head2>42. Abolishing the Last Enemy, Death</h2><p>The last aspect of God&#8217;s work in the new dispensation will be the abolishing of the last enemy, death. First Corinthians 15:26 says, &#8220;The last enemy that is being abolished is death.&#8221; Immediately after the fall of man, God began His work to abolish sin and death. This work has been progressing through the Old and New Testament ages and is still in process today. When sin is done away with at the end of the old creation and when its source, Satan, is cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10), death will be abolished. It also will be cast into the lake of fire with Hades, its power, after the last and final judgment at the white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). The lake of fire is the &#8220;trash can&#8221; for the entire universe, into which all negative things, including death and Hades (Rev. 20:14), will be cast. Death will be the last enemy destroyed by God.<p>All that God has done and all that He will do is for the purpose of dispensing Himself into His chosen people. God is working to remove all the obstacles and to prepare the way to dispense Himself into all of His chosen people to accomplish His eternal economy. It is not sufficient for us merely to know about this-we need to see it. If we see what God is doing and the purpose for it, then we shall know where we need to be-continually under His dispensing. Therefore, let us remain in God&#8217;s presence so that He may have the opportunity to infuse into us all He is and all He has. This is our burden in these messages.<h2 class=head1>D. IN ETERNITY FUTURE</h2><h2 class=head2>1. As the Redeeming God Administrating within the New Jerusalem in the New Heaven and the New Earth</h2><p>In eternity future, after the millennium, God as the redeeming God will administrate within the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth. Revelation 22:1 speaks of the throne of God and of the Lamb. The one throne for both God and the Lamb signifies that God and the Lamb are one-the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer. In eternity the very God who sits on the throne will be our redeeming God, from whose throne proceeds the river of water of life for our supply and satisfaction. This depicts how the Triune God-God, the Lamb, and the Spirit (symbolized by the water of life)-dispenses Himself into His redeemed people under His headship (implied in the authority of the throne) for eternity. Therefore, in Revelation 22:1 is the redeeming God administrating within the New Jerusalem. This administrating will be for the carrying out in full of God&#8217;s dispensing.<p>Both God and the Lamb are sitting on the throne. They are not sitting side by side. Rather, God is in the Lamb. God is the light and the Lamb is the lamp (Rev. 21:23). The glory of the light and the lamp are not side by side. The light is in the lamp. The Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light. This indicates that God is in the Lamb sitting on the throne. They two are actually one, just as the light and the lamp are one unit, one entity. God in the Lamb is the redeeming God. For eternity in the New Jerusalem we shall see the redeeming God, God in the Lamb.<p>The river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. For the water of life to flow out of the throne means that it flows out of God Himself. In the New Jerusalem, we have God in the Lamb, and out of the redeeming God flows the river of life, the life-giving Spirit. This is the dispensing of the Triune God. Before God could dispense Himself into us, He had to redeem us. Thus, the picture in Revelation 22 reveals that the redeeming God is the life-dispensing God. The Lamb signifies redemption, and the river of life signifies the dispensing of life. For eternity, our God will be the redeeming and life-dispensing God. In the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth, our God will be in the redeeming Lamb, flowing out as the river of life (the life-giving Spirit) to dispense His life into every part of the city.<p>The tree of life grows in the river of life, and the river of life that flows out of the throne reaches every part of the city. This indicates that the flow of the Triune God waters the whole city. Every part of the city receives the life supply because the tree of life grows in the river and the river reaches every part of the city. The tree of life, as a vine, grows on both sides of the river, following the flow of the river. Wherever the river flows, the tree of life grows. The supply of life is in the flow of life. This is a picture of God&#8217;s dispensing. Christ as the tree of life is the life supply available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ is found. The entire city of New Jerusalem, which will be constituted of all the redeemed people of God, will be watered by the river of the water of life and nourished by the tree of life. This is the dispensing of the Triune God in full for eternity.<p>In these messages we have considered the many aspects of God&#8217;s work in eternity past, in the old dispensation, and in the new dispensation. Eventually, God will put all the enemies under the feet of Christ, and He will abolish death, the last enemy. Then everything will be new. There will be the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center. For eternity the redeeming God will sit on the throne in the center of the New Jerusalem, and out of the throne, that is, out of God Himself, will flow the water of life to saturate the city. Furthermore, the tree of life will grow in the water of life to nourish the city. This saturating and nourishing is the divine dispensing in full. We shall be there eating of the tree of life and drinking of the water of life. For eternity, we shall be eating, drinking, and worshipping God. This is the eternal enjoyment of God&#8217;s dispensing. While we are enjoying the dispensing of the Triune God by eating and drinking, we shall worship Him.<h2 class=head2>2. Expressing Himself-the Triune God- through the New Jerusalem in the New Heaven and the New Earth</h2><p>To express Himself through the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth will also be God&#8217;s work in eternity future. Revelation 21:11 says that the New Jerusalem has the glory of God. This indicates that the New Jerusalem bears the expression of God. The Triune God expresses Himself through the New Jerusalem in the triune way: in the tree of life, in the river of life, and in the light of life. This triune expression of the processed God is His full expression in His eternal manifestation according to His eternal economy for His divine dispensing.</body></html>
