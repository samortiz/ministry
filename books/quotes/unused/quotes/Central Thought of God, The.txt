The central thought of God in this universe and in eternity is to have Christ as His expression through the church
If you apply this thought and realization to all the Scriptures you read, the Scriptures will be opened to you
If you do not understand this mystery, you do not know the meaning of the universe and the meaning of your human life
If we want to understand the thought, the meaning, of any book, we have to realize what it speaks of at the beginning and at the conclusion
At the end of this divine book are the last two chapters, chapters twenty-one and twenty-two of the book of Revelation
We need to see Christ as the expression of God and the church as the Body of Christ in the first chapter of the Bible
Genesis 1 reveals Christ as the expression of God and us as the members of the Lord's Body, which is the church
God brought the land out of the waters of death and caused the land to produce all kinds of life-the grass, the herbs, the trees, and so on
At the beginning of Genesis 1 are the Spirit of God and the light, and at the end is man with the image and authority of God
After all these dividings, the land emerged to produce different kinds of life and to become a place to live for the living creatures
On the fourth day there were the bigger and more solid lights, the embodied lights; so after this there was more life
Scientists spend much time studying the universe, and others try to study the first chapters of the Bible with scientific knowledge
Similarly, the apostle John told us that, besides those things that were recorded in his Gospel, the Lord Jesus did many other things
God created the whole universe with myriads of things, yet He gave us a record of only two chapters concerning His creation
In Revelation the messengers of the churches the spiritual ones who bear the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus are the shining stars
The church is typified by the moon in Genesis 1 , and Christ is typified by the sun, the greatest light bearer
Many times oppressions, trials, and temptations come to us, but we can declare to them, 'All of these things are under my feet
Following this, we have the more abundant life, a life that can work for God, that can do the will of God, that can move on this earth
At Calvary, on the day of the Lord's crucifixion, the cross was in the middle dividing the saved one from the perishing one
God's bringing the people of Israel into this land is a type of His saving us from the world and bringing us into Christ
Isaiah 11:1 says that 'a twig will come forth from the stem of Jesse,/And a branch from his roots will bear fruit'
Christ is the Sun of righteousness with the church, His Body, as the moon reflecting His light and all His members as stars
In Leviticus we are told that sometimes the burnt offerings had to be offered with turtledoves or young pigeons , which are types of Christ
When Christ was crucified on the cross, He was in the form of the serpent but was without the serpent's poison
The central thought of God is that Christ will be the expression of God through His church, shining all the time in life
Song of Songs 1:14 mentions the henna flower, an Old-World plant with which Jewish girls beautified themselves
God is still working today in the New Testament age because there is the lack of such a life that is full of His image and His authority
On the fourth day is Christ as the sun with the moon, including all the stars as a corporate, collective reflector of Christ
On the fifth day is the stronger life for the expression of Christ, and on the sixth day is an even stronger aspect of Christ as life
Because Adam was created according to Christ and is a copy of Christ, we may say that he was the duplication and multiplication of Christ
Christ was the only begotten Son of God from eternity, and in resurrection He became the Firstborn among many brothers
The central thought of God is to have such a man with the appearance, the form, the life, and everything of Christ
The human race is a figure because it just has the form, the appearance, of Christ, not the life, the substance, and nature of Christ
Today we as the church have not only the appearance, the form, of Christ but also the life, the nature, and the substance of Christ
What God created was not just an individual man but a collective man, a corporate man, a man including millions of sons and daughters
The church as the real man not only has the form, the appearance, of Christ but also the life, the nature, and the substance of Christ
Since the fall, man has had a wrong concept of always wanting to do something for God, to work for God, but we have to give up this thought
Rather, the central thought of God with us is that He can make us a part of Christ and that He can work Christ into us
We are in the hand of God to be worked on by God that we may be the expression, the image, of Christ both in form and in reality
God's central thought is to have Christ as everything to us so that we, as the Body of Christ, can be the expression, the image, of Christ
There are a lot of activities, a great deal of work, and different kinds of movements, but there is only a small measure of Christ
Before this subduing there must have been something in this universe and on this earth that was against God and needed to be subdued
Up to that point, man had the form and the appearance of God but not the life and nature, the substance, of God
Adam was made as the highest life among the created lives, but he did not have the divine life at the time of creation
Without the divine life being accepted received realized and experienced by man man can never be the expression and representative of God
After man's creation, the first thing, the primary thing, for man to pay attention to is to receive God as his life
We should not be the doing or working Christians but the receiving Christians, the eating Christians, and the drinking Christians
After Adam was created, God did not say, 'Adam, you have to be patient, be humble, love others, and make sure that you love your wife'
Neither did God tell Eve, 'Eve, you have to be clear that as a wife, you have to be submissive to your husband'
In the Gospel of John, the Lord told us to believe into Him , to love Him , to abide in Him , to eat Him , and to drink Him
As long as we experience and enjoy Christ by feeding on Him, receiving Him, and drinking of Him, we will be a satisfaction and a rest to God
Our spiritual hunger is a sign that we need more of God, that we have to receive God once more as our life supply
He was short of the divine life within, and second, he was short of a wife, a counterpart, to match him without
The ultimate issue, the outcome, of this experience is that we will be built up together as a corporate bride to match Christ
The more we enjoy, experience, and realize Christ, the more we will be built up together as a corporate bride to Christ
Our nature was earthen, but after we receive Christ as life, we have Him as a precious and excellent treasure within us
Corinthians 4:6-7 shows that when God shines in our hearts, Christ as the treasure comes into us, the earthen vessels
Today if we receive Christ as our life, there will be a flow of the living water within us, and in this flow there is the nature of gold
In the flow of the river there were also bdellium , something that is bright, and onyx stone, which is precious
The Lord continues to transform us from the human form to the divine form, from clay to something as precious as gold, pearl, and onyx stone
After regeneration we have to be transformed from the natural form into the glorious form, the form of the divine life
You may say that you have seen some light about a certain truth or about certain gifts, but we need to see what God's desire is
In Revelation 21 in the last item of the Scriptures, the holy city, the New Jerusalem, there are gold, pearl, and precious stones
All the entrances, the twelve gates, are pearls , and the stones for the building up of the wall are precious stones
After we have been built up together with others in the very flow of the divine life, we will be a part of the counterpart of Christ
By the help of the New Testament, we can realize that the man created by God is a type, a figure, pointing to the real man, who is Christ
We were made as parts of the first Adam, and now we have been regenerated as parts of the last Adam to be the expression of God in Christ
God also created a bride, a wife, to match man, to be the helpmate to man, the counterpart of man, and this counterpart was his increase
One half is the husband and the other half is the wife, and when you put the two halves together, you have the whole person
As a man, you need a wife to match you to be your counterpart, to make you whole, to make you complete, and to be your increase
God took a part, a rib, out of Adam, and God built that rib, that piece of bone, into a woman, the increase of Adam to be his wife
Adam, by his wisdom, gave every creature a name, but he did not see anything that was good enough to match him
It is as if God brought all these things to His Son, Christ, and Christ said, 'There is none good enough to match Me
The bone taken out of Adam signifies the resurrection life of Christ, a life that can stand any kind of opposition or attack
His flesh which typifies the human nature was broken but His bone which typifies the divine life the resurrection life could never be broken
The church is something produced out of the resurrection life, the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life of Christ
The church is something out of Christ, a part of Christ, the increase of Christ, the counterpart of Christ, the one who can match Christ
No foreign, inorganic element can be put into our physical body or it will damage our body, yet this is what many have done to the church
None of us has the right to bring something which is not Christ or which is less than Christ into the Body of Christ
We need to bring Christ as the life supply, the food, to feed the members of the Body for the growth, the building up, of the Body
We have to see that all the things in the old creation created by God are not the real things but are figures and types of Christ
There are two creations: the first creation, which is the old creation, and the second creation, which is the new creation
The whole old creation is a form, an empty vessel, to contain Christ, with man as the center and as the leader
Genesis 1 shows that God created the whole universe as an empty vessel in form, in image, in appearance, without anything as the content
In Genesis 2 we are told that man as the leader, the center, and the head of the old creation was made in a way to receive something else
After the creation of man as the center, this center with a mouth was put in front of the tree of life, which was edible
God created the heavens and the earth, with the vegetable life, the animal life, and thousands of things as an environment
Man is an empty vessel, an empty container, with an opening to receive the Triune God, who is symbolized by the tree of life
When you receive Christ as your life, there is something within you flowing all the time as a stream of living water
They are very active and very positive because there is another life within them that is living, moving, acting, and energizing
When we are regenerated, we have something within us that is living, acting, moving, and energizing as an inner flow
The more you quarrel, the more you reason with others, the more your inner conscience tells you that the current within you is stopped
You may give up your reasoning, but you have the living flow, the current, the fellowship, the communion, the stream, of the life of God
The city itself is gold, the entrances of the city are pearls, and the wall with its foundations is precious stones
The man in the first creation is a man of dust, but the man in the second creation is a man of gold, of pearls, and of precious stones
After regeneration, gradually we have to be transformed, and finally our vile body will be changed, transfigured, into a glorious body
We are regenerated in the spirit; second, we are being transformed in the soul; and lastly, we will be transfigured in our body
After we have been regenerated, we have the life of God and the divine nature of God, which is signified by gold
He was wounded by us a piece of sand and He secretes His life over us to make us precious pearls for the building of Gods eternal expression
A piece of coal becomes a diamond, a precious stone, through a tremendous amount of heat and pressure over a long period of time
The Holy Spirit always tries His best, if we are available, to put us under a certain pressure and burning for our transformation
Before God put Himself into this vessel, Satan, the enemy of God, came in as the serpent to damage, to poison, the vessel
He knew that man is the center of the vessel of the old creation, so he came in to inject his poison into the center of this vessel
When the Lord was on this earth He scolded people by calling them offspring of vipers and brood of vipers that is children of the serpent
It can reign as king ; it can rule over you, control you, and lord it over you ; and it can become your master and make you a slave
The body was changed in nature because something of Satan was injected into it, causing it to be mixed with Satan
We are clearly told in the Scriptures that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was born through a virgin ; His birth was not of a human father
He is the real seed of woman who dealt with the serpent by bruising his head, that is, by putting him to death
Due to Satan's subtlety today, many people, even in Christianity, do not recognize that the Lord Jesus was born of a virgin
One day the Lord came as the seed of the woman to bruise the head of the serpent, that is, to put Satan to death
In John 3:14 the Lord told us that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up
Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness in order to deliver the people of Israel from the poison of the serpents
At that very time, the people of Israel in the eyes of God were just like serpents because they had been poisoned by the serpents
When God provided a deliverance, that is, a deliverer, that deliverer was lifted up in the form of a serpent to be their substitute
The One who was lifted up was only in the form of the serpent, without the nature, the life, and the poison of the serpent
When fallen man, fallen humanity, was dealt with on the cross by the death of the Lord, Satan was also dealt with
He told us that Satan thought that it was fortuitous for him to gain man to possess man and to put himself into man as a resident within him
Brother Nee said that, on the contrary, this was a pity to Satan because having come into man, he became located
On the day that the Lord took the human nature to the cross, He simply put Satan, who was within the human nature, on the cross
When He has adequate Christian executioners to cooperate with Him then He will come to bind the serpent and cast him into the bottomless pit
When you come to the Word you come to the dining table and when you contact the Spirit you contact the plate and the food is on the plate
We have to be built up together as the Body to have a church life and be the living members functioning in the Body
The man created by God was pure, but after the fall, man was injected with Satan, so man became sinful and was constituted a sinner
All things of the proper human life are of God, but all these proper things have been utilized by the enemy as systems to systematize people
Many worldly people do not have the freedom, the liberty, to serve the Lord simply because they have been systematized by their clothing
To dress ourselves is not something of the world, but to be systematized by dressing is absolutely something of the world
We see that with Satan sin came in, death came in, sinners were constituted, and a world was formed, organized, and systematized
Galatians 2:20a says that we have been crucified with Him, and Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ
According to Colossians 2:15, the kingdom of darkness with the rulers and authorities was stripped off by Christ on the cross
Let us now see something of Christ and the church in a very brief way from the sixty-six books of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation
With Jacob it is not a matter of an individual person but a matter of a house-the house of Jacob, the house of Israel
The heavenly ladder is Christ, and the house of God made with the stone upon which oil was poured is the church
Originally and naturally, we were not pillars of stone but pieces of clay-at most, pillars of salt, as Lot's wife became a pillar of salt
When you realize Christ as such a One, you will sense that there is a great change, a regeneration, even a transformation within you
Immediately after this, God not only commanded but demanded that they set up a tabernacle as His dwelling place among them
Today we have Christ and we are the church, not by natural goodness or other natural matters, but by the Christ who is experienced by us
The lamb will become the tabernacle, Christ will become the church, but He must be experienced and enjoyed by you
You have the Passover lamb, and then you will have the tabernacle in the wilderness built up as a dwelling place for God
The entire history of the children of Israel in the Old Testament is a history of the tabernacle and of the temple
A number of years ago, some young people in the Far East claimed that they saw the revelation concerning Christ and the fullness of Christ
They said there was no need to talk about the church because as long as we have Christ, everything is all right
The New Jerusalem is nothing other than the ultimate consummation of the divine work throughout the generations
As we have said many times, the church is absolutely something of Christ, and strictly speaking, the church is something as Christ
We have seen that the church is the increase of Christ, something that comes out of Christ to be increased as a bride to match Him
Because in Paul's days many things other than Christ had come into the church, the church was greatly damaged, spoiled, and dismembered
If today an ass spoke in English, the whole city would be excited, and the newspapers would greatly publicize it
The gifts should be a help that brings people to the Giver, but today people are content with the gifts, and they forget about the Giver
Today, however, many people are satisfied with the gifts, and they have no heart and even no desire to seek the Giver
When the Holy Spirit comes to us, He often comes with some gifts, but all these gifts are reminders of Christ, the Giver
By this you can see the difference between the gifts and the Giver, between the many things other than Christ and Christ Himself
While they were listening, Brother Nee was really happy and said within himself, 'O Miss Barber, this time you have to be convinced
Something from Christ, something out of Christ, even something as Christ must be ministered through you to others
We have to realize, however, that any gift that is separated from Christ and remains merely a gift is dangerous
Once a gift is separated from Christ, you may do many things, but this gift will be a damage to the building up of the Body
The more they work, the more they do, the more they preach, and the more they teach, the more they damage the building of the church
They have a so-called spirituality which is not Christ Himself; they do not have the real spirituality which is Christ Himself
If you claim that you have seen the heavenly vision, it simply means that what you have seen is an earthly vision
You will long to have the church life, you will be desirous to be built up together with others, and you will love others
If any one among us still considers himself or herself as someone special, this is a damage to the building up of the Body
Do not pay much attention to the so-called gifts, to mere teachings and knowledge, or to so-called spirituality
We may not talk about our 'spiritual' experiences, but we simply contact the living Lord day by day and live by Him
The apostle Paul told the Galatians that it was Gods pleasure to reveal His Son in him and he told them that Christ would be formed in them
From that time on he could discern the difference between the law and Christ, and he gave up the law and kept Christ
He told the Galatians that today with us, the Christians, it is not a matter of keeping the law but a matter of living by Christ
Strictly speaking, no one is teaching the law today, but you have to realize that many times you yourself are like a teacher of the law
In the Epistle to the Hebrews there is a big difference between Christ and all the good things of the genuine, fundamental religion
In that religion there were the angels, the apostles such as Moses and Joshua, and the priests, including the high priest
All the good, sound, fundamental, and genuine things of religion were there, yet all these are not Christ Himself
The apostle Paul told us that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ and that Christ is all and in all
You may exercise different kinds of gifts and even 'play' with the gifts as little children play with their toys, yet you may not have love
The apostle was telling the Corinthians that they needed to know Christ, to grow up, and to exercise their gifts in love
These four books-Galatians, Hebrews, Colossians, and 1 Corinthians-were written to deal with all the different things that are not Christ
The entire Scriptures with sixty-six books is centered on Christ as the expression of God through the church as His corporate Body
In the Old Testament the history of the people of Israel was simply a history of the tabernacle and the temple
In the wilderness, there were about six hundred thousand men between the ages of twenty and fifty who could go to war to fight for God
If each one of them had a wife this number would have been doubled and if each couple had children their number would have more than tripled
All we should do is handle the tabernacle, which is a type of the increase of Christ, that is, Christ with the church
Later, after the children of Israel entered into Canaan, they commenced the second part of their history, the history of the temple
In John 2:18-21 the Lord Himself told us that His body was the temple of God which the Jewish people were going to destroy
The Lord's body in the flesh was put to death on the cross, but a mysterious Body was raised up through the resurrection of Christ
The New Testament reveals to us a great, mysterious, and universal man, with Jesus Christ as the Head and all the believers as the Body
The Gospels, the first four books of the New Testament, reveal to us Christ as the Head; then the Acts reveals the Body
When Saul who strongly opposed the church was on his way to Damascus the Lord met him and said to him Saul Saul why are you persecuting Me
To his great surprise a voice from heaven told him that He was the One whom Paul was persecuting and that His name was Jesus
To experience Christ, to feed on Christ, to live by Christ, and to express Christ in a corporate way is the proper and central line
Since the Corinthian believers appreciated the gifts, they also appreciated and highly valued the gifted persons
In verse 29 we are told that we need to discern the Body and that we eat and drink judgment to ourselves if we do not discern the Body
When we participate in the Lord's table, we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the one Body of Christ
We may illustrate transformation with an ugly caterpillar, which after a period of time becomes a beautiful butterfly
Today on the one hand, we are a caterpillar, but praise the Lord, on the other hand, we are becoming a butterfly
Many Christians have been spoiled in the process of their transformation and in their growth of life by the gifts
It speaks of the experience of the cross through suffering upon suffering, death upon death, and consuming upon consuming
If we look at the situation of the church today, we have to admit that troubles in the church are often due to having too many gifts
The more gifts the Lord's people have, the more troubles, the more divisions, and the more opinions the church will have
For this reason, in 2 Corinthians the experienced apostle forgot about the gifts and gave up all the matters related to the gifts
We need to learn not to get rid of the thorn but to suffer under the thorn in order to know and experience the sufficient grace
There is only one thing that can build up the church, and that is Christ Himself experienced by us as everything
If we are still childish, if we remain as little children, we will be tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching
Whether you believe in pre-tribulation, post-tribulation, or partial rapture does not matter for your salvation
Today some people insist on foot-washing, some insist on head covering, and some insist on greeting one another with a holy kiss
We will be the habitation, the dwelling place, of God for His satisfaction and rest, and we will be the bride, the counterpart, of Christ
While the Lord is tarrying while He delays His coming back we know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God the church of the living God
On the one hand, the church is the house of God, the dwelling place of God, the place for His rest and satisfaction
On the other hand, the church is the pillar, the supporting power, and the base, the foundation, of the reality, which is God Himself
It deals with the difference between the all-inclusive, living Christ and a genuine, sound, fundamental, yet dead religion
What we need is not a religion in knowledge, teaching, or letters, but a living person, that is, the living Son of the living God
Every local church is a lampstand, a testimony, a local expression of the Body to express Christ in a corporate way
In the book of Revelation we have the seven local lampstands at the beginning and the unique, universal lampstand at the end
The holy city is of pure gold, and the throne of God in Christ is at the peak of that city, just as a lamp is on the top of a lampstand
In these verses we are told clearly that in the new creation the new universe there will be a bride and this bride is the wife of the Lamb
The New Jerusalem is the bride, the wife, the counterpart, of the Lamb, who is the Son of God, the Lord Christ
At the beginning of the coming age the New Jerusalem will be the bride, but after that, the New Jerusalem will be the wife of the Lamb
The New Jerusalem is something new, and it is something holy, something separated from all other things unto God to match God
Verse 13 says, 'On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates'
There are three gates on each of the four sides, comprising the number twelve, which is composed of three times four
Verse 14 says, 'And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb'
He measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal'
The length is twelve thousand stadia, the width is twelve thousand stadia, and the height is twelve thousand stadia
Creation extends in four directions, and the four sides of the New Jerusalem are toward the four directions of the whole universe
Verse 17 says, 'And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel'
Man is the center of the living things on this earth and the angels are the center of all the things created by God in the heavens
As far as time is concerned, the New Jerusalem is a combination; as far as space is concerned, the New Jerusalem is a mingling
The young people who are believers in Christ have God within them as the divine nature, the new nature, signified by the gold
They have the gold the divine nature of God within them by regeneration because when we are regenerated we receive God as the golden nature
After regeneration we need to be built up by transformation to have something of the appearance of God shining as jasper
The twelve layers of precious stones as the foundation in their respective colors have the appearance of a rainbow
The rainbow is a sign of God being the God of covenant, the God of faithfulness, who is faithful to keep the everlasting covenant
The New Jerusalem is a city which has the foundations , and the foundations are the faithfulness of God, the everlasting covenant of God
The foundation of this city is like a rainbow which reminds us and God that we are safe, that we have eternal security
The city in which we will dwell is a city with a rainbow as the foundation to remind God that it is not lawful for Him to destroy it
Revelation 21:21 says, 'And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl
Paul told us that we should build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones , and silver signifies the same thing as pearls
In Genesis 2 there are three items, in Revelation 21 there are three items, and in 1 Corinthians 3 there are also three items
Verses 24-27 speak of the nations, saying, 'And the nations will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it
That the throne is in the center of the city means that the throne must be on the top of the center of the city
Regardless of which of the twelve gates you enter, if you proceed on the street, you eventually will reach the throne of God
Students of the Bible realize that the last two chapters of Revelation are the conclusion of the entire Scriptures
As the ultimate conclusion of the entire divine writings, the New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the divine thought
In this record we are told that God at the very center of the city is the light, and the shining of the light is the glory of God
God, who is the light and who is constantly shining, is in the lamp, who is the redeeming Christ, the redeeming Lamb
The New Jerusalem is a living, corporate vessel as a container to contain God in Christ and to express God through Christ
In this picture of the New Jerusalem, God is the light in the lamp, which is Christ, shining Himself forth in Christ and through Christ
Because this corporate vessel is transparent in every respect and in every part, it is easy for it to shine forth what it contains
The old creation as an empty vessel has no content of God, but the new creation as a corporate vessel is filled with God as its content
Because it is no longer empty but filled with God, it has been transformed from its old shape, form, and nature into a new one
From that time on, due to the filling of the Lord, a change has taken place in you and is still taking place all the time
Throughout all the Scriptures, the enemy has always tried to discover God's plan and do something before God does
The descendants of Noah were very much used by the enemy to build up another city, the city of Babel with the tower of Babel
Do not do anything to help Pharaoh to build up his two cities as a container to contain Satan and all his corruption
That was the building of the tabernacle with the priesthood, full of precious stones and gold, as God's dwelling place
There is a contrast between the building of the cities in Egypt and the building of the tabernacle in the wilderness
In Matthew 21:42 the Lord Jesus, quoting from Psalm 118:22-23, indicated to the Jews that He is the cornerstone for God's building
In the next verse he tells us that he was a wise master builder, the head of a group of workers to build the house of God
In 4:12 he speaks of the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ
Do not forget that in addition to the New Jerusalem there is the city which is called 'Mystery, Babylon the Great'
In the last book of the Scriptures Babylon is mentioned again, this time as something against the New Jerusalem
One is the container of Satan to contain Satan with all his corruption, confusion, complications, and divisions
In, among, and with the human race as the material, Satan is building up a mysterious city as a container to contain him and express him
What God is doing today is, on the one hand, to build up His holy city and, on the other hand, to destroy the great Babylon of mystery
After the destruction of this great, sinful, satanic city, the time will come for the New Jerusalem, the holy city, to be manifested
From now on you should never believe that in this universe God is building a material place with material things
After such a long time the Lord still has not finished the building, so imagine how wonderful that mansion will be'!
In certain places some friends asked me, 'Brother Lee, would you please tell us where we Christians will be after we die'?
He is seeking after a living habitation that is composed of, built up together with, all the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed ones
In the same way, how can a physical mansion without a heart, a mind, a thought, and a desire be the counterpart to match the living Christ?
The Lord is going to marry not a physical mansion but His redeemed ones, who are composed together as His bride, His wife
The apostle John tells us that all the people given by God the Father to the Lord, the Son, are the bride as the increase of the Lord
These portions of the Word show us clearly that the bride of Christ is not a physical house but a living composition of the redeemed ones
We are told in the Scriptures that we are the household and the house of God , and we are the living temple of God
Eventually, when we come to the ultimate conclusion of the entire Scriptures, we have a picture of the tabernacle and the temple
It is a sign of a living community, either of Satan to contain Satan or of the living Body of Christ to contain God
Today, the human community as a corporate vessel contains Satan with all his sinful aspects, and Satan is expressed through it
Human civilization, the human community, is a satanic dwelling place, a resting place for Satan to have his satisfaction and rest
God's intention was to make Abraham a house and a kingdom with a people as the materials for God's divine building
God chose a people as a new race to be another people, the heavenly people, to build up another city, that is, Jerusalem
The history of the Old Testament is a history of the fighting and struggling between these two cities, Babylon and Jerusalem
Rather, Babylon is a sign, signifying people as a human community used by Satan as a corporate vessel to contain and express him
It signifies all the chosen, redeemed people of God as materials built up together as a corporate vessel to contain God and express God
In the whole universe, with the human race, there are two communities, the satanic community and the divine community
Our only hope was to go to the heavenly mansion, but according to your teaching and interpretation, our heavenly mansion is gone'
In order to see the vision of Babylon, there is no need to go to a high mountain; it is sufficient to be in the wilderness
If you remain in the wilderness, you can see only Babylon and can never see the New Jerusalem, the heavenly city
If you want to see the heavenly city, you have to be delivered from the wilderness to the height of the heavenly places
With passages such as Revelation 21 and 22, we must be very much before the Lord, looking to Him for the proper understanding
If all the lights in a major city were to go out, the whole city would be in darkness, and there would be robbery, looting, and killing
When the lights come back on, however, there is the ruling and governing, and the entire city is restored to good order
Without Him as the redeeming One, we can never come to touch, to contact, God as light since we are so sinful and so much in darkness
God is in Christ, Christ is the expression of God, and God in Christ is on the throne at the center of the New Jerusalem
God as light is in Christ as the redeeming One, and the throne of God in Christ is the exercise of His authority
If we have God as light in the redeeming Christ to exercise His authority among us today in the church, then we have everything
All the aspects of the church and all the riches of the church come out of God as light in the redeeming Christ exercising His authority
What we need today is to acknowledge the redemption of Christ, be under the light of God, and be in subjection to the authority of God
Sinners need to repent because the kingdom has come; this means that the authority of God, the divine heavenly ruling, has come
We have to receive the redemption of Christ that we may be in the light of God, and then we will be under the authority of God
When we realize the authority of God by the light of God in the redemption of Christ, we will have the riches of Christ
According to the divine thought in all the Scriptures, God always sees His redeemed ones as His wife and He Himself as the Husband
Hosea 2:16 says, 'And in that day, declares Jehovah, / You will call Me My Husband / And will no longer call Me Baali '
In the book of Revelation, John tells us clearly who and what the bride of Christ is; the bride is the New Jerusalem
We have to admit that this city, the New Jerusalem, is the very bride whom the apostle John mentions in his Gospel, in John 3:29
Not only so, the apostle Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 11:2 that he betrothed us, the believers, as pure virgins to one Husband, Christ
Christ does not have sisters but brothers; He is the Firstborn among many brothers , not among many brothers and sisters
In these days, we speak a great deal concerning the building up of the church and concerning the practice of the church life
If we want to know what the church life is and what the right way is for the building up of the church, we have to know the New Jerusalem
The temple is God Himself, since in the New Testament time, everything positive is God Himself in Christ through the Holy Spirit
The New Testament service is subjective to such an extent that in it we and the Lord, the two, are mingled as one
Today among Christians, however, the church is a mixture with some part of the divine nature and some part of the fallen human nature
If we want to have the real church life, the church herself must be pure gold, that is, altogether of the divine nature
The speaker said that we still need to be purified, just as pure gold is purified to contain no mixture and to be transparent
Sometimes you may meet a saint in the Lord, whom you sense is not only clean but also transparent, like clear glass
As long as the throne of God is gone, the source of the living water is also gone, because the living water comes out of the throne of God
As long as you do not have the headship, the lordship, of Christ realized in the divine order, you have lost the source of the living water
That the tree of life grows in the river means that Christ as our life supply is available to us in the flow of the Spirit
In any kind of meeting of the church life, there must be Christ ministered as the life supply in the flowing stream of the Holy Spirit
In the church life, we must have Christ supplied and ministered to us as the life supply in the flow of the Holy Spirit
Day by day, week by week, month after month, and year after year, we should not be satisfied with singing the same hymns over and over
In the meetings we must have something of the riches of Christ ministered to the Lord's people as the life supply
With and in the flow of the living water grows the tree of life, and the flow of the living water is in the middle of the street
If you have Christ as the pure gold, the living water, and the living supply, you have the way, and you will know what you should do'
If you have the stream, you have the life supply and you have the pure gold, the divine nature; that is, you have the street
We have seen that the New Jerusalem is a full picture of all the building work of God throughout the generations
When Christ came, He told us that He is the bread of life which comes down out of heaven, the food of eternal life from heaven
On the other hand, this corporate Body is a habitation, a dwelling place, for God to be His satisfaction and rest
He also tells us that the Lord Jesus is the Bridegroom who has the bride and that He is the light , the way, the reality, and the life
He tells us that the Lord Jesus is the living bread from heaven, full of the life supply, and the living water
In the first two chapters of the Bible we see the tree of life, and we also see a river flowing by the tree of life
There is a difference between the materials at the beginning of the Bible and the materials at the end of the Bible
A garden is a scene of nature, of God's creation; a city is something built up with the materials created by God
Although He is the Creator, His intention is to build Himself into man as His creature to mingle Himself with him
God in Christ through the Spirit is the contents of this corporate Body and this corporate Body is the vessel to contain God and express God
Revelation 21:21 says, 'And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl'
When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a precious pearl
The resurrected Lord secretes His divine lifejuice around us all the time until we the worthless grains of sand become the precious pearls
In John 3:5 the Lord told us, 'Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
In the third parable we have God the Father receiving the repenting and returned sons as the father receiving his prodigal son
In Revelation 21, four represents the four directions of the earth-the east, the north, the south, and the west
The number four signifies the creatures, because in Revelation 4:6 we are told that there are four living creatures around the throne of God
There is only one way, one street, one flow, one stream, one Spirit, one fellowship, and one food with twelve varieties
No matter how you denominate yourself as a denomination if you do not give that up today one day the Lord will tell you Child give that up
We are one in the way, in the life, in the flow of the stream in the Spirit, and in the fellowship of the Spirit
Do not consider that you are spiritual and others are not, nor consider that you have seen the heavenly vision and others have not
We are all one in the way, in the life, in the Spirit, in the flow, in the communion, in the fellowship of the Spirit
We have the nature of God the Father as the pure gold, and the crucifixion, the redemption, and the regeneration of Christ to make us pearls
Our being Christians is up to Him and not up to us; it is something from heaven and not something of this earth
Your dear wife is a pressure, your dear children are a pressure, and your dear brothers and sisters are a pressure
Whether it should be low, medium low, medium, medium high, or high, the divine Cook knows how to adjust the fire
As we have seen, the wall of the holy city is built with precious materials pressed and burned by the divine hand
In many churches, there may be the gold, and there may be the pearls as the entrance, but they do not have the wall
It is simply because the believers, after the pressing and the burning, have been conformed to the image of God
You will see the divine jasper in them because they have been burned and pressed in the hand of the Holy Spirit
Revelation 21:14 says, 'And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb'
They have been built up together as a corporate vessel, a corporate container, to contain God and to express God
God in Christ through the Spirit is the contents of this city, and God is the glory expressed through this city
