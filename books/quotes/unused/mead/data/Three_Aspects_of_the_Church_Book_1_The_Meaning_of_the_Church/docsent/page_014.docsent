   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE GOD S WORK TO RECOVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ONENESS IN THE UNIVERSE Scripture Reading: Ephesians 1:10, 22; 4:13 Satan Damaging the Oneness of God s Creation through Death</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The oneness of God s creation was damaged by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan damaged the element of oneness by introducing death into all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Death had three spiritual consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, it severed the Creator s relationship with the creation; second, it caused the creation to lose its original function with respect to the Creator; and third, it caused the creation to be corrupted and abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, God is now recovering us with His life so that we may be joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is recovering our function toward God, and He is recovering God s life, which is indestructible, incorruptible, and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When all things were separated from God, the oneness of God s creation was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The center of the universe is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the oneness of the universe is also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once the created universe lost God and its relationship with God was severed, it lost its center.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Colossians 1:20 says, Having made peace through the blood of His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peace in this verse does not merely refer to sinners being reconciled to God but also to a restoration of the relationship between the universe and God, in which there is no separation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through the blood of Christ, God and the universe are in one accord and in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This harmony is the great oneness of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, when Satan introduced death into the universe, the universe was separated from God, and the one accord and the oneness were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, there is not full harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wars being fought among the nations and people killing one another demonstrate the lack of harmony and oneness among men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even the fact that mosquitoes bite people shows that there is no oneness in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The universe has lost its oneness because it has been separated from God, the source of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peace and harmony can be found only in God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The disharmony in the universe will continue until the restoration of all things, that is, until the coming of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 8:19 says that the creation is anxiously watching, eagerly awaiting the revelation of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The revelation of the sons of God will occur when the sons of God reach maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the restoration of all things, vipers will not hurt people, and lions will not bite or harm people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the condition of the kingdom as depicted in Isaiah 11:6-8: The wolf will dwell with the lamb; / And the leopard will lie down with the kid, / And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; / ...The nursing child will play by the cobra s hole, / And upon the viper s den / The weaned child will stretch his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On that day all things in the universe will be in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Men will not war any longer, and all the weapons of war will be changed in their nature 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, at that time the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, / And the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days 30:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Jews and the Gentiles will minister to the one God and be in complete harmony 56:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Isaiah presents a thorough description of the harmonious situation that will occur upon the restoration of all things in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is working continuously until the day when all matters, things, men, and God will be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The situation in the restoration and the issue produced from death are totally contrary.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When death entered, all things lost the oneness and entered into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not have light in a meeting, we will fall into darkness and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Death brings in darkness, and darkness brings in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there is a condition of confusion among the brothers and sisters, we know that they are in darkness and lack life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the contrary, life brings in light, and light brings in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the restoration of all things, everything will be in the light, and all things will be in harmony with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time, They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, / For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah, / As water covers the sea 11:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Harmony results from the knowledge of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The knowledge of Jehovah is light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today, however, in the universe there is no harmony, because all things have been separated from their Creator and have fallen into death.</S>
