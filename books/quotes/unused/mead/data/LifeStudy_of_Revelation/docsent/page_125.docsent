   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE FOUR ASPECTS OF THE EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis is the field into which nearly all the seeds of the truths were sown.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Revelation we have the harvest of the truths sown in the beginning of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this book of consummation, the local churches are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The local churches are also the focus of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that the local churches are the destination of God s progressive revelation and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible we not only have God s revelation but also His manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation may be considered as being close to doctrine, but manifestation is definitely related to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the Bible not only gives us the doctrine but also the experience, not only the revelation of God, but also the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there were no local churches, there would be no destination for God s revelation and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The subtle enemy, Satan, hates the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Throughout the centuries, many good Christian teachers have devoted their attention to many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We admit that some of these things have been important.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, most of these teachers have still missed the mark, missing the destination of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must worship and praise God for being the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He would never let this matter go.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After recovering so many items during the past several centuries, in our time He has come to this destination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the reason that, day and night, our only burden is to build up the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the attack and opposition that we undergo are simply because of our stand for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE LAMPSTAND AS A TYPE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everybody knows that the term church is not found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first time it is used is in Matthew 16:18, where the Lord Jesus said, I will build my church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, in the Old Testament there are many types that foreshadow the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For instance, in Genesis 2 we have the bride as a type of the church being Christ s counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, both the tabernacle and the temple are types of the church being God s dwelling place among men on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The children of Israel as a corporate people signify that the church is also a corporate people to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>None of these types, however, is as all-inclusive as the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The lampstand is first mentioned in Exodus 25.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we only had this chapter, we would be unable to realize that the lampstand is related to the church or to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Near the end of the Old Testament, we find the lampstand mentioned again in Zechariah 4.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Zechariah shows some progress and improvement over Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Exodus we only have the lampstand with the seven lamps; there is no mention of what the seven lamps refer to.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in Zechariah we are given a definite interpretation of the seven lamps, for in this book we are told that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of God 4:10 and the seven eyes of the stone 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Zechariah tells us two main things regarding the lampstand that the seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of God and the seven eyes of the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consider the picture presented in Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That the stone has seven eyes, which are the seven eyes of God, indicates that these seven eyes infuse what God is into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is light, life, love, holiness, etc. All that He is as the life element is infused into us through His seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is even true of us as human beings, for as we look at others something of us is infused into them through our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is the significance of the seven eyes of God also being the seven eyes of the stone?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Undoubtedly, the stone is for building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, these seven eyes not only infuse God as the life element into our being; they also infuse Christ into us as the building material, making us the material for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Zechariah 4:2-6 and 10 also imply that these seven eyes of God, which are the seven lamps of the lampstand, are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In answering the question, What are these? it says, Not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse indicates that it is only through the Spirit that we can be prevailing in God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, we can see that the lampstand in Zechariah 4 reveals a definite development beyond the lampstand in Exodus 25.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, Zechariah is not the book of consummation, and we must continue until we come to the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Revelation there are seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This book also reveals that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God and the seven eyes of the Lamb 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the lampstand includes God, Christ, the Spirit, the Redeemer, and the building material.</S>
