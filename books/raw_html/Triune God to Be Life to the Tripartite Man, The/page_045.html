<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the One Who Abides in Our Spirit<br>to Live in Us, Operate in Us,<br>Empower Us, and Strengthen Us</H2><P>As our life, Christ abides in our spirit (John 15:5; 2 Tim. 4:22) to live in us in our daily life (Gal. 2:20), operate in us in our labor for Him (Col. 1:29), empower us in spiritual fighting (Eph. 6:10), and strengthen us in spiritual living (Phil. 4:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the One Who Is One with Our Spirit</H2><P>As the Spirit, Christ is one with our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17) to mingle Himself with us that we may be one with Him, even one with the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the Head and the Body and<br>the One Who Is All the Members<br>and in All the Members of the New Man</H2><P>Christ is the Head and the Body (Col. 1:18a; 1 Cor. 12:12), and He is all the members of the new man and in all the members of the new man (Col. 3:11). He is all in all. Whatever we experience in the experience of the divine life must be Christ. Eventually, our experience of the divine life will issue in the new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Experience Christ as the All-inclusive Person<br>Needing Us to Take the Following Actions</H2><P>Since Christ is such an all-inclusive, excellent, and marvelous Person in so many aspects, we need, for experiencing Him, to believe in Him (John 3:15), love Him (John 21:15), eat and drink Him (John 6:57b; 1 Cor. 12:13b), enjoy Him (1 Pet. 2:3), and live and magnify Him (Phil. 1:20-21a). In 1958 I began to see the matter of eating Jesus. During that year I held four conferences in Taipei within a six week period of time, and the subject of each conference was eating Jesus. The Lord Himself said, "He who eats Me shall also live because of Me" (John 6:57b). We must eat the Lord.</P><P>We also must learn to enjoy the Lord. First Peter 2:3 says, "If you have tasted that the Lord is good." To taste is to enjoy. Through the milk of the word (v. 2), we taste the Lord, that is, we enjoy the Lord.</P><P>To experience Christ, we must also live and magnify Him (Phil. 1:20-21a). To magnify Christ is to make Christ larger. Paul's desire in Philippians 1:20 was to make Christ larger. He said that he wanted to magnify Christ in his body, whether through life or through death. When he said this, he was in prison, but he still wanted to magnify Christ. Paul magnified, enlarged, extolled, and exalted Christ. This may have been the reason that some of Caesar's household became saints (Phil 4:22).</P><P>The Lord wants us to eat and drink Him and to live and magnify Him. In John 4 the Lord Jesus answered the Samaritan woman's question concerning worship. The proper worship is to drink the living water by contacting God the Spirit with our spirit (vv. 14, 23-24). By eating and drinking Him, we live and magnify Him. When we are eating Him and drinking Him, we render real worship to the Father. This makes Him happy. This is the experience of Christ as our life.</P>
