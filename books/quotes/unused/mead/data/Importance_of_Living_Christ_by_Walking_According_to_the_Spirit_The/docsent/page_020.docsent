   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: You have encouraged us to walk according to the spirit and not to rely on the exercise of the spirit in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we leading brothers are led by the Lord to change the meeting environment, how should we help the saints who want to continue in the old way?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: The basic principle is that we should not make anything a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we decide to give up the old way and force our decision on the church, this is legality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we first began to the call on the name of the Lord and pray-read in the meetings in the 1960s, I often felt that the calling and the pray-reading were somewhat wild, but I did not say much to correct the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Recently, I did not feel good about the shouting of some young brothers in the meetings because I did not believe that their shouting was of the spirit, but I did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In principle, we must help the saints to know the real exercise of the spirit, which is not merely shouting or excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Recently, some young brothers laughed wildly in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do not believe that it was the release of the spirit, and I do not believe that it edified others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The elders should adjust such ones in fellowship not during the meeting but afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, the elders are being negligent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We would not be wild or loose if the president were among us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we certainly should not be this way in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The elders should care for the saints as children in their family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When some of the children do not behave, the elders need to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The elders should not expect that a traveling co-worker would do something to correct a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is under the care of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders have many responsibilities, just as parents must do many things to raise their children.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regrettably, I have noticed that some elders do not do their duty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In every meeting the elders should be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The elders are overseers of the church Acts 20:28, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As overseers, they should exercise oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The elders should not try to force the saints in their localities to stop the so-called old way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That is legality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, the elders need to pray much and do their best to help the saints learn the real exercise and release of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A saint may call on the Lord loudly in order to be released from some bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That is genuine and is not a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all need to exercise and release the spirit, call on the name of the Lord, and pray-read in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, we should not be unruly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not be a pray-reading church, neither should we be a non-pray-reading church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both are wrong and are matters of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not make anything a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We like to have things clear-cut and make regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, according to the New Testament, the church is absolutely a matter of the spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It should have no legal regulations or bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A local church is simply the saints in a locality meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It does not need to have official membership or a record of its members.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whoever believes in the Lord Jesus is a member of the local church wherever they are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Question: First Peter 5:3 says that the elders should be patterns of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Can you share more about what the elders should do to become such patterns?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Answer: The elders in each locality should fellowship concerning what needs to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is much for the elders to do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who only come to the meetings and do routine work need to begin to do something more.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every elder can begin by praying to seek the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord may lead the elders to contact every saint in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may contact the saints in different ways one at a time or in small groups, by visiting them or inviting them somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the elders begin to contact all the saints, they will stir up the practical shepherding in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, the elders will shepherd the saints; then the saints will begin to shepherd others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the way for the elders to be a pattern to the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are the first sheep to do something, and the rest of the flock will follow them to do what they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are always short of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is also a great need for gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not simply a matter of announcing a love feast and a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We know from experience that this alone does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once we have laid a foundation, then we can use this way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A love feast for the gospel is the drawing in of a fishing net.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>First, we must cast the net.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If only a few new ones come to a love feast for the gospel, it is difficult to give a gospel message with impact.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are many things for the elders to do it all depends upon their seeking the Lord s leading and carrying it out properly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, as the elders work, they should pass things on to others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more we do, the less there should be in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After we finish doing something, there should be nothing left in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Every burden should go to others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to include others in everything we do in order to pass the burden on to them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>From the very beginning, whatever we do should lay the foundation to pass the burden on to others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After a year of laboring on something, no burden should remain with us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every bit of the burden should be on others shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we practice in this way, a revival will come in which every member will be functioning and active in the church life.</S>
