<h1 class="title">THE HISTORY OF THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE IN CHINA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>About two years after Brother Nee began putting out <em>The Christian,</em> many believers were raised up to pursue the Lord both in northern and southern China, because the messages in <em>The Christian</em> provoked the lovers of the Lord regarding the real condition of the church. They were shaken inwardly and were willing to take a pure, new way in order to be pleasing to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Situation from 1927 to 1942</h2>
<p>In 1927 Brother Nee began meeting with a small number of brothers and sisters in Shanghai. In the beginning there was one brother and a few sisters, and they broke bread in the home of Sister Peace Wang&rsquo;s father. They met there until 1928, when they rented a building in Shanghai and formally began to meet. From 1927 or 1928 Brother Nee felt that the center of his work should be in Shanghai. Thus, in 1927 Brother Nee moved his personal belongings and the Gospel Book Room to Shanghai. The work in Shanghai began at that time, and the church in Shanghai was established.</p>
<p>In February 1928 Brother Nee held the first overcomer conference in Shanghai. As a result of this conference, churches were raised up in numerous places in the northern part of Kiangsu Province. Several preachers from that area came to Shanghai for the conference and were blessed by it; thus, they brought the Lord&rsquo;s testimony back to Kiangsu Province. Within three or four years they raised up more than ten local churches with many members. In Pingyang County (in which Wenchow is located) in the southern part of Chekiang Province, many brothers began to serve and meet between 1928 and 1930. Within a few years they raised up more than twenty local churches in various towns and villages. When we visited that area in 1934, we did not have to go very far to get from one locality to the next. Thus, between 1927 and 1930 churches were established in Shanghai, in the northern part of Kiangsu, and in the southern part of Chekiang.</p>
<p>In October 1931 Brother Nee held the second overcomer conference. I planned to attend those meetings, but on September 18, the day of my scheduled departure, Japan invaded the three northeastern provinces of China, creating a dangerous situation in Chefoo, where I was living. Everyone was worried that I was traveling by steamship, and many people exhorted me not to go to Shanghai for fear that I would not be able to return home. Because of these exhortations, I cancelled my trip just before boarding the ship. Therefore, I did not attend those meetings. In November 1932 Brother Nee led a conference in the church in Shanghai. Eight Western believers visited the church in Shanghai and fellowshipped with the brothers; some of them were Englishmen, one was an American, and some were Australians. These believers came from Brethren assemblies. Because we had bought their books and fellowshipped with them through correspondence, they found out that believers in many places in China had left organized Christianity and were serving God in a hidden way. They wanted to visit the saints in China, and the brothers in Shanghai agreed to receive them. From the outset we made it clear that we were fellowshipping with them only as individual believers and that we did not agree to any connection or relationship with the organizations they represented. I was not present at that conference, but I learned that that visit did not have a good result and that it was not easy to fellowship with the Western saints. Moreover, some difficulties also arose in other areas.</p>
<p>In 1932 meetings also began in the northern part of China. The churches in the north were raised up later than those in Shanghai, Kiangsu, and Chekiang; thus, northern China was the fourth area where churches were raised up. Chefoo and Tsinan began their meetings around the same time in the summer of 1932. After approximately half a year, meetings began in Tientsin and Peking. Thus, by the second half of 1933 there were proper local churches in Chefoo, Tsinan, Tientsin, and Peking.</p>
<p>The fact that these four large cities in northern China had meetings greatly influenced other places. Although the churches in the north were established after those in the south, the churches in the north were raised up in big cities. This was different from the churches in Kiangsu and Chekiang, which began in remote rural areas. Peking and Tientsin were the first and second largest cities in northern China, and Tsinan was the third or fourth largest city. Although Chefoo had a population of only two hundred thousand or so, it was the center of Christianity in northern China; thus, Chefoo had a great influence on Christians in northern, eastern, and western China.</p>
<p>Toward the end of 1933 meetings began in Changchun in northeastern China. These meetings included people who were not only influential in the church but also very powerful socially and economically.</p>
<p>In January 1934 Brother Nee held the third overcomer conference. This third conference was on a larger scale than the first two, having a larger number of brothers from many different places. Many brothers came from localities without a church meeting or from other Christian groups. Many of them were still serving the Lord in various organizations. More than ten brothers came from Chefoo. The Lord&rsquo;s blessing was on that conference; the messages were high, focusing on Christ as the centrality and universality of God and on God&rsquo;s overcomers, and were given over a period of ten days. During that time the brothers all fellowshipped with each other. The meetings were full of the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and the messages were full of power and blessing. Every person went home filled with Christ.</p>
<p>After the conference the work that the Holy Spirit had begun in many places was stirred up. Thus, in 1934 in all of China except the western and central regions&mdash;that is, except for the provinces of Szechwan, Hunan, and Hupei&mdash;churches were raised up in locality after locality like bamboo shoots sprouting up after a rainfall. The raising up of the churches was a rushing, torrential flow. The slogan of that time was, &ldquo;Leaving the denominations; walking in the way.&rdquo; This aroused strong opposition from Christianity. Because I was serving in Shanghai as the acting editor of <em>Collection of Newsletters</em> and had to collect the news from all the localities, I was more clear than others concerning the situation of each locality. The flow for the raising up of churches and leaving the denominations was astonishing; moreover, each person who left the denominations sent a formal letter to his denomination with two main points: &ldquo;Because I want to walk in the Lord&rsquo;s way, the proper way, please remove my name from your book of life.&rdquo; The Christian organizations in China, especially the Western missionaries, were shaken and rose up to oppose us.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1934 meetings began in Fengtien, that is, Shenyang. Not long afterward, meetings began in Harbin and Dairen. By the end of 1934 there were churches in each of the four largest cities in the northeast, in Manchuria&mdash;Changchun, Fengtien, Harbin, and Dairen.</p>
<p>In October 1934 Brother Nee held the fourth overcomer conference in Hangchow. Prior to the conference, there was already a meeting in Hangchow. The Lord blessed this fourth overcomer conference, but I felt that it was not as strong as the third one. This conference was attended by believers from northern China and Manchuria. Because this conference was attended by so many believers from northern China and Manchuria, its greatest influence was on the churches in Manchuria.</p>
<p>The first half of 1935 was a very difficult time among us. On the one hand, there were severe attacks from the outside; some people printed tracts opposing us and even started rumors about us. They distributed the tracts at the exits of denominational churches when services let out. They took every opportunity to attack Brother Nee. On the other hand, there was trouble among the co-workers. The problems began when I was in northern China; the brothers sent me a telegram telling me to hurry back to Shanghai. I do not want to describe how serious this matter was, but when I returned to Shanghai two or three weeks later, all the co-workers were gone; I was the only one remaining. They left because the outside opposition exposed our inner problems.</p>
<p>Brother Nee was in a very difficult situation because the co-workers left, one by one, without telling him the reason. This left us with a bad feeling. They did not leave because there had been a difference of opinions; it almost seemed as though they left against their will. Only one elderly sister, who had not been subject to outside attacks and did not have any opinions, stayed with us to deal with the situation. Regrettably, however, her father was imprisoned and became ill in prison, so she needed to leave to care for him. When she left, I was the only one remaining. This difficult situation lasted for about four months.</p>
<p>Eventually, the co-workers came back, one by one, because they had the grace of God and learned some lessons of spiritual life. Because of these problems, Brother Nee was in a difficult situation and was not willing to do anything openly. About ten brothers and sisters, myself included, invited him to Hangchow to study Song of Songs; this was still in 1935. The book <em>The Song of Songs</em> is compiled from the notes of that time.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1935 I returned to northern China; Brother Nee planned at that time to travel through Manchuria, then through Siberia, and on to England. When he passed through Chefoo, we met together. That meeting was blessed by the Lord and caused some people to be revived. Brother Nee recovered the inward freshness and dropped his plan to go to England; instead, he returned to Shanghai. When he arrived in Shanghai, he held some meetings, and these meetings brought in a revival. The central messages released that summer in both Chefoo and Shanghai emphasized Christ as the overcoming life.</p>
<p>Because of the revival of 1935, the co-workers felt at the end of 1936 and the beginning of 1937 that we had never truly gone out for the spreading of the gospel; moreover, the churches in big cities like Nanking and Tientsin were very weak. Therefore, the co-workers wanted to go out to help the churches in all the localities and to strengthen the meetings in every place. In January 1937 Brother Nee called a co-workers&rsquo; conference in Shanghai in which he spoke about the principle of Acts 13; the messages in this conference began a line of fellowship that was later included in the book <em>Rethinking the Work,</em> now titled <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> Brother Nee specifically pointed out that a servant of the Lord should not stay in one place for a long time but should go out. The Lord gives us the light of the truth, not just for ourselves but for all of God&rsquo;s children. Brother Nee hoped that a few brothers could bear some responsibility to release the light of the truth in many places. However, our going out at that time did not reap much blessing.</p>
<p>On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Sino-Japanese War. On August 13 a battle broke out in Shanghai, and the entire country was in turmoil. The government decided to resist the Japanese invasion to the bitter end. The churches along the coast were affected by the war, and many brothers and sisters decided to move inland. On the one hand, they moved because of government policy, and on the other hand, they feared being massacred by the Japanese. At that time the stronger localities were all in the coastal provinces. Brother Nee felt that this retreat was probably the Lord&rsquo;s will and that we should take the gospel, the truth, and the Lord&rsquo;s testimony inland, behind the battle front. Therefore, in November Brother Nee called a co-workers&rsquo; conference in Hankow and spoke again, this time more formally, on the principle of Antioch. Although I went to Hankow for this conference, I was forced to return to the north to care for my family because the situation in northern China was very pressing due to the war. The messages given in the conference in Hankow were edited into the book <em>Rethinking the Work</em> in the fall of 1937. Later, many brothers and sisters retreated from the front; thus, during the Sino-Japanese War churches were raised up in Chungking and Chengtu in Szechwan Province. Brothers Chang Yu-lan and Cheng Ta-chiang were saved during this time.</p>
<p>In 1938 Brother Nee visited England again and fellowshipped with Brother Sparks; he returned to China in the summer of 1939. By that time Nanking had already fallen to the Japanese, so we met in the foreign concession in Shanghai. Because the area outside the foreign concession was under Japanese authority, we were cut off from fellowship with the rest of the country. In August 1939, after Brother Nee had returned to China, he held a conference, hoping that many people would be able to attend. Because travel was difficult due to the war, not many people came; however, I participated in that conference.</p>
<p>I personally received much help in that conference. The messages were on the Body of Christ. The conference was a great turning point among us, and a major aspect of that turn was an emphasis on the inner life and on arriving at the knowledge of the Body through the resurrection life. After the conference Brother Nee was burdened to hold a training in Shanghai. In 1940 he started a training in Shanghai&rsquo;s Yu-hwa Village; the training was held continuously for two years. By that time there were many localities throughout China, and the church in Shanghai was a very large church with several hundred members.</p>
<p>At the end of 1941 the Japanese began the war in the Pacific and took over the foreign concession in Shanghai; they also organized false Christian groups. At the same time some big problems occurred among us. As a result of these troubles from within and without, the meetings in Shanghai were formally discontinued in the second half of 1942. After the Japanese occupied China, the country was divided into two regions, the northern region and the southern region. The churches held their meetings secretly, and there was not much communication among the brothers. Although churches had been raised up in the inland areas, it was still not easy for localities to fellowship with one another.</p>
<p>For about four years, beginning in 1940, the Lord worked strongly in northern China. The churches in northwestern China had a very strong beginning. Moreover, the churches in northeastern China were strengthened. Thus, during the Sino-Japanese War, although the church in Shanghai experienced problems, the churches in northern China made a turn, learning and realizing many necessary things.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
