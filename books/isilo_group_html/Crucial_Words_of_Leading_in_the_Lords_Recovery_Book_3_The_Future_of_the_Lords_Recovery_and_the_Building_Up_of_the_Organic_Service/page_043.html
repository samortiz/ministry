<h1 class="title">THE FOUNDATION FOR THE SPREAD<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE BEING MOBILIZED TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>For many years the number of saints meeting regularly in the church in Taipei has been around four to five thousand. The spiritual life of the saints has been maintained through their meeting regularly, and they have grown in life. This is a positive situation. Many brothers and sisters are growing, and many new brothers and sisters are being brought into the church life. However, it is time for us to change from merely maintaining our situation to taking action. The church in Taipei must rise up. Even though four to five thousand is not a large number, if the saints rise up to move corporately, it will be significant and profitable, and we will be able to accomplish something.</p>
<p>According to the present strength of our meetings, it should not be a problem to increase our numbers. It should be easy to double our numbers by next year, and we should also be able to quadruple them. I say this because at least three thousand five hundred saints stood up in the meeting to express their desire to bring one person to the Lord every year. This means that next year we can add a minimum of three thousand five hundred new ones. If every saint brings at least one person to the Lord in the next year, we will double our numbers. In addition to this, we should strengthen the preaching of the gospel in our homes and among the students. By adding these two aspects, we should be able to quadruple our numbers next year. If we want to gain people, we all, including the older and the younger saints, must rise up and coordinate together. The Lord&rsquo;s leading is for everyone to be mobilized as a soldier and to carry out his or her function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF OUR WORK BEING<br />
BEGETTING, NOURISHING, TEACHING,<br />
AND ADMINISTRATING</h2>
<p>In this message we will emphasize three matters: truth, life, and the church. With respect to the gospel, as long as we all preach the gospel, we will have good results. It is not difficult to beget children, but nourishing the children is not so easy. Teaching or educating children is even harder, because we must be educated first. We encourage all the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to beget children; it is good to have many new ones. However, after children are born, we cannot discard them on the side of the road, nor can we abandon them in a nursery school. We must raise them up by nourishing them and giving them an education. Furthermore, we must bring them to the proper path. If we beget five thousand children next year, it will be a huge problem to nourish and educate them. How can we teach them if we are uneducated? In ancient China it was rare for women to receive an education. After they were married, they stayed at home to raise children. Even though the children received their mother&rsquo;s love, they did not receive any education from their mother, because their mother was not educated.</p>
<p>In contrast to the situation in ancient Chinese households, the situation in Taiwan today is quite different. Nearly all young females receive a good education, one that is not inferior to the education received by males. Most young women today have graduated from high school. Therefore, they can bear the responsibility to both nourish and teach their children.</p>
<p>In order to keep the children whom we beget through preaching the gospel, we must educate them. Many do not know much about God, Christ, or redemption. We should know how to teach them these matters, because we have been taught the truth for many years. Not only do we have to beget, nourish, and teach; we also have to administrate. After we beget someone, we need to nourish and teach him. We must also lead him to participate in the proper church life and to function with the saints in the church. Then he will also be able to beget, nourish, teach, and administrate, and we will be able to continue to gain new ones. For this reason, we must learn how to beget, nourish, teach, and administrate.</p>
<p>When a couple gets married, they beget children. When the children are born, the couple will have no peace. Some people who get married today do not want to have children. This is not according to God&rsquo;s will in His creation of man. Likewise, some Christians do not want to beget new ones. After being saved, they want to pray, fellowship with the Lord, read the Bible, and be spiritual. But they do not want to beget and nourish children. To them, begetting children is a suffering as well as a blessing. Some brothers refuse to be an elder or a deacon, one who takes care of the saints and bears responsibility in the church. They want only to be a simple Christian who is not bothered or troubled by anything. We cannot be like this. We must beget new ones, and we must nourish them. We cannot ask the elders to nourish our children, nor can we put our children in a nursery school. We must nourish them ourselves.</p>
<p>From our experience we know that begetting is easy, but nourishing, teaching, and administrating are not so easy. We have been begetting people for many years, but we lack adequate care and nourishment. It seems as though we either leave them at home, or we throw them out on the street. Some of our children die from the cold, some starve to death, and some are taken away by other people. Hence, we must change this situation. We must care for the people whom we beget through preaching the gospel, and we must nourish and teach them in order for them to be sustained. After teaching them, our care for them must be proper; we must bring them along the proper path, which is to live the proper church life and to function in the church. This must be the focus of our work.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord's Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
