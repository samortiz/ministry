   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even the Old Testament tells us to be stirred up in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church is not a human society, but a divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not a human movement, but a divine movement, a divine moving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, God needs our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God stirs up our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not consider and analyze too much with your mind, and do not be so emotional or so determined.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all must be stirred up in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To understand in the mind is one thing, but to be stirred up in the spirit is another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am afraid that some of us may be clear in our mind about the Lord's recovery, but so poor in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May God be merciful to us and speak to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God must touch our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He must deliver us out of our mind and turn us to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we will not care so much for our mind, and we will not care so much for our emotions or our will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will go on with the Lord in His recovery because we have been stirred up in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A NEW BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ezra 1 begins with, "Now in the first year of Cyrus."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why was it not the second year or the third year?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why was it the first year?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the recovery is a real new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If today we are stirred up in the spirit for the Lord's recovery this will be the first year to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will be a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first year of King Cyrus was the beginning of a new reign.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope that among those who read this message, many will say, "Hallelujah, this year is the first year of my church life!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now I know that I must go up to Jerusalem!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some may ask, "If they go up to Jerusalem, what about all the rest who will not go up?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not consider that much just go up!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why do you have to consider so much regarding others?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If God has stirred up your spirit, you must go up, regardless of what others do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>History tells us that only a small number of the captivity went back to Jerusalem; the majority remained in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that besides the temple in Jerusalem, there has never been another temple built up by the Jewish people in the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, they have built up many synagogues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They have not dared to build up a temple, because they know too well God's commandment in Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we only rise up, yet we do not go up to the church life, we may serve God, but we will only serve God in a synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can never serve God in the temple simply because we have only been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need not only to be raised up, but also to go up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not serve God on a lower level; we must go up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may say that they can preach the gospel where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yes, they can preach the gospel on a low level.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And some may say that they have the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a sense I agree with them, but they have the presence of God on a low level.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all need to go up! up to Jerusalem! up to the ground of unity! up to the unique ground of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am so happy that in these past years we have seen many dear ones who have been stirred up, have risen up, and have gone up to bring up and build up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now today, in so many places, they are building up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hallelujah! stirred up! rise up! go up! bring up! and now build up!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We build up what we bring up.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a summary of God's recovery.</S>
