   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Not in Padan-aram</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Padan-aram, God did not give a promise to Jacob 31:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did God not give him a promise there?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It certainly was not because God changes, for God never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No promise was given to Jacob in Padan-aram because that was not the proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Padan-aram, Jacob was not in the right position to receive God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we would receive God's promise, we must be in the proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I say strongly that many things can only be received in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Outside of the church life, you do not have the position to receive these things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 Not in Succoth or in Shechem</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, Jacob left Padan-aram and journeyed to Succoth, which means "booths" 33:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Succoth, which was on the border of the good land, Jacob built a house for himself and booths for his cattle, but he did not erect an altar for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later, Jacob traveled from Succoth to Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen that in Shechem he built an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this altar was built at the place of his own satisfaction, not at the place of God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, God changed Jacob's circumstances that he might be stirred up and receive the charge to arise and go up to Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Neither in Succoth nor in Shechem did Jacob receive God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>3 Only in Bethel</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only in Bethel did God give His promise to Jacob 35:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The promise in chapter thirty-five is more solid than the promise given to Jacob in the dream 28:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before we came to the church life, we never had a solid promise given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The most solid promises are always given in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our experience after coming into the church life is that nearly every day is a day of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that every day is full of expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Outside the church, we had no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Did you have hope before coming into the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No, we only had disappointment and discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But now, in the church life, everything is so definite and meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Morning, noon, and night we have hope.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these hopes are the promises we are receiving day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the promises given by God and received by us in the church life are for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are not for our little cottage or hut.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the past, some of us desired to build a little cottage of holiness, and some of the sisters expected to build the little hut of a good married life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many wives who have not found married life enjoyable have sought to find a happy married life in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even after coming into the church life, many sisters still have deep within them the hope of finding in the church the happy married life they have been seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their intention is not for the building up of the house of God; it is to build the little hut of their married life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the experience of many of us is this: when we were endeavoring to build a little hut for ourselves, God blew upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In my experience years ago, God firstly blew away the roof and then the walls.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After that, my hut was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But do not think that all the church people are miserable because the hut of their married life has been demolished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have a much better married life, not in our little hut, but in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today, in the church life, I can testify and boast to the enemy concerning the wonderful married life I have in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you did not have the church life, what a miserable married life you would have!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we tried to build a little hut for ourselves, we were unsuccessful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when we brought our married life into the church, we found ourselves in a mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Praise the Lord that we are here for the house of God!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before I came into the church life, I also attempted to build a little house of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As many of you know, I am a quick person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It takes a great deal of energy for a fast person to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I even hate to get a busy signal when I dial the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Realizing as a young man that I lacked patience, I attempted to build a little house of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I also did my best to build houses of holiness and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I wanted very much to be victorious over my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A fast person is impatient, and impatience causes us to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I was quite aware that I was impatient, unholy, and defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although I tried to build houses of patience, holiness, and victory, I was not successful in building even one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I came into the church life, I did not immediately forget these houses.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, I still attempted to build them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But one day I saw that it was foolish to build these small houses, for I already had one large house the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as we are in the church life, patience, holiness, and victory are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let me share with you something I have experienced many times.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I was on the verge of losing my temper, I thought about the church, and immediately my temper disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Perhaps I said to myself, "I am about to lose my temper with the elders."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But, by the Lord's mercy, I thought about the church, and my temper vanished.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is not always the need to even experience the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even a thought about the church life can quell our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You may say, "Brother Lee, this is superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How can a little thought about the church life take away your temper?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I cannot explain this, but I know that I have experienced that even a thought about the church can make you victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you actually live in the church life, what holiness and victory you will have!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When you get into the New Jerusalem, will you still be seeking holiness, humility, and patience?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No, when you get into the New Jerusalem, all this vocabulary will be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There will be no patience, just God Himself as the all-sufficient God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the church life we have a miniature of the New Jerusalem today.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No other Christians experience holiness as much as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are not building our cottages and huts.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are only for the unique building the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This house is a mutual habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Both we and God abide here.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Praise the Lord that we are now in the church life experiencing God in a corporate way!</S>
