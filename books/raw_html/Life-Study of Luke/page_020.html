<h2 class="head3">Adored by Anna</h2><p>In 2:36-39 we have Anna&rsquo;s adoration of the Child Jesus. Verse 36 says, &ldquo;And there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was well advanced in years, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity.&rdquo; Anna was a widow &ldquo;up to the age of eighty-four, who did not depart from the temple, serving with fastings and petitions night and day&rdquo; (v. 37). Verse 38 says, &ldquo;At that very hour she came up and returned thanks to God, and spoke concerning Him to all those looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.&rdquo; Here the word &ldquo;redemption&rdquo; indicates that the Man-Savior is the redemption of God&rsquo;s people. Anna returned thanks to God for the Man-Savior and spoke concerning Him as the redemption of God&rsquo;s people.</p><p>In 2:21-38 we see that the Man-Savior, in order to be a proper Israelite according to the law, was circumcised, named, and offered to God. Luke 2:39 says, &ldquo;And when they had finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.&rdquo; The Man-Savior was born in Bethlehem, the city of David, and He remained there just briefly. He was raised in Nazareth, a despised city in Galilee, a despised region. Being despised was also a characteristic of the Savior&rsquo;s human life.</p><h2 class="head3">Growing in Stature of Body,<br />Becoming Strong in Spirit,<br />Being Filled with Wisdom,<br />and the Grace of God Being upon Him</h2><p>Luke 2:40 says, &ldquo;And the little child grew and became strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him.&rdquo; He grew in stature of body (v. 52), and He became strong in spirit (see 1:80).</p><p>Verse 40 says that as the Man-Savior was growing, He was being filled with wisdom. This wisdom, which came from the Savior&rsquo;s deity (Col. 2:2-3), was revealed in proportion to the measure of His bodily growth.</p><p>Verse 40 also tells us that the grace of God was upon Him. As a Man, even Jesus needed the grace of God for His human life. He was filled with wisdom from His deity, and He needed the grace of God for His humanity.</p><p>As God, the Man-Savior did not need grace. However, as a Man He needed the grace of God. Therefore, we are told in verse 40 that the grace of God was upon Him.</p><p>As human beings, we all need God&rsquo;s wisdom and grace. Wisdom is related to the way of doing things, and grace, to the power, the ability, to carry out those things. In our living we first need the way to do a particular thing; then we need the power to do it. Wisdom is the way, and grace is the power. We need wisdom in order to have the proper way. However, wisdom itself is not enough. We also need grace. If we do not have grace, we shall not have the power, strength, or energy to carry out a certain matter in the proper way. If we have wisdom without grace, we shall be disappointed because we shall not be able to fulfill our responsibility. But we may have God&rsquo;s wisdom for our way and God&rsquo;s grace for our power, strength, and energy. The Man Jesus lived in God&rsquo;s wisdom and grace.</p>
