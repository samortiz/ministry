Before the Lord Jesus ascended into heaven, He charged His disciples to go forth and preach the gospel everywhere
We, His believers, bear this burden joyfully, for God's power to save everyone who believes is contained in the gospel
He is the last Adam, who became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection to enter His believers and give them life
His resurrection was God's vindication and approval of Him and of His work and becomes the proof of our justification before God
After nullifying death through His death, He brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel by His resurrection
In resurrection Christ came back to the disciples and breathed into them that they might receive the Holy Spirit as their life essentially
After His ascension He poured out the Spirit of power upon His believers that He might be their power economically
Through all His accomplishments, Christ has attained and obtained a number of things that we proclaim as our gospel
As the God-man, with both the divine and the human natures, He has attained to the peak of divine attributes and human virtues
He is the High Priest to the believers , interceding for them before God that they may be saved to the uttermost
When Christ returns, He will transfigure the body of our humiliation , thereby redeeming our bodies that we may enjoy the full sonship
He will bring God's kingdom to this earth, and the kingdom of this world will become the kingdom of our God and of His Christ
In this eternal city, Christ is the tree of life, supplying Himself as life to the entire city and offering healing to the nations forever
Their salvation is to be forgiven of their sins, justified by God, reconciled to God, and regenerated and saved through His Spirit
