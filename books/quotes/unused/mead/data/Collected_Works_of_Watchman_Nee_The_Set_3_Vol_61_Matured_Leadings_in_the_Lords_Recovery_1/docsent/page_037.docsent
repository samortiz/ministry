   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE FORSAKING EVERYTHING TO SERVE GOD Date:Evening, February 3, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong THE GLORY OF SERVING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among God's children today, there is the thought that service to God is a favor to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let me ask: Do we see the shining face on the throne?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Unless we see God's glory on the throne, we cannot forsake everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The world is lovely, and mammon is precious!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone is intensely interested in money; no one can forsake it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have seen His glory, however, we will be like Paul who regarded everything as refuse in comparison to the excellency of Christ Phil 3:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Ma, do you know the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Chu, do you feel that you have given yourself to the Lord's service too soon or too late?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The world has only pain, bitterness, and regret to offer to men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is more than worthwhile for a Christian to forsake the world to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are here to speak about total consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some feel that this is too much, but these ones have not seen the glory of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They want to go back to the world at every turn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Israelites who did not see the excellency of the promised land wanted to go back to Egypt at every turn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we sense the glory of serving the Lord, we will be able to lead many by the hand even though we may be young men ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul was a young man when he was called Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He persecuted the church and thought that he was serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He asked for letters from the high priest to bind the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet God's glory came to him, and he fell down.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through this experience, he began to know the meaning of serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps we consecrated ourselves with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even while our tears were still wet, our heart was filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The deepest joy is the joy that is accompanied by tears.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should feel ashamed that we have not given Him enough.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should feel ashamed that we have not given Him the best.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can never give Him too much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This revelation alone will change the color of everything in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It will change our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not doing this to join a crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is by God's grace that our offering is accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the meaning of knowing Him in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what motivated the early church to consecrate itself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some people think that they are doing God a favor when they drop a little money in the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Little do they realize that it is God's mercy that our offering is accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I know two young brothers who are somewhat clever in worldly ways.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Each of them has some small achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are very proud.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They think that their service to God is a favor to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I heard them say once, "I could have gained a high place in society, but I have given myself to serve God!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I heard this, I said, "You are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During the past two thousand years of church history, countless people who were better than you have given themselves to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They knew the preciousness and the glory of serving the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They never felt that they had done themselves an injustice by serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the contrary, they thanked God for His great mercy for sending down His fire to consume the service of a sinner like them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>O blind ones, the day will come when the One to whom you offered yourselves in contempt will be exalted in glory as the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Think carefully about who is doing whom a favor!"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if we have to kneel, crawl, or prostrate ourselves before God, we have to plead for service.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His acceptance of our consecration is His mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consecration is God's grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is God granting us a favor by accepting us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to bow down our head and say, like Mephibosheth, "What is your servant that you should look upon a dead dog like me?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>2 Sam 9:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God is so great.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is the Lord of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What a wonder that creatures as lowly as we can serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>O proud ones who can boast in anything, you cannot boast in front of God; this is the wrong place for boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let me illustrate my point with a story.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have a friend who is also a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During the war he was in Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One day General Chiang invited him for a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He was very excited when telling me about the dinner, and he was very honored.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Two months ago Mr. Mao wrote him a letter and asked him a question.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He came and told me that General Chiang's dinner and Mr. Mao's letter were highlights in his life that he would never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let me say that God is far greater than Mr. Mao and General Chiang.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Are we doing Him a favor or is He doing us a favor by allowing us to serve Him?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everyone who knows God will prostrate himself in the dust and beg to give his all to God in adoration and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is God's great love and mercy to allow us to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have not done Him a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is a matter of Him receiving our consecration, not a matter of us being generous enough to give ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The honor is on us, not on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Serving the Lord is our glory, a tremendous glory!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We hope that in these days many brothers and sisters will learn to press themselves against the Lord and say, "This is what little I have.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Please send down Your fire to accept it."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the time for us to forsake everything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is inexcusable for any of our co-workers to have fear or to keep back anything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Anyone who tries to deceive or who has impure motives will be like Ananias and Sapphira.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our God is a consuming fire Heb 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No man can deceive such a Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have to offer up everything wholeheartedly and in all sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to serve God with our whole soul and our whole mind.</S>
