   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN JOSEPH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 22 says, By faith Joseph, when near his end, remembered concerning the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Joseph remembered the coming exodus of the sons of Israel and charged them to bring his bones out of Egypt and into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This took great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Israelites entered into Canaan, they brought Joseph s bones into the good land Exo 13:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>X. IN MOSES</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 23 says, By faith Moses, having been born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a handsome child, and they did not fear the king s decree.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His parents hid him by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he had become great, he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh s daughter, choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek word translated temporary in verse 25 may also be rendered for awhile, short-lived, fleeting, passing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During Moses time, to be called the son of Pharaoh s daughter was an enjoyment to the life of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Moses refused this, choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to have the fleeting enjoyment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The enjoyment in Egypt, that is, the enjoyment in the world, is sinful in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the enjoyment of sin, of a sinful life, and is temporary, short-lived, fleeting, and passing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 26 we are told that Moses esteemed the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked away to the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was young, being troubled by my clock mentality, I questioned how Moses could have suffered the reproach of Christ, since Christ had not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ, as the Angel of the Lord, was always with the children of Israel in their afflictions Exo 3:2, 7-9; 14:19; Num 20:16; Isa 63:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the Scripture identifies Him with them Hosea 11:1; Matt 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, the reproach falling on them was considered also as His reproach, and the reproaches of those who reproached God fell upon Him too Rom 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament believers, as His followers, bear His reproach 13:13 and are reproached for His name 1 Pet 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moses, choosing to be ill-treated with the people of God v. 25 , esteemed this kind of reproach, the reproach of the Christ of God, greater riches than the treasures of Egypt in Pharaoh s palace, for he looked away to the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because Moses was willing to suffer the reproach of the Christ, he will receive the reward of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was not allowed to enter into the rest of the good land because of his failure at Meribah Num 20:12-13; Deut 3:26, 27; 32:50-52 , but he will be with Christ in the kingdom Matt 16:28-17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By referring to this, the writer certainly intended to encourage the Hebrew believers, who were suffering persecution for Christ s sake, to follow Moses by esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the things they had lost and by looking away to the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not know who told Moses of the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps it was his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, having great faith, he looked away to the reward and fled Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The palace of Pharaoh, the royal sonship, the worldly enjoyment and attainment, and all the things in Egypt were there before him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to his sight, these things were real, but according to his faith, they were not real.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Something other than that the reward was real to his substantiating sense.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although at that time the reward was far away from him, he looked unto it and was encouraged by it to forsake everything in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 27 says that by faith Moses left Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king, for he was steadfast as seeing the invisible One.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time, this was a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That great reward was such an incentive to him in fleeing Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a full portrait of our life today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today the world is Egypt and all that it can afford us is a palace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But to our faith, all this is a vanity of vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only one thing is the reality of realities the coming reward.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 28 says, By faith he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It took faith for Moses to institute the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It also took faith for Moses to tell the people to prepare the lamb and to sprinkle the blood on the lintels and posts of the doors.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God honored Moses faith in instituting the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without seeing the Passover, which was to come, Moses substantiated it by faith and acted according to this substantiation.</S>
