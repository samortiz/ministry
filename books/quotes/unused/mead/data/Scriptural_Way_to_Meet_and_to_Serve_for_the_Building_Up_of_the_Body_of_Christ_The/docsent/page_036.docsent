   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS Scripture Reading: John 3:15-16; 6:48; Eph 3:8; 1 Cor 15:45b; Phil 1:19; John 6:57; Eph 6:17-18; John 6:63; Rev 2:7, 4-5, 17, 15; 3:20, 15, 18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapters of this book we have seen much concerning the riches of Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The purpose for seeing these things is that we may enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our enjoyment of Christ is for the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Christians attend church services, but few know the relationship between the enjoyment of Christ and the Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the United States twenty-five years ago, I discovered that the words e njoy, dispense, and practice were not used in regard to the Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have used such words in order to minister what I have seen of the Lord concerning the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day in Los Angeles in 1964, several of the leading ones came together to draft a statement which described the purpose of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The brothers also asked me to compose a part of this statement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This statement required the use of the word practice; therefore, I included this word in the phrase, the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today this phrase is very common among us, but in those days, it was not a very familiar term.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One of the leading brothers was a high school teacher in English.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he read my composition, he questioned the use of the phrase the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He felt that this phrase was not good English, so I asked him to improve it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After trying for a period of time to find a better way to say it, he said that he could not think of anything better and that we should use the phrase I composed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From that day until now, the word practice has been accepted for use in our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>EATING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also use the word enjoy to describe our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is even eatable and drinkable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our eating and drinking is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since 1958 I began to use the word eat concerning the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today I use it very emphatically.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1958 before I visited England, I held a conference with the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During that conference, the term eating Christ came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The burden concerning this matter was quite heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One night after a strong message on eating Christ, a learned brother, who was a professor from a prominent university in Taiwan, came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said, Brother Lee, the message was very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the word eat seems to be too wild.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Could we really eat the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He asked this question because to eat someone up in Chinese slang has a very poor meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said, Brother, this word eat is not my invention.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus Himself spoke this word in John 6:57 He who eats Me shall also live because of Me. When I pointed out this verse to him, he said, I have nothing to say because the Lord Jesus said this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then I responded, Since the Lord Jesus said to eat Him, surely we also have to say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all have to learn to say that Jesus is eatable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the bread of life John 6:35, 48, 51 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we have a piece of bread, is it not right to say that the bread is eatable?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some Christian groups may speak about and stress that Jesus is the bread of life, but very few have told people to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In John 6:48 the Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life, and in John 6:57 He said, He who eats Me shall also live because of Me. In Greek the word for eats in verse 57 is literally masticates.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To masticate is to eat finely, thoroughly, and absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jesus came not only to die for our sins but also to be our daily bread, our food.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ being the bread of life and the matter of eating Him are mentioned together in the same chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is logical.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus told us that He is the bread of life, and He must also show us how to take Him as the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The bread is not for our appreciation outwardly; it is for our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Years ago I put out a series of messages entitled, Eating, Drinking, and Enjoying God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This may sound very rough and wild to some.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When John the Baptist was preaching in the wilderness, everything about him seemed wild.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His eating was wild, his clothing was wild, and his way of living was wild.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He denounced the entire culture at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then the Lord Jesus came to tell people to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This may also seem wild, but in reality we must eat Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more we eat Christ, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The best way to eat Him is to masticate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we taste Him in such a way, we will surely testify that Jesus is eatable and delicious Psa 34:8; 1 Pet 2:3; Heb 6:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the start of God s relationship with man in Genesis 2, God placed man in front of the tree of life Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Immediately, God brought this man out of His creating hand to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This indicates that what God wanted man to do was to eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The tree of life is a sign, signifying that the creating God is the life supply to His created man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then in Revelation 2:7 the Lord Jesus says that he who overcomes will be given to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At the end of the Bible there is the holy city with the river flowing with the living water Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the flow of the living water grows the tree of life v. 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This tree of life is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine John 15:1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The description in Revelation 22 indicates that the tree of life is a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verse 2 says that the tree of life is on this side and on that side of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What tree, other than a vine tree, can grow in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It does not grow upward like a pine tree tall and stretching toward the heavens; but it grows like a vine close to the earth on the two banks of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the tree of life were tall like a pine tree and its fruit were at the top, its fruit would be too high for us to reach without difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But the tree of life as a vine is lower than we are; thus, it is so easy to obtain its fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine, and He also told us that He is the life 14:6; 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Putting these two things together the vine tree and the life, we can see that Jesus is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The vine tree must be the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As the tree of life He is a fruit tree for eating, not a pine tree for building materials.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is a vine full of life for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For eternity, we are destined to eat Christ as the tree of life, which is the fullest expression of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The riches of Christ are not for us to study; they are for us to eat and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Before 1958 there was very little realization concerning this matter in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To eat Jesus is a new term among the Lord s children today.</S>
