   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Just as man has fellowship with the physical world through his body, he has fellowship with the spiritual world through his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This fellowship with the spiritual realm is not through the mind or emotion but through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is through the intuition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we understand the functions of the intuition, we will understand the nature of the fellowship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For a man to worship God and have fellowship with Him, he must have a substance that is similar to God's. "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit" John 4:24 . There cannot be fellowship between two different substances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, unregenerated persons, whose spirits are not resurrected, and those regenerated believers who do not worship with their spirits cannot have any real fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although a person may have some beautiful thoughts and strong feelings, he can never enter into spiritual reality and have personal fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our fellowship with God is in the deepest part of our being; it is in the part that is deeper than our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We fellowship with God through our intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 2:9 through 3:2 explains clearly how man fellowships with God through the intuition in his spirit and how he understands the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us now look into this carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE HEART OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 9 says, "Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse talks about God and the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All of His acts are things which man's outer body the eye and the ear has neither seen nor heard.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are things which have never come up in man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Man's heart" is man's understanding, mind, or intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man's thought can never fathom God's acts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's acts are far beyond man's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who want to know God and have fellowship with Him can never reach God by simply using their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 10 says, "But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit searches all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit does not have to use the mind to figure out all things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit knows even the deepest things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The things which man does not know, He knows.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He searches all things by His intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, through Him God can reveal to us things which have not come up in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is "revelation."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not the understanding which comes after an exercise of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since it is something that has not come up in our hearts, it is even more unlikely that it would come up in our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a "revelation" or an unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no need for help from our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God does not reveal anything to us through our ears, eyes, or mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How does revelation come?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The next two verses answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE SPIRIT OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verses 11 and 12 continue, "For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the same way, the things of God also no one has known except the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been graciously given to us by God."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only the spirit of man knows not understands or apprehends the things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Similarly, only the Holy Spirit knows the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Both the spirit of man and the Holy Spirit know things directly, not by deduction or investigation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, they both know through the intuition, not through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since only the Holy Spirit knows the things of God, we can only know the things of God when we receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The spirit of the world is a spirit which does not have any fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even though it is still a spirit, it is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, it cannot bring us fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Holy Spirit of God knows the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, when we receive in our spirit what the Holy Spirit already knows in the intuition, we also know the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why it says, "we have received...the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things...given to us by God."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But how do we know?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 11 says that we know through our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This makes the matter very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Holy Spirit reveals to our spirit all that He knows in His intuition, causing our spirit's intuition to also know what He knows.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through the intuition we know the things revealed by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, whenever the Holy Spirit reveals the things of God, He reveals them in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In God's eyes, other than man's spirit, there is no other organ in man which can know the things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, the Holy Spirit does not reveal the things of God to our mind because He knows that our mind is incapable of knowing the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The mind is not an organ for knowing things pertaining to God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although the mind can think and even design many things, it cannot say that it knows these things because only the spirit of man can know the things of man.</S>
