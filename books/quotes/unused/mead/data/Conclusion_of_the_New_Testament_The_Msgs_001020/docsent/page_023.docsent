   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE SIX GOD HIS PERSON 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall conclude our study of the aspects of God's person revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>25.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The One Who Is, Who Was, and Who Is Coming</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Twice in the book of Revelation we are told that God is the One who is, who was, and who is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the meaning of the name Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Hebrew Jehovah means "I am that I am."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His being the I Am signifies that He is the One who exists from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This title is composed basically of the verb "to be."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apart from God, Jehovah, all else is nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the only One who is, the only One who has the reality of being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The verb "to be" should not be applied absolutely to anyone or anything except Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the only self-existent and ever-existent being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the universe all things are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only God is the One who is, who was, and who is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past He was, in the present He is, and in the future He will be.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hebrews 11:6 says that "he who comes forward to God must believe that He is."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to this verse, God is, and we must believe that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is, but we are not and all things are not either.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the One who is, who was, and who is coming, God is the self-existing One and the ever-existing One, the One whose being depends on nothing apart from Himself and the One who exists eternally, having neither beginning nor ending.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before anything else came into existence, God was.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After so many things have passed out of existence, God will still be.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God was, God is, and God will be.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the self-existing One and ever-existing One, God is the reality of every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Gospel of John reveals that He is all we need: life, light, food, drink, the pasture, the way, and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, this title of God indicates not only that He exists eternally but also that, in a positive sense, He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you need life?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you want light?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you desire holiness?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God exists from eternity to eternity, and He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is necessary that we know God as the One who is, who was, and who is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Heaven and earth may pass away, but God is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are you discouraged by your weakness?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day your weaknesses will cease to exist, but God will still be.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not believe in anything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not believe either in your weakness or in your strength, for both your weakness and your strength will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, when they are gone, God will continue to be the One who is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Oh, we must believe in Him as the ever-existing One!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we know God as the One who is, who was, and who will be, we shall be greatly encouraged, especially during difficult times.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>26.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Alpha and the Omega</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is also the Alpha and the Omega Rev 1:8; 21:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The eternal and almighty God is the Alpha, the beginning for the origination, and the Omega, the ending for the completion of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the book of Genesis He was the Alpha, and in the book of Revelation He is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever He has originated He will complete.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Governmentally He continues His universal operation, which He originated from eternity and will bring to completion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The fact that God is the Alpha and the Omega indicates that He is the entire "alphabet" needed for composing the story of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is also the "letters" used in writing the history of our personal lives.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How meaningful it is that our God is the Alpha and the Omega!</S>
