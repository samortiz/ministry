<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 5:1-47</h1><p>The more we consider the signs in the Gospel of John, the more we realize that this book is a word spoken by the Lord concerning divine mysteries. I do not believe that the natural mentality is capable of writing such a book. In this message we shall begin to consider the signs in chapter five of John. In this chapter there are at least eleven signs.<h2 class=head1>A CONDENSATION OF THE UNIVERSAL STORY</h2><p>God’s economy is to gain a dwelling place for Himself by Christ and with Christ. Christ is both the means and the element used by God to produce His dwelling place for the carrying out of His divine economy. This is the unique story in the universe.<p>We truly praise God for the Bible. Next to the Triune God Himself, the most wonderful matter in the universe is the Bible. I believe that as we spend more time studying the Bible, we shall become fully convinced that no other book can compare with it. The Bible is the book. Only this book deserves to be called the book. No other book reveals things from eternity past to eternity future. Furthermore, only in the Bible can we see God’s economy, the unique story in this universe. The divine story, which is a mystery, is God’s economy to fulfill the desire of His heart to obtain a dwelling place for Himself by Christ as the means and with Christ as the element.<p>In order for Christ to be the means and the element for God’s dwelling place, He must be the tabernacle and the offerings. If we see this, eventually we shall realize that the tabernacle and all the offerings are the structure of this universal mystery. Therefore, we may say that the real contents of the Bible are the tabernacle and the offerings.<p>The sixty-six books of the Bible are, in a very real sense, condensed into one book, and this book is the Gospel of John. Therefore, in the Gospel of John we have the condensation of the universal story of God’s economy.<p>We should never regard John’s Gospel as shallow or elementary. The language of this Gospel may be simple, but its contents are profound. The more I study the writings of John, the more I realize how profound, deep, divine, wonderful, and mysterious they are.<p>In our Life-study of the Scriptures we have completed all the New Testament books with the exception of Mark, Luke, Acts, and James. The Recovery Version of each book contains an outline of the book. The best outline is that of the Gospel of John. Consider the portion of the outline of the Gospel of John that covers chapter five:	<ol class="decimal" start="4">	<li>The need of the impotent—life’s enlivening (5:1-47)		<ol class="lower-alpha">		<li>The inadequacy of religion’s law-keeping and the sufficiency of the Son’s life-giving (vv. 1-9)</li>		<li>Religion’s opposition to life (vv. 10-16)</li>		<li>The Son equal with the Father in giving life and executing judgment (vv. 17-30)</li>		<li>The Son’s fourfold testimony (vv. 31-47)			<ol class="none">			<li>(1) The testimony of John the Baptist (vv. 32-35)</li>			<li>(2) The testimony of the Son’s work (v. 36)</li>			<li>(3) The testimony of the Father (vv. 37-38)</li>			<li>(4) The testimony of the Scriptures (vv. 39-47)</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol><p>The language used in this section of the outline is quite simple. However, it is not easy to explain what the different terms in the outline mean because they point to matters in this chapter that are profound and mysterious.
