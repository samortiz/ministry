<h2 class="head1">LIFE IN THE DEPTHS</h2><p>Hosea 14:5-7 reads, "I will be like the dew to Israel;/He will bud like the lily/And will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon./His shoots will go forth;/And his splendor will be like that of the olive tree,/And his fragrance, like that of the trees of Lebanon./Those who sit under his shade will return;/They will revive like grain/And will bud like the vine;/His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon." In this passage, Lebanon is spoken of three times: once in relation to the lily, once in relation to the olive tree, and once in relation to the vine. Why is there such an emphasis on Lebanon? There is such an emphasis because the cedars on the mountain of Lebanon are very tall and the roots are very deep. The Bible uses the cedars of Lebanon to represent the tallest and biggest trees on earth; they also signify people who strike their roots deep. In this passage Lebanon is first spoken of with reference to the lily, then the olive tree, and finally the vine. For the Bible to speak in this way is profoundly significant. Let us briefly consider these verses.</p><p>Why is the lily linked to Lebanon? A lily is pure and beautiful. The lily that is referred to grows in the wilderness, not in a house garden. No gardener cultivates this lily; it depends solely upon sunshine, rain, and dew for sustenance. Christians are lilies of the valleys (S.S. 2:1); we rely entirely upon God's cultivation and maintenance. A pure and beautiful spiritual life is derived from uninterrupted fellowship with God. Hence, "he will bud like the lily/And will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon."</p><p>Why is the olive tree linked to Lebanon? In the eyes of man, an olive tree has no splendor at all. If we said that something has splendor like a peony plant, it would be easy to understand. But to compare splendor to an olive tree does not sound very appropriate. However, the Bible shows us that splendor to God is not a superficial splendor but genuine fruit. The olive tree bears oil-yielding drupe&mdash;its splendor is in its fruit. The splendor of a Christian is in the bearing of the fruit of the Spirit. This can be achieved only by going inward and striking roots in the depths. Therefore, his splendor is said to be as the olive tree and his fragrance as Lebanon.</p><p>Why is the vine linked to Lebanon? The verse says, "They will...bud like the vine." Have we ever seen the budding of a vine? Vine blossoms are tiny! Very soon after budding, the buds are turned into grapes. We never see vine blossoms in a flower vase. Why does the verse not say that the budding is like that of the peach tree or the chrysanthemum? This is because the budding which God honors is not something for man's appreciation but something that bears fruit like the vine. God requires a Christian to strike roots and bear fruit abundantly. That is why the verse says that they shall bud like the vine and their renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.</p><p>Lebanon is referred to three times&mdash;all for the purpose of drawing attention to a life in the depths. Although this life in the depths is a secluded life (like the lily in the valley), a life that is outwardly unattractive (like the olive tree), and a life that is not prominent (like the budding vine), it looks to God in simplicity and is capable of bearing much fruit. This is the kind of life a Christian should have. Yet it is impossible to have this kind of life unless one strikes deep roots; there has to be a regular daily exercise. We must set aside a little time every day to pray and study God's Word&mdash;reading and praying simultaneously in the presence of God. If possible, we should also appropriate some time to pray for the saints, the churches, and God's work. If a Christian does not read the Bible or pray every morning, he simply does not have any life in the depths. To strike roots is not a matter of words but is an actual practice in our daily life. At the beginning of this practice, one has to pay a price. May God's love attract and lead us into the depths day after day so that our roots may go down deeper and deeper.</p><p>In order to live a life in the depths, it is necessary to have direct and intimate fellowship with the Lord. Song of Songs 4:12 says, "A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse;/a spring shut up, a fountain sealed." What is spoken of here is a garden. According to the Bible, a garden is God's very first thought. A garden is not an ordinary plot of land; it is not for general- purpose planting. Neither is it a field, which is specifically for tillage. A garden exists solely for the purpose of beauty and enjoyment. In a garden there may be trees, but their purpose is not for wood. There may be fruit trees, but their purpose is not for fruit bearing. The importance of a garden is in its flowers. They are planted only for their beauty. Flowers are for the pleasure of the eyes. The description of the garden as "inclosed" means that it is not a public park which everybody has access to for enjoyment. Rather, it is inclosed exclusively for Christ. The inward beauty is to be seen and appreciated by Christ alone. This kind of life is not one that pleases men but one that only pleases Christ.</p><p>This life is "a spring shut up." The word "spring" can be translated "well." A well is for man's use. Although this well is for man's use, it is still under the restriction of the Lord. This life is also "a fountain sealed." A well is produced artificially, but a fountain is not. A well is for man, but a fountain is for God. A fountain stands for the joy and contentment we acquire before God. We cannot consciously divulge our experience to men, because it is a sealed fountain. A Christian should not consciously exhibit his beauty, pursuit, and spiritual experience to others. Everything should be silently sealed up for the Lord. Only this kind of life in the depths will satisfy the Lord's heart.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, our life is often too shallow, and a large portion of it is exposed on the surface. May the Lord grant us grace and do a deeper work in us through the cross so that we may strike roots and have a life in the depths to fulfill God's requirements and satisfy His heart.</p>
