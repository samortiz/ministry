<h2 class=head2>B. Not Discouraged</h2><p>Sometimes you may be discouraged by the condition of the church, or because the condition of the church does not match the heavenly vision. Some may say that after having been in the church life for ten years they still have not seen the fulfillment of God’s purpose, as revealed in the Bible. We should tell them that heaven and earth will pass away, but His Word will not pass away until everything is fulfilled (Matt. 24:35). God is building the masterpiece of the universe. It is less difficult to create the physical heaven and earth than it is to build the church. It requires more love, wisdom, time, and energy to build the church. The material He uses to build the church comes from the heap of collapse. All were evil sinners, full of filth and corruption. God needs to redeem man then transform him into the right material for His building. It takes time. This age, and most importantly, our life-time is for this work. Therefore, we should not lose heart because we have the New Testament ministry to encourage and supply us for the building up of the church (2 Cor. 4:1). <h2 class=head2>C. Always Pursuing the Goal</h2><p>We must focus our attention on the goal—Christ and the church. Paul said in Philippians 3:13 that he forgot the things which are behind and stretched forward to the things which are before, that is, he pursued toward the goal—Christ and the church. We must have the same attitude as Paul. Do not say, “I am not like my brother Paul.’’ Paul said that he is a pattern for the believers to imitate (2 Thes. 3:9). We all should imitate him because he is an imitator of Christ (1 Cor. 11:1). Therefore, young brothers and sisters, set your whole heart, whole mind, and whole soul to love the Lord Jesus for the building up of His church. Pray like this, “Lord, You gave Yourself to me and to the church. You chose me, redeemed me, regenerated me, and baptized me into Your Body. Lord, I want to give my whole being, all that I am, have, and can do to You. I consecrate my whole life, my whole future to build up Your church. All that You have is mine, and all that I have is Yours. Your will becomes my will, and My will is Your will. Lord, build up the church through the saints and through me.’’<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Use the Bible to write a prophecy regarding our entrance into the church.</li><li>We have seen in this lesson that it is possible to be disobedient to the heavenly vision—but is it possible to leave the church? Explain.</li><li>What role did the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—have in our entrance into the Church?</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Further References</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Body of Christ (Lee/LSM), pp. 19-24.</li><li>The One New Man (Lee/LSM), pp. 47-61.</li><li>Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of the Divine Trinity (Lee/LSM), pp. 39-45.</li></ol>
