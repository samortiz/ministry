   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Christ as the Embodiment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Triune God Being the Fulfillment</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Types of the Tabernacle and the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 is the fulfillment of the types of the tabernacle and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This fulfillment commenced in His incarnation John 1:14; 2:21 and will consummate in the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament, from Matthew 1 through Revelation 22, covers the entire span of the incarnation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This incarnation, which commenced in Matthew 1, will continue until it consummates in the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament, therefore, is simply a record of the divine incarnation, which commenced at the birth of Christ and which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the first chapter of the New Testament we have the individual Christ, but in the last chapter we have the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that the individual Christ is the beginning of the incarnation of the Triune God and that the corporate Christ, the New Jerusalem, will be the conclusion and consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We praise the Lord that we have been blessed to be involved with the incarnation of the Triune God by being made a part of the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to see this, to be in this, and to minister this to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE MAIN CONSUMMATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OF THE INCARNATED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regarding the incarnated Triune God, there are two main consummations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A. The First Altar</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first consummation is the first altar the bronze altar for the offering of all the sacrifices Christ in His crucifixion to solve all the problems of man before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning this, Psalm 84:3 says, "Even the sparrow has found a home;/ And the swallow, a nest for herself,/Where she may lay her young:/Your altars, O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we all are "swallows" who have suffered from storms, wind, rain, snow, and the burning sun and who need a nest, a refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our refuge is the first altar, which signifies the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the cross of Christ we are saved, and here we have our nest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, our nest is the cross of Christ itself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this nest we may lay our young, that is, produce new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. The Second Altar</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second altar is the golden altar of incense Christ in His ascension for God's acceptance of the redeemed sinners v. 3 . When we experience Christ in His ascension, we have a place of rest, and we sense that we are at home.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the first altar we have a nest, and at the second altar we have a resting place in the house of God.</S>
