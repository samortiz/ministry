   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOR THE NOURISHING AND CHERISHING OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition to being cleansed, we also need to be nourished and cherished.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our body must receive nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ordinary way to nourish our body is for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To eat is to receive outward nourishment into our body so that it becomes our inner elements.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The nourishing in Ephesians 5 is this kind of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our body needs this kind of nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It also needs to be cherished, to be kept warm.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you ask doctors, they will tell you that for most illnesses the body needs to be kept warm.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are not kept warm, you become cold and stiff, and you may even die.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Greek word for cherish is difficult to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It means, on the one hand, to warm, and on the other hand, to soften.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we are cold, we become stiff and hard, and when a person dies, his body becomes stiff and cold.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If any kind of hardness develops in any part of your body, that is bad because it might be a tumor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the body to stay healthy, it must be nourished, and kept warm and soft.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have a boil, that spot can become hard and cold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The lessons of the cross may cause people to become cold, and the breaking may cause them to become hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more breakings they experience, the more they become hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because you do not have any sores or boils on your body, your body is soft all over.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose, however, you are cut with a knife.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After half an hour, both sides of the cut will become hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Being broken, receiving the cross, and enduring sufferings cannot keep us warm and soft.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, what is really beneficial to our body is that which can warm and soften it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is all right for our body to sweat, because we sweat when we are warm.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, do not expose yourself to coldness or you may catch a cold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to protect your body, it is better to keep it warm rather than to let it get cold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we need to see these principles of life from the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When brothers or sisters live together, they should not make their homes seem like funeral homes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the corpses in the funeral homes are stiff.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When people visit a brothers' house, they should be able to sense the warmth there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They should be able to sense that everyone there is softened.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I come to visit your sisters' house, and when I step inside, the atmosphere is cold, everyone's face has an icy look, and nobody dares to say a word, then something is seriously wrong there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I come to the brothers' or sisters' house, and the moment I enter, I can feel the warmth there, and if every one of you is soft when I speak with you, then I will know that the spiritual condition there is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Greek, the meaning of nourishing and cherishing implies feeding the body so that it is always kept warm and soft.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not be like a corpse and become cold and rigid.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose a person who has been sick for a long time is about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you touch his feet, you will feel that they are cold.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After ten minutes the legs will be cold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After another ten minutes the coldness will reach his knees, and fifteen minutes later the coldness will reach his thighs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that stage you know that he is about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As soon as a person dies, their whole body becomes cold.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some brothers and sisters have received the kind of "help" that makes them cold, then makes them hard, and finally causes them to became a stiff corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the Lord have mercy on us and deliver us out of all these situations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The entire church life and all the church meetings should be in a nourishing and cherishing situation.</S>
