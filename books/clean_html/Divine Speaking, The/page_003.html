<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE SPEAKING IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>What the Bible reveals concerning the divine speaking in the old creation is firstly seen in Genesis chapter one. The Bible tells us clearly that the old creation was created by God&rsquo;s speaking. Genesis 1:3 says, &ldquo;And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.&rdquo; This was done by speaking. For this reason Hebrews 11:3 tells us, &ldquo;By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;And God said, Let there be a firmament...and it was so....And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together... and it was so&rdquo; (Gen. 1:6, 7, 9). Psalm 33:9 says that when God spoke, it was done. When God spoke, that was it! God did not use any gimmicks, any messages, any channels to create the universe. God created the universe only by speaking! He spoke and it was.</p>
<p>Following this, in the Old Testament for quite a long time, there is not much record of God&rsquo;s speaking. Of course, He spoke to Noah, but not so much. Then He spoke to Abraham, but even to Abraham He did not speak so much. But when Moses came, he became the top speaker of God. God used him to speak. We all know that the first five books, the Pentateuch, were written by Moses. The law, the ordinances, the regulations, and all those types were all written by him. In other words, these were spoken by Moses and through Moses. Numbers 11 records that the responsibility among God&rsquo;s people was too heavy for Moses alone. At that time, God took the Spirit, who was upon Moses, and put the Spirit upon the seventy elders (Num. 11:25). All the elders began to prophesy. At the same time, the Spirit rested upon two of them who remained in the camp. They also began to speak as prophets. When Moses&rsquo; attendant, Joshua, heard this, he reported to Moses and begged him, &ldquo;My lord Moses, forbid them.&rdquo; Moses replied, &ldquo;Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all Jehovah&rsquo;s people were prophets, and that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them&rdquo; (Num. 11:28-29). That indicated that God&rsquo;s desire was to make all His people prophets. That was in the old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE SPEAKING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Now we come to God&rsquo;s speaking in the new creation. How was the new creation made? It was made by speaking. First, the entire God was the Word. This means that the entire God was a speaking. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). This Word became incarnated to be a man, and that man was just God&rsquo;s speaking. The man Jesus was God&rsquo;s Word. In other words, He was God&rsquo;s speaking. He told us that He was one with the Father; He was in the Father and the Father was in Him; and the word He spoke was God&rsquo;s working in Him (John 14:10). Then He said, &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him Who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgement, but has passed out of death into life&rdquo; (John 5:24). This is the new creation brought into being by speaking.</p>
<p>Before the day of Pentecost came, the Lord Jesus told His disciples, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses&rdquo; (Acts 1:8). This means, &ldquo;You shall be My speaking people to speak for Me.&rdquo; We all know what a witness is. A witness is a speaking person, one who testifies by speaking. Then the day of Pentecost came. What happened at that time? Tongues of fire came down. We all know that tongues are for speaking. On the day of Pentecost tongues came upon all the believers, and they began to speak. It is no wonder that right away after the day of Pentecost, three thousand, and then five thousand, all met in their homes, speaking, preaching, and teaching. Everyone spoke. They did not need to worry about their home meeting, whether they would have speakers or not. Everyone spoke. Everyone witnessed. Everyone preached. Everyone taught. Everyone!</p>
<p>Then Acts says, &ldquo;The word of God grew and multiplied.&rdquo; The same kind of phrase is repeated in Acts three times (6:7; 12:24; 19:20). How did the word of God grow? It was by speaking! In Jerusalem when the great persecution came, all the three thousand and five thousand were scattered. Only the apostles were left there in Jerusalem. The scattered ones went out to preach the word, to speak the word by the way of preaching! They all went out to speak, to speak, to speak, to every village. When the eunuch from Ethiopia was riding in a chariot, Philip was told to speak to him. This was an example of speaking. It was not in congregations nor in arranged meetings. Rather, everywhere they just spoke.</p>
<p>Eventually, Paul said nearly the same thing as Moses did. Moses said, &ldquo;Would God that all Jehovah&rsquo;s people were prophets, and that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them&rdquo; (Num. 11:29). Likewise, Paul said, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:31). It is a poor situation that most of the Christian people today understand the word &ldquo;prophesy&rdquo; to mean to predict. But when Moses used the Hebrew word for &ldquo;prophesy,&rdquo; his intention was not to indicate &ldquo;to predict.&rdquo; Even he himself did not predict much! In all his five books how many predictions are there? Very few. But his writing, that is his speaking, was altogether the speaking forth of God. He was speaking for God and he was speaking God! He predicted little. It was the same with Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. Their books actually contain very few predictions, but rather are full of speaking forth God, speaking for God, and speaking God directly. This was the Old Testament prophecy: not much prediction, but full of speaking forth of God, speaking for God, and speaking God directly. It is the same way with the Greek word in the New Testament. Prophecy in New Testament Greek means a kind of speaking of God. You speak God forth, you speak Christ out, you speak Christ to people, you speak for Christ. This is prophecy. To prophesy is mainly to speak for Christ, to speak Christ forth, to speak Christ out. To prophesy is to speak God, to speak Christ, to speak the divine interest, to speak the things concerning Christ and God, and to speak forth, speak out, and speak for God.</p>
<p>We all need to practice prophesying every day from morning to evening. We need to practice this kind of speaking for Christ, this kind of speaking forth of Christ, and this kind of speaking out Christ, speaking Christ all the day long. &ldquo;This is my story, this is my song, speaking my Savior all the day long!&rdquo; When we are accustomed to speaking, we come to the meeting and just speak. We have a lot of things to speak concerning Christ. Then spontaneously we will have home meetings that are enlivened, enriched, strengthened, and refreshing. They will be made new, attractive, and attracting. They will be full of power and strength to hold people.</p>
<p>Let us all come to the meeting to revolutionize the meeting by speaking! Speaking spontaneously. Speaking Christ. Speaking for Christ. Speaking forth Christ. Speaking out Christ. Speaking Christ to everybody. If when you come to a home meeting, you see that no one is there, you can still speak. Speak Christ to the books! &ldquo;Books, let me tell you, you don&rsquo;t have a spirit, but I do. You cannot take Christ, but I can! You cannot receive Christ, but I can! You cannot enjoy Christ, but I can! You know, books, I have enjoyed Christ the whole day today!&rdquo; No one has come in yet, but the meeting starts with just you yourself. Such a speaking will revolutionize the meeting.</p>
<p>The psalmist in Psalm 19 says, &ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament sheweth his handiwork.&rdquo; Even the heavens speak! Why do we not speak? We have been created, regenerated, and made His witnesses. We are His witnesses. We have to speak! Do not talk about anything else. Just talk about Christ. Do not talk about the weather. Speak, speak, all the time speak Christ. Then you will be a prophet. So Paul says, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:31). You all can! So we all have to learn how to revolutionize our meetings by speaking.</p>
<p>God created the old creation by speaking, and that creation was carried on by God&rsquo;s people speaking God. Moses was a typical example. He desired that all God&rsquo;s people would be such speakers, prophets speaking God, to carry on the old creation. Then the new creation was created, again by God&rsquo;s word. We all have been made witnesses to speak for God. Paul says that you all can be a speaking one, a prophet speaking God, speaking forth God, speaking for God. You all can do this one by one. This is God&rsquo;s word! So, dear saints, if we are going to promote and build up the home meetings, there is no other way but by speaking.</p>
