   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING FOR THE LORD IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all are able to speak for the Lord in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You should not think that a certain brother who has much experience in the Lord and much knowledge of the Word is able to speak, but you are not able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although you may not have as many spiritual riches as this brother, you still have something.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You at least have some amount of spiritual riches and you need to spend what you have by speaking forth the Lord in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fact that we speak freely outside the meetings is a strong indication that we are also able to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, a brother may be silent in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then after the meeting, perhaps on the way home, he may speak freely and boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to realize that we all are able to speak in the Spirit in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all are able to utter at least a simple word for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>An experience I had in a meeting of the church in Los Angeles in 1968 illustrates the fact that all believers can speak in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On a certain Lord s Day morning I had the deep feeling that I should stand up and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I stood up, but I did not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, I told the saints that we all can prophesy, that we all can speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I went on to say that at least we all can speak four words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At this point I said to myself, What four words?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What words will you encourage the saints to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then I went on to say, We all can speak these four words: O Lord amen hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the meeting, I began to consider what I had said.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At first I thought that I had been mistaken regarding the sequence of these four words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I said to myself, You spoke these words in the wrong sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of saying, O Lord, amen, hallelujah, you should have said, O Lord, hallelujah, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But as I considered the matter further according to the Scriptures, I realized that Revelation 19:4 says, And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to this verse, amen comes first, and hallelujah follows.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was confirmed that the sequence in which I had spoken these four words was correct.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I believe that I was led by the Spirit to point out to the saints that we all can say, O Lord, amen, hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The words O Lord, amen, hallelujah! can be uttered in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may speak them strongly and loudly, or we may utter them slowly and quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Surely all the saints, from the youngest to the oldest, can speak these four words, especially in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more the saints speak something for the Lord in the church meetings, the more living the meetings will be.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would be helpful if we all practiced speaking for the Lord in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even at home we can say, O Lord, amen, hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Would it not be wonderful if a sister would say, O Lord, the husband replied, Amen, and the children responded, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of speaking would help to produce a heavenly family life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the church meetings all the saints, especially the young ones and the new ones, can speak for the Lord in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, a new believer may stand up and say, Jesus the Lord is so precious to me!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every time I say, Lord Jesus, my heart is filled with His sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After this, another young one may rise up and say, I want to testify to you all that the name of Jesus is so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How excellent the meetings would be if they were filled with such speaking!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A SPEAKING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A genuine and typical Christian is a speaking Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christians are a speaking people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if we do not speak, we shall not look like real Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christians are those who have been made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once we were dead, but now we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who are dead do not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All those buried in a cemetery are silent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not be dead, dumb believers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, because we are living, we should demonstrate that we are living by speaking for the Lord in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose as an experiment you tried to refrain from speaking for twenty-four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I believe that you would find this extremely difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because we are living persons, we have the desire to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why, then, are certain ones silent in the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since we are living, we should speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have pointed out that the worshippers of the living God should not be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, we need to speak forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This kind of speaking is related to the exercise of the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Speaking the Lord Jesus is the main function of the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The purpose of our speaking in the meetings is to speak concerning the Lord.</S>
