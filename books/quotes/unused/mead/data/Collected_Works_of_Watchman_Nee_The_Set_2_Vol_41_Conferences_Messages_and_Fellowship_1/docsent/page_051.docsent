   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE MANIFESTATIONS AND EVIDENCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Date: November 19, 1935, morning</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Chuenchow THE EXPERIENCE AT PENTECOST NOT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A LITERAL FULFILLMENT OF THE PROPHECY IN JOEL</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The experience at Pentecost recorded in Acts was not a literal fulfillment of the prophecy in the book of Joel; it was only an event that was similar to Joel's prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were no prophecies, visions, or dreams at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were only the sound from heaven as of a rushing violent wind and tongues as of fire 2:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only manifestation in the disciples was speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yet there is no mention of speaking in tongues in the prophecy in Joel This proves that Pentecost was not a fulfillment of the words of Joel; it only pointed to similar incidents.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One powerful Pentecostal speaker claims that a man must speak in tongues as a proof that he has received the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we know from Peter's word that the experience of Pentecost was only that which was spoken through the prophet Joel Peter said, "This is what is spoken..."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not say, "This is a fulfillment of what was spoken..."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a big difference between these two.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A fulfillment is a literal realization, whereas "this is what is" merely refers to similar instances.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many people think that the outpouring of the Spirit was a fulfillment of Joel's word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually Joel did not mention speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people today exercise their jaws in a certain way in an attempt to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They also try to have dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, this is not what Peter meant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said that when the Spirit came, the people saw something that was similar to what Joel prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we do not need to imitate the manifestations of the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Recently while I was in Shen-yang, Shanghai, Chefoo, and Chuenchow, I observed many different manifestations of the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Chefoo some laughed continuously, while others cried.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some felt power or other things coming upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to realize that all these manifestations are under the category of what Peter described as "this is what is."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are not the fulfillment of Joel's words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some felt they had received electrical jolts; others seemed to be enveloped by something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some jumped around, while others remained seated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There were all kinds of different sensations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These sensations happen naturally when the Spirit is poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter said, "This is what is."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When some receive the outpouring, they may cry or weep.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I have not received the outpouring, and I seek for the outpouring, I may not experience the same manifestations as others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the meaning of "this is what is."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone has his own path to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot say that others are wrong just because they have experienced something different than what we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a man has received the Spirit, and he can say, "Jesus is Lord," it does not matter what his outward manifestations are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These manifestations are God's business, not our business.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Peter said, "This is what is," and we should also say, "This is what is."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not imitate others or force others to have manifestations that are the same as ours.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>PURSUING THE OUTPOURING,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>YET NOT NEGLECTING TO TEST</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While we are seeking for the outpouring of the Spirit, we should test whether or not the Spirit that is upon us is of God 1 John 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to continually cooperate with the Holy Spirit and not allow our mind to become idle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not imitate others, and our will should never be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not try to take too much control; neither should we be out of control.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Evil spirits can counterfeit the Holy Spirit and give men supernatural feelings and experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to test whether what we have received is of the Holy Spirit or of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to distinguish between the work of the Holy Spirit and that of the evil spirits, we must first know the difference between the principle of the work of the Holy Spirit and that of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Holy Spirit wants man to cooperate with Him in an active way, while evil spirits only want man to yield to their works in a passive way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, in pursuing after the outpouring of the Spirit, we must not allow our minds to become idle or our wills to become passive.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Evil spirits are very pleased with a passive attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even a desire to imitate the experiences of others will give evil spirits a chance to work on us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must practice these things in a definite way and cooperate with the Holy Spirit in an active way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In all of these things, we have to exercise the utmost care or else we will be deceived because it is possible for any one of us to be cheated.</S>
