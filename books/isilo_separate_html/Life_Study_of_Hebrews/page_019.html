The High Priest</h2><p>While Christ is fighting as our Captain, He is also ministering as our High Priest. Do not be troubled. On the one hand, He is the fighting Captain; on the other hand, He is a ministering High Priest. He ministers whatever you need. Therefore, there is no reason to lack anything. Christ will minister to you.</p><p>After Abraham had fought against the enemy and released Lot, Melchisedec, the High Priest, came to him ministering the bread and wine (Gen. 14:14-20). As we continue on in Hebrews, we shall see that our Jesus is Melchisedec. In order to enjoy the ministry of Melchisedec, you must fight. Only when you fight will He come to you and minister to you. If you do not fight, do not expect Christ to come to you as Melchisedec ministering the bread and wine. However, if you are willing to fight, I can assure you that after every bit of fighting Christ will come to you as the ministering Melchisedec and you will enjoy His supply of bread and wine. This is wonderful. It is another factor that makes our salvation so great.</p><p>The &ldquo;so great a salvation&rdquo; not only has a Redeemer and a Savior but also a Captain fighting for us and a High Priest ministering to us. Be encouraged. If you do not fight, you will be defeated and have no bread and wine to feed on. However, if you fight, you will not only gain the victory but will also receive the bread and wine. Hallelujah for so great a salvation! It is great in what Christ is.</p><h2 class="head1">II. GREAT IN WHAT CHRIST HAS DONE,<br />IS DOING, AND WILL DO</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Having Made Purification of Sins</h2><p>What has Christ done? He has made purification of sins (1:3). Be at peace. Your sin has been purified. Although you must hate your sins, you need not be bothered by them. Christ has purified our sins once for all (7:27).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Having Tasted Death for Us</h2><p>Christ has tasted death for us (2:9). Since He has tasted death, death has been abolished (2 Tim. 1:10). Death has been terminated. Do not believe in death. Deny it. Do you have death in your church? Deny it. Do you have an illness in your physical body indicating the presence of death? Do not believe it, and do not accept it. It is a lie.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Having Destroyed Satan by Partaking<br />of Our Nature<br />to Release Us from Slavery</h2><p>Christ has destroyed Satan. He partook of our nature in order to destroy the devil who has the might of death (2:14-15). He has done this on the cross. Satan is finished. Whenever Satan comes, you should say, &ldquo;Satan, you have come to the wrong place. Don&rsquo;t you know that you have been destroyed? Who released you? Go back to your place.&rdquo; The best way to defeat Satan is to shame him. Say, &ldquo;Satan, don&rsquo;t you know that you have been defeated? You have been destroyed. Go back, and keep your position.&rdquo; Satan will go. By partaking of our nature and destroying Satan, Christ has released us from slavery. Death has been abolished, Satan, who holds the power of death, has been destroyed, and we have been released from slavery.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Sanctifying Us</h2><p>Christ is now sanctifying us (2:11). He is the Sanctifier and we are the sanctified. He is sanctifying us day by day (1 Thes. 5:23-24). We shall be under His sanctifying work continually until we are fully transformed to His image (2 Cor. 3:18).</p><h2 class="head2">E. Being Able to Help Us</h2><p>Christ is able to help us (2:18). He is able to help us to the uttermost. Do not listen to the lies. Do not listen to your environment, weakness, situation, or your husband or wife. Your wife or husband may be a little liar. Your sickness, weakness, and environment may also be lies. Do not believe the lie. The leading brothers should never listen to lies. Often the brothers and sisters are used by the enemy to lie to the leading brothers. For example, someone may say, &ldquo;The church meeting is getting very low.&rdquo; When someone says this, there is no need to argue with him. Just close your eyes and say, &ldquo;This is a lie. Get away. I believe that the church is living and set on high.&rdquo; This is faith. Try it and see. Sisters, if you say that your husband is no good, I can assure you that he will be no good simply because you have prophesied in such a way. You must cross the river. Do not believe that your husband is no good, but rather say, &ldquo;My husband is the best one among all men.&rdquo; If you say this, the Lord will come in to honor your prophecy and make your husband the best one. He is able to help us in all things. He is able to succor us in any kind of situation.</p><p>What Christ has done in the past, is doing in the present, and will do in the future are all included in the &ldquo;so great a salvation&rdquo; and all are factors that make His salvation &ldquo;so great.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
