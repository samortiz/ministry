   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 6 of 2 Corinthians 3 says, "The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life," and verse 17 says, "Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we put these verses together, we see that the Lord is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is no bondage, no deadness, no entanglement of letters and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the life-giving Spirit is within me, I am free from the law, from knowledge, from bondage, from regulations, and from all dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hallelujah, I have the living One within me!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TRANSFORMED BY THE LORD SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>. If we, like mirrors, behold and reflect the Lord without having any veils on our faces, we shall be transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that the life-giving Spirit is now doing a transforming work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our God is the Spirit for us to breathe in and to drink of, and our Triune God issues in the Spirit as the flow, the fellowship, the transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Also our Redeemer is the life-giving Spirit within us, imparting Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we open to Him, gaze on Him, behold Him, and reflect Him, we are under the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that all that He is, now is being transfused into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By being transfused with all that He is, we shall have a complete transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We shall be transformed into His image from one stage of glory to another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, we shall all be the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This does not take place by means of teaching or doctrine, but by means of Him as the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Lord Spirit is in us right now.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To this point we have seen three aspects of the Spirit: that our God today is Spirit, that the Triune God issues in the Spirit as the flow, and that Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, has become the life-giving Spirit within us to transform us by imparting Himself into us as the transforming element.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not think that you are so familiar with all these verses about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You need to consider your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not care whether or not you know these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am burdened to fellowship with you to bring you into the real experience of these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is Spirit, the Triune God issues in the Spirit, and the Redeemer today is the life- giving Spirit, transmitting Himself into our being that we may be transformed into His image to be exactly the same as He.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the Spirit we must experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>EXPERIENCING THE WORD AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we must proceed to see another aspect of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only is God the Spirit, not only is the issue of the Triune God the Spirit, and not only has the Redeemer become the life-giving Spirit, but the words the Lord Jesus speaks are also Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 6:63 says, "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Years ago I could not understand how the word could be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually I learned that the word of God is Spirit because it is God's breath.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second Timothy 3:16 says, "All scripture is God-breathed" Gk.</S>
