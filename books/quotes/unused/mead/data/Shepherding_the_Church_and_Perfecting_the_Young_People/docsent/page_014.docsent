   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CHANGING THE CONCEPT IN OUR SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TEACHING AND PERFECTING OTHERS STUDYING THE FACTORS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THAT HINDER THE INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we want to study the factors that have hindered our increase.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the beginning of the work in Taiwan there was a rapid increase in numbers, but after a period of time we seemed to have come to a stop, and no matter what we did, there was not much increase.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Doing Things Ourselves and</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Being Unable to Teach Others</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After spending time with the Lord and analyzing our situation, we are clearer concerning our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A primary problem has been that the co-workers do things themselves and have not been able to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose three brothers go to a new locality to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since they have a heart for the Lord, new ones are gained.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the co-workers teach these new ones, raise them up, perfect them, and bring them into the service, the co-workers will gain some apprentices.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is regrettable, however, that we have neither learned to bring the saints into the service nor learned to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, we do everything by ourselves and thus unconsciously replace the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, the saints do not know how to function, and the responsible ones do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The scope of what two or three people can do is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, if we cannot teach and lead others, the work will come to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the Lord will have to lead the co-workers to another place where there are no saints, where the work has not reached.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The co-workers can then gain new believers and labor until the work again comes to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time, they will have to move to yet another place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the co-workers do not move to a new location, there will be no possibility for increase, because the co-workers always work by themselves and do not bring others into function.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person can do only a limited amount of work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the other saints can also do a limited amount of work, it will be difficult for them if their function is not manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we continue in this way, there is no way for the church in a locality to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since we do not teach the new ones how to bring others into function, they will repeat our pattern of doing everything by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After a period of time any work in their hands will also come to a standstill, and the church will not spread.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not Teaching Others and</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not Coordinating with Others</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we cannot bring others into the things that we do, we cannot teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we cannot teach others, we cannot coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These are the two main factors that frustrate the spread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our inability to coordinate with others is not related to being at odds with them; rather, it is the consequence of not having a disposition and habit to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is wrong to think that we can do everything and that we have no need of others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the work assigns a second co-worker to serve in a local church, but the first co-worker still does all the work, the second co-worker will not be able to enter into the work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This deficiency is not the result of unwillingness on the part of the new co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nor is it related to any resentment toward the first co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, it is because the first co-worker cannot coordinate with another person; hence, the two cannot work together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this case, each co-worker is a separate cord, and they cannot be twined into a twofold cord, much less a threefold cord Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This limits the increase in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is an example of not being able to teach others, not being able to work with others, and not being able to coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As co-workers, we should be able to teach others and also to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A co-worker serving in a local church should be able to serve and also to teach others to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A skillful carpenter can produce something useful out of any type of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Similarly, a co-worker should be able to use any saint, no matter what their situation is in life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the same time, he should be able to work with many other co-workers without any conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In his coordination with others, everyone should be able to function according to their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the Lord can open our eyes to see this matter and to have a fundamental turn, it will not be difficult for the churches to increase twofold in two years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, if we cannot turn, we will not increase.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We will only maintain the status quo because we will limit the work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, we must have a radical and thorough turn.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must be able to teach others and coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whether or not we are capable, we must coordinate with others and serve together with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If some are not capable, we need to learn how to teach the saints and coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are capable, there is an even greater need to teach others and coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The co-workers who are limited in capacity should not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They should never give up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The co-workers who have some capacity must not look down on others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even the most capable co-worker cannot bear up the entire work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Regardless of how capable a person is, he is unable to bear a church or even a district.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to uphold a church, we must coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the co-workers must change their concept and realize that everyone has some capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The co-workers who think that they are incapable must endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If they cannot teach the saints, they should follow and learn from other co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who are capable should teach the saints instead of doing the work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The co-workers should also perfect the saints, regardless of the saints ability.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is better for the saints to make mistakes than for them to be idle.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this way everyone will be given an opportunity to serve, and we will learn more.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We learn when we do things, but we learn more when we teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do not teach others, our learning is incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we teach others, we are forced to consider things thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may think that we know how to arrange the chairs, but it is not easy to teach another person to arrange the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Teaching requires skill.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We may be able to do something but be unable to teach another person to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we are able to do something and are also able to teach others, we will be truly skilled.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Teaching others will also cause us to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we have a strong personality or are peculiar, we will be dealt with when we teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is difficult to successfully teach others without being dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must never say that a saint cannot be taught because he has no capacity.</S>
