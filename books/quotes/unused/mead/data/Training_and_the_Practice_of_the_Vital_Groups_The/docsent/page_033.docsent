   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SEVEN THE NEED IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY TODAY TO BUILD UP THE HABIT OF CONTACTING PEOPLE Scripture Reading: John 21:15-17; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 5:1-2; S. S. 1:8 THE NEED FOR SHEPHERDS IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to build up a habit of contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Song of Songs 1:8 the Lord said to His follower, "Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse indicates that we have to run after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While we are running, we have to take care of some younger ones, who are our kids.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are to bring them to the tents where the shepherds are and where the people of God meet with the Chief Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Gospel of John, which is a Gospel on life, also speaks of the need of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By the end of chapter twenty, the Gospel of John is actually concluded, yet there is still one more chapter as an appendix, chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The main thing in this appendix is the Lord Jesus spending time to shepherd Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter suffered a big defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only a short time before John 21, he was boasting by telling the Lord, "Lord, everyone may reject You, but I will not.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I will follow You to the end."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the Lord told him, "Truly I say to you that in this night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times" Matt 26:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter responded, "Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You" v. 35 . No doubt, by that time Peter did not believe that he could ever deny the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After his terrible failure that night, he wept bitterly v. 75 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord Jesus resurrected, how could Peter face Him once again?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The days must have been difficult for Peter after he denied the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was taking the lead among the disciples throughout the three and a half years of the Lord's earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then he had a great failure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He even denied the Lord to a young servant girl vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>69-70 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord surely knew that Peter was down.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After his failure, he took the lead to go back to his old profession of fishing in order to make a living John 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord restored Peter, He reminded him of His desire to have a flock.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Peter 5:4 Peter called the Lord Jesus "the Chief Shepherd."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 13:20 says that Christ is the great Shepherd, and the Lord Himself told us in John 10:11 that He is the good Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, He is the Chief Shepherd, the great Shepherd, and the good Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Peter 2:25 tells us that this Chief Shepherd is the Shepherd of our souls.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our soul is our inner being, our real person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our Lord shepherds us mainly by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our real person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But do you think that the Lord Jesus by Himself can shepherd so many flocks of sheep?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the Chief Shepherd, He must have a flock of shepherds under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not just flocks of sheep but flocks of shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord asked Peter if he loved Him, he responded by saying, "Yes, Lord, You know that I love You" John 21:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the Lord asked him this the third time, Peter could only say, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You" v. 17 . After each of Peter's three responses, the Lord told him, "Feed My lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Shepherd My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Feed My sheep" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No doubt, this gave Peter a strong impression that he could never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was the reason that in his first Epistle he touched the matter of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He told us that Christ was the Chief Shepherd and that he was one of the many shepherds under the Chief Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He also told us that the Lord is the Shepherd of our soul, our real person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That was his experience when the Lord restored him in John 21.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some may think that the Lord Jesus went to the seashore in John 21 to help the disciples get some fish for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But Peter realized that this was not the Lord's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord's intention was to touch Peter, to shepherd his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time his soul was really suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His soul could not have been happy after denying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The disciples caught 153 fish v. 11 , but Peter did not care for that because of his failure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the Lord knew this, He shepherded Peter in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later, Peter said that he was one of the shepherds, and he exhorted his fellow elders to shepherd the flock of God 1 Pet 5:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now I would like us to consider what the church needs today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The biggest lack, the biggest shortage, is in the eldership, because the elders should be the shepherds among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because there are no elders, most of the sheep in the Lord's flock are wanderers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Millions of Christians are wandering in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Who is taking care of them?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They do not have any shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if there are some shepherds, they concentrate mostly on outward affairs; they do not shepherd people's souls.</S>
