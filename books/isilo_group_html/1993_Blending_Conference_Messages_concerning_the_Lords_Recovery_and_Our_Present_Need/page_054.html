Concerning Jesus' Work</H2><P>The testimony of the believers with the church by their living is concerning Jesus' work through His redeeming and life-releasing death (John 19:34; 12:24) and through His life-imparting and church-producing resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; 1 Pet. 1:3). It is also through His ascension to be made Lord, Christ, Ruler, and Savior (Acts 2:36; 5:31) to carry out His heavenly, church-building ministry (Heb. 8:1-2; Eph. 2:22). Finally, it is through His second coming to establish the eternal kingdom of God (Dan. 7:13-14; Rev. 11:15) and to reign in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 20:4, 6). All these are the details of Jesus' work. We should be the testimony of such a wonderful person in His work.</P><P>Our living should be a testimony concerning Jesus' person as the God-man, and concerning Jesus' life with two lives living together: the divine and the human. Our living should also be a testimony concerning Jesus' living a life of crucifixion in resurrection and concerning Jesus' work. We have to live a life to testify concerning Jesus. That means we have to live a life just like He did. He lived a life to testify concerning God. Now we live a life to testify concerning Jesus unto God. When we testify concerning Jesus, that means we testify concerning God. Thus, we are the continuation of Jesus. He and we are one great person testifying concerning God. With Him this testimony is subjective. With us this testimony is objective.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>1993 Blending Conference Messages concerning the Lord's Recovery and Our Present Need &nbsp; pg 54</div><br></body></html>
