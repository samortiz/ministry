   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO GROW AND BE TRANSFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we have emphasized the need for growth and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can we grow and be transformed?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The only way to grow and be transformed is to have the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Reality of the Divine Birth</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As believers in Christ, we all are those who have been reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all have experienced the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This birth is not merely a theological doctrine, and regeneration is more than a term.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regeneration is a spiritual fact, even a divine fact.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God, and the divine life are all real.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God entered into us to impart God s life, eternal life, into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In reality and in practicality, the divine life has been imparted to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not a doctrinal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Something divinely real and practical has been imparted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the receiving of the divine life through regeneration were not a reality, then our believing in the Lord Jesus would be vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But believing in the Lord Jesus is not vanity; it is a marvelous reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through our believing in Him eternal life, the very life of God, has been imparted to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From the time of our regeneration, the life-imparting Spirit has been with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now this Spirit with the divine life abides in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever we contact our Lord, the Triune God, through the exercise of our spirit, the indwelling Spirit imparts more life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Contacting the Lord by Exercising Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From experience we have learned that we may contact the Lord by calling on His name and by proper prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times we have prayed improperly; that is, we have prayed only from our mind, neglecting our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who pray only with the mind may sometimes pray from memory and at other times may think about what they should pray before uttering anything in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to have a proper prayer, we need to pray by our spirit and from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we call on the name of the Lord and exercise to have proper prayer, our spirit is exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At such a time the switch is turned on, and the current of the divine life flows within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more this current flows, the more the divine life is added to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more this current flows, the more the divine life increases within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The increase of the divine life within us depends on our contacting the Lord by praying and calling upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the reason the New Testament tells us to pray without ceasing 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praying without ceasing can be compared to breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we want to stay alive, we must breathe all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter what we are doing, we need to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether we are awake or asleep, whether we are working or resting, we need to keep on breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A husband continues to breathe even when he is exchanging words with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It would be ridiculous for a husband to say, I m busy arguing with my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I don t have time to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to maintain our physical life, we must breathe all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The principle is the same with our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever we stop breathing, we experience spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To experience death in the spiritual sense is equal to switching off the current of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Just as a person dies when his blood stops circulating, so we experience spiritual death when the divine life stops circulating within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many Christians are dead, spiritually speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The current of the divine life does not flow within them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you know the reason so many Christians are spiritually dead, the reason they do not have the divine life flowing in them?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The reason is that they do not contact the Lord by praying and calling on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, when a brother and his wife are exchanging words, they are not contacting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, even when we are doing good things, the inner current of the divine life may stop flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to maintain the flowing of the divine life, we need to pray without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can we fulfill Paul s charge in 1 Thessalonians 5:17 to pray without ceasing?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Years ago, I tried to find a book that answered this question, but I could not find one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually, through experience with the Lord I discovered that to pray unceasingly is to exercise our spirit continually.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may use walking as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Walking is an exercise of our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we want to walk, we need to exercise our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In like manner, seeing is an exercise of the eyes, and hearing is an exercise of the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But what does it mean to exercise our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To exercise the spirit is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that whenever we exercise our spirit, we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As one example, I can testify that whenever I am giving a message, I am exercising my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Through this exercise of my spirit, I look to the Lord for His instant transfusion and utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not know from one moment to the next what kind of utterance I should use.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, while I am speaking, I am praying by exercising my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Praying does not necessarily mean that we utter something verbally.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No, to pray is to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we realize this, then we shall see that even at work we can exercise our spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible reveals clearly that the Spirit of God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because the divine Spirit is with our regenerated spirit, when we exercise our spirit, the Spirit of God flows within us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As this divine current flows, it brings the element, even the essence, of the divine life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way we receive more of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The result of the increase of the divine life within us is growth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Growth, therefore, is a matter of the continual increase of the divine life within us.</S>
