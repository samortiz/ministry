   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2 3 The birthright of the promised seed consists of the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Reuben, as the firstborn son of Jacob, should have inherited the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But because of his defilement he lost the birthright Gen 49:3-4; 1 Chron 5:1-2 .</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sarah, wanting to help God fulfill His promise, made a proposal to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sarah seemed to say, "Look, Abraham you are nearly ninety years of age!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And look at me I'm too old!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is impossible for me to bring forth a child.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jacob was a real heel-holder.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The meaning of the name Jacob is the heel-holder, the supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because God had already chosen Jacob, all his endeavors were in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jacob needed a vision.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ and to participate in Him as God's eternal blessing!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jacob's supplanting was not justified, but his seeking after the birthright surely was honored by God.</S>
