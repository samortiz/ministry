   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The King of Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This High Priest is of another order, not of the order of Aaron but of the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Melchisedec was a king, and his name means the king of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Isaiah 32:1 we see that the title, king of righteousness, also refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the King of righteousness, today s Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the King of righteousness, Christ has made all things right with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He has reconciled man to God and has appeased God for man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Righteousness issues in peace Isa 32:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By His righteousness Christ has brought forth the fruit of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. The King of Peace</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Melchisedec is also the king of Salem, which means the king of peace, signifying that Christ is also the King of peace Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the King of peace through righteousness, Christ has brought in peace between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In peace He fulfills the ministry of His priesthood, ministering God to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. From a Kingly Tribe</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Neither Aaron nor any of his descendants has ever been a king.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were just priests.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were not of the kingly tribe but of the priestly tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kingly tribe was the tribe of Judah, and the priestly tribe was the tribe of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ came out of the tribe of Judah 7:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So we should not rank Him with Aaron, for He does not belong to Aaron s tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is a kingly Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. Combining the Kingship Together</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>with the Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the High Priest, but His status is that of a king.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As He functions as a Priest, He is a King.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the King to be the Priest; so His priesthood is kingly, royal 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He combines the kingship together with the priesthood Zech 6:13 for God s building and for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ s kingship maintains a peaceful order through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This peaceful order is necessary for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The building of God s house is in a situation of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ s priesthood ministers all the supply needed for the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this His glory is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A priest who offers sacrifices for pitiful sinners does not need to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to have such a priest, you do not need a king of righteousness or a king of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But, in order for the High Priest to minister the processed God to a victorious fighter, He must be both the King of righteousness and the King of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you believe that before Melchisedec came to Abraham and ministered the processed God to him, God did not come to Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have already said that in the evening you need to spend some time with Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But this does not mean that during the morning and afternoon God does not come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Genesis 14:20 says, And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not think that Abraham was able to slaughter Chedorlaomer and the other kings by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not do it by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to Genesis 14:22, before Abraham went out to fight the battle, he lifted up his hand to the Most High God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that before he fought with the enemies, he contacted God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So it was not Abraham who slaughtered the enemies but God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Abraham lifted up his hand to God, the situation was without righteousness and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There was no righteousness because Lot and all of his things had been captured by the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There was no peace because the enemies had not been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But as Abraham went out to fight the battle, he trusted in God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After Abraham had slaughtered the enemies and Melchisedec had come to meet him, there was righteousness and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who brought in this righteousness and peace?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Melchisedec, the priest of the Most High God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While Abraham was slaughtering Chedorlaomer and the other kings, Melchisedec must have been praying.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It must have been through his intercession that righteousness and peace were brought in.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do you believe that while Abraham was fighting Melchisedec was sleeping?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do you believe that after Abraham won the victory, Melchisedec suddenly awakened and came in a hurry to minister the bread and wine to Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I believe that while Abraham was fighting the enemies, Melchisedec was praying for him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Most High God answered Melchisedec s prayers and delivered Abraham s enemies into his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After this intercession and Abraham s victory, Melchisedec appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Perhaps he said, Abraham, how are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I know that you are fine because I have been praying for you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Are you tired?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have come to minister bread and wine to you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you read Hebrews 7 again, you will see that the Christ who ministers as the High Priest is the interceding One.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As you are fighting during the day, slaughtering the negative things, Christ, the High Priest, is interceding for you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is clearly mentioned in 7:25.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At the end of the day, when you have finished your fighting and He has finished His interceding, He comes to you with bread and wine to have a good time with you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>While the victor was fighting, Melchisedec was watching and interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He saw Abraham s victory and knew when to come with the bread and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Bible does not need to tell us certain things because if you see the front side you automatically know the back side.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you see the front of my face, you know something about the back of my head.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The ministering Melchisedec must also have been the interceding high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the kind of High Priest that we have today in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our High Priest, Christ, is not according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Aaron is past.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I am sorry to say that many Christians still hold on to the past Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But how many Christians have the present Melchisedec?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Very few.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to be occupied with the present Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Melchisedec is not a High Priest for the purpose of offering sacrifices to God for our sins but for ministering the processed God as grace into us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now sin is over and grace is here.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Sin has gone and the enjoyment of God has come.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is no longer a matter of offering sacrifices for sin but of ministering bread and wine for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the priesthood in the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>While so many Christians still stay with Aaron, we need to be recovered back to Genesis 14.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Hebrews is a continuation of Genesis 14.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Between these two books is a bridge Psalm 110.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Psalm 110 is the bridge that brings us from Genesis 14 to the book of Hebrews, passing over the book of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The book of Hebrews, being concerned with the heavenly Christ as our High Priest, refers to this psalm a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Before our Melchisedec ministers the processed God to us, He intercedes for us, praying that we may take up our sword and slaughter the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must slaughter the self, the natural mind, the wild emotion, the stubborn will, and other enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>While we are slaughtering the enemies, He is interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>After we have finished our slaughtering, He will change His interceding to the ministering of bread and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The proper Christian life is to slaughter the enemies during the day and to enjoy the ministry of our Melchisedec with the bread and wine in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>At the end of every day, when the slaughtering and interceding have been accomplished, He and we, we and He, may have a good time enjoying the bread and wine in righteousness and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Melchisedec was the king of righteousness and the king of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>After he came, there was righteousness and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It was in such an environment and condition of righteousness and peace that Melchisedec ministered the bread and wine to the victor.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We need to fight for righteousness, and righteousness will issue in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Eventually our environment and condition will be full of righteousness and peace, and our Melchisedec will appear to have a good time with us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the ministry of our kingly High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>PERPETUAL</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Our kingly High Priest is perpetual, eternal, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Hebrews 7:3 says of Melchisedec that he is without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>According to Genesis 14, Melchisedec suddenly appeared and then disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He seems to have had no coming or going, no beginning of days or end of life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Because our Melchisedec is eternal, He has no genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>For all the important persons in Genesis there is a genealogy, but not for Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In the divine writing, the Holy Spirit sovereignly gave no account of the beginning of his days or of the end of his life so that he might be a proper type of Christ as the eternal One to be our High Priest perpetually.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This is like the presentation in the Gospel of John of the Son of God, who, being eternal, has no genealogy John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>But as the Son of Man, Christ has genealogy Matt 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It is such a Christ who is the kingly, royal High Priest ministering the processed God to us as our daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He is the perpetual One, the constant One, the eternal One, having no beginning of days or end of life.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>He may come to us in the evening and, while we are experiencing Him, He may seem to disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He never says good-bye to us, and we never say good-bye to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>But when we awake the next morning we find that He is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>With Him there is no coming or going.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He abides the High Priest perpetually.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>GREAT A. Having Tithed Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Our High Priest, Christ, is great, much greater than Aaron and all the Levitical priests.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>He was also greater than Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>This is proved by the fact that Abraham gave tithes of the choice spoils to Melchisedec 7:4, 6; Gen 14:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedec, the Levitical priests, who, as descendants of Abraham were in his loins, also paid tithes to him in Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Therefore, all the Levitical priests are lesser than Melchisedec, and the order of Aaron is inferior to that of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>B. Having Blessed Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Melchisedec blessed Abraham 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Verse 7 says, But without dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>This also indicates the greatness of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>He was greater than Abraham and he blessed him with God as the blessing Gen 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>C. Being Ancient before Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Christ is very ancient, much more ancient than Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>John 8:58 proves this: Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I am Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>We see by this that Christ is greater than Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Before Abraham was, Christ was there already.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Christ is not old, but He is ancient.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>As our Melchisedec, Christ is more ancient and greater than Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Hence, He is greater than all the Aaronic priests.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Our High Priest, Christ, today does not offer sacrifices for sin but ministers the processed God to the victorious fighters.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>This is the kingly priesthood in the book of Hebrews.</S>
