<p>When Jesus was on the earth, everything He did expressed God’s love toward men. If you read the life of Jesus, you will find out that He is not only a good man but God from heaven becoming a man. We thought that God hated us. But He became a man in order to show us that God is the same as Jesus. He was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years; during this time He expressed God’s heart. God is the same as Jesus. The way Jesus treated men is the way God treats men.<p>Once, a man full of leprosy came to worship Jesus and said, “Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me” (Luke 5:12). Jesus very easily could have made him clean by one of His words. Instead, He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed!” (v. 13). A man full of leprosy is unclean and smelly! But the Lord put forth His hand and touched him. He sympathized with this man. He seemed to be saying, “If others are not willing to come to Me, and you are willing, I will touch you.”<p>Another time, a woman caught in adultery was brought to the Lord (John 8:3-11). According to the law, such a woman should be stoned to death. The Lord Jesus could not say that she did not commit sin, yet He did not want to see her stoned to death. Therefore, He said, “He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her” (v. 7). They were all convicted in their own consciences and left one by one, from the oldest to the youngest. Then Jesus was left alone, and the woman stood before Him. What did the Lord say? He said, “Has no one condemned you?” (v. 10). She said, “No one, Lord.” Jesus then said, “Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more” (v. 11).<p>O friends! If you have not believed, let me tell you that God does not hate you; rather He loves you.<p>On another occasion, a publican named Matthew invited many publicans and sinners to his house, and he also invited Jesus. At that time the publicans were a very despised kind of people. The Jews had lost their country and were under the domination of Rome. For a Jew to work for those who conquered his country and dealt harshly with his own people, was something very despicable. If it were us, we would not have eaten or drunk with them. But Jesus ate and drank with them. <p>Would you as a college student be willing to sit with such people? You might think that if a newspaper reporter found out that you were socializing with such people, it would be a big disgrace to you. But in any case, Jesus went. <p>At that time there was another kind of people called the Pharisees. When they saw this, they spoke to Jesus’ disciples, saying, “Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?” They were debating and criticizing. But how did Jesus reply? He said, “Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.…For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Matt. 9:10-13). Jesus opened up God’s heart to men. <p>Some may wonder, “Does God still want me? I am such a terrible sinner.” Others may wonder if God would want persons like themselves because they have robbed others, committed adultery, told lies, and been unclean and filthy sinners. But Jesus has opened up God’s heart and shown us that God wants us and loves us. He is, in effect, saying, “I am like a doctor, and I am not afraid of patients.” Are patients afraid of doctors? Of course they are not afraid. Some may think that God does not like them and wants them to perish. But I must tell you that God wants you because He loves you! Friends, please do one thing today: remove the veils from your eyes so that you can see that God has no evil intentions toward you. He loves you.<p>The Lord Jesus once spoke a parable about the prodigal son. When he was a great way off, his father saw him, had compassion on him, ran, fell on his neck, and kissed him. This expresses God’s heart. God is calling you home today. Jesus has died for you, and the Holy Spirit has come. You do not need to go to hell. But if you do not accept the Lord, there is no other way. I hope you can remember that God is love! If you will say to God, “I am a sinner. I am willing, and I want to accept You,” you will be saved. Then God will rejoice, and you will also rejoice together with Him. God is love!<p><p>From The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Set 1, Vol. 18, pp. 267-277.
