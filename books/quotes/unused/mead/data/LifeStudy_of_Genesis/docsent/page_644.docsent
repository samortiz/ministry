   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>13 Becoming the Savior of the World,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Sustainer of Life the Revealer of Secrets</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because Christ was resurrected, enthroned, glorified, and received gifts, He is the Savior of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the Savior of the world, He is also the Sustainer of life and the Revealer of secrets Acts 5:31; John 6:50-51 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Joseph typified Christ in these three aspects, for these titles are all included in the name Zaphnath-paaneah given to Joseph by Pharaoh 41:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This name firstly means the Savior of the world; secondly, the Sustainer of life; and thirdly, the Revealer of secrets.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all know that Christ is the Savior of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the Savior of the world, He is the Sustainer of life and the Revealer of secrets.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these titles were ascribed to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Firstly, Joseph was the revealer of secrets, then the savior of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He became the savior because he sustained the life of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regarding Joseph's being the sustainer of life, the record of the Bible is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Pharaoh had two dreams, the first of cows and the second of ears of corn 41:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did Pharaoh not dream of seven turtles and seven black stones?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both the cows and the grain are good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today we enjoy eating steak, which comes from cows, and bread, which comes from grain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see two kinds of life the animal life and the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to enjoy both kinds of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the ordination in the Bible, before the fall man ate only of the vegetable life 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the fall, however, man was told to eat meat because of the need for the shedding of blood for redemption 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, after the fall, man had to take as his supply the vegetable life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, the animal life must come first, for the fallen ones need to be redeemed before they can enjoy life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the Lord's table we see the bread and the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The blood comes out of the Lord's animal life for redemption, and the bread comes from His regenerating life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Gospel of John the Lord is likened to a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 1:29 John the Baptist said, "Behold the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the animal life for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 12:24 the Lord compared Himself to a grain of wheat falling into the earth to reproduce by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the vegetable life for regenerating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both kinds of life are mentioned in Genesis 41.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we consider this, we realize again that the Bible is truly a divine book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No human being could have composed it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more I probe into the depths of the Bible, the more I am convinced that its contents are divinely revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Surely it is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who other than God could have written such a chapter as Genesis 41?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today, the life supply we receive from the Lord Jesus as the Sustainer of life includes both the animal life for redemption and the vegetable life for production.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hallelujah, day by day we are nourished in this way!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Simultaneously Christ is both the Savior of the world and the Sustainer of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is also the Revealer of secrets, the One who interprets dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Have you ever considered how many dreams the Lord Jesus interpreted when He was on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By dreams I mean revelation, the secrets He has revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He interpreted at least seven dreams in Matthew 13 and a number of others in Matthew 24 and 25.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Truly the Lord is the Revealer of secrets.</S>
