<h1 class="title">DANGERS TO AVOID IN THE SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we mentioned two dangers that we must guard against in our service. In this chapter we will consider three more dangers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THIRD DANGER&mdash;DOCTRINES</h2>
<p>In our Christian journey we must guard against doctrines. When we speak of doctrines, we are referring to the truths in the Bible becoming dead letter and losing the Spirit and life. Through His seekers throughout the ages, God has gradually unlocked the truths in the Bible, thereby giving His children new light. For example, Martin Luther and others saw the truth of justification by faith during the Reformation. Since then a considerable number of believers have seen more truths, such as sanctification by faith, living by faith, the meaning of baptism, the practice of the church, consecration, the indwelling of Christ, and co-crucifixion. God has given these truths to His church. The danger, however, is that we may receive these truths as doctrines. Then they lose the power of the Spirit and become dead letter, dead knowledge.</p>
<p>We humbly acknowledge that over the years God has given us new light that needs to be released to all God&rsquo;s children. But there is a danger that the light we have received will gradually become doctrine, dead letter, and empty knowledge; that is, it will lose the divine life and the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>God has given us much light in our trainings. We hope that every trainee will continue to review the lessons in order to receive the benefit. Nonetheless, there is still a danger that dead knowledge and doctrines will be produced.</p>
<p>The benefit of the trainings is not so much that we receive revelation but that we receive wisdom. Ephesians 1:17 mentions &ldquo;a spirit of wisdom and revelation.&rdquo; We first receive wisdom and then revelation. Wisdom prepares us to receive revelation. The trainings merely prepare us with wisdom. There is still a need for us to obtain revelation. It is easy to regard the material and the light we received in the trainings as complete. This prevents us from receiving revelation. No one can help us with respect to revelation. In order to receive revelation, we must live in spirit, let God touch us, be willing to pay the price, accept His breaking, and learn spiritual lessons. This does not mean that we need to memorize the training lessons in order to receive spiritual revelation. Spiritual revelation cannot be found in the training lessons. Spiritual revelation depends on our meeting God, being touched by Him, being broken, paying the price, learning the lessons, and spending time in His presence. If we are such persons, we will receive revelation. Hence, revelation does not depend entirely on the trainings.</p>
<p>We publish spiritual books and hold trainings out of burden. However, we feel that there is still a lack, because some saints depend solely on the publications for their spiritual life. Some brothers who give messages depend only on the material in the books and their notes from the trainings, but they have little experience that is based on contacting God. The brothers who give messages must be persons who contact God so that they have a burden in their spirit. In order to receive revelation, they need to pay the price and spend time to learn lessons. Then they can use the help from the ministry books for utterance to enrich their speaking. The ministry books and training notes are helpful and beneficial to a brother who has a burden but does not sufficiently understand a point.</p>
<p>A brother might read a spiritual book before he contacts the Lord. Then the Spirit can give him a seeking heart or enlighten his understanding so that he receives revelation and has a burden for a message. It is also possible to use the material in a book to give a message that is living, not dead. We fear that some brothers take the written material and speak according to what is printed, but they lack the spiritual supply. I believe that the saints understand this problem.</p>
<p>The brothers who give messages are not the only ones with such a problem. Many of the saints have the same problem. It is easy for them to take our publications as doctrine. The truth then becomes dead letter. Such saints do not contact or seek the Lord when they read the publications. It is as if they read the books in order to know how to speak or what to do in a certain situation.</p>
<p>It is even easy to be influenced when reading the Bible. For example, while a brother is reading Ephesians 2, he might remember that there was a message in the training concerning the significance of this chapter and look for his notes. A sister who is reading Matthew 25 might remember an explanation in Watchman Nee&rsquo;s <em>Study on Matthew.</em> These saints have been distracted from reading the Bible by ministry publications. This danger causes us to turn spiritual things into dead letter, hinders us from contacting God directly, and causes the Spirit to lose ground within us.</p>
<p>Many years ago in northern China I met a German brother who approved of J. N. Darby. One day as we were talking, I mentioned a book written by Darby. His response seemed to say, &ldquo;Since that book was written by Darby, it is the best, and there cannot be anything better. You cannot say anything that compares to what Darby has said. Everything that God wants to say to the church is in his writing.&rdquo; According to that brother, anything that Darby did not say must be incorrect and even heretical.</p>
<p>I am deeply concerned that such an attitude might also be in us. We do not despise the speaking of prophets, and we should receive all that God has spoken through His servants. However, if it were merely a matter of receiving doctrine, what God has spoken through His servants would be dead, and even the Bible would be dead. Dead doctrines are a snare and a danger that we face. We must guard against them.</p>
<p>We should read the Bible, have a living contact with the Lord, and receive the light that God has given through His servants. We must not be so foolish as to believe that we understand and know more than other believers. We must not be so foolish as to believe that we do not need help from other believers or that we know everything. This is a very foolish attitude. At the same time, however, we must not think that we can receive all that we need from others&rsquo; books or even our books. We should not say that we have a book for sanctification, a book for justification, and yet another for the faith. We must not have such an attitude.</p>
<p>When I was a young believer, I thought that the Bible was difficult to understand. Therefore, I bought commentaries on each book in the Old Testament and in the New Testament so that I could become a Bible authority. If there was anything I did not understand in the Bible, I would read about it in the commentaries. However, experience has proven that although we need outward help in order to understand God&rsquo;s Word, such help is not sufficient. The true way to understand God&rsquo;s Word is to contact Him, touch His feeling, and let Him touch us.</p>
<p>A person whose true condition has not been touched by the Lord cannot understand the truth. We must let the Lord touch our being, that is, touch our background, our standing, our walk, our position, our reputation, our tendencies, our preferences, and our future. Our ability to know His Word depends on how much He has worked in us. It is futile to read the Bible merely with the mind. As the Lord works in us, we will receive light from the portions that we have read and memorized. Many saints have had this experience.</p>
<p>We can apply the same principle to reading the ministry books. A brother may be quite familiar with the books, having read them thoroughly, but whether he truly understands them and can apply them effectively and in a way that is full of life depends on his contact with the Lord. A brother who does not let the Lord work in him might preach proficiently and speak fluently, but his speaking is like sounding brass or a clanging cymbal, and his words are dead, without life and the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>It is true that there is an indispensable need for the publications and the trainings. In his old age the apostle Paul wrote to Timothy, &ldquo;The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:13). Paul was always reading. It is not possible to arrive at a point in our Christian life when we do not need to read the Bible or the ministry books, or a point when we do not need to listen to spiritual messages from other believers. A believer who reaches such a point is proud and foolish. We should always humble ourselves in order to be taught and to receive help from others. However, we must maintain our contact with the Lord in His presence. We must let the Lord touch our feelings. The truths that we receive from others should become our revelation. Otherwise, we will be left with dead knowledge. Dead knowledge does not have the vitality of life or the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Not only should the saints have such an attitude, the church should also have such an attitude. We should not be so proud that we do not accept anything from others, nor should we mechanically accept light in the Word and the ministry as doctrine. We need to be balanced. May the Lord have mercy on us. If the Lord permits, we will publish more ministry books. But may He deliver us from falling into doctrines. We must learn to live in His presence and to contact Him and to let Him touch us.</p>
