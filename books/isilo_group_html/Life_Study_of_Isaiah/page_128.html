Political Babylon is somewhat in a state of repose, whereas religious Babylon is flourishing. For example, Christmas, which is celebrated throughout the world, is altogether from Babylon. Participating in Christmas may seem to be a small thing, but anything that is part of Babylon is abominable in the eyes of God. The system in the church meetings of one man speaking and all the rest listening is also a part of Babylon. This Babylonian element must not be allowed to remain among us.</P><P>God commanded His Old Testament elect, Israel, to depart from Babylon and to separate themselves absolutely from Babylon (Isa. 52:11). In the New Testament, God also charges His elect, the church, to come out of Babylon (Rev. 18:4). We all need to ask ourselves whether or not we have made a thorough clearance with today's Babylon. We are here following our Christ, who is the Servant of Jehovah, and He requires us to depart from Babylon and to have a thorough clearance with Babylon.</P><P>In Joshua 6 the children of Israel gained the victory over Jericho, but in fighting against Ai they were defeated. Because Achan kept a Babylonian garment (7:21), God's people suffered a defeat. Anything that is Babylonian gives Satan the ground to defeat the people of God. Therefore, we must forsake everything Babylonian. If we would serve God as His pure people, we first need to have a thorough clearance of all Babylonian things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE PROSPERITY OF CHRIST<br>AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH IN RELATION<br>TO ISRAEL'S RETURN FROM CAPTIVITY<br>AND HER RESTORATION</H2><P>In Isaiah 52:13-15 we read of the prosperity of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in relation to Israel's return from captivity and her restoration. Verse 13 says, "Behold, My Servant will prosper;/He will be exalted and lifted up and very high." According to verse 14b, His appearance was marred more than that of any man, and His form more than that of the sons of men. Even as many were astonished at Him, so will He astonish many nations. Kings will shut their mouths because of Him; for what had not been recounted to them they will see, and what they had not heard of they will contemplate (vv. 14a, 15).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_127.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_129.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 128</div><br></body></html>
