The Offering of Twelve<br>Silver Plates, Twelve Silver Basins, and<br>Twelve Gold Spoons Full of Incense</H2><P>The leaders of the twelve tribes offered twelve silver plates, twelve silver basins, and twelve gold spoons full of incense (vv. 84-86). In offering these for the service of God, they cooperated with God in His services by offering the silver and gold vessels with the incense, signifying Christ in His redemption and His divine nature as a fragrant satisfaction to God.</P><P>These items were offered by the twelve tribes in twelve days, signifying that both the offering people and the offering time are eternally complete in God's administration. It took twelve days for all these items to be offered. This indicates that God was patient with man's slowness in his coordination. Although the pace was slow, both the offering people and the offering time were eternally complete and perfect for the divine administration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Different Categories of Offerings</H2><P>The leaders of the twelve tribes also offered twelve oxen, twelve rams, twelve lambs a year old, and their meal offering for the burnt offering; twelve male goats for a sin offering; and twenty-four oxen, sixty rams, sixty male goats, and sixty male lambs a year old for the peace offering (vv. 87-88).</P><P>We need to offer ourselves to God to match His need for His move. This offering is our coordination with God. However, because we are sinful, we cannot coordinate with God by ourselves. If we try to do this, we will not be accepted. We need Christ. First, we must offer Christ as our sin offering to redeem us from sin. Then we must offer Christ as our burnt offering so that we may live for God in Christ, with Christ, and by Christ. As our burnt offering, Christ is for our living to God. The result of the sin offering and the burnt offering is the peace offering, signifying our enjoyment with God and God's enjoyment with us. The issue of the sin offering and the burnt offering is the rich peace offering, through which we and God enjoy Christ mutually in peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. For the Worship of God</H2><P>These offerings are for the worship of God. The proper worship of God is very different from the worship in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. According to the Bible, in order to worship God, we must offer ourselves to Him. Then we must offer Christ as our sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offering. As a result, God is satisfied, and we also are satisfied. Then we and God can sit down together to enjoy Christ in a mutual way.</P><P>Even for the transportation of God's moveable home, there was the mutual enjoyment between God and His people in Christ as the sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offering. The principle is the same with us today. For example, when you come to clean the meeting hall, you must come in the way indicated by the type in Numbers 7. This means that first you should offer yourself to cooperate with God and then offer Christ as your sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offering. If you offer Christ in this way, you and God will enjoy Christ in mutuality and be satisfied with Him.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Numbers &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
