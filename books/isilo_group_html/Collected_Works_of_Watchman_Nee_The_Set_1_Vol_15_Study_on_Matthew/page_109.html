Note that this does not mean that dead people still have the opportunity to be saved after their resurrection. Furthermore, the unsaved are not resurrected at this time.</P><P>(2) This implies that the oil of the five prudent virgins was also bought originally. They paid a price for their oil. From this we know that slothful ones cannot be filled by the Holy Spirit.</P><P>(3) For the infilling of the Holy Spirit, there is a price to be paid. It cannot be obtained by begging. When one goes to buy, he must know what he wants to buy. Often when we meet friends in a department store and ask them what they want to buy, they say they do not know. Many Christians are like this. They do not see the need to buy oil, or they know the price but cannot pay it. Most believers today do not know the importance of the infilling of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>The amount of oil in the lamp is not sufficient to last past midnight. Only the oil in the vessel is sufficient. The new covenant in the heart can only produce new desires; it cannot supply the strength. Having only the desires causes frustration because there is not the power to fulfill them. Hence, the infilling is crucial. Since man needs it, he should pay the price for it. Do not think that as long as one is saved, he is all right. One must first consider the price. Consider the Lord's word about the building of the tower and the king going to war (Luke 14:28-32). When many hear of the high price, they turn away. They do not realize the need for the oil.</P><P>The price differs for each person. Some may have to clear up matters, while others may need to get rid of certain things in their lives. In short, oil requires that a price be paid; it cannot be obtained for free. Even when the oil is obtained, it is not for the interest of the individual but rather for the glory of God. In working for God, many love to use their gift and power as a kind of ornament. But God never exalts Christians by gifts and power. The price may not always be known; nevertheless, it is there.</P><P>The most important thing here is the dealing with sin; it is the prerequisite. Before sin is dealt with, one cannot consider paying the price. The confession of sins is not the paying of the price; it is our undisputed duty. Even the five foolish virgins did that.</P><P>(4) Paying the price. A penny of price will buy a penny of goods. Whatever price one pays, that much oil he will get. The cross cannot be separated from the Holy Spirit. The killing (which comes before death) of the Lord should be magnified in our body (2 Cor. 4:9-11). The cross opens up room for the new covenant to move in. The infilling of the new covenant is not necessarily sensed or felt; it is a fact. It is not necessary for us to be able to sense our heartbeat. It is enough that the reality of the heartbeat is there. The only begotten Son has been given, but the oil cannot be given; it must be bought.</P><P>There are four items in the Bible the obtaining of which demands that a price be paid. (a) Proverbs 23:23 says, "Buy the truth." To know the truth, we must have a determination to practice the truth, then seek and pursue it. (b) Revelation 3:18 says, "gold refined by fire," (c) "white garments," and (d) "eyesalve."</P><P>Buying here is not for the unbelievers. God cannot ask the unbelievers to buy. Furthermore, the church in Laodicea is still the church. Gold refined by fire signifies the faith that can go through testing without suffering defeat. This is the faith in dealing with the environment (1 Pet. 1:7). For God to allow a believer to pass through trials is an honor. When a believer passes through trials, God is glorified before Satan, as He was with Job.</P><P>In Revelation there are two kinds of white garments: (a) The white garment obtained before God is the Lord Jesus. This is our being cleansed when we put on Christ. Those without this white garment are not saved. (b) The white garment before the Lord is the righteousness that comes from the moving of the Lord's Spirit in us. Those without such a white garment are naked before the Lord and cannot receive a reward.</P><P>(5) This section gives us the hint that the oil must be bought anyway. The infilling of the Holy Spirit is not something that is up to you. Sooner or later all believers will have to be filled by the Holy Spirit. Do not think that the five prudent virgins went to extremes. When the time comes, God will force you to go to extremes too. Ephesians 5:18 is a command. If you do not keep it today, you will have to keep it someday.</P><P>(6) Where do the foolish virgins go to buy the oil? At that time, the end of the tribulation, who will be on earth to sell the oil? There will be two: Enoch and Elijah (Rev. 11:2-4). They are the "olive trees," which bear oil-producing fruit. Zechariah 4:11-12 also speaks of them as the oil-producing plants. Enoch and Elijah were both prophets who had the gift of the Holy Spirit. They were the sons of oil, supplying others with oil. But note, Enoch and Elijah can supply only part of the oil. To be full of the Holy Spirit still requires our own pursuit.</P><P>(7) How can there be suffering after resurrection? The Bible does not consider this a problem. You may have the prejudice that there will be no suffering after the resurrection. But one must realize that everyone who is suffering in hell is resurrected. After resurrection, some will have joy, while others will have suffering. If a Christian's temper is not dealt with when he is alive, it will not be dealt with after his death either. The greed, pride, and selfishness of the rich man were still there after he died. Death cannot make a person holy. Otherwise, every man would be made holy, since every man dies once.</P><P>For this reason, after resurrection there is the need to trim the lamps. In verse 8 the lamp is going out, which means that the lamp can never actually go out. The life that God gives us will forever remain. Yet many Christians' experience of the Holy Spirit is in a situation of "going out." Many times it seems as if it has "gone out," but actually the Holy Spirit never leaves. Although the Holy Spirit cannot leave because of man's unfaithfulness, there are many Christians who are at the point of "going out."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_108.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_110.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 109</div><br></body></html>
