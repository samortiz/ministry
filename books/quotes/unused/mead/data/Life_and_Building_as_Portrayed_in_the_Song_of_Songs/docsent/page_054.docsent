   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE LORD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the Lord's final appraisal of the seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since she has reached the consummate attainment, she is now ready to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not a work for the Lord, but a work with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She is now fully equipped and fully qualified to care for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This brings the Lord's last appraisal concerning her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the aspects of this appraisal are related to her qualifications for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>HER FOOTSTEPS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord first of all mentions something about her footsteps: "How beautiful are thy footsteps with shoes, O prince's daughter" 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Footsteps" indicate action which has already taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not a matter of the beauty of her feet, but of her footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the beauty of her action and her move.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Her move is not with bare feet, but with shoes!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From Ephesians chapter 6 we see that the shoes signify the preaching of the full gospel, including the preaching of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The shoes not only give beauty to the feet, but also keep the feet from the defilement of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we put our bare feet on the earth, they will become dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if we have shoes on our feet, our feet are covered, protected, and separated from the earth, though they are so near to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, wherever we go to the office, the factory, the school, or the store we must wear our gospel shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The preaching of the gospel will protect us, and keep us from becoming defiled through contact with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we arrive at a new job, go to a new school, or move to a new location, we must immediately let the people around us know that we wear the shoes of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If from the first day we tell them they need Jesus, not one of them will ask us to go to the movies the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The shoes of the gospel will separate us from this world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The preaching of the full gospel always leaves a footstep that is beautiful in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THIGHS LIKE JEWELS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second thing that the Lord mentions are the jewels: "Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman" 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jewels are precious gems which have been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were not originally in that state.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows that she has been transformed by the skillful workman who is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Her thighs like jewels represent her standing power and stability.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without stability, we are not qualified to touch the work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are going to work with the Lord, we need the stability of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>NECK AS A TOWER OF IVORY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the Lord mentions her neck again: "Thy neck is as a tower of ivory" 7:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In chapter four her neck was depicted as the tower of David, but here it is described as a tower of ivory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The tower of David was for fighting, but the tower of ivory means that her neck is full of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ivory in typology signifies the Lord's resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now her neck is not only full of submission for fighting the spiritual warfare, but it is also full of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Her neck is a tower ministering life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>EYES LIKE POOLS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Next, the Lord speaks of her eyes: "Thine eyes like pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim" 7:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In chapter one her eyes were likened to doves' eyes, but now her eyes are likened to pools.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know that doves' eyes are very small, but pools are much larger and have a much broader scope.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How much can the doves' eyes cover compared with pools?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now she has two large eyes, as big as pools.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such an enlarged vision is really wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The doves' eyes are spiritual, but the eyes like pools are enlarged and broadened to cover the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some seemingly spiritual people have the eyes of an ant.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their eyes are even smaller than the eyes of a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They cannot see anything except their work, their mission field, their little group, their "church."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this seeking one can now see the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no limitation to her sight.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all need such a broadened vision.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Her sight has been enlarged to the size of pools.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is really meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, these two pools are located by the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A gate is for coming in and going out.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the communication of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If our eyes are as small as the ant's, it is really difficult for us to have fellowship with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our fellowship depends upon our broadened sight.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Another matter concerning the pools is that they always give some reflection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is light in her sight.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To care for the Lord's work we need such a broadened sight full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Otherwise, we are either short-sighted, narrow-sighted, or even blind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must become so enlarged in our vision that we can see the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We not only care for the Lord's work where we are, but we also care for the Lord's interests in the whole universe.</S>
