<h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Wisdom: Both Righteousness<br />
and Sanctification and Redemption</h2>
<p>In [1 Corinthians 1:24 and 30] the wisdom of God denotes the divine way....As wisdom to us from God as God&rsquo;s way, Christ is righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Actually, these are three steps of the way. This understanding is, of course, related to our experience.<sup>51</sup> Christ as the righteousness from God to us...is not only for justification concerning our past offenses, but is for our living today. It enables us to be right and just toward God, man, and everything else in procedures and methods. Christ is dispensed from God into us to be our life, power, and wisdom, so that we can live out this righteous living and be righteous in every word, deed, movement, and action.</p>
<p>Christ as the sanctification from God to us (1 Cor. 1:30) is not only sanctifying us in position, but in disposition also, so that we can be set apart to God from everything common....Through Him, the divine dispensing is continually transmitted into us, sanctifying our whole being&mdash; spirit, soul, and body&mdash;making us holy, full of the divine element to live out an excelling living.<sup>52</sup></p>
<p>If we are those who exercise our spirit, call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and enjoy Christ as our unique portion, we shall not only become righteous and sanctified, but we shall also experience Christ as our redemption. This means that in our experience we shall be brought back to God. Whenever a sister quarrels with her husband or debates with him, she is far away from God....But when she enjoys Christ and thereby becomes righteous and sanctified, she is brought back to God....Redemption also includes termination.... [Furthermore,]...when Christ terminates us, He replaces us with Himself....When we are replaced, we are transformed and reconstituted of Christ. Is not this the wisdom of God? When we experience Christ as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, we truly have Him as wisdom to us from God.<sup>53</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Life</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life. We live and move on earth because we have life; once we die, we cannot move any longer. As Christians we have not only the human life but also the Lord Christ in us as our surpassing life. He is the Spirit to be our life, by which we may live and walk and be transcendent and excellent, as He is.<sup>54</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ Being the Unsearchable Riches</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3:8, [the apostle Paul uses a phrase] <em>the unsearchable riches of Christ....</em> The [unsearchable] riches of Christ are all that He is....What Christ is does not refer to what He has; the emphasis of what Christ is, is on His being.<sup>55</sup> All the types, shadows, and figures of Christ in the Old Testament are descriptions, explanations, and definitions of what Christ is....The riches of Christ are also seen in prophecies [and] in the fulfillment of the prophecies.... [Moreover, in the Bible,] Christ is typified...by trees and plants,...animals,...minerals,...and persons....[In addition,] all the positive things in the universe point to Christ. For example, Christ is the real gravity. Without Him, we would drift away. If Christ did not hold us in place, we would not be able to stand. Christ is the One with the true holding power. According to Hebrews 1:3, He upholds the entire universe. [Furthermore,] the riches of Christ also include both human virtues and divine attributes. Christ is the real love, patience, and forgiveness. Apart from Christ, we cannot love, be patient, or forgive, not even in relation to our wife or husband. But when we have Christ, we have all the human virtues and divine attributes.<sup>56</sup></p>
