   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN HAVING DIED WITH CHRIST FROM THE ELEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND HAVING BEEN RAISED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO LIVE WITH HIM IN GOD Scripture Reading: Col 2:20-23; 3:1-3; 2:11-12</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter two Paul says that Christ is the mystery of God and that in Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now that we have received such a Christ, we should walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To walk in Christ is to have our living and our being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 2:9 and 10 Paul goes on to say that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and that we in Him have been made full.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Christ we have been completed, perfected, supplied, and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, in Christ we were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, we were buried with Him in baptism, and we were also raised together in Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to verses 14 and 15, the handwriting in ordinances which was against us has been wiped out, and the rulers and authorities have been stripped off.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these things are true in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ROOTED IN CHRIST AS THE RICH SOIL</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the matters mentioned above are elements of Christ as the rich soil in which we are rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first element of this soil is the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Other elements include circumcision, burial, being raised, the wiping out of the ordinances, and the stripping off of the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since we have been rooted in Christ, we may now absorb all these rich elements into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the eyes of God, believers can be likened to plants.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason Paul could say, I have planted, Apollos watered; but God made to grow 1 Cor 3:6, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>. Paul also said that we are God s farm, God s plantation 1 Cor 3:9, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>. We have been planted into Christ who is the good land with very rich soil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>ENJOYING CHRIST TO BECOME BODY-CONSCIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 16 through 19 form a distinct section in Colossians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The matters in verse 16 eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are all shadows, of which Christ is the reality, the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The things to come are the things related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verses 18 through 19 Paul speaks of not being defrauded of our prize and of holding the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have pointed out that, experientially and practically, to hold the Head is to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The result of holding the Head in this way is that we become Body-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever we enjoy of Christ is related to Him as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why, when we enjoy Christ, we are actually holding the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We enjoy Christ as food, drink, Sabbaths, new moons, and feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the Christ we enjoy in all these aspects is the Head who causes us to become conscious of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The One we enjoy is not only Christ to us; He is the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the issue, the consequence, of enjoying Christ and holding Him as the Head is Body-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To enjoy Christ, holding Him as the Head, is to absorb into us the rich elements of Christ as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Two of these elements are the experience of having died with Christ and of having been raised with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 2:20 Paul indicates that we have died with Christ from the elements of the world, and in 3:1 he says that we were raised together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Testament clearly says that we have been crucified with Christ Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I was a young believer, I tried my best to figure out how this could be true.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How could we have died with Christ when He was crucified more than nineteen hundred years ago?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Certain books point out that when Christ was crucified, He included us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brother Nee used Hebrews 7 to illustrate this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Hebrews 7:9 and 10, Levi also, who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes; for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that when Abraham offered one-tenth to Melchisedec, Levi, the descendant of Abraham, who was in Abraham s loins at the time, also offered tithes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If Abraham had died childless, Levi would have died also.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This illustration helped me to see how we were included in Christ when He was crucified.</S>
