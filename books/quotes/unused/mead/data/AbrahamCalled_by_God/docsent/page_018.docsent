   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT OBEYING GOD'S CALLING RIGHT AWAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why did God need to appear to Abraham twice and call him twice?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did God need to repeat His calling?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As far as God was concerned, there was no need for Him to repeat His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was Abraham who needed the repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is hardly one who has experienced God's calling just once and then immediately crossed the river.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one among us has ever answered God's calling without dragging his feet through mud and water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hardly anyone has ever given a clean-cut answer to God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may say, "What about Peter and John when they were called by the Lord by the Sea of Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord called them, and they followed Him immediately."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you read other portions of the Word, you will see that even these disciples were dragging their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is difficult to have a clean-cut answer to God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We always drag our feet through mud and water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our relatives might be the mud and we ourselves might be the water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although you might have received the calling from God, you allow your relatives to be the mud through which you drag your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And you yourself are the water, the dirty and black water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You drag your feet through this mud and water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While Abraham was living at Ur, the God of glory suddenly appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This appearing brought in light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The name Ur means light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a demonic land, a land full of demons Chaldea means demonic , the God of glory appeared and brought in light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever God comes to call a man, there is always light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While Saul of Tarsus was on the way to Damascus to persecute the Christians there, a light from heaven shone upon him Acts 9:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that moment, Saul was at Ur. He was under the light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you were called, you also were under the light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You saw that your place, your environment and surroundings, was not the right place for you to stay any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You were called at Ur, the place of light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TAKEN TO HARAN BY HIS FATHER AFTER HIS BROTHER'S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that Abraham received God's calling when he was young.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He might have told his father, Terah, and his relatives how God had appeared to him and had told him to get out of his country and his kindred.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham probably did not have the boldness to do this himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 11:28 we are told that "Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Haran might have been Abraham's older brother and he might have opposed God's calling to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It might have been that God waited a certain period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Abraham still did not take any action, God took away Haran, the opposing one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Haran might have been Terah's eldest son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The eldest son's death might have been a warning to the father not to tarry any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The name Terah means to tarry, to delay, or to be laggard.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Terah took the whole family, went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, and dwelt in Haran 11:31; Acts 7:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was not Abraham who took the initiative to leave Ur; it was his father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Terah and his family might have traveled northward along the side of the river Euphrates.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, after a journey of at least five hundred miles, they came to Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the ancient method of travel, it must have taken over half a month to travel from Ur to Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But although they made such a long journey, they never crossed the river as God wanted them to.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How many years have you been dragging along the side of the river without crossing it?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may say, "Praise the Lord that I am no longer in Ur."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Right, you are not in Ur, but you are still on the other side of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even in the church life you have been journeying along the riverside without crossing the river.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many of you have journeyed northward but are still on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But even this journey northward was caused by God's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At Ur there was a person named Haran, and now we see a city with the same name.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that they left one Haran and came into another.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the eyes of God, both are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether Haran is a person or a place, it is still Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The name Haran means dry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the elder brother was opposing God's calling, he must have been dry.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Any relative who tries to prevent you from accepting the Lord's calling is a dry one, and any place that hinders you from answering God's calling is a dry place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You can never be watered there.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In such a place you have the sensation of dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many of us have experienced this.</S>
