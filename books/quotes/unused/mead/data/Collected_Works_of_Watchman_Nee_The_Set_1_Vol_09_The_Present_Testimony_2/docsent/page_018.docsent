   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The Lord Jehovah God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Cannanites...unto a land flowing with milk and honey" Exo 3:16-17 .</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no other reason.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If anyone among us obeys God because He has said "I am that I am," he is blessed and will not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He can find many reasons in the world to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But because of one great reason: "I am that I am," he will not sin and will be blessed!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Simply put, there are two reasons for God being "I am that I am."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>1 I am; I am the powerful One.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore you cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am; I am your power, protection, holiness, righteousness, and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why do you have to sin?</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Jehovah will say, "I am the One who supplies you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why do you have to borrow?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you sin, it is not because I will not help you nor because I cannot protect you from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am that I am.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I can protect you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You sin because you want to sin."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>2 I am that I am.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"I am not only power, wisdom, and the one who loves you and has chosen you.</S>

   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you do not do well, I will discipline you and chastise you.</S>

   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the second case, He shows us that Jehovah Himself is holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He will judge us according to His holiness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In using this name, it seems as if He will not reason with us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He told His people, "I am Jehovah, I am the Lord, therefore you cannot sin.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am Jehovah.</S>
