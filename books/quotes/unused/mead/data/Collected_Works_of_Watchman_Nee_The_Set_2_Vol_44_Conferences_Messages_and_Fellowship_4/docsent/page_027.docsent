   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THE PROTECTION, LIMITATION, AND MINISTRY OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 3:3-6; 2:15 THE PROTECTION OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Body renders supply to every member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, this Body also renders protection to every member.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is especially important when it comes to the matter of spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians is a book that deals specifically with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter six we see that spiritual warfare is something that is related to the church, not to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the plural you that must put on the whole armor of God, not the singular you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan is not afraid of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is afraid of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must meet the devil on the ground of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even in our private prayers we should stand by faith on the ground of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians fall before the foe because they stand alone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In fact, if we stand alone, we invite Satan's attack.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must remember that the spiritual armor is for the church, not for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Body of Christ puts on the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Body every member has its specialty, and all these specialties combined together form the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a brother has faith, he has the shield of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If another brother has the word of God, he has the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The whole armor of God is the totality of all the specialties of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the whole armor is for the whole church, not for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Spiritual warfare is an integrated warfare of all the members; it is not the isolated warfare of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A single tree can be blown down easily, but a whole forest cannot be blown down easily.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan likes to pick out those who are without any covering as the objects of his attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He looks for men who are alone and isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whoever is under the protection of the Body is sheltered.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One function of the Body of Christ is to protect all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need the covering of the Body; otherwise, we will be constantly exposed to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>An isolated individual is also prone to be deceived, so we need the covering of the Body for this as well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should consult constantly with our fellow- believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must not only acknowledge the need for the Body in a general way, but we should also go to our brothers and sisters in a specific way and ask for help.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Body of Christ is a reality; it is not a doctrine or a theory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The protection of the Body is also a reality and not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Immediately after I was saved, I read in the Bible about bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I thought that if I memorized the verses on this subject, I would be bearing the cross and that if I forgot the verses, I would not be bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, I found out that bearing the cross has nothing to do with our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our memory merely retains the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the Lord's word is life to us, nothing will affect our bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not matter whether or not we remember the word, because if the word is life to us, it has already become a law of life in us and is no longer just an outward legal ordinance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The same is true with the Body of Christ it is a law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once we experience this life, we are under the operation of this law of life, and we discover that the protection of the Body is a reality and not an outward law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Soldiers hide in the trenches for their protection in physical warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They cannot expose their heads; to do so is dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is also true in spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No member should be alone, and no member should expose his head.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are merely members in the Body, and we need the protection of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Moses lifted up his hands to pray for the Israelites, he needed the help of Aaron and Hur.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With their help the Israelites prevailed over the Amalekites.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a man as strong as Moses needed the help of his brothers, how much more do we need the help of our brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people do things without consulting and praying with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are ignorant of the protection of the Body, and the result is nothing but failure.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all must see the reality of the Body's protection, hide under its protection, and accept its safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the difference between one who has revelation of the Body and one who does not: The one who knows the Body merely as a truth may seek the counsel and covering of the Body, but he will do it as a matter of policy, not as a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he thinks of it he will do it, but he can also forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The one who has seen the Body as a reality and has entered experientially into the realm of the Body has no possibility of forgetting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His acting by the Body-principle is something spontaneous because it is his life.</S>
