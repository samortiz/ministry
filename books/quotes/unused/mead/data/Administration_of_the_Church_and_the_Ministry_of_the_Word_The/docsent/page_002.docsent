   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Eph 4:11, 16; 2:20; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 Cor 3:9-10, 14; 14:4-5, 12, 26; Heb 11:10 GOD S INTENTION BEING TO RECOVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Over the past two thousand years people have not paid sufficient attention to the matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Over the last few centuries God has recovered many items.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These items of recovery have occupied God s children so much that they have not had the energy to see God s further recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Strictly speaking, there has not been much recovery concerning the matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only in recent years has God led His people to consider this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It has been difficult for us to find topics related to building up in Christian publications.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people speak of edification, but few speak of building up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in the English translations of the Bible, the Greek word for building up is often translated as edification instead of building up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is also the case with the Chinese translation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many portions that are translated as edification should actually be building up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SAINTS BEING BUILT UP AS A SPIRITUAL HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Greek the verb for building up has the same root as the noun house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the word for build up is translated as edify, it conveys only the thought of education rather than the meaning of building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to see the difference between building up and edification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the past we had a regard for edification but not for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We understood edification as a matter of individual experience and had no consciousness of its relation to corporate building up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, in the Bible building refers not only to individuals being edified but also to the saints being built together.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, according to the Scriptures, building includes not only personal edification but also the saints being built up as a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Edification is needed for individual matters, and building up is needed for corporate matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the words for building up and house have the same root in Greek, building up means to build all the saints up as a house.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In spiritual terms it is to build them up as the Body Eph 2:20-22; 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our physical body can be compared to a house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second Corinthians 5:1 refers to our body as a tabernacle, because our body is temporal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This verse also indicates that the transfigured body we will have in the future is a building from God, an eternal dwelling in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is the house of God Eph 2:22 and the Body of Christ 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the house of God and the Body of Christ indicate two aspects of the church, they refer to the same thing, because the Body of Christ is a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians 6:19 says that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our body is a temple, a building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord Jesus said, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up John 2:19 , He was saying that if the Jews destroyed His body and killed Him, He would raise it up in three days.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows that in the Bible, the body refers to a house, and the house refers to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is the house of God and the Body of Christ; these are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the church is merely the Body, we may think that there is no need for building up; however, the Body is also a house.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, there is the need for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible speaks of building a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 , the building of a dwelling place of God in spirit Eph 2:22 , and also the building up of the Body of Christ 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we cannot apprehend the fact that the Body is a house, we will question the need for the Body to be built up.</S>
