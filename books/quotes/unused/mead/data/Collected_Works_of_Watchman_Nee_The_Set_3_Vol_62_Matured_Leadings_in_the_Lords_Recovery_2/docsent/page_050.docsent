   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE SPIRITUAL FEELINGS Date:Evening, February 28, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading:Gen 2:7; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>36:26-27; Luke 9:55; John 3:6; 4:23-24; 6:63; Rom 7:6; Phil 3:3; 1:19; Gal 5:25</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Witness Lee: Lord, how we need the cleansing of Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are still many unclean and impure things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, we need Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Forgive our past shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May we come to You once again with full assurance to receive mercy and grace for our timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, grant us Your revelation and shine into our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Unless You do this, our understanding will not be open even when we have Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Open our understanding even tonight so that we will see what we have not seen before.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Watchman Nee: Today we will speak on the subject of spiritual feelings and how to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The feeling in our spirit originates from the Holy Spirit; when the Holy Spirit moves within our spirit, we acquire a certain kind of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our mind, however, does not require the Holy Spirit to activate it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It can think and consider by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A Christian communicates with God through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's Spirit lives in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We sense the move of God's Spirit by our spirit, and we communicate with Him, know Him, and know His will through this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is understandable for a person to exercise his mind all the time before he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But it is inexcusable for a saved person to use his mind to replace the operation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a Christian has never learned to follow the Holy Spirit, he will not know what the feeling of the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the Holy Spirit moves within us and we touch the feeling of the Spirit, we exercise our mind to think and to translate this feeling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is useless, however, if the Holy Spirit prompts us and our mind is still occupied by our own things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people think that clever ones understand God's things faster, and dull ones understand them slower.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But this is not what the Lord's Word says.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord's Word says that He will destroy the wisdom of the wise and set aside the understanding of those who understand 1 Cor 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord places the wise and the foolish on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The wisest mind and the most foolish mind are equally worthless before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both need to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God does not need man to be His counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Who has become His counselor?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rom 11:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who can be God's advisor?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God only acts according to His own will; He does not act according to man's reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated" 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Again He said, "I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion" v. 15 . This means that God only acts according to His will; He does not act according to reason, judgment, or fairness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we follow God according to reason, judgment, and fairness, we are asking Him to follow our reason.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we are God's slaves; we are nothing but dust.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can only prostrate ourselves before His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How can we reason with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no other way than to obey and follow the Holy Spirit's prompting within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can only stand on the ground of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We cannot stand on the ground of interference.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot be God's counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The mind only reasons and argues.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It only considers whether or not reason allows and permits something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God does not want us to argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He wants us to walk according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A man can argue with his friends, but a father of thirty or more years does not need to argue with a three- to five-year-old child.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the child asks why they have to move, the father does not need to give a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our God is far greater than us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His glory is unapproachable to man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even if He revealed only a millionth of His glory to us, we would have no place to go but to fall on our face and drop our reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To follow God, we cannot exercise our reasoning faculty, that is, our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to use another organ, our spirit.</S>
