   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REDEEMING THE TIME TO EAT AND DRINK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Third, I want to fellowship with all of you about how to use the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have been exercising here for half a year and have learned some things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But one of the problems with the home meetings is that people are on different levels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No two persons are on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a home meeting there may be those who have been saved for many years, those who are newly saved, and some who are not yet saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There may even be some who are hearing the gospel for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although everyone is different, please do not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The key to meeting is not to be afraid of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, we may be scheduled to read Galatians 5:16-19 this Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if some gospel friends show up, we can still use these verses to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The home meetings are all in the brothers and sisters homes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One sits here; another sits there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One comes early; another comes late.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone speaks a little, and there is no need for any formality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the best point about the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is another principle that I would ask you to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every time we come to meet, we are meeting around the Lord s Word, contacting the Word and getting help from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The help the Lord gives us never comes apart from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is like the current of electricity flowing into a building; it never comes apart from the wires.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If there are no wires, the electricity in the generating plant will never come over to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord s Word is like the wire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In every meeting we should eat and drink the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is one point that we must grasp firmly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The home meeting only lasts an hour and a half.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not make good use of the time, before we know it, forty-five minutes will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we let a few say some more unrelated things here and there, another half hour will fly away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the one and a half hours, although the atmosphere is good and everyone is happy, no one received any practical help.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If one does not get any supply in the meeting, he probably will not want to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every home meeting must have some core members.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The core members should grasp the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not let time slip away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, bring out the Lord s Word and read it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps we are not too accustomed to doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our habit is to sing a hymn, have some prayers, read the Bible, and then give some testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not accustomed to carrying on a meeting according to the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must all exercise to get into the Lord s Word properly in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does not mean that we cannot give testimonies of our daily life in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It only means that we must testify according to the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>OUR TESTIMONIES NEEDING TO BE GOVERNED</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>BY THE LORD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us take the morning watch I just spoke of as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A brother said, It is most difficult for us brothers to stay in spirit when we speak to our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that point a brother should have followed with a testimony like this: You are absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Last night as I was speaking to my wife, although I did not lose my temper or get angry, under the light now I see that what I said to my wife was totally not in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time I talked about how this brother and that sister were, how the meeting was, how the church was.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I spoke about spiritual things, but I was not in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of testimony is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do not have a proper testimony along this track, it is better for us not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes the testimonies given by the brothers and sisters in the meetings are not on the track of the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They speak about the North Pole and about the South Pole; there is no track at all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not take the Lord s Word as the track in our testimonies, our speaking will not carry any weight.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE HOME MEETINGS BEING MEETINGS FOR</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>SUPPLYING SPIRITUAL FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the home meetings we should bring out the Lord s Word and have everyone read it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If there is anything that we do not understand, we should refer to the footnotes together.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>First pick up the facts, and then find the explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Read in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After reading the Recovery Version, read the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The home meeting is not a Bible class in a seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We do not need to go through every chapter, every verse, and every word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The home meetings are eating meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we invite people to come, we should only think about how to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is like going to the market to buy a chicken to cook for the family.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>First, you need to pluck the feathers and peel off the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then you need to cut off the beak and the claws.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Last, you need to cook the plump, tender part of the chicken in a tasty way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only then can you bring it to the table and invite your guests to dine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In every home meeting, I have noticed that the brothers and sisters offer people an abundance of physical food.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everyone eats very well.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But I am afraid that after attending such a home meeting, many people still go away hungry in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We all need to change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Every Saturday, when we come together, do not be so polite.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The most important thing is to spread out the Lord s word as a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You brothers and sisters who are the core members should be well prepared on Saturday afternoon for the meeting that evening.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Look up some verses in the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Read the footnotes carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You do not need to read all the footnotes; just read the important ones.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whatever you do, you are preparing a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the people come, you should know how to bring out the tasty dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this way everyone will be well fed and happy.</S>
