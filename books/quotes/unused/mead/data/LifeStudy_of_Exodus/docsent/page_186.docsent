   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO KEEP THE LAW OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY BECOMING ONE WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that we keep the law of God by loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, we keep God s law by becoming one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such oneness is related to the fact that the law was an engagement paper, a covenant of espousal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s goal in giving the law was to make His chosen people one with Him as a wife is one with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law would then impart God s substance into them, usher them into God, and unite them with God in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This union of God with His people in life and nature is portrayed by the type of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2:18-24.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All this indicates that God s law can be kept only by those who love God and are one with Him in life, nature, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible truly is a book of courtship, and our God is a courting God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people may disagree with the statement that God is a courting God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But unless we disregard the Bible, we must admit that this is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible clearly reveals that God is courting man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A number of gospel songs speak of the Lord s calling, and many preachers say that the believers are a people called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This, of course, is true.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, God s calling of sinners to Himself is His way of courting them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His calling is His courting of His seeking people not only to be saved, but also to be His bride loving Him in an affectionate way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is of the Lord s sovereignty that the Song of Songs is included in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, some so-called Christians disagree with the inclusion of Song of Songs in the Bible, viewing it as a secular book, not as a sacred one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in fact Song of Songs is the most sacred of books.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this book the seeker says, I am my beloved s, and my beloved is mine 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we did not have Song of Songs, we probably could not have such an expression regarding our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The hymn Loved with everlasting love has a line in the chorus which says, I am His, and He is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a reference to Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To say that I am my beloved s does not mean that He is the Master possessing us as His servants.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It means that we are His love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This relationship is not that between master and slave, but the affectionate relationship between husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Song of Songs is the most romantic book ever written.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet this book is concerned with the loving relationship between God and His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It presents a portrait of the married life of Christ and those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would remind you that the subject of this message is keeping the law of God by loving Him and His word and becoming one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Keeping the law of God has very much to do with loving Him as a wife loves her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have pointed out repeatedly that in giving the law God was wooing His people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the law was given as an engagement contract, we should not try to keep it apart from loving the Lord and being one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some Christian teachers think that in the New Testament God has abandoned the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is far from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The content of the law along with redemption may be considered an abstract of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, concerning God s law, the content of the New Testament is essentially the same as that of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, throughout the Bible we are told not to have a god other than the one true God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is a jealous God, and we should not have any god in addition to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul refers to God s jealousy in 2 Corinthians 11:2, where he indicates that we should be a chaste virgin to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord must be our unique Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is taught not only in the Ten Commandments, but throughout the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The whole Bible teaches that we should not worship idols.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This charge is not limited to the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, the entire Bible teaches us to use the name of the Lord properly and never to take it in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once again, this commandment is not limited to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In principle, not even the fourth commandment, concerning keeping the Sabbath, is restricted to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, God s people were to have a memorial day as a sign that they belonged to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the old creation this day was the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in the new creation it is the eighth day, the first day of the week, the day of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As those living in the new creation in resurrection, our memorial day is the eighth day, no longer the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although the day has changed for us in the new creation, the principle has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>During the millennium, restored humanity will continue to observe the seventh day Isa 66:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Based upon this fact, the Seventh-Day Adventists argue that believers in this age should continue to observe the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, in the coming millennium the Sabbath will be observed not by God s regenerated people, but by restored and preserved, yet unregenerated, mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although they will be restored to man s state at the time of creation, they will not have the divine life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whereas they will be people of the seventh day, we are those of the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But in either case the Bible teaches that God s people are to have a particular day as a sign of their separation unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have seen that the first four commandments are upheld throughout the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The same is true of the last six commandments concerning honoring parents, not murdering, not committing adultery, not stealing, not bearing false witness, and not coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we abandon the law, we lay aside the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although we must not abandon the law, we should be careful not to abuse it, nor to misuse it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Both the law in particular and the Bible as a whole should be used in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we try to keep the law without contacting God, we shall abuse it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Likewise, if we approach the Bible without touching the Lord, we shall misuse the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Judaizers made the mistake of trying to fulfill the law without contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, they did not become His counterpart, those who keep His law by loving Him and being one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In principle, many Christians are making the same mistake today.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although they read and study the Bible, they do so without contacting the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>While they teach others the knowledge of the Bible, they do not encourage them to contact the Lord in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, they become today s Judaizers, abusing and misusing the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We in the Lord s recovery appreciate pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do not want to read the Bible without contacting the Lord in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must beware of reading the Bible apart from praying and touching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we contact the Lord in the Word, we shall be one with Him in a practical way in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then we shall become His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>By loving the Lord as our Beloved and becoming one with Him, even becoming His love, His word will become the life supply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The law is the condensation of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whenever we contact the Lord in a direct, intimate way, becoming one with Him, His word supplies us with life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>By this life we grow, become His expression, and live in a way which corresponds to what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Such a living corresponds to God s law and to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the proper way to use the law of God and the Word of God.</S>
