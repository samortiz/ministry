   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX WITH THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In meetings with the resurrected Christ, the main factor is the breathing of the Holy Breath, the life-giving Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In meetings for the ascended Christ, the central matter is the blowing of the mighty rushing wind Acts 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means the blowing of the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So in all the meetings with the resurrected Christ, we see Christ breathing Himself into His disciples as the breath of life, the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then in the meetings for the ascended Christ, we see the empowering, the clothing of the Spirit with power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I feel deeply burdened that we still need to see more concerning the meetings with the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that the Lord will recover more and more regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most people have simply become familiar with the stories of these six or seven chapters at the end of the Gospels and the beginning of the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But, as we have seen, in all the pages of the Bible there is the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In all these stories of Christ meeting with His disciples after His resurrection we must receive something as a life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>INDIVIDUALLY AND CORPORATELY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The main point which we must see in all these narratives is that by meeting with His disciples, the resurrected Christ revealed Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are two ways He took to meet with His disciples: The first is the individual way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He met with His disciples individually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He met Mary Magdalene, Peter, and James in an individual way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second was in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That means that He had some meetings with a good number of His disciples at once.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are told in 1 Corinthians 15:6 that at one time He met with over five hundred brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, we may say that there is still another way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes He met not just with one person individually, but with several together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once He met with a few sisters; another time with two brothers as they walked.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He met with them individually, in two s or more, and at least five or six times according to the record with them all together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes He met with the sisters corporately, and sometimes He met with the brothers corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the account of the Bible, the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples after His resurrection, either individually or corporately, about eleven or twelve times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is difficult to come to a definite conclusion regarding this matter, because it is not so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But there are at least from eleven to twelve instances.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let me mention them again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the morning of the resurrection day, the Lord Jesus firstly appeared to one sister alone, Mary Magdalene John 20:14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After that, in the same morning, He appeared to a few sisters together as they went to tell His disciples that He was risen Matt 28:8-10; Luke 24:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thirdly, during the day, the Lord Jesus purposely appeared to Peter 1 Cor 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, in the afternoon, or in the early evening, He appeared to two disciples on their way to Emmaus Luke 24:13-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fifth instance of His appearing was that night, when He appeared to all the leading disciples in the room with the doors shut John 20:19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sixth was the following Lord s day, seven days later at that time He appeared again to His leading disciples including Thomas John 20:24-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The seventh was His appearance to His disciples on the mountain in Galilee appointed by Him Matt 28:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eighth, He appeared to His disciples on the shore of the Sea of Tiberius John 21:1-23 ; ninth, to five hundred people at once 1 Cor 15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The tenth was His appearance to James, individually 1 Cor 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Number eleven, according to 1 Corinthians 15:7, was to all the Apostles it is rather difficult to decide whether this was another separate appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then eventually He appeared to the disciples on the Mount of Olives, when He ascended to the heavens Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:6-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to this enumeration we have twelve instances.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But Acts 1:3 tells us that He was seen of them forty days ; so this allows for many additional appearances.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>HIS CONTINUAL PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Howbeit, we must learn something here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not take these just as stories.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many people no doubt have missed the mark, making the Bible either a story book or a book of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Most people take this account purely as a story, without even deriving much teaching from it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Lord s intention is not to tell us some stories.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John said that he did not record everything if he did, even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only certain cases are related to fulfill the Lord s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Based upon this principle, we must look at these verses to see not a story, but a portrait revealing something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here in these few chapters Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20 and 21, and Acts 1 is a full record as a kind of portrait revealing the presence of the resurrected Christ, showing how living He is and how He is with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are alone, He is with us; if we are two or three, He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you are three sisters together, He is with you; if we are two brothers together, He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you are one who is seeking and loving Him, He is with you; or if you are one who has failed like Peter, He is also with you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether you are strong or weak, He is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whether you are in the room or walking on the road, He is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whether we are on the mountain or by the seashore, He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whether we understand or do not understand, He is still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whether we are conscious of His presence or not conscious of His presence, the resurrected Christ is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is so strange and interesting to see that when we are not conscious of His presence, He is more with us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When those two dear but poor brothers on their way to Emmaus were speaking with Him and even rebuking Him You came from Jerusalem, don t you know what s going on there?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He was so much with them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But once their eyes were opened and they realized it was the Lord, He vanished.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you think He left them?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No, He just disappeared in order to train them, in order to help them realize not only His visible presence, but even more His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His visible presence is not so precious as His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you are quite conscious of the Lord s presence sometimes, it is not as good as when you are unconscious of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Can you follow me?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many times we are not conscious of His presence; yet that is the most wonderful time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By all these stories we realize the wonderful presence of the resurrected and living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Never forget that one verse, Lo, I am with you all the days Matt 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He did not say, I have been with you, or I was with you, or I shall be with you, but, Lo, I am with you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He used the present tense.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Lo, I am with you all the days.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>By what way?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By any way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I wish to point out one thing more regarding His appearances.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord Jesus is rather sneaky may the Lord allow me to use this word.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The sisters were told to go and tell the disciples that He would meet them in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If I were there, I would have said, All right, the Lord Jesus is going to meet us in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>So I will not go to the meeting tonight; He will not appear then.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I will do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But in the evening of that very day, the Lord Jesus came and joined their meeting!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He came not to Galilee, but into a room in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>That visit was not appointed by Him; He came without notifying them He just came.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He did not even knock at the door; He just came in. When they were so frightened and disappointed, yet with some startling reports of His resurrection, He suddenly appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If I were Peter, I would say, Lord, You told us that You would meet us in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Why did You come tonight without any notice?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I tell you, the Lord s presence is visible as well as invisible, conscious as well as unconscious.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Lord sometimes notifies us of His presence and more often does not.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We just do not know where we will meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Everywhere He meets us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In any case, however, wherever, whenever, He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He is always with us.</S>
