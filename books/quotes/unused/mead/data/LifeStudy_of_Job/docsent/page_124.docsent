   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AN ADDITIONAL MESSAGE THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:10; 3:8-10; 1 Tim 1:4; Gal 1:15-16; Col 3:4a; John 12:24; 19:34; Rom 5:10; John 3:3, 5-6; Titus 3:5; 1 Pet 2:2; Eph 4:12-13; 1 Cor 14:3; Eph 4:15-16; Rom 8:2; 1 Cor 15:45b; Phil 1:19b; 1 Cor 12:13b; John 7:37-39; Gal 5:16, 25</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are two great things in the Bible the divine dispensing and the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will cover these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. THE DIVINE ECONOMY BEING GOD'S ETERNAL PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>TO DISPENSE CHRIST INTO HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word economy is an anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia, which means "household law" or "household management" or "household administration" and derivatively "administrative dispensation," "plan," "economy."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine economy is God's eternal plan to dispense Christ into His chosen people to produce, constitute, and build up the organic Body of Christ Eph 1:10; 3:8-10; 1 Tim 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, for God to dispense Christ into His chosen people actually means that God dispenses Himself in Christ into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In brief, God's economy is to gain a Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This Body is the enlargement of the Triune God for His expression that He may be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE DIVINE DISPENSING BEING TO IMPART CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AS LIFE AND THE LIFE SUPPLY INTO HIS BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The divine dispensing is to impart Christ as life and the life supply into His believers Gal 1:15-16; Col 3:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. In God's Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This dispensing of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is first in God's redemption John 12:24; 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The central point, the goal, of God's redemption is not merely to redeem us from our sins and from the condemnation of sin eternal perdition , but to release, that is, to dispense, God Himself as the divine life into His redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 12:24 says that Christ in His incarnation as a grain of wheat fell into the ground and died.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as there is life in a grain of wheat, within the human shell of Christ's physical body there was the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He was on earth in the flesh, the divine life within Him was concealed in the shell of His human body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He went to the cross and died, and the death of the cross broke this human shell and released the divine life to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is to release the divine life into all these grains.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Also, John 19:34 says that when Christ died on the cross, two elements, blood and water, flowed out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Blood is for redemption, and water is for the releasing of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the redeeming death of Christ becomes the life-releasing death.</S>
