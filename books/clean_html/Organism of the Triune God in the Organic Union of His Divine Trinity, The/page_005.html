<h2 class="head2">An Issue of the Spirit as the Consummation<br />
of the Flow of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the consummation of the flow of the divine Trinity. The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow. There is such a divine flow in this universe, and this flow has been consummated, or completed, by the flowing Spirit. This flow issues in the organism of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Seal Christ&rsquo;s Redeemed Ones<br />
with the Essence and Likeness of the Triune God</h2>
<p>The Spirit seals Christ&rsquo;s redeemed ones with the essence and likeness of the Triune God, making them a particular possession of the processed Triune God (Eph. 1:13). The sealing Spirit is the consummation of the divine flow. When a seal is placed on a sheet of paper, the ink essence in the form, the likeness, of the seal is applied to the paper and saturates it. Thus, the ink, the form of the seal, and the paper are mingled as one item. We were like a blank piece of paper before we received the Lord. But when we called on the Lord Jesus, we were sealed with the Holy Spirit. This sealing continues until we are fully redeemed in our body (Eph. 4:30). As we continue to call on the Lord, we continue to be sealed by the indwelling Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God. He seals us with the essence of the processed Triune God, the One who has passed through the processes of incarnation, death on the cross, and resurrection. The Triune God becomes the very ink with which we are being sealed. Now upon us, the blank paper, are the ink and the form of the seal. We are mingled with the Triune God as the sealing Spirit, and this causes us to bear His likeness. This is the dispensing, the impartation, of the Triune God into our being issuing in the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Be a Pledge of God to the Sealed Ones</h2>
<p>After sealing us, this seal becomes a pledge of God to the sealed ones, guaranteeing that God is their inheritance for their satisfaction (Eph. 1:14). On the one hand, we were made God&rsquo;s inheritance for God&rsquo;s enjoyment (1:11, 18). On the other hand, we were made to inherit God as our inheritance for our enjoyment. In Christ we were made an inheritance of God, and under the sealing of the Spirit, we enjoy God as the pledge of our inheritance. The church as the organism of the Triune God is the issue of the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Accomplished by the Transmission<br />
of the Great Power of God</h2>
<p>The dispensing of the divine Trinity to produce the organism of the Triune God is accomplished by the transmission of the great power of God (Eph. 1:19-23). This power raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him in the heavenlies, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things (vv. 19-22). This power that has accomplished so much is transmitted to the church. The transmission of this great, divine power to the church makes it the Body of Christ, an organism of the Triune God (vv. 22-23). Christ is Head over all things &ldquo;to the church.&rdquo; &ldquo;To the church&rdquo; implies a kind of transmission. Whatever God has wrought in and upon Christ is transmitted to the church to make the church the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ. The organism of the Triune God is an issue of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. The church is the issue of the operating Triune God, and this issue becomes the organism of the invisible Triune God. The church is altogether organic, altogether of life. This life is the divine life signified by the tree of life. We are partaking of this tree of life, enjoying this divine life, so that we can be the very Body of Christ expressed in different localities as local churches. The local churches as the expression of the one Body of Christ should have nothing to do with organization but should be totally organic. We need to see that the church, which is the Body of Christ, is absolutely organic.</p>
