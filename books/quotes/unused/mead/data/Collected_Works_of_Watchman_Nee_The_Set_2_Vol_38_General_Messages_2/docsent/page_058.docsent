   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN LIVING BY THE LAW OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:1-2 THE FAILURE OF LIVING BY THE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Christian life an important principle is to live not by one's own will but by the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians, especially the young ones, do not see this, nor have they learned this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The strength of their living is dependent upon their will and sustained by their will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They dare not put aside their will for even a moment, because they know that they will stumble and their Christian living will cease.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The living of many Christians is dependent upon their will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brothers and sisters, even if you have been a Christian for many years, do not think that you no longer live by your will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many still maintain their Christian living by their will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps you still do not know the extent to which your will occupies your living and how much ground you have given your will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The person in Romans 7 is one who lives by his will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The "evil" is his acts, and the "good" is his will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, he says, "For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice" v. 19 . All of his "good" is in his will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He can comfort himself by saying, "I want God; I want God's will; I want to obey God's will."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He can comfort himself also by saying, "I do not want to sin, I hate sin, and I want to serve Him; my sole purpose is to please God."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He can say, "I want God's will and I want to please God; I want to do only things that are good, and I will glorify God's name."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He may make many resolutions in his will, but he can do nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a gross misconception in his thinking that whether or not a man can do good is dependent on whether or not he wills to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He does not see that doing good or evil is a matter of a law, not a matter of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He does not see that even if he has decided to do good, he will only experience failure and disappointment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Quite a few brothers and sisters say, "I truly want God's will, I truly want to please God, and I am truly doing things according to God's law."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A brother may be saying these things and at the same time wonder, "Why don't I receive what I seek before God, and why am I doing all the things that are contrary to my will?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many brothers and sisters wonder and say, "Why can't I do what I will, and why do I instead do what I do not will?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, God wants to show you one thing in this situation: Your willpower cannot be the power of your living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps you still do not know how much you live by your will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, let us first take a look at how man lives by his will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A clear sign of living by the will is refusing to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people refuse to let go of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This does not mean that Christians do not need restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But many Christians hold on to themselves; they will not let go of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is an arduous task being a Christian who puts a very tight grip on himself, thinking that a Christian must be careful in the way he eats, the way he walks, the way he rides a streetcar, and the way he talks with his family.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From morning to evening he keeps a firm hold on himself in order to behave like a Christian and in order to walk, eat, and travel properly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seems that one can only be a Christian when he firmly holds on to himself and carefully bridles himself!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He thinks that once he lets loose of his grip, he will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the situation of many Christians who live by their will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They firmly hold on to themselves in an effort to live like Christians; they force themselves to act like Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is like trying to make a stream flow upward.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians are trying to make water flow upstream; they force themselves to behave like someone they are not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people compel themselves to be like someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are not that kind of person, but they stubbornly try to be that kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What do they do?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They exercise their own will to put a tight hold on themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people strenuously try to be Christians this way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They make the strength of their will the power of their life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should remember that if we have to exert so much effort to be a Christian, we are surely not this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we were this kind of person, we would not need to expend such a great effort.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Oh, there are many things which are difficult to turn our eyes from!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are many things which are difficult to refuse, and there are many foods which are difficult to resist.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How much effort do we need before we can control ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How much effort do we need before we can refrain from speaking improperly?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How much effort do we need before we can refrain from going places that we should not go?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are things that we naturally like to do, and we spontaneously do them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we want to stop, we must force ourselves not to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, if you were raised in Shanghai, do you need to say, "I am determined to speak Shanghainese; I must speak Shanghainese; I will speak Shanghainese.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I need to be careful not to speak the Shantung dialect or the Cantonese dialect"?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No, you do not need to will yourself to do this, because you are a Shanghainese, and you will naturally speak Shanghainese.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if you are not a Shanghainese and you want to speak Shanghainese, you need to exert effort to speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To live by the will is to try to be a certain type of person when you are not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you try to force yourself to be a certain type of person, the only thing you can do is exercise the will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are land creatures, and it is natural for us to live on land; if we want to live in water, we must exercise our will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are two kinds of people who try to be Christians according to their willpower.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First, there are those who have not been regenerated; they have not been born of God and have never received God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, they must exert considerable effort to compel themselves to be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many so-called Christians are actually not Christians at all; they are merely trying to be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since they want to be Christians, they sing a few hymns because other Christians sing hymns, and they say a few "hallelujahs" because others say hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But whether singing hymns or saying hallelujahs, they do it all with considerable unease.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When other Christians speak, it is real, but when they speak, they do not feel a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>People who are like this are pretending to be Christians; therefore, it is very unnatural for them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Second, there are those who are born again and who are God's children, but who do not believe in the life that God has given them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They have the life, but they do not live by this life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Their salvation experience is unclear; their regeneration experience is also not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They did not hear the complete gospel, and they have not fully believed in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They fail often and are weak to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They cannot believe that the life within them can swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They are accustomed to sin and have failed constantly; therefore, they concede that no other experience is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They consider themselves as standard Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thank God, they are absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Brothers and sisters, just because you have not experienced the mighty power of God's life, do not say that the life that God has given you is as weak and powerless as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thank God that His life comes with great power!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As long as a man dares to believe in God's Word, God's life will manifest its mighty power in him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God's life cannot manifest its mighty power in many people because they either do not have the life or they have not fully believed.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When one genuinely believes, he will testify that God's Word is fully trustworthy.</S>
