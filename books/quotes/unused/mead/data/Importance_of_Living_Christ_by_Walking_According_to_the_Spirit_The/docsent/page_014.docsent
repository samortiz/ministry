   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT LIVING THE BODY LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 12; 1 Cor 12; 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, we pray for the churches in Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We ask You to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Show us the proper way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, cover us from any frustrations, attacks, or disturbances from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We trust in Your cleansing, covering, and prevailing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to see more concerning the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are four main chapters in the New Testament concerning the Body life Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4, and Colossians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These chapters were all written by Paul, the only New Testament writer to use the expression the Body of Christ to describe the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to know what the Body life is, we must study these four chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even the order of these chapters in the New Testament is meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 12, the first of the four chapters, lays the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE BODY LIFE REVEALED IN ROMANS 12 Presenting Our Body a Living Sacrifice to God</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 12 begins with an exhortation to present our physical body as a living sacrifice to God v. 1 . In order to do this, our body must be released from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to understand the matter of presenting our body as a living sacrifice to God in Romans 12, we must go back to chapters 6 through 8.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 6:6 we see that our body is the body of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then in 7:24 we are told that our body is the body of this death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Genesis 1:27, God made man in His image so that man could fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the fall brought in sin and death, which damaged man and annulled his body for the fulfilling of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The body of sin is strong in sinning against God, but the body of this death is weak in acting to serve and please God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 8:11 tells us that our body is a mortal body, in other words, a dying body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a sense, we begin dying the day that we are born.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Apart from God s salvation, we are only dying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, when we are saved, God enters our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He first enters our inmost part, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Accordingly, Romans 8:10 shows that life is imparted into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then as we walk according to the spirit v. 4 , life spreads from our spirit to our mind, which represents our soul v. 6 . If we allow the Spirit of the Triune God to indwell us, to occupy us, life will eventually spread to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way our body of sin and of death is recovered to become living and active for the fulfilling of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is such a body that we can present as a living sacrifice to God for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is natural and religious to try to present our body to serve the Lord without the revelation of Romans 6 8.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These chapters reveal that our body is the body of sin and of death and that our mortal body needs to be enlivened in order to be prepared, proper, qualified, and capable for God s use.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is only such a body that we can present to God for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot present the body of sin and of death to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, Romans 8:2 says, The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The context of this verse indicates that to be freed from the law of sin and of death means to have our body freed from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 11 says, If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is to set the body of sin and of death free from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First our spirit and our soul are freed from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ultimately, our body is also freed so that our entire tripartite being is freed from the dominion of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then our body is qualified to be presented to God, for God can use only such a freed body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, we need to walk according to the spirit so that our body will be freed from sin and death, given life, and qualified to be presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When our body is ready to be presented to God, our entire being is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are composed of three parts, but these parts are not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is impossible to have a spirit and soul that are holy and a body that is not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we walk according to the spirit, our spirit, soul, and body will be free from sin and death and full of life, and our body will be qualified to be presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a basic requirement for the Body life, for if our body is not presented to God, we cannot have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to have the Body life, the primary requirement is to present to God a freed and enlivened body, which is able to serve God to fulfill His purpose.</S>
