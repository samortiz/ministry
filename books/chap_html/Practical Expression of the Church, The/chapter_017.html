<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>FUNCTION BY PRAY-READING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture reading: Deuteronomy 27:14-26; Revelation 5:9-14; 19:1-6; 1 Corinthians 14:16</h1><p>In the last chapter, we mentioned the release of the spirit. Without the release of the spirit, there is no real function of life in the church. We may have certain functions of teachings, doctrines, and knowledge, but we cannot have any function of life if there is no release of the spirit. This is because “it is the Spirit that gives life.” The function of life in the church requires the release of the spirit. And we have found by our own experiences that the best way to release the spirit is by pray-reading the Word. To find a proper way that really is effective in releasing our spirit, we must try pray-reading the Word.<h2 class=head1>“AMEN” TO THE WORD</h2><p>We need to see something more regarding the pray-reading of the Word. The pray-reading we have had in the past is still not adequate. When we pray-read, we deal with the Word of God. We as human beings are very dull and slow when we come to the Word of God. We may be intelligent in reading scientific or philosophical books, but when we come to the Bible, we are blind. Something may be clear and definite in the Bible, but we may read it again and again, study it diligently, and even make careful research without seeing it.<p>Have you ever noticed that in Deuteronomy 27:14-26, the people say “Amen” to the Word of God twelve times? We must say “Amen” to the Word of God! The people of God in the Old Testament were even ordained by God to practice this. They had to say “Amen” to every word at the closing of God’s Word in this chapter. Have you ever heard God’s people say “Amen” to His Word? There are nine blessings in Matthew 5—“Blessed are they.” Have you ever said “Amen” to these blessings? I have been a Christian for more than forty years, and I have never heard this.<p>Some may say that this is something of the Old Testament. But in 1 Corinthians 14:16, the Apostle Paul tells us to pray with clear words that others might say “Amen” to our prayers. Moreover, the saying of “Amen” is not just something done on earth, but also in the heavens. Revelation 5 says that when the Lord Jesus ascended into the heavens, the heavens were filled with “Amen.” Revelation also shows us that in the future there will be a great “Amen” in the heavens. It is not just a matter on earth, but also in the heavens.<h2 class=head1>NOT ONLY SINGING, BUT SAYING</h2><p>Have you ever seen a church on the earth doing this? You may say that you have seen quite a number of churches singing, “Amen, Hallelujah.” But that is singing, not saying. In Revelation 5 and 19, it is saying, not singing. It is not a kind of singing, but a kind of saying. Have you ever seen Christians gathering just to say, “Amen, Hallelujah”? I have heard Christians singing, “Amen, Hallelujah” many times, but I have never heard a group of Christians saying, “Amen, Hallelujah!” What must we say “Amen” to? We must say “Amen” to the Word of God. Have you ever heard or practiced this? I believe that the Lord will lead us to do this.<p>Suppose we were to read Ephesians 4:4-7. When I read “One body,” you all will say, “Amen!” When I say “One spirit,” you all will say, “Amen!” And when I read “One hope,” you will say, “Amen!”…“One Lord”…“Amen,” and so on. I believe that would be marvelous! Let us come together to “Amen” the Word of the Lord. When we open the Bible, we can say “Amen” to every word. When we say “Amen” to the Word, it will release the spirit. Take any book, any chapter, any phrase, and read. Then say “Amen” to what you read.<p>Sometimes we should let the sisters read and the brothers say “Amen.” At other times, we can have just four brothers stand up and read, and all the rest say, “Amen.” When we have a large congregation, we can have ten read, and all the congregation say “Amen.” I believe they are already doing this in Taipei. There, they have an enormous crowd to say, “Amen.”<p>Without mercy, grace and heavenly enlightenment, we cannot see this. But, praise the Lord, we do have this enlightenment. Why do we only use hymns to praise the Lord and not the Bible also? The Bible is full of praises. We must learn to say the Word together, to pray-read the Word together. We not only need to sing the music, but to say the words. That means to pray-read the words. I do believe that after pray-reading the Word in this way for a short time, our spirit will be released. It is wonderful and it is so good. We do not need to compose anything, it is composed already. We only need to pray-read and say “Amen” to every part of the Word.
