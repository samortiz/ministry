Angels are spirits, and they are distinct from God Himself. Later God created man. Man is a soul, and he is also distinct from God Himself. Until the age of the kingdom, man has the freedom to obey or disobey God. When God created the church, however, He created a Body. Christ Himself is our Head. The life which God has put in us is the same life that is in Christ. We can be one with Christ because we bear Christ's nature. The Head and the Body are absolutely in union; the submission found here is absolute. There is no friction between the Head and the Body; the Head spontaneously directs all the members of the Body, and the members of the Body spontaneously obey the Head. When the human head initiates something, the body physiologically responds in certain ways. Psychological activity triggers physiological activity. The transmission between the psyche and the body is wonderful. When an idea comes to the mind, it is transmitted to the members through the nervous system, and the members act accordingly. This is the mystery of the body. We do not feel that the head and the body are two different things. In fact, they cannot be separated from each other.</p><p>Submission in the body is spontaneous and natural. Many movements of the body have their origin in the subconscious or unconscious part of the psyche. One can differentiate between conscious and subconscious activities in a textbook, but in actual life, the difference is not that apparent. One does not make deliberate distinctions between conscious and subconscious motions. When a part of the body is under duress, such as when an arm is wounded, a person becomes very conscious of that member, especially when he tries to move it. If I ask whether or not you breathed yesterday, you will not have any conscious memory of breathing, but you were breathing. If you are sick with tuberculosis, you will think about your breathing and be conscious of it all the time. When you are healthy, you do not give the slightest thought to such functions, but even though you are unaware of the movement of the body, the head directs it unceasingly. The oneness and harmony between the head and the body are beyond human description. In the body God's authority can be fully illustrated. The submission of the body to the head is the most perfect example of submission to authority. The Lord requires a submission from us that matches that of the body to the head. May the Lord lead us to see the Body of Christ and to realize that this is where God's authority is manifested. No member should be sick; none should murmur, complain, rebel, or be discordant. God desires that we express His authority. If we stand fast, God will have a way to go on. We hope that we will manifest God's authority in this way. If any friction arises among us, it proves that we are short of the manifestation of divine authority. The Body of Christ is not only the place where brothers and sisters fellowship and love one another; it is the place where God's authority is expressed. The relationship among us should be one of spontaneity and harmony; we are not compelled to be together. We are an institution that expresses God's authority, and submission among us should be very spontaneous.</p><h2 class="head1">INDIRECT MANIFESTATION OF AUTHORITY</h2><p>Authority is not only expressed directly in the body, but indirectly as well. For example, the hand helps the foot. To the foot, the hand appears to be helping, but in reality, the whole body is helping it. The head directs the hand to help the foot. Many people realize that there is a oneness of life among the members, but they do not see that there is also a oneness of authority among the members. The church is not only an institution of life but also an institution of authority. If the foot rejects the hand, it rejects the head. The hand does not move by itself; it moves by the authority of the head. Therefore, when the hand helps the foot and the foot rejects it, the foot is rejecting the head. When the foot has a need, the hand is not the only member that helps it; all the members of the body join in to help. Therefore, we have to acknowledge the authority in the members. Acknowledging the authority in the members is acknowledging the authority of the head.</p><p>It is impossible to deny the authority of the members without denying the authority of the Head at the same time. It is impossible to reject deputy authority without rejecting the authority of the Head at the same time. Deputy authority is God's ordination for the Body. In Shanghai I once said that every member of the Body is an authority to us. As a member we only possess our own function. If I am a hand in the Body of Christ, my function is limited to that of the hand. If I want to walk, I have to depend on the feet. Although the hand possesses a great variety of functions, it has to look to the feet for walking. If the hand wants to walk by itself, it puts a very hard task upon itself. If the feet refuse to walk, the hand can do nothing. It is likewise impossible for the hand to know color by touching it. It can try for a lifetime, but it will never distinguish different colors. Once the eyes see, they identify color. The hand cannot see anything by itself; therefore, it needs the judgment of the eyes. The functioning of the eyes becomes the authority to the hand. If God has appointed a certain person to be the eye, everyone has to go to him for seeing. The same can be said of the functions of the nose and the ears. The function of every member in the Body becomes its authority. If any member tries to replace another member, the result will be trouble. The problem today is that everyone acts as if he is a whole body in himself; everyone thinks that he is omnipotent and can do everything. This is impossible. We are not the Body of Christ; we are only a little member. We have to accept the functions of the other members. If we all stand on the ground of a member, we will become useful. Some are mouths, and they can speak. Others are eyes, and they can see. Some are ears, and they can hear. Others are noses, and they can smell. Still others are hands, and they can work. We all have to maintain our standing, receive other members, and coordinate together. We may not see something ourselves, but others have seen it; they are our eyes. Their seeing is our seeing. We may not have heard something ourselves, but others have heard it; they are our ears. Their hearing becomes our hearing. What the mouths have spoken, we have spoken. If we can see this, we will rejoice, and we will be able to submit and receive.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
