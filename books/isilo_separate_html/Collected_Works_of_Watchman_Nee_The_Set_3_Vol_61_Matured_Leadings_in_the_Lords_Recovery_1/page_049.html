Please do not take this word in a light way. The church does not exist on this earth for any other purpose. It does not exist for jobs, education, or its own future. The church exists for the gospel of God, but how many brothers and sisters remember that they do not live for their business, family, living, and future, but for the gospel? When we were saved, God gave us not only a new life but also a new profession, which is the preaching of His gospel. On the day we were saved, not only did our old life die, but our old profession died as well. The basic problem with many brothers and sisters is that though their life has changed, their professions have not changed; they are still pursuing their former resolves. They want to be ahead of others, earning fame and riches. Some young people have not yet entered a profession, yet they are already dreaming of the day when they will be a great doctor or a famous engineer. If a Christian does not experience a change in his profession, he cannot become God's means. This is the reason we want the brothers and sisters to hand themselves over. We can call this a handing over, or we can call this consecration. We are for the fact, not the terminology. The Bible says that every saved person is changed in his life as well as his profession; he has become a preacher of the gospel.</p><p>Many of the co-workers have the wrong concept that some people are specially called by God to be workers. Some of us think that we change our profession because we have acquired some kind of gift, but this is wrong. The Bible does talk about different gifts, but the Bible does not say that Christians have different professions. We have the same life, and we have the same profession. I have searched through the whole Bible. I cannot find one case where a person has a new life but does not change his profession. We may think that it is enough for our life to change, but this is wrong. Our profession must change as well. When I was saved, I became God's goal. When I changed my profession, I became God's means. I, my very person, became His way. The profession that God assigns for a Christian is dedicated entirely to the gospel. God has not only given us a new life; He wants to use us as His means to save others. The Bible shows us that God did not give this new profession&mdash;the proclamation of the gospel&mdash;to individuals only. The spreading of the gospel cannot be achieved by one man alone. God's commandment concerning the spreading of the gospel is for the whole church. Please remember that in sending out the disciples for the gospel work, the Lord did not say "go," singular, but "go," plural (Matt. 28:19). In the Gospels the Lord sent the disciples out two by two (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1). When there were more people, He sent out groups of more than two. For example, in Acts we see Peter and John and we also see Paul and Barnabas. In Samaria we see Peter and John (8:14), but in the visit to the house of Cornelius in Caesarea, we see Peter with six other disciples (10:23-24; 11:12). More than two joined him. In Antioch the first apostles who went out were Paul and Barnabas (13:2-3). Later many others joined them (15:39-40). The church exists on this earth for the gospel.</p><p>I would like to consider one question with the brothers and sisters today: What is the church? What should the church be likened to? The church is the means of God; it is God's means to reach the world with the gospel. Protestantism has given us good as well as bad examples during the past one hundred and forty or fifty years. It drew men's attention to the revivalists or evangelists. It sent many people to foreign lands, but these efforts can be likened to the garment hawkers on the streets of Chungking or Shanghai during the war: Everyone was selling his own wares. The result was isolated cases of revival. The Bible, however, does not show us a scattered preaching of the gospel. The Bible says that the whole church gives itself to the Lord for the gospel. The church is God's means; individuals here and there are not God's means. The church spreads the gospel, not one or two individuals doing isolated evangelistic work. What is the place of the church in God's plan? In God's plan, the entire church on earth is God's way, His means. The church exists on earth for the gospel. The church has only one profession&mdash;the spreading of the gospel. Every Christian receives a new profession after he is regenerated&mdash;preaching the gospel. It is not a matter of individuals preaching the gospel in an isolated fashion, but the church preaching the gospel in coordination.</p><p>We do not need to talk about this matter to those who are not saved. Once we are saved, we have to see clearly that God has changed our profession. We are not to serve individually. We all have only one profession now, which is to preach the gospel. In the past, Protestantism only encouraged men toward a kind of individual and isolated evangelism. It was good, but not good enough. Today God's way is for the whole Body to rise up in one accord to preach the gospel. For this, the church must coordinate together before it can preach the gospel. Without coordination, it cannot preach the gospel.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
