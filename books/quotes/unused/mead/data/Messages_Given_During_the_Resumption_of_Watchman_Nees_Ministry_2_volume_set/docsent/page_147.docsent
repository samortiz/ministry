   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE BODY AND ITS MEMBERS CO-WORKERS' MEETING 10</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Date:April 17, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Speaker:Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE TRUTH Truth Bearing No Relationship with Man</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In learning to take care of God's work, one basic lesson is to be absolute for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No truth in the Bible is involved with man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today, man is not absolute toward the truth because he gets himself involved with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because the truth becomes involved with man, when a man does not experience a truth, he feels that he cannot speak that truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet a person has to realize that it is not because he has the experience that he is qualified to speak concerning a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Truth is absolute in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>David said that all men speak vanity Psa 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he spoke this word, he was not considering himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before God, David considered himself a non-existing person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's servants cannot look inward into themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's truth is absolute; it is not involved with us in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because the truth is absolute, we have to sacrifice ourselves, and we have to put ourselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man always sacrifices God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Yu and his wife are both here.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose there is something that a wife should not do in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Can our brother's wife do it simply because she is a responsible brother's wife?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The responsible brothers often deal with themselves in one way and deal with others in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have to ask whether or not a thing ought to be done, then we have to put the same question to everyone involved in similar cases.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A responsible brother cannot say that if such a case involves others, the question ought to be asked, whereas if such a case involves his own wife, the question can be skipped.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times, we want God's truth to follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We become involved with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, we ourselves are drawn into the involvement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Last year two brothers came to me and asked if a certain responsible brother had done something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I answered that they considered the matter wrong only because they were not the responsible brothers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they were the responsible brothers, they would not have considered it wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what I mean by man affecting God's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to realize that the condition of an individual has nothing to do with God's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If truth is affected by man, the truth will become the truth no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the truth is not something absolute for you, you do not know God, and you do not know God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Foochow, twenty-seven brothers and sisters came and met with me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Originally, it was only going to be a talk between Brother Lee, Sister Wang, and me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the end, all the others came.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I could only present the truth to the brothers there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What I am personally cannot affect what God's truth is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot say that a teaching is right simply because others are good to us, and we cannot consider the same teaching wrong simply because others are not good to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once the truth becomes affected by human factors, it becomes no more the truth; it becomes something else.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the truth is not absolute in you, you cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The truth can never be controlled by man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I cannot say that something is right simply because you and I are from the same school or were born in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>So many problems in the world arise and so many disputes in teachings result not because of a change in the truth itself, but because of changes in human factors.</S>
