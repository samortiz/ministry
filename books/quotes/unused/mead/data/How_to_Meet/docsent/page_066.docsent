   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE PRAISING FROM PSALM FORTY-FIVE WITH A BUBBLING HEART</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here in Psalm 45 we have some principles for composing praises to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first principle is that the heart is bubbling over with a good matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we look into the entire Psalm, we see that this good matter concerns the King and the Queen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The King, we know, is Christ, and the Queen is the church; hence, the good matter with which the heart of the Psalmist bubbles over is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do need something concerning Christ and the church bubbling over within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This word bubbling, which in the King James Version is translated inditing, means boiling up in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Something is so burning within us that we boil or bubble over.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to be burned with the good matter of Christ, the King, and we need to be burned with the beauty of the church, the Queen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be so burned that our heart simply bubbles over.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the first principle of composing praises to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brothers and sisters, if you come to the meetings and do not have anything bubbling over within you, you are certainly wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I say this politely.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If I were not so polite, I would say forgive me that you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You are not only wrong, but dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why are you so quiet in the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not say that you are just being nice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If so, you are deadly nice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that you will be nice in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would praise the Lord, we need something bubbling over within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, this requires experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>COMPOSING PRAISES</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second principle concerning the praising of the Lord is found in the Psalmist s statement, I speak what I have composed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Psalmist has prepared something, he has composed something to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What he speaks is what he has already composed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So we all need to learn how to compose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not compose in the meeting that is too late.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must bring to the meetings what you have already prepared and composed before coming.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 14:26 says, When ye come together, every one of you hath a Psalm, hath a teaching, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This verse clearly indicates that at the time of meeting those who gather together already have something.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It does not say that everyone will have something, but that everyone has something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you come to the meeting, you should be able to say, Hallelujah, I come to the meeting with a praise already composed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I speak what I have composed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not mean that we must compose our praises with knowledge in our mentality, but with experiences in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, consider the knowledge we have just received in the past chapters concerning the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not compose praises simply according to this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need fresh composition drawn from our fresh experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps in the past few days you have experienced the sweet odor of the incense expelling the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever you utter something as incense to the Lord, the evil one is driven away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have learned this experientially; therefore, you need to compose something out of this experience as a kind of new and living composition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you come to the meeting you can offer this at the proper time as a bubbling over of what you have already composed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our meetings then will all be new not new in doctrine, teaching or knowledge, but new in the freshness of praises from our current experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must forever gather new experiences and put them into praise, either by singing, testimony, or worship directed to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all need such preparation for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a matter for professionals, and this is our profession.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our job is the priesthood; we are all priests of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As priests we need to be professional, we need to be expert in burning the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From this there is no vacation: every day is a day for exercising our profession in composing praises to the Lord from our fresh experience.</S>
