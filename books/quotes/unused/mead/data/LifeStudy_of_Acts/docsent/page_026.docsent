   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE TEN THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN JERUSALEM, JUDEA, AND SAMARIA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PETER S COMPANY 5 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:14-47</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Peter s first message to the Jews 2:14-47 we see four matters: the explaining of the economical filling of the Holy Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>14-21 , the witnessing of the Man Jesus in His work, death, resurrection, and ascension vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>22-36 , the instructing and entreating of the Spirit-moved ones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>37-41 , and the beginning of the church life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>42-47 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the foregoing message we covered Peter s explanation of the economical filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us now go on to consider his witness concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>WITNESSING OF THE MAN JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>IN HIS WORK, DEATH, RESURRECTION,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AND ASCENSION His Work God s Demonstration of Him</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 2:22 Peter says, Men, Israelites, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man demonstrated by God to you by works of power and wonders and signs, which God did through Him in your midst, even as you yourselves know.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first message of the apostles preaching of the gospel is focused on a Man whom Luke in his Gospel presented to his readers from His conception through His birth, youth, life on earth, death, and resurrection, to His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now Luke s succeeding narrative goes on to tell us that this Man was preached by the apostles as the God-ordained Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek word translated demonstrated in verse 22 literally means to point out, to exhibit, to show forth, in the sense of proving by demonstration, thus bringing about an approval.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that the Lord s work was God s demonstration of Him, His exhibition of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While Christ was living and ministering, whatever He did was an exhibition of the fact that His work was done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the four Gospels we have the exhibition of a wonderful Person, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Gospels exhibit this God-man as the One who was fully tested, proved, and approved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter s thought in verse 22 is that Jesus was fully tested, proved, and approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His Death according to God s Determined</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Counsel and Foreknowledge</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 2:23 we see that the Lord s death was according to God s determined counsel and foreknowledge: This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to the cross and killed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This determined counsel must be a counsel held by the Trinity before the foundation of the world 1 Pet 1:20; Rev 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that the Lord s crucifixion was not an accident in human history, but a purposeful fulfillment of the divine counsel determined by the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ s death was also according to the foreknowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be His redeeming Lamb John 1:29 for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world 1 Pet 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was done according to God s eternal purpose and plan, not accidentally.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, in the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain Rev 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen that the divine Trinity held a counsel concerning the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In that counsel it was determined that the second of the Trinity would become a man and die on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the Lord s crucifixion, which was according to the foreknowledge of the Triune God, was the result of a determination made by the Trinity in an eternal counsel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, instead of being an accident, the Lord s crucifixion took place according to the eternal determination of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Acts 2:23 says that through the hand of lawless men the Lord Jesus was nailed to the cross and killed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These lawless men included Judas Iscariot Luke 22:3-6 , chief priests, officers of the temple, elders Luke 22:52-53 , the high priest and the Jewish Sanhedrin Luke 22:54, 66-71 , Pilate, Herod, and the Roman soldiers Luke 23:1-25 mainly the Jewish religionists with their deputies and the Gentile politicians with their subordinates.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that Jesus was killed by all mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Acts 2:23 says that the Lord Jesus was nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Jewish death penalty was by stoning Lev 20:2, 27; 24:23; Deut 13:10; 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Crucifixion was a heathen practice Ezra 6:11 , adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The crucifixion of the Lord Jesus was not only a fulfillment of the Old Testament Deut 21:23; Gal 3:13; Num 21:8-9 , but also of the Lord s own word concerning the mode of His death John 3:14; 8:28; 12:32 , which could not have been fulfilled by stoning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was of God s sovereignty that not long before the Lord Jesus was put to death the Roman Empire made the law that criminals sentenced to death were to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was by this kind of death that the Lord was executed.</S>
