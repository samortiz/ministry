   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ANSWER TO EVERY QUESTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It may be the case that we are often touched by the Lord s great love that was manifested in His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may vividly and genuinely see the Lord s death and His great love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, when we think of Him, we may often be touched to the point of shedding tears.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, when we come to preach the gospel, we may not know how to present to people this love of the Lord Jesus that He displayed on the cross and in His precious, cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, however, we have found the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that the Holy Spirit is able to show man the precious blood of the cross just like the scene on a television screen is shown and that in doing so the Holy Spirit is not constrained by time or space.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The great love displayed on the cross and the precious, redeeming blood are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we know the mystery that everything is in the Spirit, we will realize that all the questions that we do not know how to answer can be answered by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>ALL SPIRITUAL REALITY BEING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, when we preach the gospel to people, we may tell them that Jesus died for them on the cross and shed His precious blood for them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if they ask, Where is the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Where is this precious blood? we are not able to show them these things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although we are not able to show them, as we are speaking to them, the Holy Spirit creates an image in their spirit, showing them the scene of the Lord on the cross so that they not only hear the truth of the gospel but also see a spiritual vision of what they are hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This spiritual vision is spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The cross, resurrection, ascension, and all that God is and has done are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All spiritual reality is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit brings God Himself, incarnation, redemption, the shedding of blood, the substitutionary death, resurrection, ascension, glory, authority, and the throne to man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After passing through all these processes, God became the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All spiritual reality is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In ourselves, our ability to experience spiritual reality is limited by time and space, but time and space do not exist in the Holy Spirit, and He has brought all these realities directly into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the past all these realities were not available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But today the shedding of the precious blood, resurrection, ascension, and all these realities are in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit has brought all these realities into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 14 the Lord said that when He went away, He would send the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What does the Holy Spirit do when He comes?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He comes, the Holy Spirit guides us into all the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we tell people that there is God, they may ask, Where is God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To man, God is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we have to remember that in the Holy Spirit God is real.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a person touches the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit brings him into the reality where he is able to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we tell people that Jesus was crucified, this is merely a doctrine to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To them, the cross is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in the Holy Spirit the cross becomes real, and in the Holy Spirit man can touch and experience the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same principle, when we tell the children of God that they are of Christ and that they have been resurrected with Christ, this may be vague to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they touch the Holy Spirit, however, this spiritual reality will be in them, and resurrection will become real to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All spiritual reality is in the Holy Spirit, so the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of reality, God is real.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In addition, incarnation, the cross, resurrection, ascension, the throne, authority, blessing, and the glory in the heavens are all real.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If all these things were not in the Holy Spirit, there would be no spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why many unbelievers ask: Is there God in this universe?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is there the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is there resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is there ascension?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although there is truly a spiritual reality of all these matters, for finite man all of these matters are too far away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To those who believe in God, however, these things are very close, even intimately close, because all these things are in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is in those who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we touch the Holy Spirit, all these matters become real to us, because all these matters are real in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever we touch the Holy Spirit, we touch death, resurrection, ascension, and the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To those who have never touched the Holy Spirit, all these things seem not to exist.</S>
