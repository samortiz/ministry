   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 The Tree of Life a Signifying God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The tree of life was a symbol, signifying God as the proper source cf.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psa 36:9; John 1:4; 10:10b; 11:25; 14:6; 1 John 5:12; Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we only read Genesis 2, we will be unable to understand the meaning of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the Gospel of John reveals the life denoted by the tree of life in a concrete way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 1:4 says, "In Him was life," and John 15:5 tells us that the Lord Jesus is a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we put these two verses together, we will realize that Christ is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jesus, the embodiment of God, is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the tree of life in Genesis 2 is a symbol of God as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Besides this source, there is another tree, another source in the universe death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, this tree is not called the tree of death; it is called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is such a tree in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two trees oppose one another, the tree of life denoting God as the source of life, and the tree of knowledge signifying Satan as the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As God is the source of life, Satan is the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, in Genesis 2 we find two sources signified by two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout the course of this life-study, we have pointed out several times that nearly everything in Genesis 1 and 2 is a seed of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The two trees are such seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Along with all the other seeds sown in Genesis 1 and 2, these seeds grow in the following books of the Bible and are reaped as a harvest in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Revelation 20:10, 14 we see that death is cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Revelation 22:2 we see that life abides in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the beginning of the Bible we find death and life, and at the end of the Bible we again see death and life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Between the two ends of the Bible two lines are set forth the line of death and the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both lines begin in the book of Genesis and end in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Death begins with the tree of knowledge of good and evil and ends with the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Life begins with the tree of life and ends at the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before we were saved, we were on the line of death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we were saved, we were put on the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>b Its Contents, Nature, and Result</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first of these two choices was the tree of life, which denoted God Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The content of the tree of life is life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is life, simply, purely, and absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The nature of this tree and the result of this tree are also life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Life is the content, nature, and result.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything is life.</S>
