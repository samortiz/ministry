   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PETER S COMPANY 7 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:14-47</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2:14-47, which records Peter s first message to the Jews, Peter explains the economical filling of the Holy Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>14-21 , witnesses of the Man Jesus in His work, death, resurrection, and ascension vv.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>37-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in 2:42-47 we have a description of the beginning of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we shall consider the beginning of the church life as presented in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE BELIEVERS CONTINUING STEADFASTLY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>IN FOUR THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 2:42 says, And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see that the first group of believers produced through the apostles preaching and ministering of Christ on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in four things: teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Teaching is the unveiling of God s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Fellowship is the communion and communication between the believers in their communion and communication with God the Father and Christ the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Breaking of bread is the remembrance of the Lord in His accomplishment of God s full redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Prayer is cooperation with the Lord in heaven for the carrying out of God s New Testament economy on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first two matters, teaching and fellowship, conjoined by and to be one group, are of the apostles, but breaking of bread and prayers are not of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that besides the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, the believers in Christ should not have any other teaching and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In God s New Testament economy there is only one kind of teaching revealed and recognized by God the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, there is only one kind of fellowship which is of God and acceptable to Him the fellowship of the apostles, which is with the Father and the Son Jesus Christ 1 John 1:3 and which is the unique fellowship of the unique church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The last two matters, the breaking of bread and prayer, conjoined also by and to be another group, are practices of the believers Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These practices are not related directly to God s economy for the keeping of the oneness of the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, they are not of the apostles, who brought in God s New Testament revelation and His fellowship among all the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Teaching of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have seen that the new believers continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only proper teaching in the New Testament is the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Any teaching other than the apostles teaching is not scriptural or orthodox.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The orthodox teaching is that of the apostles recorded in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament from Matthew through Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, Paul said to Timothy, Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently 1 Tim 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To teach differently is to teach differently from the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have different teachings, we shall be divided into different groups.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if we have only the teaching of the apostles, we shall be one.</S>
