<P>Many times when you try to study the Bible, you are deadened because you get a lot of doctrinal knowledge without life. We need to study and read the Bible prayerfully with the exercise of our spirit. The mental reading kills, but the prayerful reading gives life. The more you read the Bible prayerfully, the more you have the deep sense that something within you is flowing, quickening, reviving, enlightening, and strengthening. The Concordant Literal New Testament translation of 2 Corinthians 3:6 says that the Spirit is "vivifying." The more you read the Word prayerfully, the more you are vivified. When you read the Word mentally, you are mortified, but when you read the Word prayerfully, you are vivified. Whether you will be vivified or mortified depends upon the way you take to read the Bible.</P><P>Even the Bible can be a dead, written code to us if we do not come to Christ Himself to receive life. We need more life, not more knowledge. We need to be more and more vivified. We can be vivified by pray-reading the Lord's Word. Life is what we need. The Spirit is not the Spirit of doctrine but the Spirit of reality, who is Christ Himself as life. The more we contact the Spirit, the more we are vivified.</P><P>The life-giving Spirit, the vivifying Spirit, is Christ Himself. Verse 6 of 2 Corinthians 3 says that the Spirit gives life. Darby puts verses 7 through 16 in parentheses, indicating that verse 17 directly continues verse 6. Verse 17 says that the Lord is the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit who gives life is Christ the Lord. Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).</P><P>I would like to point out what Dean Alford said concerning 2 Corinthians 3:16-17:</P><blockquote>The Lord of v. 16, is the Spirit...which giveth life, v. 6: meaning, "the Lord," as here spoken of, "Christ," "is the Spirit," is identical with the Holy Spirit...Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ.</blockquote><P>Let us also read what M. R. Vincent had to say about this passage of Scripture:</P><blockquote>The Lord Christ of v. 16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers (v. 6)...</blockquote><P>We may wonder how Christ, as Dean Alford pointed out, could be the Spirit of Christ. We may not be able to understand this, but we simply need to say amen to what the Bible says. Hebrews 1:8 refers to Christ the Son as God, and then verse 9 says that God is His God. This is the mystery of the Divine Trinity. We cannot fully comprehend such a mystery, but we can accept it. The Bible says that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, that the Lord is the Spirit who gives life, and that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This is not my teaching, but my quotation of the Bible. This is not my invention, but my discovery.</P><P>Now that we have seen the anointing Spirit, the sealing Spirit, the pledging Spirit, the writing Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit, let us go on to see the remaining aspects of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians.</P>
