   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEAL OFFERING AND THE MANNA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only do we need to see the difference between the burnt offering and the meal offering, but also between manna and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians think that manna is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in the book of Leviticus, the manna is past; it is replaced by something better and richer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first difference is that manna is from heaven, but the meal offering is from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We would think that something from heaven should be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Could anything be better than that which is from heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the meal offering is of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Manna was given from heaven, but the meal offering was grown up from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaiah 4:2 tells us that the Lord Jesus on the one hand is "the branch of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This speaks of His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But on the other hand it says that He is "the fruit of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As to His divine nature, He is the branch of Jehovah, and as to His human nature, He is the fruit of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaiah 53 speaks of the Lord as a "tender plant" grown out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the fruit of the earth, and He is a tender plant out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the meal offering we do not need the divinity of the Lord Jesus; we need His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His humanity is for our perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not something given from heaven, but grown from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians would never think that something of the earth could be better than something from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the meal offering is better than manna.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Also, manna is a gift from God, and the meal offering is a present to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Which is better?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must see that a present to God is much better.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must be delivered from our old concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Manna is for our satisfaction; it is not for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The meal offering, however, is for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is even a memorial to God this is something more than satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"And the priest shall burn the memorial of it the meal offering upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord" Lev 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Manna is not for God's satisfaction, but the meal offering is for God's satisfaction, and it is a memorial in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is something for God to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is much better.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, manna is for a life in the wilderness, whereas the meal offering is for a life in God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Manna is sufficient only to sustain a life in the wilderness, but the meal offering will support a life in the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where do you prefer to be: in the wilderness or in the dwelling place of God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all must prefer to have the meal offering, and we must forget the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The meal offering suffices for a life serving God in His presence and in His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no more wandering, but just dwelling with God in His house.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Another important point of difference between the manna and the meal offering is that manna never constituted worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God never asked His people to worship Him by presenting manna.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But God did command His people to worship Him with the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus the meal offering is quite sufficient to constitute worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why among many Christians there is really no true worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>People are always feeding on manna.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the local churches we must have true worship to God by enjoying the meal offering all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is one additional point concerning the manna and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With manna, there is no need of human labor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But to have the meal offering, there is much need of human labor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must labor on the good land by tilling the ground, sowing the seed, watering the plants, and reaping the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must care for many things in order to obtain the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even after the harvest, there is the grinding and the baking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of this is not done in the tent of meeting, but at home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All that is required for the manna is to go out and gather it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The meal offering requires much more labor than the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So many young people today are loose and careless.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many times I decided to visit the young people's houses, but my wife said that I should call them first.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if I did that, there would be no need to go.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>My intention was to see how they keep their rooms and their kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>So many of them shout, "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!" but I want to see their bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am afraid that many of them did not make their beds today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If that is true, it is certainly not the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I like to hear the young people shout, "Hallelujah," but "Hallelujah" what?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes I would rather go to their bedroom to see how they labor on Christ and till the ground by making their bed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sloppy ones cannot even get the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There may not be much labor, but you still must rise early and go out of the camp to gather it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God is merciful, but He is not so gracious if you are sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God will send the manna outside the camp, but He will not send it into your bedroom and into your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You must rise early, get out of your bed, leave your bedroom, and go out of the camp to pick up the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then you must cook it a little before you eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Solomon says in Proverbs 19:24 that the lazy man, even when he stretches out his hand for food, will not take it back.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is really lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A lazy person cannot obtain even the manna, not to mention the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The meal offering requires much more labor than the manna.</S>
