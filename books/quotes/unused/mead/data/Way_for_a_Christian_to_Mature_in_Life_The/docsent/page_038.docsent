   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EMPTYING THE VESSEL FOR GOD TO COME IN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the meaning of leaving everything?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It means that all the things that are necessary in life do not have any ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, the ground in us has been given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How should we deal with our children, our family, and our career?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord within us will show us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one can tell others how to deal with these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our lives, statuses, and situations may be different, but our hearts should be absolutely the same.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ground in us should be given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is actually relatively easy to abandon all the things in our lives and to not live by them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is much more difficult to live by those things and yet not give them the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is like living in a family but not giving the family the ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How difficult this is!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some religions persuade people to abandon their families and even to abandon everything, because they believe that everything is vanity and that people no longer need anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord, however, does not want us to live such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, He wants us to have a family but to not give the ground in us to our family.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the ground has to be given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the same time, we must act according to the will of Christ to properly bear the responsibilities of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A co-worker once said that our heart is like a Chinese medicinal patch.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever it is applied to, it sticks to that.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, whatever our heart touches, it sticks to it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When it touches education, it sticks to education.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When it touches business, it sticks to business.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When it touches money, it sticks to money.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When it touches our family, it sticks to our family.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Someone may say, If our heart is like this, then I do not want anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the Lord will tell that one, No, that is not the way of My salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In My salvation you should have a family, bear responsibilities, become a husband and a father, do business, have a career, and lead a proper life, but all these things should not have the ground in you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the price that we must pay.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is it to pay the price?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is to empty our vessel for God to come in. Every inch of ground in us has to be given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we give Him the ground, we will have God in us, and we will have the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some fifty years ago in a Western country, there was a group of saints who were pursuing the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One of them was a sister who loved the Lord very much and who was also pursuing the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She prayed and waited.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then she prayed and waited again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While she was praying and waiting there, she felt that she had given the Lord the ground in her.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It seemed that the Lord could do whatever He wanted to do in her except deal with her hair.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During that time in the West, the most fashionable way for a woman to arrange her hair was to set it very high, like a tower.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This sister allowed the Lord to touch everything she had except her tower-like hair.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When she had the feeling that the Lord wanted to deal with her hair, she told the Lord, Lord, if You touch my money, I am willing to offer it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If You want me to deal with my sins, I am willing to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, my hair is really an insignificant matter, so please leave me alone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can see that this sister s hairstyle was not sinful, nor was she loving the world by having this hairstyle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many sisters today cut their hair very short and do not consider that they are loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The problem is that man likes to reason.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Who can say that setting one s hair very high is loving the world, while cutting one s hair very short so that it looks like neither a man s nor a woman s is not loving the world?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The question we must ask is, who has the authority?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is the authority over your hair in your hands or in the Lord s hands?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who is the master of your head you or the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our reasons may be very plausible, but the Lord never listens to our reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In a sense, He is unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our lawsuits with the Lord are always one-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are no plaintiffs and defendants.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is only His side.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whatever He says, that is it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is nothing to argue about.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During a meeting, the sister mentioned earlier came and, kneeling down, cried out loudly, Lord, why do You not answer my prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why have You not filled me with the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lord, I have been so desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have been praying and waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whatever You wanted me to do I did.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Why have You not given me the filling of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then the Lord asked her, Have you done all that I asked you to do?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What about your hair?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She was speechless.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On that day she knelt down and pulled her high hair down.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then she received the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once her hair was subject to the Lord, she was immediately filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What the Lord wants is not our wealth, our time, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What He wants is for us to allow Him to question us about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord is not so cruel that He would ask us for everything that we love.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord wants us to allow Him to go through everything and to allow Him to have the ground in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord will not necessarily fight against us to take away all our material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord may even give us more enjoyment, but the question is whether we will give Him the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All things are His.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we truly want to enjoy Him and love Him, we have to give Him the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then we will be satisfied and will receive the filling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Lord cares not for your hairstyle but for whether or not He has the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When you decide on your hairstyle, the Lord cares whether He is in it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What the Lord is fighting for is His authority and ground.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Are the authority and ground in your hands or the Lord s hands?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we bring all these questions before Him and give Him the authority and ground, we are paying the price to buy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He will have the ground in us to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Perhaps one day He will give us clothing that is much more beautiful than the clothing we wore in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord is merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The question is whether we will completely give Him the ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What is it to be a vessel?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To be a vessel is to be empty within.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then the oil can be put into the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In order to contain the oil, the vessel has to be emptied and has to give room for the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If the vessel has no space and is not empty, then the oil cannot be put in. We are vessels, and we have to be emptied for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is to pay the price.</S>
