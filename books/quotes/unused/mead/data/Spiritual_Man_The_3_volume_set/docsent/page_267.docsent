   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LACK OF CONCENTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many times evil spirits also take away the power of concentration in the believers' minds.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The power of concentration is different from believer to believer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But according to the experience of believers, a variation in the power of concentration mainly comes as a result of the evil spirits' distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many believers seem unable to concentrate their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some are a little better.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they try to concentrate on one thing for a few minutes, they find their thoughts flying all over the place instead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is especially true when one is praying, reading the Scriptures, or listening to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many believers feel that their mind is always wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although they have made up their mind to concentrate, it cannot be done in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although they exercise the will to control these racing thoughts, and although it may produce some effect for a while, nothing seems to last for long.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes they find themselves completely out of control within themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these are the works of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But these works occur because the believers' minds have already reserved ground for them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is unfortunate that believers waste away their mental power in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The result is that nothing is accomplished all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as it is a damage to waste physical energy, it is a damage to waste mental energy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many believers today have wasted much time and not secured any results because their minds are under the attack of evil spirits and unable to concentrate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because evil spirits attack the mind in such a way, believers often experience a kind of "absentmindedness."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Initially the mind is sharp.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suddenly, there is an emptiness, and one finds his thoughts flying away to nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He does not know what he is doing or what book he is reading.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He may think that his mind is on something else.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the point to realize is that these kinds of thoughts are not initiated by one's own will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Countless numbers of believers have the experience of a sudden loss of hearing of what others are saying during the meetings and also at normal times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is evil spirits which are causing them to not hear the words which are profitable to them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At such moments, evil spirits either cause their minds to stop functioning or force them to think about something else.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After a believer's mind has been attacked by evil spirits, it is very difficult for him to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes, he seems to miss a few sentences or a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before he can understand what the other party is saying, he must wrinkle his forehead in order to try to hear the words.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Often he does not understand the very obvious meaning of the other party, or he misunderstands the teachings given to him by the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these are caused by the disturbance of evil spirits in his mind, who put many prejudices into him or interpret the meaning of the words for him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The believer hears men and demons speaking at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, he either hears nothing or he misunderstands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many believers become disinclined or unable to hear others speak because evil spirits work this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before others finish their words, they want to cut in with something.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This happens because evil spirits have given them many thoughts, forcing them to listen to them and speak what they have put into them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At such times, a believer hears two voices at the same time, one from the outside and one from the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He hears suggestions from evil spirits within, and he hears men's words without.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since the voices within are closer than the voices without, the believer's ears will seem to be blocked from hearing the voices without.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is ordinarily known as "absentmindedness," is in fact just the heart being occupied by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How many times do believers think that they have become "absent-minded," when in fact their hearts have just been captured by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If believers do not rid themselves of the work of evil spirits in their minds, it will be impossible for them to concentrate their minds on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of evil spirits' disturbance in the minds of the believers, they shake their heads, as if to shake out the undesirable things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they say something, they have to say it loudly in order to let their own minds hear what they are saying and to leave an impression.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they think, they also have to loudly speak what they are thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, their muddled minds do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If they read, they also have to loudly read.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Otherwise, they do not understand what they read.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All these are the result of the disturbance of evil spirits in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They cannot concentrate their thoughts, and they have to do these things before their minds can receive a little impression or know anything.</S>
