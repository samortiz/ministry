   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REPLACED BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How is it possible for us to be replaced by Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can be replaced by Him only through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apart from His death and resurrection, Christ Himself would not be able to replace us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Also, it would not be possible for us to be replaced by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This replacement can be carried out only through Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to realize that it is necessary for us to deny our self.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our attitude should be of willingness to be replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also need to see that a replacement has been prepared for us, and this replacement is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the words of Paul in Galatians 2:20, it should be no longer we who live, but Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we live, we live according to our corrupt heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We live according to ourselves, and within us we have an evil heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we would be delivered from what we are in ourselves, from our evil heart, we need to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To deny ourselves actually means to be replaced by Christ through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ s death on the cross included us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that when He died, we died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we need to realize this fact and apply it to our living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To see that we have been crucified with Christ and apply this fact to our living is to take the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, to take the cross means to admit that we have been terminated by Christ s death and to apply this termination to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we make this application, resurrection life comes in.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our daily living, the crucified and resurrected Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reality of Christ s resurrection is actually the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever we apply the cross of Christ, the life-giving Spirit, as the reality of Christ s resurrection, comes in to be our real replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we are able to say, I have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is no longer I who live Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>WHAT GOD WANTS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have you seen what is revealed in 8:27 9:13?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we have a revelation of Christ s Person and His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Oh, we all need to see this!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am concerned that some of us have not seen the crucial matters of Christ s all-inclusive Person, His wonderful death, and His marvelous resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we see them, we shall say, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Amen to Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Amen to the death of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Amen to the resurrection of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Amen to my termination!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because I have been terminated, it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is the entire replacement in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God does not want Moses, God does not want Elijah, and God does not want me in what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I say amen to the fact that God only wants Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God does not want whatever we are in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He does not want our flesh, and He does not want our heart in its corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God only wants Christ, for Christ is the unique, all-inclusive replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 9:7 God declared, This is My Son, the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hear Him!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to hear Him, not ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not listen to our mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not listen to what we think, imagine, or love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should listen to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is God s Beloved, God s Favorite.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the One who replaces everyone else and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, He should have all the ground in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything in our living should be given over to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THROUGH HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As the One who is our replacement, Christ has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the cross He died an all-inclusive death, a death that included us and terminated us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After dying such a death, Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit to be the reality of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we apply His death as our termination, the Spirit has the full ground to make Christ real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we enjoy a real replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a result, we can declare that we have been crucified with Christ and that we live no longer, but Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can even say with Paul, To me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In everything, whether in death or life, we live Christ and magnify Him Phil 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In order to interpret these verses from chapters eight and nine of the Gospel of Mark, we need the fourteen Epistles written by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>With the help of these Epistles, we can see the picture in the first eight and a half chapters of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May we be so deeply impressed with this picture that we never forget it!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praise the Lord that this picture includes us!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are in a divine realm living Christ through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Praise the Lord for this highlight in the Gospel of Mark, the place where we have a revelation of Christ with His death and resurrection!</S>
