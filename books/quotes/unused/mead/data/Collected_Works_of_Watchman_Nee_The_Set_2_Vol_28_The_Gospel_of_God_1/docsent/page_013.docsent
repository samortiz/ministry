   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S GRACE NOT RELATED TO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAN'S WRONGDOINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first characteristic of God's grace is that it is not related to man's wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's grace is given to sinful man, to helpless, low, weak, and ungodly sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the question of wrongdoing comes up and if it is stipulated that those with sin shall not have grace, then grace is basically annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's grace can never be held back just because man has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's grace cannot even be reduced when man's sins increase.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There can never be such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man's mind, being fully of the flesh, is filled with the thought of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may think that the ones who have achieved may receive grace but we, the sinners, as those without achievements, are unqualified to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In man's thought, wrongdoing and grace are at opposite poles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In man's thought, grace only comes where there is no wrongdoing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you told anyone who has some consideration about God that God loved him and has given him grace, he would immediately wonder how this could be since he has committed so many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man's thought is that grace can be received only when there is no wrongdoing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He fails to realize that this is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because wrongdoing provides the best opportunity for grace to operate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without wrongdoing, grace has no opportunity to manifest itself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only is wrongdoing unable to stop grace; it is the necessary condition for grace to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way, our poverty before the Lord is not a deterrent to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the contrary, our poverty is a condition for receiving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without being so poor, we would not be willing to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every Lord's Day morning there are eight or nine beggars here in our meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They come every Lord's Day morning, and they are very punctual.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they come to you and you give them a coin or two, they smile and take it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But what would happen if you offered a coin to any brother or sister among us who is well groomed and who has a good upbringing, saying, "Here, take this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Find yourself two more coins and you will be able to buy some fritters on the street"?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Surely he or she would not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He or she would not only refuse it, but would consider it an insult.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, being poor is a condition for receiving grace; in fact, it is the most necessary condition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man is very illogical.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He says that he cannot receive grace because his sins are too numerous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No statement is more contradictory than this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No statement is more senseless.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because the sick are sick, they need a doctor; because the poor are poor, they need relief; and likewise, because man is a sinner, he needs grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, sin is not a deterrent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, it is an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our problem today is that we always think that we have to be in a condition that is different from where we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We think that we must be holier and better people today than yesterday if we are to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My friends, if you want to be a magistrate, there is the matter of qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you want to enter a school, there is the matter of standards.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you want to be a doctor in a hospital, there is the matter of capability.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you want to do business, there is the matter of skill.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Qualifications, standards, capabilities, and skills are indeed useful in certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if man wishes to come to God, qualifications, standards, capabilities, and skills are out of the question.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only when I am a helpless sinner, standing on the lowest ground, can I receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man misses grace not because he is too sinful, but because he is not low enough.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is too proud and too moral.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is precisely where the greatest problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are great in all kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the same time, we are very great in the sin of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, we have an absolute need; on the other hand, the ground we stand on is one on which we cannot receive the grace we need.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is due to nothing other than our pride.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Romans 5:20 tells us that "Where sin abounded, grace has super-abounded."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Word of God shows us that where sin is, grace is also.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where sin abounds not that it has really abounded, for all men sin alike, but that sin has manifested itself more abundantly the grace of God abounds even more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The word abound in the original language has to do with the idea of overflowing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I do not know if you have ever been to the seashore or riverside.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When high tide comes, a water line is left on the shore or bank.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if a flood comes, it overflows the water line.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the water is at the water line, we say that there is only a normal rise of the tide, but if the water rises above the line, there is a flood.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is what abound means here.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sin is so high, but grace is higher and even covers sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sin is high, but grace is even higher and has covered sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Man has the strange thought that to receive grace, he must be without sin or wrongdoing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But there is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although our wrongdoings are quite serious and can rise quite high, God's grace rises even higher.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since the grace of God is here to deal with the problem of wrongdoings, they are no longer a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What is the nature of God's grace?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's grace is just God coming in the sinner's position to take upon Himself the consequence of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Please remember the definition that we gave earlier, that grace is God working for man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we do not have any wrongdoings, we do not need God to do anything for us, and as a result, we do not need God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But because we have sinned and because we have problems, He has to come and solve our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, we need grace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If I say, "Since I have sinned, I cannot receive grace," it is like saying, "Because I am too sick, I am too shy to see the doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I will see the doctor when my temperature is down a little."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Since there is no such patient in the world, there should be no such sinner in the world either.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thus our wrongdoings are the condition for us to receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Since the problem of sin is taken care of by God and since He takes the responsibility to deal with our wrongdoings, any sin we have, whether great or small, is no problem before God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Both great sins and small sins pose no problem, for both can be solved by God's work and by God's work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The great sin is taken care of by God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The small sin likewise requires God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If it were up to us to deal with our sins, we would distinguish between great sins and small sins.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But if our sins are taken care of by God, they will be taken care of regardless of whether they are great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Since they are taken care of by God, it makes no difference at all to us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All that we are doing is receiving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Earlier we saw why man cannot receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Recall Peter's words in 1 Peter 5:5: "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God gives grace to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you humbly confess that you are a sinner, your wrongdoings will not deter you from receiving God's grace; rather, they will cause you to receive His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As long as you humble yourself before God, God's grace will flow to you.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Thank God that the grace of God flows down to us; it is not pumped up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>No one can ever pump God's grace up to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Therefore, all those who are high have to come down.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Who are the sinners and who can receive grace?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Bible shows us clearly in Romans 3:23-24 that "all have sinned," but the all who have sinned are "justified freely by His grace."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Bible shows us that once man sins, spontaneously he can receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Without being a sinner, he cannot receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Man thinks that those who have sinned cannot receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But God says that because man sins, he can receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It is so obvious: since man has sinned grace comes.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Never think that when sin comes, grace goes away.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Sin is one of man's great mistakes, but to think that sin blocks man from receiving grace is a greater mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Therefore, the first thing we must see is that man's wrongdoings cannot stand in the way of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>With God's grace, there is no problem because of wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>On the contrary, God's grace is there to deal with man's wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>God is giving grace because man has sinned.</S>
