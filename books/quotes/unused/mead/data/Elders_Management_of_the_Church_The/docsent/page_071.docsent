   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. To Be Open</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All those who do not open themselves to the brothers are keeping themselves whole.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As such, it is impossible for them to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many problems result from a lack of openness, the most serious of which is misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you never open up yourself or share your feeling with others, but you hold on to what you consider as right, misunderstanding and misinterpretation will very easily result.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This misunderstanding is the enemy's most serious weapon to destroy coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I know of some places where elders cannot be coordinated together simply because of misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wherever misunderstanding occurs and exists, coordination is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone may still be able to come together for talks and discussions, but it will be of no avail, because the germ of misunderstanding has killed the life of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Openness can solve many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes there are problems among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not avoid the problems; rather face them head on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose you avoid the problem, and I avoid the problem; the more we avoid it, the closer we will become, and the closer we become, the more misunderstanding there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is only the problem on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the positive side, a person who is not open cannot supply others with grace and life, and cannot receive others' supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because there is no flow between you and others; what is in you cannot flow out, and what is in others cannot flow into you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, in order to coordinate together, everyone must be open.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>D. Humble yet Not Passive</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to coordinate together well, the elders need to be humble and not be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I may be a very humble person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet at the same time I am very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a person is humble, it is easy for him to be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when a person is positive, it is not easy for him to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is common human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in the coordination, we have to learn to be humble without being passive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have to touch everything, and I want to participate in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have my view in everything, and I am happy to express my feeling in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet I remain humble.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This humility with this positiveness is a difficult lesson to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not easy for those who are positive to be humble, and it is not easy for those who are humble to be positive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to be humble as well as positive, there is the need for grace and for brokenness.</S>
