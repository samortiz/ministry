   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE CHRISTIAN MEETING BEING A MATTER OF SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The purpose of the Christian meeting is to prophesy, to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is just like saying that the purpose of a ball team is to play ball; the ball is the focus of a ball team.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a ball team comes together, it does so to play ball.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there is no ball, there is no reason to have a ball team.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, we have to see that the Christian meeting is not a so-called worship service but a gathering for all to prophesy, to speak Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sixty years ago when we were raised up by the Lord in China, we were all young people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we are very happy because we see that in the church there are also numerous young people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This encourages us very much.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If in a worldly profession there is no younger generation, then that profession has no future.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Similarly, the rise or fall of a family depends on the next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter how able and capable the older generations the grandparents and the parents of a family are, if there are no heirs to continue the family line, then the family will not have any future.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We thank the Lord that in the church there are many older saints, because without them the church would not have any descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we should not be ungrateful toward the older saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nonetheless, it is very good that we have many young people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I see these young people, I feel like I am a coach teaching these young ones how to play ball.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We Christians are a ball team, and our meeting is a ball game.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even when we are not competing, we are still practicing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The ball is the word, the ball game is our meeting, and our ball playing is our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To play ball well, one must play skillfully and accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, to speak in the meetings we have to be able to speak the word clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the past we came to the meetings without bringing the "ball."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, everyone came empty-handed, coming only to "go to church."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, in our "going to church" there was no prophesying, no speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Christian meeting is not for "going to church" but for speaking, for prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Traditional Christianity has been deceived and has been utilized by Satan to completely discard the treasure of our heritage the Bible, the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to recover this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must see that the purpose of the Christian meeting is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Christians meet together, there should be speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>NOT WORSHIPPING DUMB IDOLS BUT SPEAKING IN GOD'S NAME</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Christian meeting is not for the worshipping of dumb idols 1 Cor 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Christian meeting is for "going to church," then it is the worshipping of dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before I was twenty years old, I was saved and delivered out of the worldly system; at that time I began to love the Lord and to study the Bible diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now it has been over half a century, and I have studied the Bible quite thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Besides reading the Bible, I have also read and studied in depth the history of the church, biographies of famous people throughout the generations, and the orthodox teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From my readings I saw the subtlety of Satan, particularly in the Middle Ages, when European architecture was altogether focused on building cathedrals.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nearly all the European-style cathedrals, as well as the cathedrals from earlier time periods, have a towering outward appearance, stained-glass windows, and a dark interior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The purpose of this is to produce a psychological effect on people so that once they step into the building, they are struck with awe and dare not make a sound.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All they can do is just find a seat and then sit down and begin to have the "worship service."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In doing so, they are worshipping dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The European architecture in those days was the result of much study; it was altogether for the purpose of accommodating man's psychological desire to "go to church."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows us that it was the work of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The devil's activities are very much involved in many architectural structures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For instance, when people go into a Chinese temple, not only do the things inside the temple arouse fear in them but even walking into the temple gives them a gloomy feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The stratagem of the enemy is to make the Christian meeting place exactly like a temple for idols, causing the Christian meeting to become a dumb service of one man speaking and all the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I hope that we all can see the light, so that we can see the Lord's desire, Satan's strategy, and the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christianity has fallen into such a pitiful condition that the Lord has no position and no freedom to speak there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the chapels and cathedrals, whether big or small, have been constructed in a way that causes people to remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Consequently, the believers not only do not know how to preach the word, they do not even know how to pray and do not dare to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This exposes the subtlety of Satan in annulling the functioning of the children of God, even to the extent that it is impossible for the Body of Christ to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We know that the existence of the Body depends on the functioning of all the members together; if the members of our physical body do not function, there is no way for our body to exist.</S>
