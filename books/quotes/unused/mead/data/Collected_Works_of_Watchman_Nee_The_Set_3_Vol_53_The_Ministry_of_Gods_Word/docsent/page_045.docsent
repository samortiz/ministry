   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The basic issue is: Are you simply ministering to others from this book, the Bible, or are you one who has met Christ and who has a revelation of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are you one who has met and encountered the Lord fundamentally?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you have a fundamental understanding of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you do, you will spontaneously say, "Thank God, many things in the Bible are clear to me now."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From that time forward, day by day as you read the Bible, you will find passage after passage making sense to you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>An inward knowledge of the Lord comes first, while a knowledge of Him through the Bible comes later.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once you have the subjective knowledge, you will find God's word understandable and self-harmonizing when you study it again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What were problems to you now become meaningful revelations, and what was once insignificant now becomes very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything fits together; all the parts are linked up and nothing is insignificant any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From that point on, your days on earth will become days of knowing the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Day by day what you see will match what the Bible says; the two will testify to the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may not see everything all at once, but it will appear to you little by little, and you will see more as the days go by.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not understand the Bible through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we know the Bible through inward light and inward revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The misguided mind always wants to take the way of the intellectual man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man thinks that he can study the Bible by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He thinks he can make the effort to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He thinks that he can read it with or without prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He thinks he can study it, and he trusts in his study.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this is a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord Jesus was born, many Jews were very familiar with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Herod asked where Christ would be born, and the chief priests and scribes answered without looking it up that Christ would be born in Bethlehem of the land of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They even quoted the Scripture which says, "And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, by no means are you the least among the princes of Judah; for out of you shall come forth a Ruler, One who will shepherd My people Israel" Matt 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They could recite the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But did they know Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although they were so familiar with the Bible, they did not use it to find Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, they used it to try to kill Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They used it to help Herod try to kill God's Anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How wrong one can become in reading the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How wrong a man can become by being familiar with the Scripture!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What kind of things a man can do by the so-called understanding of the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, the Scripture was fulfilled point by point.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While a person who knows nothing about the Bible can be excused for not recognizing this, those who knew the Scripture should have recognized immediately that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God from the many fulfillments of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But did the Pharisees know this?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They did not know Christ nor could they accept Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They sewed the Scripture to the hem of their garments and their girdles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They had a knowledge of the Scripture and could expound biblical prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They could tell others about the teachings and doctrines of the Scripture, but they kept Christ outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man can touch the Scripture without touching Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Pharisees made the Scripture mere reading material, study curriculum, an object of doctrinal research.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They could understand the doctrines, but they rejected the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time that this was going on, there was another group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They did not have any Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Matthew was a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter was a fisherman.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even in Acts, they were considered "uneducated men and laymen" 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet they had met the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They had met Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God revealed His Son in them, and they knew the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Peter received from God the revelation of His Son at Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He knew inwardly that Jesus was God's Anointed, the very Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As far as Christ's ministry is concerned, He is the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As far as His person is concerned, He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As far as His work is concerned, He is the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As far as His person is concerned, He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the greatest revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The entire church is built upon this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These uneducated laymen knew the Son of God, and they knew the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Matthew was a tax collector; he had not previously known the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But because he knew the Lord, he could tell us so much about the Old Testament in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once he knew the Lord, everything became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not learning a word by seeing the picture, but rather, identifying a picture by seeing the object.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He first knew the Lord, and then he found out about Him from the books of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Suppose you know a brother personally.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When another person brings you a picture of this brother, you can identify him in the picture immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You must first know Christ before you can know His book.</S>
