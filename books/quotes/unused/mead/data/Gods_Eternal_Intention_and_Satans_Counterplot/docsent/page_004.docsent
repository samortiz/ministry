   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD, MAN, AND SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many different beings in the universe, but only three are vital.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first is God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second is man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The third is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible, it is often said, is a revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Bible also reveals man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the Bible we do not know what man is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may have read the great philosophers' writings, but if we do not know the Bible, we still do not know what man is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not know where we came from nor where we are going; we do not know where we are; we do not know what human life is; and we do not know the purpose of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Philosophy does not have these answers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have read the writings of some of the Chinese philosophers; to me they are foolish, not wise.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Plato and Socrates are also philosophically foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Confucius, for example, said that if a man sins against heaven that is, God , he has no way to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is this not foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible strongly tells us that our sins may be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we want to know ourselves, we can find our biography in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we learn where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These things we need to know so that we may fulfill our role in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan is the third vital figure in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are other secondary characters, like angels; but God, man, and Satan are the primary ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>GOD'S INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Over the years you may have heard a good many messages in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I wonder, however, if you young people realize what God's eternal intention is for you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christians, even though they are God's saved and regenerated children, are for the most part unaware of what God's intention is for them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may be very familiar with the Bible yet still miss its central point.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may have heard what it is and thought that you saw it, but still you may not really have grasped it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since I came to the United States, I might have given about three thousand messages along this line.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I repeat it from different angles over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet it bothers me that I see so few living daily according to this eternal intention.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's eternal intention is to enter into you and become your life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He wants to make you one with Him that you may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually He becomes your life, and you become His living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may say that you already know this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may think it is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is simple, but not practical to you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It does not apply to your daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man was made in the image and likeness of God Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What image and likeness mean we shall not consider now.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, notice that it is said only of man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the other created things were to bring forth after their kind Gen 1:11, 12, 21, 24, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The cat is after the cats' kind; an apple is after the apples' kind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After what kind is man?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man does not have his own kind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man is after the kind of God!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He bears the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We were not made in the image of a turtle, or a monkey, or a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even though we are fallen, we are nonetheless a man, bearing the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is the image of God?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The New Testament tells us that Christ is the image of the invisible God Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When He came and dwelt among men, He expressed love, kindness, mercy, grace, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For man to be created in the likeness of God means that he was created in the form of God's virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The loving God created love in man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The merciful God created mercy in man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man thus possesses mercy and love; he has all the virtues God has.</S>
