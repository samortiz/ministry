   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As Christians, we believe that the Bible is the Word of God given to man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The entire Bible does three things: it manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, it shows us that the God who blesses us is loving, righteous, and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, it shows us that man is nothing, has nothing, and can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man is filled with sin; thus, he is only good to be crucified and nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third, it reveals Christ, the hidden mystery, as the Savior, the life, the life supply, and everything to fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By believing and receiving Christ, man may come back to God to be filled up with God and express God as one corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We believe not because of outward proof but because of a living touch with God the Spirit by praying in our spirit with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although we do not need any outward proof to believe, it is still good to know a few crucial facts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is good for us and for our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But never forget that people believe by the spirit, not by the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Doubt is in the mind; faith is in the spirit see note 2 of 2 Cor 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This lesson and the following lesson are based on a Chinese book entitled Is the Bible Inspired by God? by Y. L. Chang, published by the Taiwan Gospel Book Room in 1982.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I. THE PROOF BY LOGIC</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since there is a God in this universe, and since He created man, He must want to reveal Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is very great and man is very small.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the best way for Him to reveal Himself to man?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He must use the way man communicates speaking and writing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, there must exist on this earth a book through which God can communicate with man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are so many books on the face of the earth; which one is God s book to man?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How do we know?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can expect God s book to meet the following suppositions:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It should say that the author is God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It should have the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It should talk about God, His purpose, His reason for creation, man, man s problem, solutions to man s problem, and the destiny of creation and man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It should be available to all men, of all races and tongues, whether they be rich or poor, well-born or low-born, educated or uneducated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A. Authorship</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us consider all the books in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are only three books that claim divine authorship the Bible, the Koran, and the Book of Mormon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible states more than two thousand times that it is spoken by the Lord God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Immediately, we eliminate all the other books.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>B. Moral Tone</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What about the moral tone of these three books?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The moral tone of the Koran is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Its heaven is full of lusts and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God could never write a book with such licentiousness and immorality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Book of Mormon is also substandard in moral tone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It tells men that they will have many wives when they go to heaven, and it promotes bigamy on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only the Bible has the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It disallows divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Marriages of divorced people are considered adultery Matt 19:3-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible further states that even lusting in the heart is equivalent to committing adultery Matt 5:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This standard exceeds that of any other book on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It also teaches people not only to forgive from their heart Matt 18:35 but also to love their enemies Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It condemns hatred as murder Matt 5:22; 1 John 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All books on ethics deal with outward behavior; only the Bible deals with the heart to produce a moral living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>C. Content</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only the Bible tells us about God, His purpose, His reason for creation, man, man s problem, solutions to man s problem, and the destiny of creation and man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We will talk about these matters in subsequent lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>D. Availability</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible is readily available to man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It has been translated into approximately two thousand languages.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1989, six hundred million Bibles were sent out to a world population of 5.5 billion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Within ten years, the number of Bibles sent out will surpass the population of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that most of the people on the face of this earth will have an opportunity to read a Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As you can see, there is only one book that is qualified to be God s book to man, and that is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All other books on earth do not pass the test because they are not written by God to reveal Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How we praise Him for giving us the Bible and letting us find the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How much we need to treasure the Bible and see God revealed in the Bible!</S>
