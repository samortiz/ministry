<h1 class="title">PASSING THROUGH DEATH<br />
TO LIVE OUT LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 12:24-26</h1>
<p>In John 12:24-26 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life. If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant will be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.&rdquo; According to the Lord&rsquo;s words, whoever hates his soul-life in this world will keep it unto eternal life. These verses speak of two lives: the soul-life, which is our human life, and the eternal life, which is God&rsquo;s life. If we love our soul-life and are not willing to let it pass through death, we will lose it. However, if we hate our soul-life in this age and allow it to be put to death, we will keep it unto eternal life. This is a serious matter. In verse 26 the Lord indicated that He was going to die, to pass through death; hence, those who followed Him also needed to die, to pass through death. The Lord as a grain of wheat fell into the ground and died; hence, the grains that have been brought forth in Him must also pass through death. Those who serve Him must also fall into the ground and die. The Lord entered into death; hence, we cannot serve the Him without falling into the ground and dying.</p>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw that God came to be our life. This emphasizes life. However, if there is life, there must be a living, because living is the outward expression of life. Hence, in this chapter we will fellowship concerning the expression of life, that is, our living. We will see how the divine life is lived out of us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF DEATH</h2>
<p>Everything in the universe operates according to its law. Living organisms have their respective law of life. Biology is the study of the law of various organisms. These laws are fixed and definite. If we want a certain life to live and grow, we must focus on its law.</p>
<p>Among the laws of life, there is the great law of death. Many Christians have an inaccurate understanding concerning the death of the Lord Jesus on the cross. In the Bible death has a negative aspect as well as a positive aspect. Whereas the negative aspect of death is perdition, the positive aspect includes more than redemption. Death is also the prerequisite for the divine life to grow in man. The death given to us by Adam is negative; this death comes from sin. If we have only the death from Adam, we will perish. However, we thank the Lord that He has given us another aspect of death. We treasure the cross because it is a symbol, a sign, of death. The cross of Calvary declares that a unique death has been accomplished in the universe. The salvation that we as Christians receive depends on this death.</p>
<p>Through the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross, we have not only redemption but also life and the growth of life. Many of those who speak of the cross give the impression that the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross was only for redemption; the Lord Jesus died on the cross to bear our sins, to be judged by God on our behalf, and to taste death for us. This is not wrong, but it is not complete. The Lord Jesus died on the cross not only to bear our sins and accomplish redemption; He died to release the divine life so that this life could grow in us and be lived out of us. This is what He said in John 12:24. The grain of wheat must die in order to become many grains. Such a death is not a terrible death; rather, it is a wonderful death, in which one grain of wheat became many grains. Such a death did not cause the grain of wheat to perish, but rather it released the life that was in the grain of wheat.</p>
<p>Without such a death on the cross, it would not be possible for the divine life within the Lord Jesus to be released. It was through His death that the life within Him could be released. Hence, this death causes life to be released. The release of life through death is a great principle that applies to many organisms; if they do not pass through death, the life within them cannot be released. This is true not only with the plant life, such as a grain of wheat, but also with the animal life. In order for an egg to hatch and bring forth a baby chick, the eggshell must be broken. This breaking is the passing through death. Furthermore, in order for life to be transmitted from one organism to another, both parties need to pass through death. For example, in order to give blood, the donor must be pricked for blood to flow out, and the recipient must also be pricked in order for blood to flow in. This kind of pricking is in the principle of death. Not only so, the food that we eat, whether it is of the plant life or the animal life, also needs to pass through the principle of death. Anything that we eat must pass through death before it can enter into us to become nutrients. Similarly, God also passed through death before He could enter into us. If He had not passed through death, He would not have been able to enter into us to be our life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
