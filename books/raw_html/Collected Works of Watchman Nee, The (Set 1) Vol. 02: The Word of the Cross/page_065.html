<H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SALVATION AND REWARD</H1><P>When a lost person receives Jesus, he freely obtains an eternal and perfect salvation. His sins are forgiven, righteousness is imputed to him, and the records of his sins are forever erased.</P><P>God calls sinners to receive salvation and calls saints to receive the reward. Salvation is given through the righteousness of the Lord Jesus. The reward is given through the work of the Christians. A man cannot be saved through good works, neither can he be rewarded through faith. Salvation comes from believing in the Lord Jesus as the Savior, and the reward comes from the good works which one performs after he is saved.</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>Salvation:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>Salvation is a free gift:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"The gift of God" (John 4:10)</li>			<li>"Take...freely" (Rev. 22:17)</li>			<li>"The gift of God" (Rom. 6:23)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Salvation is a present inheritance:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Gave" (1 John 5:11)</li>			<li>"Has saved us" (2 Tim. 1:9)</li>			<li>"Has eternal life" (John 6:47)<br>			If a saved person works faithfully for the Lord, he will receive a reward. Such a promise may cause a believer 			to free himself from the pleasures of the world, keep him from falling, and grant him victory in an hour of 			persecution or temptation.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>Reward:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>What is the reward?			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Crown" (2 Tim. 4:8; 1 Pet. 5:2-4; Rev. 2:10)</li>			<li>"Throne" (Matt. 19:28; Rev. 3:21)</li>			<li>"Reign with Him" (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:6)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The requirements for the reward:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Labor" (1 Cor. 3:8)</li>			<li>"Work" (Rev. 22:12)</li>			<li>"A cup of cold water" (Matt. 10:42)</li>			<li>"Do" (Col. 3:23-24)</li>			<li>"Do good" (Luke 6:35)</li>			<li>"Pray...in secret" (Matt. 6:6)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The basis of reward:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>Motive (Matt. 6:1)</li>			<li>"Hidden things...counsels of the hearts" (1 Cor. 4:5)</li>			<li>"In the name of a disciple" (Matt. 10:42)</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol><P>In summary, "For by grace you have been saved...not of works" (Eph. 2:8-9). "But if by grace, it is no longer out of works" (Rom. 11:6). The reward depends on whether or not we have worked for the Lord after being saved.</P>
