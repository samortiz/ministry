   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being a Slave as a Child-Conductor</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The law is no longer the most important item.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians 3:24 says that the law is our child-conductor unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The King James Version mistakenly translates this word as schoolmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Strictly speaking, the law is not a schoolmaster but a child-conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Conybeare tells us that in the ancient times there was not the system of schooling that we have today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time there were schoolmasters, to whose houses parents would send their young children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more wealthy people at that time had slaves, so when parents sent their children to the schoolmaster's home to study, a slave would accompany them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the children were young, they could get lost travelling from their parent's home to the schoolmaster, so they needed the slave to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certain versions of the Bible mistakenly cause people to understand that the law is the schoolmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The law is not the schoolmaster; the schoolmaster is Christ, and the law is the child-conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's intention is to bring us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, just as parents used slaves to bring young, immature children to a schoolmaster, God used the law as a child-conductor to bring His people to Christ, the schoolmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because children are young, foolish, and childish, they need a child-conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, when they grow up, there is no need of a child-conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, according to the context of Galatians 3, the position of the law is the position of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being a Maidservant</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Galatians 4:21-31 shows us something more concerning the position of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abraham had two wives.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sarah is a type of God's grace, while Abraham's maidservant, Hagar, typifies the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The position of the law is the position of a maidservant, or concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the position of the law is not positive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>None of us would want to be the child of a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason we know that the law is not something according to God's final goal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The law helped toward the goal, but it does not belong to God's ultimate purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Galatians 3:19 tells us that the law "was added because of the transgressions," but it was not something originally intended by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The law was not part of God's original purpose, and it is not a part of His ultimate purpose, His ultimate consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, it was added on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the process of fulfilling God's eternal purpose, something happened, so the law was added to correct and adjust the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must be very clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW God's Original Purpose and Ultimate Intention to Give Us Christ</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The book of Galatians reveals that the original purpose and ultimate intention of God is to give us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's plan and God's purpose is to give us Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the time of Abraham, God came in to promise him not the law and not seeds but a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That promise to Abraham is called the gospel in Galatians 3:8.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 8 says, "And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: In you shall all the nations be blessed.'"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may have thought that gospel preaching started after the Lord ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, according to Galatians 3 God began to preach the gospel to mankind at least in Genesis 12 when He promised Abraham a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The message of the gospel is, "In you shall all the nations be blessed," and the content of this message is, "your seed, who is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 16 says, "But to Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He does not say, And to the seeds,' as concerning many, but as concerning one: And to your seed,' who is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God preached the gospel to Abraham, and its message was that all the nations would be blessed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The content of the message is that Christ is the unique seed because God's intention and purpose is to give us Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At a certain point in time, before the fullness of the time 4:4 , God came in to promise that He would give a seed, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must realize who this Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the very embodiment of God; all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is the very reality of God; all that God is, all God's fullness, is embodied in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is such a One, yet He became the seed of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, He is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the one hand, Christ as the seed is a blessing, and on the other hand, this seed is the one who inherits the blessing Gal 3:8-9, 14, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, He is the one who blesses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is the very God who blesses, He is the promised blessing, and He is the seed who inherits the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is altogether wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we want to have a share in this blessing, we must be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In principle, God does not bless you or me; He blesses only one person, who is the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we desire to receive the blessing, we must be a part of this one seed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be in Christ, be a part of Christ, and belong to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Galatians 3:29 says, "And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The word seed is singular; the descendants of Abraham are many, but they are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You and I must be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is the one who blesses, the promised blessing, and the One who inherits the blessing.</S>
