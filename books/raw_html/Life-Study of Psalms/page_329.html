<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In His Greatness above All Gods</H2><P>In verse 5 the psalmist says, "I know that Jehovah is great /And that our Lord is above all gods." Then in verses 15 through 18 he explains, "The idols of the nations are silver and gold,/The work of human hands./They have mouths, but they do not speak;/They have eyes, but they do not see. /They have ears, but they do not give ear;/And there is no breath in their nostrils./Those who make them,/All who trust in them,/Are like them." Here we have a comparison between our God, who is particular, and the gods, the idols, who cannot speak, see, or hear. Our God is mightier than the gods and is above all gods.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. In His Being Mighty to Do as He Pleases<br>in Heaven, on Earth, and in the Seas</H2><P>Verses 6 and 7 indicate that the priests were also charged to praise God in His creation. "Whatever Jehovah pleases He does/In heaven and on earth,/In the seas and all the depths. / He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;/He makes lightning for the rain;/He brings forth wind from His treasuries." He regulates the atmosphere around the globe for the benefit of all living things&#151;plants, animals, and human beings&#151;because they all need the clouds, the wind, and the rain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. In His Marvelous Deeds in Egypt,<br>upon Its Firstborn, of Man and of Beast,<br>and unto Pharaoh and All His Servants</H2><P>Verses 8 and 9 tell us that the priests were to praise God in His marvelous deeds in Egypt, upon its firstborn, of man and of beast, and unto Pharaoh and all his servants.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. In His Striking of Great Nations<br>and His Slaying of All the Kings of Canaan,<br>Especially King Sihon and King Og</H2><P>In verses 10 through 12 we have a word regarding Jehovah's striking of great nations and His slaying of all the kings of Canaan, especially Sihon king of the Amorites and Og king of Bashan. These kings were the two gate-guards of the demonic and idolatrous Canaan. Jehovah smote the nations and the kings so that He might give their lands as an inheritance to Israel His people. The psalmist charged the priests to praise God for all that He did in bringing Israel into Canaan and killing the kings so that His people could possess the land.</P>
