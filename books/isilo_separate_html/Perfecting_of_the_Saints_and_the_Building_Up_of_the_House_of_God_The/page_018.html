TO BE GOVERNED AND MANAGED</h2>
<p>Anyone who visits Hong Kong sees the governing and management of the British officials. They govern and manage land, transportation, traffic, and many other matters. As a result, many places that previously were inaccessible to the public are now accessible. Some places where the land was too high were made flat, and places that were low were filled in. For instance, they leveled a hill in Kowloon City and made a new runway for the airport on land that they reclaimed along the coast. In the past it was difficult for planes to take off and land at the airport in Hong Kong, because the airport, which is located at the foot of a hill, was affected by slight changes in the weather around the hill. The government leveled the hill in Kowloon and used the earth to reclaim and develop land along the coast. Moreover, the large rocks from the hill were used for construction. The land that was reclaimed was also used for a park, and portions were sold to individuals and businesses. This benefited the people.</p>
<p>This example shows that administration includes both governing and management. The elders in a local church should not only govern but also manage. A person who does not govern cannot manage; if he does not have the position and the authority to govern, he cannot manage. However, a person with the position to govern must also manage. We do not seem to have a problem governing the church, but we have a problem with management. The problems in a large local church may be the result of our not knowing how to manage. When we speak of perfecting the saints in these messages, we are emphasizing management, which covers many areas.</p>
<p>If we want a local church to be built up, we must have a rich supply from the word and proper administration, which includes governing and management. The churches under our responsibility need to be governed and managed. Some localities are governed, but they do not seem to be managed. For example, the elders must make up the lack in the meetings. The elders should not govern the saints while neglecting the management of the meetings. They should be concerned if a meeting lacks content and not let a weakened situation continue.</p>
<p>Hong Kong was previously a deserted island with hills, valleys, and barely any roads. It was difficult for airplanes to take off and land and transportation was not convenient. Then Hong Kong was placed under the British administration. This is an example of how we need to administrate the church. We should not require a church to merely be put under the governing of the elders. Governing is for management. An elder should manage a meeting that is under his care. He should make up for what is lacking and strengthen what is weak. Our lack is management, not governing. In a family the parents cannot demand that the children be under their governing but not manage the children&rsquo;s needs for clothing or food. If the parents do not manage the needs of the children, they are governing without management.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances we should manage more than we govern. In the churches we need more management than governing. We must admit that we are weak in the matter of administration. However, our basic problem is our lack of the supply from the word. The supply from the word is a big lack among us. Let us consider the positive aspect of the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPLYING THE WORD</h2>
<p>The saints responsible for the district meetings should pay attention to supplying the word. A primary matter in society is to take care of the supply of food. This is the reason that every administration focuses on supplying people with food. If the people in a country are not fed, it is difficult to administrate that country. Similarly, if the children in a family are hungry and lack proper nutrition, there will be many problems. This also applies to the church. If the ministry of the word is weak, the saints will lack the supply from the word; they will come to the meetings hungry and leave hungry. The saints who are hungry will eventually stop attending the meetings and will backslide. Moreover, many problems will arise.</p>
<p>A person who is malnourished suffers from different kinds of diseases. In the same way, opinions, criticisms, judgments, and reasonings come in and produce a negative atmosphere when a church lacks the supply from the word. A rich supply of nutrients enables a person&rsquo;s body to destroy germs so that diseases are swallowed up. Similarly, if there is a rich supply from the word, the negative speaking is swallowed up.</p>
<p>On the negative side, we can focus on the diseases in a person, but on the positive side, if we want a person to have normal growth, we have to give him adequate nutrition. A malnourished person cannot grow properly. Similarly, a church that does not have a rich supply from the word cannot develop, the function of the saints will not be manifested, and the various needs in the church will not be met. We need to see the importance of supplying the word. When there is a rich supply from the word, every problem will be terminated and every need will be met. Taking care of problems and needs depends on the supply of the word.</p>
<p>Diseases in the body are eliminated by the nutrients in the food a person eats. The proper growth and development of every part of a person depend on the nutrients in food. When there is a shortage of nutrients, the proper growth and development of the body stops, and germs that enter the body can cause diseases. Hence, it is useless to try and cure a disease if a person refuses to eat. Likewise, there will be no effect if we repeatedly attempt to solve the problems in a church when there is a shortage in the supply of the word. The problems in the church are not really problems; they are the result of a shortage in the supply of the word. As soon as there is a sufficient supply, the problems will spontaneously disappear, and there will spontaneously be the growth and building up. When we lack the supply of the word, everything becomes a demand, and the more demands that there are, the less likely that they will be met.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who serve in the ministry of the word must know that a church is weak when the supply of the word is weak, it is poor when the supply of the word is poor, and it has problems when there is a problem in the supply of the word. When there is a shortage in the word, a church cannot be built up in a good way and materials will not be produced for the building. In our service in the church we should not complain about this or about that. We should not blame the brothers, sisters, elders, or deacons for the different problems. Our complaints will not solve the problems. If we give the church a &ldquo;physical checkup,&rdquo; we will see different germs that indicate a lack of nutrition. The root of the abnormal situations in the church is an inadequate supply from the word; the saints have not been given a sufficient supply of nutrients.</p>
<p>Children who do not eat well and are skinny and sickly are prone to suffer from different diseases. Instead of blaming the children for being sick, we should blame the parents who do not feed the children. If parents feed their children with sufficient nutrients, the children will be healthy and strong. As long as the children have enough nutritious food to eat, they will not be sick. This is an accurate illustration. If we want to solve the problems in the church, we should forget about everything and minister the word. As soon as there is a rich supply of the word, there will be many vitamins and nutrients supplied to the saints. As a result, the problems and diseases will be eliminated, and the church will be strong and healthy. The key is in the supply of the word.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
