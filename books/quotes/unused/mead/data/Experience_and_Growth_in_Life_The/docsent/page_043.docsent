   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE GROWTH IN LIFE 8 Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10-11; 6:4-5; 8:2, 10, 6, 11, 13 RECONCILED THROUGH THE DEATH OF GOD'S SON, SAVED IN HIS LIFE, AND BOASTING IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 5:10-11 says, "For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And not only so, but we also are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 10 speaks of the death of Christ and the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were reconciled to God through the death of Christ, and now we are being saved in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to verse 11, we also are boasting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Boast has the meaning of exult and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are boasting, exulting, and glorying in God because we are being saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To exult is to be crazily happy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While we are being saved in the life of Christ, we should not be too quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every day we have to boast, exult, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This should be the expression of our salvation in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were reconciled to God through the death of Christ, and we are now being saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This salvation is not our eternal salvation but our daily, moment by moment salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the trials that we undergo seem to last a long time, this may indicate that we are not enjoying our moment by moment salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are experiencing this salvation, we will boast and exult, and the trials will pass by quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the Lord's sovereignty, we are often placed in trying situations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way to enjoy this salvation in these situations is to boast, exult, and glory in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul's writing in Romans 5:10-11 was very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, he did not compose these verses merely according to doctrine but according to his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not say that we boast, exult, and glory in our salvation, but in the person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are enjoying our salvation in God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that we have a direct contact, union, and connection with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our enjoyment in God may be compared to the enjoyment of a child with his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Little children care mainly for their mother's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The younger a child is, the closer he stays to his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You can take away many things from a baby without disturbing him, but you cannot take away the presence of his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way, we enjoy the salvation of Christ in the person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul's wording in these verses is wonderful, especially in his use of prepositions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is through the death of God's Son that we are reconciled to God, but it is in His life that we are saved daily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that if we are not in God experientially, we cannot be saved in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must have a direct, instant union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be saved minute by minute, we must be in God, in the direct, constant, and instant union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, we are now boasting, exulting, and glorying, not in the death of Christ or even in His life but in the person of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are one with Him, minute by minute.</S>
