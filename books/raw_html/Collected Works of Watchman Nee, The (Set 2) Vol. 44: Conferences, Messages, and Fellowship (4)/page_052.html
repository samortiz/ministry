<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE WILL AND THE LAW OF LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:27-30; Rom. 7:18-19, 21-25a; 8:1-4; Matthew 6 is on the physical life; Romans 8 is on the spiritual life.</h1><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>Every life has its law. For example, a man can only grow to a certain height. He cannot add an inch to his stature. It is impossible for anyone to try to become taller by self-effort or will power. He can only be as tall as his natural life allows. This is also true of the spiritual life. What you are is what you are; you cannot increase your spiritual stature by the power of your will. Life is something spontaneous; it has what it has and is what it is. A short person can make himself look taller by wearing high heels, but he can only do this for a little while. When he takes the shoes off, his height de- creases. The same difficulty arises when a man makes up his mind to humble himself. He can sustain this effort for a little while, but he cannot keep it up forever. Many people try to be the kind of person they are not. This is hard. They find it hard and strenuous to be a Christian. Before Paul became a Christian, he resolved again and again to do good, but the good that he willed, he did not do, and the evil that he did not will, that he did. This is because another law of evil was operating in his members. Many Christians feel that they are too talkative or too proud. They think that if they strive, restrict themselves, and cultivate themselves a little, they will improve. They do not realize that there is a law of sin within them which the power of the will has no control over and which can never be overcome.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE OVERCOMING THE LAW OF SIN</h2><p>The first three chapters of Romans is about what man as a sinner has done. Then Romans 7 tells us what man is in himself&mdash;a sinner. The first three chapters of Romans talk about what man has done; this involves the need of forgiveness. Romans 7 and 8 deal with what a man is in himself; this involves the need of freedom. The first three chapters tell us that the evils that man has committed are forgiven through the redemption of Christ Jesus. Romans 7 and 8 tell us about the law of sin&mdash;that which is within man's being&mdash;and how man is released from it through the law of the Spirit of life. An unbeliever tries to walk according to the power of his will. But a Christian should not walk according to the power of his will. God delivers us from the first law through the operation of the second law.</p><p>During the Ching Dynasty, there was a toll tax which was a heavy burden to many people. The Ching Dynasty set up many toll stations throughout the country, and the toll officers possessed tremendous authority. In order for a load of goods to pass through several provinces, the owner had to pay a heavy toll tax. When the Nationalist government took over, a new law was decreed that replaced the old toll tax. Those who were suffering under the old law were relieved by the institution of the new law. They did not need to hope or pray for change any longer, because the new law had been instituted and had delivered them from the old law.</p>
