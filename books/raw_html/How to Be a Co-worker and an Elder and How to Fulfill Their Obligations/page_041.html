<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Not Setting the Mind on the Mingled Spirit</H2><P>Our mind is always a "strange creature" dominating us. If you cannot go to sleep, it is because of this strange creature. If your heart is troubled and anxious, it is also because of this strange creature. The Scripture says that we should be anxious in nothing, but are we like this? Do we set our mind on the spirit (Rom. 8:5-6)? Do not separate your mind from your spirit; rather, let your spirit become the spirit of your mind (Eph. 4:23). Such a spirit of the mind is a renewing spirit. To be renewed means that we are renewed in the spirit of our mind. When our spirit and our mind are blended together, we can praise without any worry; we can be full of peace without any anxiety; we can be at rest without any agitation. Otherwise, we will have insomnia, worry, anxiety, fanciful thoughts, and wild imaginations. Our mind is like a wild horse. We have to bridle our mind and set it on our spirit so that it may come under the control of our spirit. Brothers and sisters, do we practice setting our mind on the mingled spirit in our daily life?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Not Magnifying Christ by Living Him</H2><P>Furthermore, we need to beware of not magnifying Christ by living Him through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19-21). Bountiful supply is a mystery, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is also a mystery. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is not merely the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of the One who was incarnated, who experienced human life, and who died and resurrected. Such a Spirit of Jesus Christ has a bountiful supply. Do you need patience? He is patience. Do you need calm? He is calm. Whatever you need, He is. He is the bountiful supply.</P><P>Often, instead of living Christ, we live ourselves, and instead of magnifying Christ, we belittle Him. We are the servants of Christ, yet we live a life of worrying, of blaming others, of criticizing others, of being unsatisfied, and of murmuring. If we do not live or magnify Christ, how can we serve God and minister to the churches?</P><P>Dear brothers and sisters, we should not merely read these items and let them go. We need to check them, item by item, and beware of them. We should not only be wary of ambition, pride, and self-justification, which are not deadly but merely little foxes and small fleas. Much more, we need to beware of the items given in this chapter, all of which are deadly.</P><P>What we speak of in this chapter is like the many sicknesses in our body. Today we need to guard against high blood pressure, heart attacks, and many other sicknesses. A flea means nothing. A little fox running around in the garden is also insignificant. However, if our body is entirely sick, that is fatal. Hence, we must beware. If our meetings are not living, fresh, uplifting, or rich, it is mostly because we, the co-workers and elders who are taking the lead, are negligent in these crucial items, not guarding against them.</P>
