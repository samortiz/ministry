<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Healing the Bad Water of Jericho</H2><P>First, Elisha healed the bad water of Jericho (2 Kings 2:19-22). When the men of the city told Elisha that the water was bad and that the land was barren, he went out to the source of the water and threw salt there, saying, "Thus says Jehovah, I have healed this water; there will not be any more death or barrenness from there" (v. 21). Jericho signifies Satan, and with Satan everything is death, including the water. But the bad water of Jericho was healed according to the word of Elisha and became good water, water that gave life.</P><P>The first miracle the Lord Jesus performed in the Gospel of John was the changing of water into wine (2:3-11). The significance of this miracle is the changing of death into life. Changing death into life is the governing principle of all the Lord's miracles in the Gospel of John and of all the cases dealt with by Him in chapters three through eleven of John. The significance of the miracle performed by Elisha in 2 Kings 2 and of the miracle performed by the Lord Jesus in John 2 is the same&#151;the changing of death into life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Calling the Things Not Being as Being</H2><P>Next, Elisha called the things not being as being (2 Kings 4:1-7, 8-17, 42-44; cf. Matt. 14:14-21; 15:32-39; Rom. 4:17b). In particular, Elisha called things not being as being when he produced many vessels of oil from one vessel. The Lord Jesus did the same thing in principle. In Matthew 14 and 15 He fed multitudes with a few loaves and fishes.</P><P>In this matter also Elisha was a type of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament age. More than any other prophet, Elisha did things that, in type, were the same as what the Lord Jesus did in reality. In principle, Elisha and the Lord Jesus did the same thing, performing miracles of grace in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Resurrecting the Dead from Death</H2><P>Elisha also resurrected the dead from death (2 Kings 4:18-37; cf. Heb. 11:35; Luke 7:11-17; John 11:41-44; Rom. 4:17b). The Lord Jesus has resurrected millions of persons, including us (John 5:25).</P><P>Calling things not being as being and giving life to the dead are not merely miracles. They are grace resulting in life unto the reigning in life as kings.</P>
