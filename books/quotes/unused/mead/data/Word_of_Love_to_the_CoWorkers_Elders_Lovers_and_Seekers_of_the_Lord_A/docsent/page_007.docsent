   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO SHEPHERDING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO THE LORD S HEART Scripture Reading: John 3:16; 1 Tim 1:15; 1 John 4:10; Matt 9:10-13; Luke 7:34-50; 15:1-24; James 5:19-20; Prov 10:12; Gal 6:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will fellowship concerning how we should learn of the Lord to shepherd people according to His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This fellowship is not merely a teaching, instruction, or rebuke; it is a shepherding to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>LOVE COVERING ALL TRANSGRESSIONS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The way that some of you have spoken concerning corporate living has bothered me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Proverbs 10:12 says, Hatred stirs up strife, / But love covers all transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we hate each other, we will have endless strife, but love covers not only one sin or some sins, but all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>James ends his writing by saying, My brothers, if any one among you is led astray from the truth and someone turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that one s soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins 5:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Should we hate one who is not up to the standard, who is led astray from the truth, or should we love him?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may not love those who are not able to live in corporate living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may only love the particular group of those who live properly in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is altogether not according to the Spirit of the Lord as revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a brother is good, he does not need our love very much because he has already been sufficiently loved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nearly everyone loves a good person, but what about one who is led astray from the truth?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a brother is led astray from the truth to attend the denominations or go to the movies, our small group may feel that we do not need him, and we do not accept him because he is not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not love; this is hate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Love covers many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if we know that he goes to the movies, we should not tell others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is to cover him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not like to uncover him or expose him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To uncover is not love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We would rather be like the sons of Noah who covered their father s nakedness which was due to his drunkenness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not like to uncover others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Covering brings in blessing, but uncovering brings in a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who uncover suffer the curse, but those who cover others sins, defects, and shortcomings enjoy, gain, and receive blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Cover a multitude of sins in James 5:20 is an Old Testament expression used by James to indicate that turning an erring brother back is to cover his sins so that he is not condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Cover...sins here equals sins...forgiven in verse 15, as in Psalm 32:1, which says, Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven; / Whose sin is covered.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the same in Psalm 85:2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOD LOVING THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>FOR SINNERS TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THAT IS, TO BECOME THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By reading all the above verses, we can see the heart of our God and of our Savior Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John 3:16 says, For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The heart of our God is to love not only righteous men but sinners, even the world, which is worse than mere sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>World denotes the sinful, fallen people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The entire human race became the world, just as the entire divine race, the new race, will become the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Jerusalem is the totality, the consummation, of the eternal life, while the world is the totality, the consummation, of the fallen race.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a hardship for translators to translate verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Chinese version renders it in a way that can be interpreted, God loved the people on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The world denoting the fallen race is seen in the word flesh in Genesis 6:3, which says, My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because all the people on this earth became flesh, God decided to temporarily forsake the world, which He loved, for a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God loved the fallen human race, who became so rotten as to be one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The world indicates man becoming one with Satan, becoming Satan s cosmos, the satanic system that systematizes all people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way, world is worse than sinners because it denotes that man is incorporated with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>World, denoting the human race in John 3:16, is a very bad term.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God so loved the world, sinful people in their worst denotation, that He gave His only begotten Son, not so that they would go to heaven but that whoever believes into Him would not perish but have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>John 3:16 is a new verse to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We generally interpret this verse to mean that if we believe in the Lord Jesus as the Son given by God, we will have His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That is right, and there is nothing wrong with this, but the goal of having the divine life is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God loved the human race, the worst human people, with the intention that they all may participate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eternal life here is the same as in 4:14, which says, The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To have eternal life means to be joined to, to participate in, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The banners for the Crystallization-study of the Gospel of John say that the Triune God who passed through all the processes, the all-inclusive Christ who was incarnated to die and resurrect, and the life-giving Spirit who was consummated to indwell us all take the New Jerusalem as Their eternal goal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When I wrote this utterance, I realized that few would understand why I used it for a crystallization-study of John, but it is the conclusion of my study of John.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this crystallization-study I thoroughly and intrinsically came to the clear conclusion that this Gospel, especially from chapter one to chapter four, is the record of the flowing God in His three stages: the Father as the fountain, the Son as the spring, and the Spirit as the flowing river.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Moreover, They all take the New Jerusalem as Their eternal goal.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Apparently, the New Jerusalem is not mentioned in John.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, it is seen in the eternal life in 4:14.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Eternal life here is the totality of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A man is the totality of the human life; each one of us is the totality of the human life, but the divine life has only one totality in the whole universe the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Bible teaches us that eternal life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the beginning there is God as the eternal life, and the consummation of God as the eternal life is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible consummates in the New Jerusalem, which is the very God who was in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How does God become the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is through His flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Bible has two ends, Genesis 1 2 and Revelation 21 22.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At the beginning of the Bible there is God, at the end there is the New Jerusalem, and in between are hundreds of pages speaking about all the matters related to the eternal life, including the believers, regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the proper way to view the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All the activities of the eternal life take the New Jerusalem as the final goal.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the meaning of into eternal life in John 4:14.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The word into is also used in 1 Corinthians 12:13, which says that the Gentiles and the Jews have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Into one Body does not mean merely to enter into the Body but to become the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the same way, into eternal life does not merely mean to enter into the New Jerusalem as the eternal life but to become the New Jerusalem as the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The coming New Jerusalem will be you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The New Jerusalem is still under a consummating work, and this consummating work is the flow of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is very deep.</S>
