[1]  The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the House of God CONTENTS
[2]  The Vision of God s Desire to Be Man s Life
[3]  In the first six messages our fellowship will mainly be to gain spiritual understanding.
[4]  The purpose of this fellowship is not to discuss certain matters or to set up a training but rather to provide an opportunity for us to come together and fellowship concerning the work and the service.
[5]  I am also burdened to fellowship concerning the building up of the church, our spiritual pursuit, and the supply through the ministry of the word.
[6]  In relation to our disposition, regardless of how much we experience salvation, God does not intend to annul our disposition.
[7]  The visit by T. Austin-Sparks at the end of 1955 was a notable event among us.
[8]  Before his visit we did not have official fellowship or contact with any Christian group in the West.
[9]  Brother Sparks s visit and his fellowship gave us many impressions that caused us to pay attention to the direction and the work of the Lord in the present age.
[10]  The two major Christian groups in the West are the Keswick Convention and the evangelicals.
[11]  In Hong Kong I read a book which said that Brother Sparks says that the believers need to know the Body and that a believer who does not know the Body has not entered into the Body.
[12]  We can say with a clear conscience, that from the time we began to serve the Lord until today, we had no intention to be in Christianity.
[13]  Just as Brother Sparks and the brothers who gathered in Scotland carefully considered the way that the Lord wants them to take and the work that they should do, we also feel that we should focus on certain things.
[14]  The saints who are co-workers need to know where we are, the situation we are in, what our need is, what our focus should be, and what we should be doing.
[15]  In the previous chapter we saw that only when we have a thorough knowledge of life, the church, and the kingdom can our work meet the need of this age.
[16]  If we have the truth concerning the church but do not have life, we cannot have the testimony of the church.
[17]  Neither can we have the reality of the kingdom if we have only the truth concerning the kingdom but do not have life.
[18]  We often speak about life, and we know that God is life and that life is God.
[19]  This does not mean that believers did not know that God is their life, nor does it mean that they did not experience and enjoy God as life.
[20]  God used Brother Nee to say that God is constituted into us, but today we say that we should absorb God so that He can become our constituent, and we also say that the divine nature and the human nature are mingled together.
[21]  Hence, we need to be alert so that we do not become dropouts in the Lord s recovery.
[22]  We need to catch up with God and see what He wants to recover.
[23]  We should ask ourselves why God placed Adam and Eve in front of the tree of life after He created them.
[24]  The vision of eating and drinking God begins with the tree of life in Genesis and ends with the tree of life at the end of Revelation.
[25]  The green pastures signify God, the waters of rest signify God, the paths of righteousness signify God, the rod and the staff signify God, and even the valley of the shadow of death signifies God.
[26]  The principle for the practical building up of the church is revealed mainly in Ephesians 4:11-16: He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error, but holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[27]  A teaching may be scriptural but still distract the believers and carry them away from God s central purpose, which is to build up the church as the Body of Christ.
[28]  Many portions in the Bible show that the church must be built up.
[29]  If Matthew 16 was the only portion that spoke of the building of the church, we would think that the church is built directly by the Lord Jesus, because in verse 18 the Lord said, Upon this rock I will build My church.
[30]  After we labor in a place, we should be able to say that instead of building up the church directly, we have perfected a group of saints who can now fulfill their responsibility and manifest their function.
[31]  There are three steps in the building up of the church.
[32]  The Lord first gives gifts to the church, and the gifts perfect the saints in different places.
[33]  Then the perfected saints are able to function according to their measure because their organic function has been activated through the perfecting.
[34]  Of course, there is a portion of the building up that we do directly according to our function, but our primary work is to perfect the saints.
[35]  If we, the workers, build up the church directly, we are replacing the saints in the building up of the church.
[36]  However, the fact that we perfect the saints to build the church does not mean that we absolutely do not build up the church directly.
[37]  Suppose we need a table, and we have a pile of wood.
[38]  We should not merely beautify a piece of wood by sanding and polishing it, we should also determine what type of furniture we can make with the wood.
[39]  TO SUBMIT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE HEAD THE CO-WORKERS ALWAYS PERFECTING THE SAINTS
[40]  Wherever the workers are, they must perfect the saints.
[41]  If the workers replace the saints instead of perfecting them, the church will not be built up.
[42]  In order to perfect the saints, we do not work by ourselves; instead, we work with the saints to teach them to do what we do.
[43]  Initially, we work by ourselves, but after a while the saints are able to work with us and are even better than we are.
[44]  To edify means to make something better, that is, to improve it.
[45]  I have been in the Lord s work for at least twenty-five years, and I have suffered much during this time.
[46]  For example, because I knew that we would suffer a great loss when Brother T. Austin-Sparks was here last spring, I tried to prevent anything from happening.
[47]  However, because the church is in a state of confusion, we must find the way to obtain God s blessing and find the proper ground that will retain God s blessing.
[48]  Even though we do not emphasize the result of our work, it would be better to have five thousand saints who can hear the messages that are being released instead of two thousand saints.
[49]  The principle of our work must be to bring the saints who are under our leading to do whatever we can do, even if they do not have our capacity or know as much as we do.
[50]  Verse 13 clearly says that the building is for us to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God so that we have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[51]  Thus, as we perfect the saints, we cause them to know the Son of God and to have the increase of the stature of Christ.
[52]  We perfect the saints with the tree of life, the living God, and with the resurrected Christ, the Son of God.
[53]  If we do not experience the tree of life, breathe the living God, and know and appropriate the riches of Christ, the Son of God, we will not be able to build others with these items.
[54]  What matters is how much we can dispense the riches of Christ into the saints, give them the tree of life to eat, and help them to breathe the living God.
[55]  In all things means that in every item of our daily life we live in Christ, we breathe God, we eat the tree of life, and we enjoy the Son of God.
[56]  Then the saints in the locality where we labor will not only know how to absorb and enjoy God, to grow in Christ, to touch the divine life in everything, and to submit to God s authority, but they will also be perfected and built up to be the church.
[57]  The content of our work must always cause the saints to gain God; in everything we must lead the saints to breathe God, to enter into the life of Christ, and to submit to the authority of the Head.
[58]  In the past we paid much attention to the exercise of the brothers when they minister the word.
[59]  We should not think that if we have three to five thousand saints, we have materials for the building up of the church.
[60]  The Chinese have a saying that a single statement may cause a nation to rise or to fall.
[61]  If we minister the word in a poor way, the church will suffer loss, but if we serve well, the church will benefit.
[62]  The brothers who minister the word must not merely collect some points from reference books.
[63]  If our speaking consists of only what we collect from reference books, the words that we speak will not come from our experience of God and will not pass through God.
[64]  This does not mean that reference books are useless, nor does it mean that we should not use them, but the words that we speak must pass through God, and they must have the element of the experience of God.
[65]  Otherwise, we are those who buy and sell goods ; we have not passed through God, and we have no experience that comes out of God.
[66]  If we do, our speaking will not be the word of the ministry, because it did not pass through God and does not have the Spirit of God.
[67]  We can say that according to the riches of His glory, God is strengthening the saints through His Spirit into their inner man that Christ may make His home in their hearts that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God 3:16-19 .
[68]  We can also say that God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us v. 20 . This is what we need to say to the saints when we speak on the book of Ephesians.
[69]  IN THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD THE BASIC PRINCIPLE IN THE SERVICE OF THE WORD
[70]  Those who serve in the ministry of the word need to supply the saints with God.
[71]  Moreover, their words should be spirit and life and should pass through God and should have the experience in God.
[72]  Since we minister the word to supply the saints, we must always hold the central line revealed in the Bible, which is God as life to man.
[73]  No matter how many messages we give, how logical our messages are, or how many topics we cover, we should always focus on God as life.
[74]  However, before speaking about human conduct, Paul says that we are in Christ 1:7 , that Christ is in us 3:17 , and that we are to be filled unto all the fullness of God v. 19 . He also says that the power of God operates in us v. 20 and that we should walk worthily of the calling with which we were called 4:1 . We need a deeper realization that God is in us and that He has called us to enjoy Him.
[75]  The brothers who minister the word need to see that the word as the utterance of God is spirit and life and that God enters into man to be man s life.
[76]  The messages that we preach have to be controlled by this vision.
[77]  However, because we do not see this vision, we do not speak concerning this in our messages, nor do we help the saints to see this.
[78]  Since we are God s representatives, we cannot speak our own words.
[79]  We should not give a message if we cannot touch God and fellowship with Him.
[80]  When our condition does not match what we speak, we are not speaking for God.
[81]  What we speak should minister God; otherwise, we are not speaking for God, and our words are vain and empty.
[82]  During the past few months the Lord led me to visit Japan, the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and several places in Southeast Asia.
[83]  After this trip to America and Europe, I spent time before the Lord to consider the situation in those places.
[84]  During the trip I was surprised to see that Christians highly regard any group of believers who meet in a way that is similar to the way we meet.
[85]  Even if the brother says that he does not know what to do and that he cannot speak, the local saints are satisfied if he gives a report concerning what he has seen and heard in Taiwan.
[86]  After leaving Japan, we went directly to America, and stopped briefly in Honolulu.
[87]  When we arrived on the West Coast, we visited San Francisco.
[88]  Most of the meetings in America that are similar to ours do not have a large congregation.
[89]  The group in the north and the group in the south consist of mostly Caucasian saints, and the group in San Francisco has only Chinese saints who are mainly from Taiwan, particularly from Taipei.
[90]  I initially planned to visit South America, but because of time constraints I was not able to go there.
[91]  Even though I did not go to South America, I received information concerning the situation there.
[92]  The saints in South America want some saints to migrate there.
[93]  Most of our time in Europe, about four weeks, was spent in England.
[94]  After England we went to several places in Europe, including Rome.
[95]  In our visit to the different places we observed that believers do not know Christ as life, and they do not have the building up of God s house.
[96]  They must help people know that God in Christ desires to be man s life, and they must build up the house of God so that God has a dwelling place on earth and God s children have a home.
[97]  Furthermore, even though the United States is a Christian country, there is a need to help people know Christ as life and to build them up as God s dwelling place locality by locality.
[98]  On the one hand, I am disappointed with the condition of Christianity that I saw during my visit abroad, but on the other hand, I have more faith in the way of the church that we are taking.
[99]  We did not fellowship with all God s children in the West, but in the past we contacted Christianity in the West through their publications.
[100]  Hence, as we take this way, on the one hand, we feel that it is according to God s leading, but on the other hand, we sometimes feel that we may be too much, since there is no precedent in church history.
[101]  Before I went on this trip, I did not expect that the urgent need in every place is the building up of the house of God.
[102]  Based on this need, the messages that I gave in Hong Kong were concerning the building of God.
[103]  The saints can testify that they see the building up the local church as the house of God, and they fellowship concerning this.
[104]  After we arrived, I realized that Japan is a large and modern country that has a large population and many Christians; however, God s house is not there.
[105]  After our time in America we went to England.
[106]  I will skip the details and relate only one incident.
[107]  The day before we left England, we had our last time of fellowship with the saints at Honor Oak.
[108]  Most of the saints asked what they should do when they went back and where they should meet, but this sister said that she would never forget the help she received and that she desired to live in God s life so that God s house can be built up.
[109]  FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SPREADING Meeting the Need in Every Place
[110]  After this visit I feel that the situation of Christians in the West is disappointing, that their questions and their situation confirm that the way we know and are taking is the right way, and that the urgent need in every place is God s house.
[111]  In light of this situation, I ask whether we should limit what God has entrusted, measured, to us to the island of Taiwan?
[112]  Or will God enlarge our borders because of our growth in Him?
[113]  We are limited by what we have learned and are doing, we are not broken, we lack coordination and harmony, and we replace the saints instead of perfecting them because we lack skills.
[114]  Wherever we went, we said that the situation in Taiwan is not so good and that there are many saints who are dormant and many saints who are still childish.
[115]  One of the feelings I have from my visit abroad is that the Lord has opened a door for us.
[116]  Even if we do not take into account the openness in the West, but only consider the openness in Southeast Asia and Japan, we can see that a door is wide open.
[117]  Paul s Epistles do not speak of his spirituality.
[118]  No one who serves the Lord should be limited by what he has learned and by what he can do.
[119]  God does not call us because we are capable, and He does not call us when we are capable.
[120]  We do not need to know how to solve problems; we should know only how to pass on the vision that we have received to others and to speak of what God wants.
[121]  I knew only that I went to Shanghai with the burden and the vision that God is the tree of life and that God desires to build up the church so that the church will rise up and serve Him.
[122]  In these days God wants to recover one church in one city as His practical testimony on the earth.
[123]  Therefore, I am burdened to show the saints that those who serve the Lord should not focus only on spiritual matters.
[124]  If we focus only on being spiritual, eventually we will not be spiritual.
[125]  The issue is whether we let God open our eyes to see a vision and whether we receive a burden.
[126]  If we focus on our spirituality and learning instead of receiving a vision, burden, and revelation from God, we will eventually fall.
[127]  The brothers have expressed a desire to lead the church into the practical building and to send workers to propagate overseas.
[128]  From the fellowship in the last two meetings and from fellowship with some of the saints, I have the assurance that some brothers and sisters have a burden to go overseas for the propagation and that we need to strengthen the testimony here.
[129]  CHAPTER ELEVEN LEARNING IN THE WORK THE WORKERS MEETING THE LOCAL NEEDS
[130]  After much fellowship we are clear that several brothers need to move for their service and labor.
[131]  Some brothers want to move, and there are places that have a need.
[132]  However, it may not be beneficial for the workers who have not learned any lessons to move.
[133]  In addition to learning to coordinate and learning skills, the workers must learn to be flexible in their work.
[134]  We should not say, for example, that we cannot do anything because the saints do not want our help in a particular matter.
[135]  For example, we should not be helpless if the saints do not want to study the Bible.
[136]  If we are willing to receive this word and learn the lessons that we need in order to coordinate with others, to be flexible, and to not have opinions, we will be useful in the Lord s hand and gain spiritual weight.
[137]  CHAPTER TWELVE OUR USEFULNESS IN THE LORD S HAND THE NEED OF THE LITERATURE WORK
[138]  The saints who labor in the literature work need a proper understanding.
[139]  It may seem that the work done in the editorial room is insignificant, but it is greater than the work of speaking from the podium.
[140]  We distributed over one hundred forty thousand copies of the pamphlet concerning how to enjoy God.
[141]  I would like to fellowship concerning our usefulness in the Lord s hand.
[142]  As those who serve the Lord, our usefulness is crucial.
[143]  We want to have spiritual weight, but we must realize that spiritual weight is for us to be useful.
[144]  In other words, we have not been as useful as we could have been, because there are problems that hinder our usefulness.
[145]  We must be enlarged by God until we are willing to learn to pray, read the Lord s Word, touch the inner sense, fellowship with the saints, be proper deacons, and even learn to be elders.
[146]  If we receive a definite commission from the Lord, we will not be limited in our usefulness.
[147]  It is not easy for a person with a small heart to have faith.
[148]  It is rare for a small-hearted person to have genuine faith.
[149]  From God s point of view, our faith is as small as a mustard seed Luke 17:6 .
[150]  It is not that God does not give us a vision but that we do not receive it, because our heart is small and we lack faith.
[151]  Many brothers are still not willing to learn lessons.
[152]  For example, we have heard about the skill to labor, observed how others labor, and we have labored; however, we still are not skilled, because our heart is not set to learn in a deep way.
[153]  Some workers do not have the skill to preach the gospel, give a message, lead the saints, or fellowship with the saints.
[154]  The church has decided to hold a gospel campaign during the Chinese New Year.
[155]  Therefore, we will fellowship concerning the practice of the church preaching the gospel and the way that we have learned to preach the gospel.
[156]  Nearly twenty years ago, in 1940, we received a clear revelation from the Lord that if we want the gospel to have impact, the whole church must preach the gospel.
[157]  We will now fellowship a few matters concerning preaching the gospel.
[158]  When we preach the gospel, we first need to pray.
[159]  After a person is saved, he should make a list of his friends, relatives, and acquaintances who are not saved and have not heard the gospel.
[160]  He should then pray for them one by one.
[161]  When the church preaches the gospel, the saints have an excellent opportunity to lead their friends and relatives to salvation.
[162]  The most important part of the meeting is after the gospel friends respond and the singing is concluded.
[163]  For example, if the gospel friend wants to speak about God, we should not bring up the matter of sin.
[164]  I once observed a gospel friend who wanted to know about God, but the saints kept speaking about Bethlehem.
[165]  Some people do not believe that God exists, and others believe that God exists but do not believe that Jesus Christ is God.
[166]  Hence, in our gospel conversation, we need to lead people to believe in the existence of God, to believe that Jesus Christ is God, to see that man has sins, to acknowledge the redemption of the cross, and to believe and receive the Lord, which includes repentance and the confession of sins through prayer, and to have the assurance of salvation.
[167]  This is also what the Old Testament says in Haggai 1:8, which says that when we go up to the mountain and bring wood and build God s house, we please God and glorify God.
