   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us turn our attention to Paul's Epistles to the Corinthians, in particular to the manner in which he fulfilled his ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A brother once said that of all the books of the Bible, the Corinthian Epistles, and in particular 1 Corinthians 7, show us the peak of human experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul's experience proves this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consider the following examples:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 6 says, "But this I say by way of concession, not by way of command."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The phrase this I say clearly indicates that this was Paul's own word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 7 says, "Yet I wish all men to be even as I am myself."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a wish was Paul's own wish.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 6 presents Paul's own word, while verse 7 speaks of his own wish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not say that God commanded such or that God ordained such.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 7 continues, "But each has his own gift from God, one in this way, the other in that."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God works in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it seems as if Paul was giving his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was hoping that all would be even as he was.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 8 says, "But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I am."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was again Paul's own word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 10 says, "But to the married I charge, not I but the Lord, A wife must not be separated from her husband."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul first said that he charged them, but then he said that it was not him but the Lord who charged them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can only find such expressions in 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, Paul charged, and on the other hand, he said that it was not his charge but the Lord's charge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 12 says, "But to the rest I say, I, not the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is Paul's word again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verses 12 through 24 are all Paul's word; they are not the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How could Paul have dared to say such a word?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How could he have been so bold?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By what authority was he speaking these words?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the following verses he presents the basis for his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 25 says, "Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul did not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He honestly confessed that he did not have a commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"But I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here was the opinion of one who had been shown mercy by the Lord, one who was empowered by the Lord to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God had done a profound work in him and had made him a faithful one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was able to claim that God's mercy had made him a faithful person, that it had done so much work in him that he was now able to express his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we do not find the Lord's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, we find Paul's opinion, that is, his view concerning a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the words were Paul's. He told the Corinthians how he felt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 26 says, "I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul said that this was his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 28 says, "I am trying to spare you."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was again Paul's opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 29 says, "But this I say, brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is Paul's word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 32 says, "But I desire you to be without care."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is Paul's word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 35 says, "But this I say."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is again Paul's word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 40 says, "According to my opinion."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is Paul's opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In verse 17 Paul said, "And so I direct in all the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said this not only to the Corinthians but to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He charged all the churches with the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brothers and sisters, how marvelous this is!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the opposite of our common understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In John 8:28 the Lord said, "As My Father has taught Me, I speak these things," and in 12:50 He said, "Even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet Paul was bold to tell others that his words were his own opinions, views, and even his charge to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is either the loftiest experience or the worst experience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thank God that this is the loftiest experience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No place in the Bible is as high as 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After his words in this passage, Paul concluded by saying, "I think that I also have the Spirit of God" v. 40 . Here we reach the highest peak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul was clear that he did not have God's commandment; he was clear that he did not have a word from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His speaking was merely based on the mercy that had been shown to him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He had no other basis.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His only basis was God's compassion and mercy to him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But after he spoke, he could say that he thought he had the Spirit of God.</S>
