   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE TEN THE CHURCH BECOMING THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1; 2:12; 3:12; 4:7; 5:23-24; 2 Thes 1:3, 5, 10; 2:13-14, 16; Col 3:10-11; Rev 1:11-12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to both 1 Thessalonians 1:1 and 2 Thessalonians 1:1, the church is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that for the church to be in Christ is to be in resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This resurrection life is Christ Himself in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What we need is not self-improvement but the growth of this resurrection life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>BROUGHT INTO THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 14 we have a further indication that we the believers are in God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the traditional religious understanding, this chapter speaks of heavenly mansions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, what John 14 speaks about is not heavenly mansions; rather, it speaks of abodes, abiding places, in a divine Person, in God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verses 2 and 3 the Lord Jesus says, "In My Father's house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus was telling His disciples that through His death and resurrection He would prepare the way to bring them into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus is in the Father John 14:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He wanted His disciples also to be in the Father, as revealed in John 17:21.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through His death and resurrection, He brought His disciples into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since He is in the Father, they are also in the Father by being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, where the Lord Jesus is, there the disciples are also.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where is the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, for us to be where He is means that we also are in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is actually superstitious to believe that John 14:2 and 3 mean that the Lord is building a heavenly mansion and that He will come back only after this work of building is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some Christian teachers claim that the fact the Lord Jesus has not come back indicates that the building of the heavenly mansion is not yet finished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was told this by a Christian teacher when I was very young.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In their talk about the heavenly mansion, some have said, "How marvelous the heavenly mansion will be!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus has been there for more than nineteen hundred years, and still He hasn't finished the building of this mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord said that after He prepares a place for us, He will come back and receive us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know from the fact that He has not yet come back that He is still building the heavenly mansion."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While I was in England in 1958, I was enlightened to see from the Bible that John 14 has nothing to do with a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The use of the word mansion in the King James translation of John 14:2 is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This verse speaks of abodes, not of mansions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word used in Greek is a noun form of the verb abide.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here the Lord Jesus seems to be saying, "I am your abode, and you shall abide in Me. You are My abode, and I shall abide in you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am going to prepare an abode in God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father wants to receive you all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, because you are sinful and unrighteous and He is holy and righteous, you cannot enter into Him unless I die on the cross to take away your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My death will open up the way for you to come into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After I have prepared a place for you in the Father through My death and resurrection, I shall come again."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord that in this sense the Lord Jesus has already returned!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has already come back, and He has brought us into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now as members of the church we can declare that we are in God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church, including all of us, is where the Lord Jesus is, that is, in God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah, where the Lord Jesus Christ is, there we are also!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are in the same abode as the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I began to teach that John 14 speaks not of heavenly mansions but of abodes in God the Father, I was criticized and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some accused me of taking away their heavenly mansion and complained that at a funeral they could no longer tell people that there is a heavenly mansion for the dead believers.</S>
