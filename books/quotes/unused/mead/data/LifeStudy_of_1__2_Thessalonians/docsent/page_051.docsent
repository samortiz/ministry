   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE FOURTEEN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR FAITH, LOVE, AND HOPE Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 3:1-13 ESTABLISHING AND ENCOURAGING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter one of 1 Thessalonians we have the structure and origin of a holy life for the church life, and in chapter two we have the fostering of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now in chapter three we have the establishing of a holy life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that this holy life is constructed of faith, love, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Along with fostering, this life needs to be established.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Its establishment involves the three main aspects of its structure; that is, it involves faith, love, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter three Paul is establishing the believers' faith, love, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should keep in mind that 1 Thessalonians is a book written to new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, everything in this Epistle is presented in a brief way, not in a profound way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This principle applies in particular to chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In writing this chapter, Paul sought to avoid profound terms.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His word here can be compared to that of a father given to young children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But although Paul speaks in a brief way, he covers a number of crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 3:1 Paul says, "Wherefore, when we could bear it no longer, it seemed good for us to be left in Athens alone."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Athens was the chief city of the province of Achaia of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this city the Apostle Paul preached the gospel to philosophical Greeks Acts 17:15-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word "wherefore" at the beginning of this verse refers us to the previous chapter, especially to verses 17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These verses say, "But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a little while in presence, not in heart, were more abundantly eager with much desire to see your face.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wherefore we wanted to come to you, indeed, I Paul, both once and again, and Satan hindered us."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostles had been bereaved of the Thessalonian believers in presence and were intensely eager to see them again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was the reason Paul says in 3:1 that he could bear the situation no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word "wherefore" in verse 1 indicates that chapter three is a continuation of 2:17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul was willing to remain in Athens alone and, as he says in verse 2, to send Timothy to Thessalonica.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 2 continues, "And we sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow-worker in the gospel of Christ, to establish and encourage you for the sake of your faith."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead of fellow-worker, some manuscripts read "minister of God."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The minister of God is God's fellow-worker 1 Cor 3:9; 2 Cor 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What a privilege!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What a blessing!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Timothy was sent to the Thessalonians to encourage them for the sake of their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that what is covered in chapter three is related to establishing and encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In speaking of the Thessalonians' faith, Paul returns to the matter of the structure of a holy life for the church life covered in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His concern in chapter three is with the establishing of such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are established in our faith, we shall not be shaken by affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Concerning this, Paul says in verse 3, "That no one be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed for this."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are established in the faith, afflictions will do good to us Rom 8:28 according to God's purpose in His appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Otherwise, we may be shaken by the tempter 1 Thes 3:5 through the afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word rendered "appointed" also means destined, set, located.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has destined, appointed, us to pass through afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, afflictions are God's allotted portion to us, and He has set us, located us, in the situation of afflictions.</S>
