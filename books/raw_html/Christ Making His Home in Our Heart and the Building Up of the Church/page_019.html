	 <h2 class="head1">PRAYING AND READING THE BIBLE IN A PROPER WAY</h2>
<p>We must learn to pray and read the Bible in our spirit. This is not a ritual of kneeling down, closing our eyes, and saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I thank and praise You for giving me peace and keeping me from having a car accident. Hallelujah, Amen!&rdquo; This is not the kind of prayer we are referring to. Such a prayer is merely from the lips; it is not a prayer in the spirit. Regrettably, most Christians pray this kind of prayer. Sometimes we close our eyes and mumble a few words before a meal. We may say that we have prayed. However, it is hard to say from where we have prayed, or whether we prayed in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We know that the Holy Spirit is in us; He is living in our spirit. But perhaps some young people among us are not clear concerning their human spirit. Our spirit is the deepest part of our being. Suppose you have an argument with your sister at home; she says that you are wrong, and you say that she is wrong. However, as you continue to say that she is wrong and that you are right, in the deepest part of your being there is a sense that you are wrong. Outwardly you may be unyielding, but inwardly there is a different feeling. The feeling in the depth of your being is different from your reasonings and conduct. This feeling in the depth of your being, this other feeling, is the feeling in your spirit. The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, which is our deepest part.</p>
<p>Jude 20 says, &ldquo;Praying...in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Hence, every time we pray, we must turn from our outward being to our inward being. Our prayer must not be a ritual in which we kneel down to say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Thank and praise You! In Jesus&rsquo; name, Amen.&rdquo; We cannot pray like this. When we pray, we need to stop our person and turn to our spirit. Then we can pray according to the feeling in our spirit. This is to pray in the Holy Spirit. This kind of prayer in the Spirit will cause us to touch the Spirit.</p>
<p>We must always return to our spirit and pray in our spirit. We also must read the Word in our spirit. Every time we read the Bible, we should read it in our spirit and not merely in our mind. If we do not read the Bible in this way, the Bible will be like any other book, which can be understood by reading and reciting. A person who reads the book of Genesis in this way can understand that Abraham&rsquo;s son was Isaac, Isaac&rsquo;s son was Jacob, Jacob had twelve sons, and the youngest was Benjamin. He can also understand that Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt, and later God rescued them out of Egypt. This kind of reading is like reading history. It is useless, because then the Bible is neither the Lord&rsquo;s word nor the Spirit to us. The Bible can be the Lord&rsquo;s word and the Spirit when we pray in our spirit and touch the Spirit. Then we will be in the Spirit. If we open the Bible and read it while we are in the Spirit, every word in the Bible will be the Lord&rsquo;s word. When we read the Word in the spirit, the Word will be Spirit.</p>
<p>If we read the Word in this way, we will pray and give thanks when we pray and read the Bible. Because we are filled with the Holy Spirit and with the Word, we are also filled with thanksgiving and praise. This kind of praying and reading of the Bible touches the Spirit in our spirit. This is not the prayer in which we merely move our lips, nor is it reading the Bible merely with our mind. Praying merely with our lips is not effective, nor is reading the Bible merely with our mind effective. These are done outside of the Holy Spirit and cannot help us touch God nor help us &ldquo;eat&rdquo; the Lord and &ldquo;drink&rdquo; the Lord. If we would touch the Lord, eat the Lord, and drink the Lord, we must pray in the Spirit and read the Bible in the Spirit.</p>
<p>How can our praying and our reading of the Word always be in the Holy Spirit? Whenever we pray, we must be calm and turn to our spirit. Then from within our spirit and according to the feeling in our spirit, we can gradually begin to pray. This is how to pray in the Holy Spirit. The more we pray in this way, the more we will breathe in the Holy Spirit and have the Holy Spirit. This will make us persons in the Holy Spirit. The Spirit will bring the word into us, and we will be able to read the Bible in a proper way. Our reading of the Bible will be in the Holy Spirit, and the words in the Bible will touch us. Thus, the word will be Spirit to us and will give us life and cause us to live. Not only so, our prayer will be effective, because we will not be the source of the prayer. The Lord in us, the Holy Spirit in us, and the word in us will enable us to pray in the Lord&rsquo;s feeling and according to His desire. Moreover, whatever we ask, the Lord will do for us. This kind of reading and praying enable us to touch the Holy Spirit and be in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING, DRINKING, AND ENJOYING GOD<br />
DAILY IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The burden of this message is to point out a way for us to read the Bible and to pray every day. In other words, my burden is that we would eat God, drink God, and enjoy God, that is, that we would touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence and have His manifestation. For this we must learn to pray in the Holy Spirit and read the Bible in the Holy Spirit. If we are not willing to learn, this message will be empty and useless. However, if we are willing to learn, this message can give us a way that will enable us to touch the source of unlimited blessing. If the young people can be brought into this practice, they will be brought into immeasurable blessings. They will be brought deeper and deeper into God, and God will fill them with His riches. They will also have deeper and richer experiences of the Lord. Such a living far surpasses listening to messages, attending meetings, or participating in various kinds of Christian activities. We must all see that to pray in the spirit and to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word in the spirit are precious, practical, and intimate.</p>
<p>I hope that we can all learn to turn to our spirit and pray in the Holy Spirit. Then the Spirit will bring the word into us, and we will be able to read the Lord&rsquo;s word when we open our Bible. As we pray in the spirit and read the Word in the spirit, every word of the Bible will be living. We will have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, His manifestation, and the Lord will make an abode with us. We will also pray more, which will enable us to touch the Spirit more. The more we touch the Spirit, the more we will have the Lord&rsquo;s word, which brings us more of the Lord&rsquo;s presence and further enables Him to make His abode with us. Thus, we will be persons who touch the Lord, eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and enjoy the Lord. In this way, the elements of Christ will gradually increase within us, and the Lord will grow in us daily.</p>
