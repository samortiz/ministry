   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God has put both His Spirit and His word into our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His Spirit is for us to breathe, and His word is for our nourishment and also for our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today the Christian life is just to practice the breathing of the Spirit and the eating and speaking of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, we emphasize, encourage, promote, and advocate the matter of prophesying, that is, speaking for God, speaking God forth, and speaking God in His word into others for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both breathing and eating are for dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we breathe and eat, the more the elements of life are dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since we have God's Spirit and God's word, all day long we can be under God's dispensing if we breathe the Spirit and are nourished with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God dispenses Himself into our spiritual being through His Spirit, who is the very breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit is the breath of God for our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more we breathe the Spirit, the more we are under the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first two lines of a hymn by A.B. Simpson on the Spirit as the breath say, "O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me, / Teach me how to breathe Thee in" Hymns, #255 . The chorus says, "I am breathing out my sorrow, / Breathing out my sin; / I am breathing, breathing, breathing, / All Thy fulness in." Instead of being limited in our breathing, we need to exercise spiritual deep breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more deeply we breathe the Spirit, the healthier we will be in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word God has given to us for our nourishment is Christ as God's embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Triune God is embodied in Christ, Christ is embodied in the word, the word is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By such a cycle the Triune God dispenses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Day by day we should deal with the word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as we have a proper dealing with the word and the Spirit, we are one with the Triune God, one with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today we have Christ as the Redeemer to save us from our sins, iniquities, and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the positive side, we have Christ also as the word and as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the Spirit for our breathing and the word for our feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we breathe the Spirit and feed on the word, we are under God's dispensing.</S>
