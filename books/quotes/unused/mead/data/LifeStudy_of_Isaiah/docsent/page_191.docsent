   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPRINGS OF SALVATION, AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE FLOW OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we want to see the springs of salvation in Isaiah 12.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to know the difference between the words fountain and springs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Deuteronomy 8:7 speaks of the good land as "a land of waterbrooks, of springs and of fountains, flowing forth in valleys and in mountains."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fountain is the source, the spring is the issue of the source, and the waterbrook, or the river, is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The source of the Jordan River is in Mount Hermon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some of us visited there and saw the spring of water gushing out from the fountain to become a river.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In its verbal form spring means to gush out or gush up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Exodus 15 speaks of the children of Israel arriving at Elim on their journey in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees v. 27 ASV . The source of these springs may have been one fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Isaiah 12 does not use the word spring in the singular but the word springs in plural.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 3 says, "Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The term the springs of salvation implies that salvation is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The source of the springs of salvation is a fountain, and that fountain is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The source, the fountain, and salvation are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Who is the source, the fountain, the salvation, in Isaiah 12?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 2 says, "God is now my salvation; / I will trust and not dread; / For Jah Jehovah is my strength and song, / And He has become my salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jah is a short form of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is similar to a person's full name also having a short form, such as Benjamin and Ben.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main word stressed in Isaiah 12 is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is our salvation, and Jah Jehovah is our strength and song.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Strength and song both indicate experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God's salvation is experienced by us, this salvation becomes our strength, and eventually it will be our song, our praising.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The strength and the song are experiences of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In our experiences our God is Jah and Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament, our God is called Jesus and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are calling upon Him, we can say in a very intimate way, "My Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes we can express this in a more dear way by saying, "My dear Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jah Jehovah in the New Testament is our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
