<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">IN ADAM AND IN CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: October 18, 1936, evening<br />Place: Kulangsu<br />Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:17</h1><h2 class="head1">OUR INHERITANCE IN ADAM</h2><h2 class="head2">The Power to Sin</h2><p>God's way of redemption is wonderful. Man thinks that he has to do something before he can be saved, but God does not want us to do anything in order to be redeemed. God does not do anything in man; He does everything in Christ. Satan's work was concentrated in Adam, whereas God's work is consummated in Christ. We have to understand one thing before we can know God's salvation. Do you know how man sins? Does he have to make up his mind to sin? Friends, what do you have to do to lose your temper? Do you have to think about it for a night, saying, "I will lose my temper tomorrow. Tonight I do not have the strength to lose it; I am too weak. I wish I could lose my temper tomorrow. I will make up my mind to lose my temper tomorrow"? Is there such a thing? No! One does not need to make up his mind to lose his temper. There is no need to exert any effort for he can lose his temper effortlessly. There is no effort involved in committing sins; it only takes effort to try to not sin.</p><p>We can illustrate this by considering light and darkness. The electrical power company helps us to remove darkness by supplying us with light. But it is interesting that there is no darkness company. We need to pay for light, but there is no need to pay for darkness; it comes by itself. If you need some darkness in your home, do you have to buy it from a darkness company? No, darkness comes spontaneously; there is no need to exert any effort. However, if you want the light, you will need to exert some effort; you will need to pay a price. In the same way, there is no need to exert any effort to sin. But it takes much effort to try to not sin.</p><h2 class="head2">The Nature of Sin</h2><p>Man does not need to pray, make up his mind, or exert any effort to sin. He sins easily. There is no need to prepare for it; it comes spontaneously. Why does a man not need to try to sin? Why is it so easy for man to sin? It is because to sin is natural. Doing good is not easy; it is not natural. Why is it so unnatural for man to do good? The Bible clearly tells us that man has the Adamic nature in him, and the Adamic nature is a sinful nature. Romans 5:12 says, "Through one man sin entered into the world." Sin came in through Adam. Those who are in Adam have inherited his Adamic sinful nature. This is why it is so natural for us to sin.</p><p>Satan wants to see the whole world sin. But if he induced every individual to sin one by one, it would take too much time. What did he do? He put the poison in the "fountainhead." Consequently, everyone who drinks the water will die. He put the poison in Adam. After Adam sinned, everyone who belongs to Adam spontaneously sins. It does not take any effort for me to sin today; I do not have to think about it or make up my mind to do it. As long as I am related to Adam and belong to him, I spontaneously sin. Hence, I have inherited the Adamic nature and power of sin.</p><h2 class="head2">Inheriting Everything that Adam Had</h2><p>For this reason, we should not be surprised by what we do. Since the world has such a relationship with Adam, it is natural for the whole world to sin. It is most natural for us to sin. If we want to lose our temper, we can do it in two seconds; there is no need to consciously try. We have inherited the power, mind, and mentality to sin. Because we are in Adam, we inherited everything in Adam. All of Adam becomes all of us. We have nothing; Adam has everything. We are born of him and belong to him. It is as if Adam wrote a will for us and gave us all his inheritance. We do not have to learn to commit Adam's sins; we commit the same sins and have inherited the same sins.</p><p>The Bible says that everything we have is inherited from Adam. What does it mean to inherit something? How does an inheritance pass from one person to another? Suppose you are a father and have earned and saved a great deal of money. You have a son that you love very much, and you bequeath all your money to him. The money has not been earned by your son; it was earned by you through hard work. Now you bequeath all of this money to your son. This is an inheritance, and this is what Adam did. He bequeathed everything to us. We can say that Adam bequeathed much "grace" upon us; there is no need for us to do anything to receive it. Christ has bestowed grace upon us, and it is free. Adam has bestowed sin upon us as a kind of "grace"; it is also free. Everyone who is born of Adam has received from him the free "grace" to sin. Hence, we are all sinners today. No one needs to make up his mind to sin, yet everyone sins.</p><p>We were born sinners, and we sin spontaneously and effortlessly in this world. Sinning is natural as well as habitual for us. This is our inheritance in Adam. He made us a sinner free of charge. When we are in him, he freely bequeaths to us his power and nature to sin.</p>
