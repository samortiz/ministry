   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The faithfulness of God is related to His word; the righteousness of God is related to His actions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both the word of God and the actions of God are related to man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we want to know God, we must know His word and His actions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to know His word and His actions, we must know His faithfulness and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many know only that God is loving and gracious.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In matters related to love and grace, God is under no obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His love and His grace come to us based only on His heart and His favor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consequently, while He loves and gives grace willingly, He is under no obligation to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though His love and grace will not cease, God could, legally speaking, stop loving and gracing us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Legally speaking, He is not required to love and grace us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If He did not love and grace us, He would not be wrong as a matter of law.</S>
