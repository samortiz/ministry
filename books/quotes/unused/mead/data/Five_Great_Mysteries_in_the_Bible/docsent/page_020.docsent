   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This age is evil and is dark, yet You always shine upon us with Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have separated us and placed us in this glorious position today to be Your golden lampstands shining forth in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have even made us Your dear bride to satisfy Your desire; we are flesh of Your flesh and bone of Your bones.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH BEING THE ULTIMATE MYSTERY IN THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this chapter we want to see the last mystery, which is the mystery of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This mystery is in the universe and also in the Bible, especially the last book of the Bible Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the ultimate mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although this book has only five chapters, it encompasses the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are fellowshipping from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22: from God, heaven and earth, and man to Jesus Christ, to the church the golden lampstand, and finally to the holy city, New Jerusalem the bride of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we take a look at the Bible with a bird's-eye view, we will discover that the Bible opens by saying, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genesis 1 begins by speaking of God, of heaven and earth, and then about the creation of man, particularly about the creation of a spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Chinese consider heaven, earth, and man as the three powers; the Bible also ranks man's spirit with heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the Old Testament begins from God, passes through heaven and earth, and reaches man, even the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament, as a continuation of the Old Testament, begins with the four Gospels which are concerning the incarnated Jesus the Nazarene, whose human living on earth was a solid expression of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the four Gospels, there are the Acts and the Epistles concerning Christ being enlarged to become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 1:22-23 tells us that Christ is the Head of the church, and the church is the Body of Christ, the expression of Christ's fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we come to Revelation, which opens by telling us that the seven golden lampstands are seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that each local church equals one lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Finally, at the end of Revelation, when the city of New Jerusalem appears, it is a huge golden lampstand, which is a great city on a great mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This great city is the beloved bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Revelation 21:2 says, "And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Christ returns, He will marry the church as His bride Rev 19:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate manifestation of this bride, the final fulfillment of that which is typified by Eve in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible covers six important items.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first item is God; the second item includes the heavens and the earth; the third item is man; the fourth item is Jesus Christ; the fifth item is the church, the golden lampstand; and the sixth item is the bride the city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, created man at the end of the process of His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, what is important to God is neither the heavens nor the earth but man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet for man to exist, there surely is the need for the earth; moreover, for the earth to supply life, there surely is the need for the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man is for God as His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The God who created all things came into the midst of men through His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This One who came was Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This Jesus Christ needed to be enlarged, and His enlargement is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church shining brightly on the earth today is the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This golden lampstand has God as its substance, Christ as its form, and the Holy Spirit shining for its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In eternity, the ultimate manifestation of this church is the New Jerusalem, the beloved bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Revelation 22:17 says, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Spirit and the bride, having become one, speak together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God and man will become an eternal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate expression of God's entering into man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the story of the universe, the ultimate manifestation of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God obtains an eternal and full expression in the man whom He created.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the ultimate mystery in the universe the mystery of the church.</S>
