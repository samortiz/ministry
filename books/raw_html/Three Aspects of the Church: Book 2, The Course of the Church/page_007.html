	 <h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF THE SPREADING<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s record in the Bible is marvelous. From Acts we see the process of the spreading of the church, and by this we know the church&rsquo;s course on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Samaria</h2>
<p>Acts 8 shows that the first step in the disciples&rsquo; scattering&mdash;that is, the first place to which they were scattered&mdash;was not to Bethlehem but to Samaria (vv. 1-25). Samaria lies between Judea and the Gentile lands, and the Samaritans were a racial mixture of Jews and Gentiles. The Samaritans considered themselves to be Jews, but the Jews repeatedly rejected them and did not acknowledge them as Jews. After the Samaritans were saved, the saints in Jerusalem were very surprised and sent the apostles to visit them. When the apostles came and prayed for the Samaritans, the Holy Spirit immediately descended; thus, God Himself confirmed this spread (vv. 15-17). It was as if the Holy Spirit was saying to Peter, &ldquo;This is of Me; I did it. You should not stay only in Jerusalem; you must spread.&rdquo; God confirmed that the church needed to spread; therefore, the first step in the church&rsquo;s spread was to Samaria, to a people who were partly Jew and partly Gentile.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ethiopia</h2>
<p>From Acts 8 the second step of the church&rsquo;s spread was through Philip&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel to an Ethiopian eunuch; thus, the gospel spread to Africa (vv. 26-39). The Jews never thought that God would call the Gentiles to hear the gospel, receive salvation, and become the church. The Jewish mind was too narrow; they would never have thought of such a thing. But one day an angel of the Lord came and spoke to Philip, saying, &ldquo;Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza&rdquo; (v. 26). That was a desert route; Philip obeyed and went. On the way he saw the chariot of an Ethiopian eunuch, and the Holy Spirit said to Philip, &ldquo;Approach and join this chariot&rdquo; (v. 29). Philip went forward and came up to the Ethiopian eunuch. Philip did these things not by himself but under the leading of the Holy Spirit. He not only preached the gospel to the eunuch and led him to believe in the Lord and be saved, but he also baptized him. When Philip and the eunuch came up from the water, the Holy Spirit caught Philip away. The fact that the Holy Spirit caught Philip away confirmed that Philip&rsquo;s actions were not only of the Holy Spirit but also that they were complete and perfect.</p>
<p>Church history tells us that from that time onward, the gospel spread to Ethiopia in Africa, which is the Cush spoken of in the book of Isaiah (18:1). Over the past two thousand years there have always been Christians there, and their beginning was in Acts 8. Thus, the Lord did not wait until the time at the house of Cornelius to spread the gospel to the Gentiles. In Acts 8 the gospel spread to Africa; however, it was not a white Gentile who received the gospel but a black one, a descendant of Ham (Gen. 10:6). The cursed race received the gospel.</p>
<p>According to the Old Testament, it was not pleasing to God for His children to have a relationship with the Egyptians, but God&rsquo;s deeds are truly marvelous; His first step was to spread the gospel to the racially mixed Samaritans and then to preach to the cursed black people. These peoples were despised by the Jews, but the Holy Spirit caused some from both groups to be saved and to become the church. We must never despise a person&rsquo;s race. It does not matter whether a race has a low culture, is morally corrupt, or is poor in character; we cannot despise them. We must preach the gospel to all peoples because the church is universal and needs to spread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Paul</h2>
<p>Acts 9 shows God&rsquo;s choosing of Paul, who was called Saul at that time. He did not choose someone who was sympathetic to Christians and a believer in Christ; on the contrary, He chose a person who persecuted Christians and opposed the Lord. The person God saved and chose to be an apostle was not a pious person who obeyed God but a person who opposed God, persecuted the church, and inflicted harm on Christians.</p>
<p>The path of the church&rsquo;s spreading in Acts is marvelous. Saul had asked for letters from the high priest in Jerusalem and was on the road going down to Damascus to harm the Christians when the Lord met him and saved him (vv. 1-9). After this, the Lord spoke to Ananias and sent him to visit Saul. The response Ananias gave to the Lord was according to his concept. To him, Saul was one who had persecuted and harmed those who believed in the Lord&rsquo;s name (vv. 13-14); he was one who approved of the killing of Stephen (8:1a) and persecuted the church. Ananias could not understand why the gospel should be preached to Saul. This is the human concept; therefore, God did something to shatter this concept. Our narrow, erroneous human concept needs to be broken and shattered through the spreading of the church.</p>
<p>We must believe that a person can be persecuting the church one hour and preaching the gospel the next hour. God is able to do this because He wants to spread. During the age of the apostles, there are many examples which show that God can spread the church to many people whom we think cannot possibly become the church. This is the case of the Samaritans, the Ethiopian eunuch, and Saul of Tarsus. After Ananias received the revelation and went to visit Saul, the Holy Spirit descended to confirm this matter. Later, Paul returned to Jerusalem, and all the disciples in Jerusalem and elsewhere who heard of his salvation were surprised because they never thought that such a thing could happen. In their minds Saul could never be saved. Despite the fact that they were afraid of Paul, they ultimately received him (9:26-28). Their reluctance shows that it is truly difficult for people to quickly receive someone like Saul; human concepts are actually a great hindrance to the church.</p>
