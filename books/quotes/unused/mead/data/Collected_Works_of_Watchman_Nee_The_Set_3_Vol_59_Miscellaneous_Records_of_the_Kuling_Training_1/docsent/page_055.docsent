   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>OF THE SONS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yesterday we spoke of God's desire to manifest His authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who are in the church should submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible has a few words to say concerning the Christian pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 10:16 says that a man is saved through obeying the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that the gospel is a command.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 10:16, 1 Peter 4:17, and 2 Thessalonians 1:8 all speak of obeying the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 2:8 and 1 Peter 1:22 speak of obeying the truth which is God's word .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's gospel is a command, and God's truth is also a command.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason the Bible says that we should obey both the gospel and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Obeying carries a more positive sense than submitting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Peter 3:1 speaks of those who disobey the word.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Acts 5:32 says that God has given the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, obedience is a characteristic of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The name Christian implies those who obey.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is better to call a believer an "obeyer."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A Christian is an "obeyer" because this is the virtue, characteristic, and nature of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God can only get what He wants from the church because outside the realm of the church everything is in rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not express God's authority in the church, we have given up His very own nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE CHURCH CANNOT FAIL</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church as God's chosen vessel is the last "obeyer."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason we should not be defeated in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot be allowed or permitted to be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God chose the angels, but they failed.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's final work, however, is with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the church fails, God cannot have any more work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have no choice but to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot rebel, because God has no further work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God sent Moses, David, and the prophets to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Finally Christ came.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may be obedient or rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God, however, must gain His vessel the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must have the realization that the church has only one way to go to overcome; it cannot fail.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord will perfect the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It cannot fail God again.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some time ago someone asked, "What would happen if we failed again?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not ask such a question.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not ask, "What would happen if the Lord failed?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord cannot fail; He must overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Similarly, we should not ask, "What would happen if we failed?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such a thought should never enter the mind of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should be nothing but absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just as it was unthinkable for the Lord to sin, it should be unthinkable for the church to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Josephus was a Jewish historian.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He did not believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to his history, demon possession was running rampant when Christ was walking on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It seems as if the entire army of Hades rose up against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the end, however, the Lord overcame them all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, the church must take the way of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The destiny of the church is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether or not we want to submit, we have to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God is God, and He never changes.</S>

   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Can you frustrate God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Sometimes I laugh to myself, saying, "How can a tiny, rebellious, and defiant worldling withstand God's way?"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord only needs to move His little finger slightly and everything will be cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Only an omnipotent one can say that he does not need to submit to anyone.</S>
