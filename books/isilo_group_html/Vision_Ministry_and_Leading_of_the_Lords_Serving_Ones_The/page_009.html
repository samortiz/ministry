PRODUCING AN INDIVIDUALISTIC MOVE</h2>
<p>We need to remember this principle, especially when we are tempted to say, &ldquo;I have a clear leading to work in a certain place.&rdquo; There is a danger in being so certain; it is the danger of acting individualistically. We must ask ourselves whether we have received our leading individualistically or with those whom we serve with in the church. When the five prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were praying together and fasting, the Holy Spirit charged them, saying, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them&rdquo; (v. 2). This was a corporate leading. We need to ask ourselves whether or not we have been led in this way. There is a great difference between an individual leading and a leading that comes from the Lord through those with whom we are serving. In the matter of serving the Lord, an individual leading will cause us to act individualistically and do an individualistic work. In contrast, a corporate leading before the Lord will enable us to move in Christ with the church. The two leadings are quite different.</p>
<p>Barnabas and Saul received the Lord&rsquo;s leading without any individual component. Five prophets and teachers were praying when the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul.&rdquo; These five were part of both the larger circle of the believers in the church in Antioch and the smaller circle of the Lord&rsquo;s work in the church. In both circles the five served together corporately.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING ONE AND NOT INDIVIDUALISTIC</h2>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may see this basic principle. Because Christianity has become degraded, there are many individual leadings, many individual works, and many individual actions. Christians who do not meet with us often misunderstand us and say that we are uncooperative, but the Lord knows that we desire to be one with other believers. When we consider various Christians, the most we can say is that they have a desire to be united. Our desire, however, is for more than just unity; we want oneness. The church is one; it is not united. There is a great difference.</p>
<p>When I was twenty-two years old, a pastor who was leading me talked about the federation of churches in Christianity. Although I was very young at the time, I received some light. I listened respectfully because I was the one being led. He said, &ldquo;We in Christianity have formed a federation; those who could not get along before are now united.&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;If the denominations need to be united, does this not prove that they are divided?&rdquo; His countenance changed upon hearing this. Indeed, division cannot be eliminated by unity but by being one.</p>
<p>The United Nations is an example of unity. Delegates from various countries meet and discuss matters; some countries are totalitarian, and others are democratic. The end result of this union is that Britain is still Britain, France is still France, and America is still America. In Christianity unity means that the Methodist denomination, the Presbyterian denomination, the Lutheran denomination, and other denominations do not criticize each other, but each denomination still keeps their own things. There are, however, no independent entities in the Lord&rsquo;s service; instead, everyone should be the same as their fellow serving ones in the Spirit. The church is one. The church is not an issue of unity but of oneness. If we need to be united, it proves that we have already formed independent entities.</p>
<p>We all know that the church is the Body of Christ and that the Body is one. If our physical body is not one, it means that some member has been &ldquo;dislocated.&rdquo; Likewise, the move, work, and service of the church must be one; anything less than this speaks of &ldquo;dislocation.&rdquo; Setting up a special group of our own is a matter to be accursed. We need to do only one thing&mdash;to set aside everything that is not of the Lord and not in accordance with the Bible. Even if others approve of such things, we should never approve. We want the way of the church, not our way; we want the ground of the church, not our ground. Anyone can stand on this ground if he so desires; the ground of the church is not something that we desire to monopolize.</p>
<p>In our service today, who follows whom? Our service is not a matter of you following me or of me following you; it is a matter of both of us desiring Christ with a pure heart and, consequently, of taking the way of loving the Lord together. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we can both be submissive within, accept help from others, and render help to others. This is our blessing; we are learning to be led together.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters are timid toward me and other responsible brothers, but we do not rule over the saints. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and leading, we decide on certain matters and occasionally rebuke some misconduct. Each of us needs to learn to live before the Lord and not be afraid of the responsible brothers; we need to fear the Lord. Anything that is acceptable or fitting to the brothers and sisters can be done. There is no human organization or human authority among us; human authority should be accursed.</p>
<p>Some say that we have a very tight organization, but I do not see such an &ldquo;organization.&rdquo; Instead, a brother among us loves the Lord and follows Him by His mercy, while yet other brothers and sisters love the Lord and follow Him by His mercy. When everyone takes this way, there is a spontaneous oneness, and there is no need for any organization.</p>
<p>The leading for serving the Lord comes from living in the Lord and following the Spirit. However, when we take an individualistic way according to our own greed, lust, and purpose, there is an individualistic move that is outside this oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE LEADING TOGETHER<br />
WITH FELLOW SERVING ONES</h2>
<p>Out of respect, brothers and sisters often ask me about the direction that they should take, but I only tell them to speak with the responsible brothers in their local church. We need to learn to live in the church. It is not possible for one person to truly know all things; this is a misconception. The true leading of the Lord is received together with our fellow serving ones in the church. Anything that is not received in this way is not accurate. Service is not an individual matter; it is carried out by brothers and sisters in the church. It may be hard for a brother to know how he should be led, but those who are serving together with him in the church will know. Next to the Lord, our fellow serving ones are the ones who are most clear about the direction that we should take in the service of the Lord. If they do not know about our situation, there must be a problem. However, if everyone is in one accord and serving the Lord in oneness, the brothers and sisters coordinating together will surely be clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s will and leading for their fellow serving ones. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s leading is received by those who are serving together in the Body, the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM THE SELF<br />
IN ORDER TO BE LED</h2>
<p><em>Question: A brother went to a certain place to work according to his personal leading, but only later was this confirmed by the church. Was his leading accurate?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This clearly shows that in the beginning there was some lack in his fellowship with the church because he only heeded his personal leading. However, once he heeded the church&rsquo;s fellowship, the leading became a matter in the church.</p>
<p><em>Question: What is a normal experience of leading?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The basic requirement for the normal experience of leading is to live in the fellowship of the church. If we do not live in the fellowship of the church, it will be difficult for us to receive the leading in the fellowship of the church. It may take some brothers and sisters five years to understand this requirement. This requires that we be delivered from our own views, our own choices, and our own preferences. It requires that we be delivered from individualism and live in the fellowship of the church.</p>
<p>At the end of a discussion related to service, we often hear brothers and sisters say, &ldquo;I will wait and see how the Lord leads.&rdquo; This speaks of something positive but also of something negative. On the one hand, it shows that such persons fear the Lord very much and are not loose. On the other hand, it shows that there is a desire in them that must be weighed against the fellowship of their fellow serving ones. Often such ones return and say, &ldquo;I do not think that it is the Lord&rsquo;s will for me to do this.&rdquo; Actually, the one who is unwilling is not the Lord but the brothers and sisters. There is hardly one saint out of ten who is truly being led by the Lord in this way, because the prerequisite to being led is to be willing to deal with oneself. Few fulfill this prerequisite.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Ministry, and Leading of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
