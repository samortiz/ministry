   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God is fair, rich, bountiful, loving, kind, and gracious.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to serve Him, we must know Him in all these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because He is fair, bountiful, and gracious, He has no problems with His people when they contend for food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since He is not angry with His people when they contend for their necessities, those who serve Him should likewise not be angry with them in such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Serving God involves caring for God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, it is not sufficient for us simply to be right with God; we must also be right in our attitude toward God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our attitude toward God's people should be according to God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Numbers 20 Moses should have had such an attitude toward the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He should have realized that the people were in need of water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He should have also considered that since water is a necessity, God in His fairness would not be angry with His people but would instead supply them with water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were not contending for their lust they were contending for their need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this matter Moses should have had regard for God's nature and should not have cared for his own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because Moses cared for his feeling and not for God's nature, he was offended and became angry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God, however, did not have a problem with His people on this occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In contrast to Moses, who was angry, God was fair, bountiful, and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this message I am especially concerned about the young saints, who have a long spiritual journey ahead of them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to complete this journey in a proper way, we need to know God in His nature, especially in relation to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether or not our service to the Lord is lasting will depend on our attitude toward His people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our attitude toward the people of God must be according to God's holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to be right in our attitude, we must know God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to realize that in His nature God is fair, bountiful, rich in supply, loving, gracious, and merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we see something in God's people which, to our view, is not right, we need to consider the situation according to God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do this, we will be right in relation to God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, we will be wrong and fail to sanctify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To sanctify God means to respect and have regard for His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is altogether different from everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is different not only from the false gods but also from every human being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since God is different from everyone, we must not make Him common.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must not lower Him to our level.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is special and particular, and we must sanctify Him, considering Him according to what He is in His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, our attitude toward God's people should not be according to our feeling and preferences but according to God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever we are about to deal with His people, we must be mindful of God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we will be preserved from the serious mistake of failing to sanctify Him in what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has His economy, and His economy includes all His actions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The actions of God's economy are mainly related to Christ and to His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, if we would act according to God's economy, we must have much consideration concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes the situation in the church is not pleasant because among the saints there is much contending.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the reason for this contending?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The reason may be that the people of God are short of the living water, short of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The way to deal with this shortage is to speak to Christ, for He is the rock that continually follows the church.</S>
