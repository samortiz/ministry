   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE EXERCISING THE HEART TO ENJOY THE LORD Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:22; Rom 8:23 CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT FOR OUR ENJOYMENT IN OUR HEART</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to continue to see how Christ as the Spirit can be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In particular, we want to see how the exercise of our heart is crucial for our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have pointed out that the Spirit of God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two verses prove that the Holy Spirit is working in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also need to see the move of the Spirit in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Galatians 4:6 says, "And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 5:5 says that "the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These verses tell us that the Spirit is moving in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 3:17 says that Christ is making His home in our hearts, and 2 Corinthians 4:6 says that God is the One who shines in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second Corinthians 1:22 says that God has "sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit is the "pledge of our inheritance," and 2 Corinthians 5:5 says that God "has given to us the Spirit as a pledge."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The pledge is the down payment, guarantee, earnest, or foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first part of the payment is the foretaste of all the payment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In ancient times the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchasing of land.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seller gave the purchaser some soil from the land as a sample.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, is also a sample.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we will inherit of God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 8:23 says, "And not only so, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The thought in this verse is also that the Holy Spirit has been given to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today the Spirit is the firstfruits of the coming harvest, the foretaste of our full enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have not enjoyed the main part yet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The main part is the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we just have the foretaste and enjoy the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 6:4 says that we are those who have "been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Again we see that Christ as the Spirit is given to us for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the Spirit is for our enjoyment, He is involved with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Romans 5:5 shows that our enjoyment of the Spirit is a matter of love in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit's working is in our spirit, but the Spirit for our enjoyment is in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our spirit is not an enjoying organ but a working organ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The enjoying organ is the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, the spirit is the working organ to receive and contact God for our heart to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We contact God with our spirit, but we love and enjoy Him with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is a big difference between the spirit and the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ezekiel 36:26 says that we have been given a new spirit and a new heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can say that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit but we cannot say that he who is joined to the Lord is one heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our spirit is a receiving and contacting organ, and our heart is a loving and enjoying organ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We receive and substantiate psychological and physical things such as music, scenery, thoughts, and ideas through the organs of the soul and the sensory organs of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But we receive the spiritual things of God by our spirit as an organ and enjoy all these spiritual things by the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have received Christ as the living Spirit into our spirit for us to enjoy in our heart.</S>
