   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to another point: What are the functions of this Spirit of life in His indwelling?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indwelling Spirit is the Spirit of life, and He indwells us to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His indwelling is not His doing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But His indwelling is for Him to do things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, He gives life to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, He puts to death the deeds of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Third, He leads us as the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the first occasion God gives life through Him Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second time He is an instrument to us, because we put to death the practices of the body by Him Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 23 gives us another item of His doings: And not only so, but we ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the firstfruit of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is the enjoyment of the Spirit in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The firstfruit of the Spirit is an expression that the very indwelling Spirit who does three things who gives life, who puts to death, and who leads satisfies us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To understand this word firstfruit we need to study the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Biblical usage, firstfruit means to satisfy someone with the proper produce.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Old Testament all the firstfruits from the land had to go to God, not to work anything for God, but just to satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, in the last book of the Bible, those 144,000 overcomers are the firstfruit unto God to satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have to realize the top firstborn Son is Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is not only the firstborn Son to His flesh mother, but He is also the firstborn Son in resurrection to God to satisfy God Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The firstfruit of the Spirit signifies the Spirit s satisfaction or the Spirit satisfying us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So the Spirit is the Spirit of life which is involved with God, with our spirit, with our soul, and with our body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And this Spirit indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His indwelling, He does three things plus one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He gives life, He puts to death, He leads, that He may satisfy you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What then is the result or the issue of the fourfold doings of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a kind of groaning, with a kind of eager expectation that our body could be redeemed and have the full sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You need to fellowship about all these points.</S>
