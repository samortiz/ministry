   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The self-life is just the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The self is our personality and everything contained in our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Out of the self grow our personal opinion, taste, thought, longing, bias, love, and hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The self-life is the power by which one lives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must keep in mind that the self is just ourself plus our likes and dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Its life is the natural power by which we perform good and do work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The self is a life, because it lives in the believers whose self has not been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even in the believers who have died to their self, it often attempts to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The self-life is a life that centers on one's own self.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the believers receive the dealing of the cross with respect to sin, the body of sin will be paralyzed and will not be able to act anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, because no attention has yet been paid to the self-life, the latter still lives.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At this stage, the self-life is like the life of Adam before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was not spiritual because it was not transformed by the fruit of the tree of life, and it was not fleshly because it had not sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It belonged to itself, and as such it could sin if it wanted to sin, and it could be spiritual if it wanted to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The believer's life at this time is very similar to this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not spiritual because his spirit is still not free, and it has not reached a walk according to God's higher life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not fleshly because the person has received the accomplishment of the cross and has reckoned himself dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is of the self, soulish, natural, and untransformed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If he is not careful, he will fall and will be contaminated by the sin of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If he goes forward and claims the accomplishment of the cross, he will become completely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, if believers stay in the realm of the self, they will mostly fall and will many times become fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this time believers are in a most vulnerable condition in their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, they must protect themselves from falling; on the other hand, they must resolve to have some practical righteous works.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The danger then is to do good by self effort.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It may not necessarily be obvious; sometimes it can be very obscure and hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes it takes God a long time to show the believers that they are still in the self and are still trying to carry out God's will by their self effort.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The self includes many things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our will, emotions, love, and intelligence are within its domain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The self is our ego.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The life of the self is the power by which we live.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The self is also the soul; it is an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life of the self is the life of the soul; it is the power that motivates this organ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a man is in the self, the life of the self will impart power, that is, the self's own power, into the various parts of the man the will, the emotions, the love, the intelligence, etc., and will cause the man to do good and to work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Its will is strong enough to resist the outward temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Its emotions make one happy and cause one to think that God is very close to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Its love to the Lord is deep and sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Its intelligence causes him to come up with many wonderful Bible teachings and many methods for doing God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But, after all, these are done by the self, not by the spiritual life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During this time, God often gives special grace to the believers so that they receive many wonderful gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By realizing that all these gifts are from God, it is hoped that man will turn completely away from himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, in experience what a believer does is completely opposite to what God intends.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only does he not turn completely to God, he takes advantage of these gifts for his own use.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, these gifts become a help for prolonging the life of his self.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, God has to work many days and years before such a person will give up himself and turn to Him completely.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After a believer is brought by God to a deep realization of the evil of the self, he will be willing to put his self to death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But what is the way for the self to die?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no other way but by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to read two passages of Scripture to understand the relationship between the cross and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"I am crucified with Christ" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me" Luke 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What Galatians 2:20 speaks of is something accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we realize that our self needs to be put to death, we should then by faith acknowledge in a definite way that "I am crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word in the original text is ego, the "I," the self.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Besides the cross, there is indeed no other way to put the self to death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should also pay attention to the words "with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The crucifixion of the self is not an independent act of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Believers are not to crucify the self on the cross by themselves in their own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The crucifixion of the self is to be joined to Christ and in conjunction with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not to say that we help Christ to put the self on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, it means that Christ has already accomplished this fact, and we now merely acknowledge and believe its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here the main focus is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is why it says, "I am crucified with Christ," not "Christ is crucified with me."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is not that we want to put the self to death, and Christ comes merely to accompany us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rather, it was Christ who in His death brought all our "ego," our self, to the cross and nailed it there.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, we are not crucifying the self again but are merely acknowledging the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The word "am" shows us that it is a fact and not a wish.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A life that dies to the self is possible, real, and attainable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The apostles in the ancient time obtained this kind of life already; their self passed the test.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, it is possible for us to obtain this life also.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, we should remember that this is "crucified with" and not "crucified alone."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Apart from the Lord we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To crucify the self with the strength of the self is an impossible task and can never be done.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we are not united with the Lord in His death, our self will never die.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ alone brought all the old creation, every part of it, to the cross in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we try to find another way besides the Lord's way and try to accomplish anything besides the Lord's accomplishment, we are not only foolish but also wasting our time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, we are to do nothing but come to the Lord with full assurance of faith and acknowledge the Lord's accomplishment as ours; following this we should pray for the Holy Spirit to apply in us the work of the Lord's cross and express this very work through us.</S>
