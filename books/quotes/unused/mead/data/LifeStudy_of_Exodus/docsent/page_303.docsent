   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. A Frame Round About</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 25:25 says, And you shall make for it a border of a handbreadth round about; and you shall make a rim of gold to its border round about.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to our present understanding, the Hebrew word here does denote a border.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, it does not denote a border in an ordinary sense.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to verses 26 and 27, four rings of gold were to be put upon the four corners which were on its four feet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, the rings were to be close to the border as receptacles for the poles to carry the table.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Hebrew, the word rendered close means side by side.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, for the rings to be close to the border means that they were next to the border.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that, since the rings were on the four corners which were on the four feet of the table, the border must have been close to the bottom of the table.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some translations use the word frame instead of border.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For Connecting and Strengthening the Legs</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we consider the table and its frame, or its border, we see that the purpose of the frame was to connect the legs and strengthen them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way the frame helped to stabilize the table.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of a Handbreadth</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The frame, or border, was a handbreadth round about.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A handbreadth here signifies full of strength to connect and strengthen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Notice that verse 25 does not say that the frame was a handbreadth in height.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This may indicate that the frame was a square handbreadth, a handbreadth in both width and height.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a frame certainly would have been a strong support to the table.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With a Rim of Gold</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 25 says that a rim of gold was made to its border round about.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as there was a rim, or crown, upon the top of the table v. 24 , so there was a rim of gold upon the frame.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we have pointed out, this rim is for keeping and holding.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not adequate simply to use our mind to try to understand the significance of the frame round about the legs of the table.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to consider this in the light of Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We know from our experience with the Lord that when we obtain Christ as our nourishment, Christ becomes to us a table with power to connect and strengthen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that the enjoyment of Christ as a feast strengthens us, connects us, upholds us, and keeps us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every aspect of the frame is related to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The size, shape, and material are all significant when considered in the light of spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I. Four Rings of Gold</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verses 26 and 27 say, And you shall make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners which are on its four feet.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The rings shall be close to the border as receptacles for the poles to carry the table.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Signifying the Spirit of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>as the Linking Factor and Power</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here it is sufficient simply to review what we have said about the four rings of gold that were cast for the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These rings do not signify the divinity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, they signify the Spirit of Christ as the linking factor and the linking power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In typology, a gold ring signifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Rebekah became engaged to Isaac, she received rings of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These rings signify the Spirit mentioned in Ephesians 1:13.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, when the prodigal son came home, the father gave him not only a robe signifying Christ as righteousness to cover him, but also a ring of gold, which signifies the initial gift, the sealing Spirit Luke 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit signified by a golden ring is a uniting bond.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ephesians 4:3 speaks of keeping the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This oneness of the Spirit is the ring, the bond with its binding power.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If Christ were only the Lord objectively in heaven and not also the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us subjectively, there would be no way for us as believers to be united, for we would not have the golden rings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to have oneness and to keep the oneness, we must have in our experience the rings of gold, the Spirit as the linking factor and the linking power.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Put upon the Four Feet of the Table for Moving</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The four rings of gold were put upon the four feet of the table so that there could be a way for the table to be moved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Without the rings, the table could not be carried.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This table, signifying Christ as our feast, is not stationary; it is a table which moves and follows us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to 1 Corinthians 10:4, the children of Israel drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Just as Christ as a spiritual rock followed the children of Israel, so Christ as the table for our feast follows us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The ark of the testimony could be moved, and the table of the bread of the Presence could be moved also.</S>
