<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE WORKING ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE<br />THAT HE HAS RECEIVED FROM GOD</h2><p>Brother Weigh, do you have any problem?</p><p>Brother Weigh: I have three questions. First, I feel that my spiritual condition does not match what I know, what I teach, or what I have heard. Second, I feel that it is very hard to have some spiritual weight or worth. In the past, I was satisfied as long as I had a work to occupy me or a platform for me to speak. For example, when the church in Hong Kong began to meet in the new building, I was very satisfied. Now I feel that I am not able to meet the demand. Of course, I must admit that Hong Kong is not a place where an ordinary person can work, but I should not live in the realm of my own concepts. Third, I do not feel that I have the ability to take the lead in the work of the entire south China region. It would be better to find some stronger brothers to come and take the lead in the work here.</p><p>Watchman Nee: First, let us talk about the work here. Let me point out that while ability has some relationship to work, the correlation is not absolute. The work belongs to God, and God works according to His own principle. His principle is to use whatever is available. In using men, God can only use those who are available, not those who are not available. We should not expect some who are not available to come. If a local church only has blind, lame, and deaf ones, we should be satisfied that such ones would rise up. The Lord has given a gift to every saved person. Even the blind, lame, and deaf have one talent. It is a matter of how to draw out their talents. Perhaps a few people in the church have five talents, but we almost have to wait for a hundred years before we can come across a few of these great gifts. However, if we add five one-talented ones together, we will have the same amount of gift as the five-talented one. Today our job is to stir up all the one-talented ones. We have to draw out everyone's portion.</p><p>There are more people here than in northwest China, but geographically, northwest China is much larger, and it is much harder for the saints to take care of the need there. For this reason you should not expect very gifted co-workers to come. You should work as much as you can with the people you have. Basically, you do not need able, strong, and gifted co-workers, but brothers who can lead and get things started. No one should be slothful in zeal. All must work together in one accord in coordination. I have a few suggestions. First, the co-workers should never neglect prayer. Second, they must come together to study the Word. Third, there should be suitable arrangements in the work. Fourth, you must be strict and severe with yourselves in the work. Do not be loose. Once you are loose, others will become loose as well. You have to be relaxed in your person, but strict and serious in your work. This is how you can go on and how you can have enough serving ones to meet the need. The service of the church is a corporate service. No one worker can single-handedly raise up the whole church.</p><p>We should not do a work like Christianity, in which one worker is sent to a specific place to work. Some of our co-workers should receive the burden from the Lord to travel and make visits within certain districts. The trouble in the past was that the workers who were visiting were not broad enough in their heart. This is wrong. When we go to a place, our heart should be there inasmuch as our body is there. But there are some co-workers who do not put their heart into where they are. This is one of our problems. We have to correct this. At any rate, the Acts of the Apostles starts from chapter one, not from chapter thirteen. Jerusalem is our proper guideline in the work. We should have a center for our work, and the local ones should rise up to serve.</p>
