For example, they should know how to lead different kinds of people on in the church. They should know how to seize the opportunity to preach the gospel and to build up the saints. These are the things concerning which the elders should receive positive leadings from the Lord; they should plan and endeavor like those who are engaging in a business. It would be a great mistake if the elders neglect this aspect of the work and engage themselves in arranging chairs and tables, taking care of the cleaning, and trying to meet other practical needs.</P><P>For instance, the church here has over thirty separate district meetings. Under normal circumstances, every district should be strong. Not only does this require the responsible ones in the districts to take up the leadership, but it requires the attention of the elders. The elders must study the condition of each district. How is the condition in this district, and in that district? If the condition is not good, what is the reason? Is it because the supply in the Word is weak? Is it because the administration or the coordination is not right? Is it because there are weaknesses in the services or in the gospel? Once they have found the reason, they have to render help according to the practical need. If one district is lacking in the supply of the Word, those among the elders who are more outstanding in the ministry of the Word should pick up the burden to render help and to strengthen the supply of the Word. Perhaps another district is incompetent in handling their business affairs. Those among the elders who are good at service should go there to help them. The elders should spend the energy, strength, and time to strengthen the meetings in all the districts, and to bring every one of the thirty or more districts up to the standard. These are the things the elders should do.</P><P>Take another example: in the church there are also the meetings in the different meeting halls. There are the Lord's Day morning message meetings and the mid-week Bible study meetings. The elders have to pay attention to the atmosphere of these meetings, the messages given in these meetings, the number in attendance, and the condition of attendance. All these things take time. As to the cleaning of the chairs and the tables, the elders need only to oversee generally. The work itself should be handed over to the deacons.</P><P>These are only examples. The elders should always take care of the big, high, important, developing, advancing, promoting, and building works within the church. As to the other affairs, they should only lay down some general guidelines and should hand them over to the deacons. This is the only way to effect a division of labor, and it is the only way to produce the manpower.</P><P>In the church, one should see a beautiful picture of the elders learning to be the authority in humility and patience, teaching others and leading them on, while the deacons are learning to submit to authority, to be led, and to serve properly. Everyone should stay in their place, and everyone should function to the best of their capacity. This requires that the elders know the boundary between the two kinds of people.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_075.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_077.html">Next</a> </body></html>
