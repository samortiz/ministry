<P>This is all I will say. If I say more, my heart will not be happy and will not improve anything. But I would present this most solemn matter before those who love Christ honestly and who honor Him faithfully. The teaching of Balaam is everywhere. What a shame this is to the Lord's name! If this is the only way to maintain the church and to support the preachers, why not let this work fall to pieces? If a Christian cannot go on without the world, he will soon find out that the world can go on without him! The Pharisees of old were wiser than the Christians of today. They said of the pieces of silver that "it is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is blood money" (Matt. 27:6). Because man does not believe in God's power and love, he devises many ways to fill up the lack. But if God truly does not have the power and the love, why do we have to spend the effort to do something in His name? If God is liable to fail, why do we not just allow Him to fail? If God can fail, what purpose is there for us to plan so much? If He cannot fail, does not planning expose our utter lack of faith? Where in the Bible does it record a campaign for money with organizational ways? Those who give should give "as a blessing and not as a matter of covetousness...each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver" (2 Cor. 9:5b, 7). God does not want an offering from sinners. What He wants is a willing consecration from His children.</P><P>Where can we find in the Bible the system of hired workers? It is true that "to the one who works" there is the reward (Rom 4:4) and that it is right that "those who announce the gospel...live from the gospel" (1 Cor. 9:14). But who is the one who hires the preacher? Whose servants are they? Are Christians offering money to hire preachers, or are they offering money to God? Are the preachers the workers of God or are they the workers of church members? God can certainly use His people to give money to His workers, but to the giver, it should not be a matter of remuneration to the preacher but a matter of offering to God. For the receiver, he should not consider the amount of work he does as the basis for the amount of money he should receive. Instead he should receive everything from God's hand. If the Lord's believers cannot give without using a certain method, will God then be short of their money? Why do we need their money anyway? If a servant of God cannot trust in the Lord fully, he should change to another profession and should earn an honest wage. The Bible does not give us one instance of a servant of God looking to man. When wages are stopped, the hired ones are gone. In this way, God's work will not be affected by money. This will prevent having useless ones among the servants of Christ. I have said before, and I will say it again, that if we cannot act by God's way, it is better that we not act at all. It is better to let the work fall than to use human inventions to replace the divine institutions. If one wants to offer, he has to do so willingly. If one wants to work, he has to trust in the Lord. Anything else will not please the Lord and should be rejected by those who faithfully love the Lord.</P><P>What is the result of the teaching of Balaam? First, it is idolatry, and second, it is fornication. At present, in addition to these actual sins, believers have many similar spiritual problems. In order to avoid being conspicuous, the believers have absorbed many heathen festivals and traditions and have christianized them. They utilize many heathen festivals as a time to give ground to the flesh. In the end, what we have is a mixed religion, with Christianity contributing the name and the idol worshippers contributing the teaching, the ceremonies, and the reality! Is the present church truly free from the power of idols? What is an idol? It is the setting up of something that man has made and worshipping it as god. Those who consider man's work as God are in reality worshipping idols. How much has the present church been freed from the realm of human work being taken as God? Where can a present believer show his distinction from the world? I do not mean a distinction from the Chinese customs. How many are there in the church who can completely reject festivals, traditions, and other idolatrous things? Or is there still the compromise, beautifying itself with a good name and utilizing this name? It is true that in many things the church is different from the Chinese customs, but can we say that it is different from the world? I am afraid that it is different from others, not because of the fact that it is Christian, but because of westernization! The god of this world is Satan. Those who follow the customs of this age are liable to idolatry in inclination and in fact. But we, the little ones, the ones who have believed in the Lord, should flee idolatry.</P><P>In the matter of fornication, is the church behind the Israelites? The Bible clearly considers the receiving of heresy as a kind of spiritual fornication. To befriend the world is also a kind of fornication. Although Christianity boasts of its power to integrate the worldly teachings, theories, and philosophies (what the Bible calls "the elements") and to turn them into the so-called western Christian culture, the Lord rebukes this as fornication! Christianity cares little for the loss of its standing, and in satisfying the appetite of the world overturns its own faith. The mind of the unregenerated man is very much lacking in standard and is full of darkness and error, yet this is what the so-called world culture is all about! The present so-called Christianity is not preaching Christ's death and resurrection but has instead become a totality of the worldly minds. As the tide of the age changes, unconsciously its position shifts gradually downstream. Periodically there are adjustments, but only for the purpose of making itself more compatible to the age. In fashioning its minds to become more modern, Christianity has drifted further away from its source! It is true that Christians are zealous, but for what reason? I am afraid it is for the reason of maintaining the name of their Christian denominations! As long as Christianity can exist in name, it is ready to sacrifice the existence of the fundamental teachings! But then, if Christianity is regressing, why not allow it to disappear, and why not set up a new religion? Why do we have to labor and be so busy stocking the goods only for the purpose of keeping such a shop running? It is a shocking fornication that the present church has committed in teaching. However, who considers this as being wrong?</P><P>Some things are clearly worldly and some people clearly love the world and make friends with the world. Yet all these are given the beautiful name of service and reform. God leaves His church in the world at this present age in order that it may be a witness to the world of the sin of crucifying His Son and of its impossibility for reform. God's only work is to save a group of people in the world and to gather them under His Son's name. When the church takes in the teaching of Balaam, she becomes a colony of the world! The present world no longer becomes simply a way for the church to pass through. Instead, it is developed as much as possible with the hope that it can eventually become the eternal home of the church! Thus, some have thought that the kingdom of heaven would be realized on earth through the church's work, and the church would remain on earth for millennia. Hence, education, labor, economy, politics, international relationships, and hundreds of other issues should all be studied and improved. However, while the church is busily engaged in all these activities, she has already lost her chastity completely! Through the introduction of the teaching of Balaam, the church has married the world. There is no lack of new terms invented by wise ones, but the Lord calls all these activities idolatry and fornication.</P>
