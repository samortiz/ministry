<h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>God led the children of Israel in their crossing of the Red Sea and journeying in the wilderness with the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire as the guidance (Exo. 13:21-22). Both the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire are types with rich spiritual significance.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE PILLAR OF CLOUD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying the Spirit</h2><p>In biblical typology the cloud signifies the Spirit. Sometimes the Spirit comes to us as the cloud to cover and shelter us. After keeping the Passover, the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea and went out of Egypt under the covering and sheltering of the pillar of cloud to run the race in the wilderness. Likewise, after we, the New Testament believers, take Christ as our Passover (1 Cor. 5:7), the Spirit of God comes to be with us that we may be freed from the usurpation and enslavement of the world, and to lead us to run the Christian race (9:24-27), just as the pillar of cloud led the children of Israel.</p><h2 class="head2">B. First Being the Cloud and<br />Then Becoming the Pillar of Cloud,<br />Standing Firm with Strength</h2><p>The cloud that covered and sheltered the children of Israel became the pillar of cloud that guided them. First the cloud was above them, and then it appeared before them and became the pillar of cloud that stood firm with strength. All the New Testament believers have the indwelling Spirit with them, who not only shelters them but also guides them (Rom. 8:14; Heb. 12:1). The Spirit&rsquo;s leading of the believers is as definite and strong as the pillar of cloud.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE PILLAR OF FIRE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying the Word</h2><p>In the daytime it was the pillar of cloud that led the way for the children of Israel, and in the night it was the pillar of fire. The cloud signifies the Spirit; the fire signifies the Word of God, which is a shining light to us, the believers. Second Peter 1:19 says that the word in the Scripture, as a lamp shining in a dark place, gives forth spiritual light to shine over the believers&rsquo; footsteps. Moreover, Psalm 119:105 says, &ldquo;Your word is a lamp to my feet / And a light to my path.&rdquo; Whenever we are in darkness, the Lord&rsquo;s word is the fire, the burning fire, the brightening light, shining over us and guiding us that we may take the way before us in the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p><h2 class="head2">B. First Being the Fire and<br />Then Becoming the Pillar of Fire,<br />Standing Firm with Strength</h2><p>The children of Israel could journey not only in the daytime but even in the night because the fire gave them light. This fire became a tall pillar of fire, standing firm with strength, leading them in their journey on God&rsquo;s way. In the dark night, as long as we have the word of the Lord, we can have the Lord&rsquo;s definite and strong guidance, as the pillar of fire, to overcome all the darkness, that our faith may be established and we may go on boldly.</p><p>The two pillars, the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, that guided the children of Israel in their journey actually were one. When night came, the cloud became the fire. But when day dawned, the fire became the cloud. Whether as the cloud or the fire, God&rsquo;s guidance is always a pillar. In the Bible a pillar denotes strength. Hence, God&rsquo;s guidance to us is strong; it stands upright, firm, and solid. Not only so, both the cloud and the fire are symbols of God, for He is both the Spirit and the Word (John 4:24; 1:1). Furthermore, the Word is also the Spirit (John 6:63; Eph. 6:17). The Lord, the Spirit, and the Word are one to lead us and guide us continually. In our Christian journey there should be no difference between day and night. Whether it is day or night, whether it is clear or dark, God guides us through His Spirit and His Word that we may walk firmly on the way in which He leads.</p>
