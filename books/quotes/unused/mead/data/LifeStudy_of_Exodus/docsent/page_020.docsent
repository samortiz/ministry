   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PLACE OF GOD S CALLING A. The Back Side of the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exodus 3:1 says, Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One day Moses led the flock to the back side of the desert.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that we can be called only when we are at the back side of our situation, never when we are at the front.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe that Moses led the flock to the back side of the desert because he was looking for the best pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He might have been dissatisfied with the familiar places, and he might have desired a new place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, he went to the back side.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we would receive God s calling, we also must be in the proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This place is firstly the back side of our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are a teacher, God cannot call you at the front side of your teaching profession.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must be at the back side.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same principle, if you are a businessman, you must go to the back side of your business in order to be called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be at the back side means that we are not content with our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For years Moses fed the flock on the front side of the desert.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But one day, discontented and dissatisfied, he decided to go to the back side to see what was there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are dissatisfied with your occupation or with your marriage, this dissatisfaction may turn you to the back side.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every one who has been called by God can testify that he was called at the back side.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the calling of Moses, who came to whom?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Did Moses come to God, or did God come to Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would say that both were traveling, and they eventually met at a certain spot.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God traveled there from the heavens, and Moses traveled there from where he was living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, it is difficult to say who came to whom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to our experience, we one day came to a certain place, and there we met God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. The Mountain of God</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Moses went to the back side of the desert, he came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times the back side of our situation turns out to be the mountain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moses, however, did not know that the mountain of God was at the back side of the desert.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, as Moses was slowly making his journey with the flock to the mountain of God, God was already there waiting for him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. Holy Soil</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 5 God said to Moses, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy sandals from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy soil Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The holy soil in this verse refers to land untouched by man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that God s calling occurs in a place where there is no human interference.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s calling always comes to one who is on virgin soil, soil touched only by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that every genuine calling comes in a place where there is no human manipulation or opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would be called by God, we must be in a place reserved wholly for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>D. The Midst of a Thorn-bush</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On this holy soil there is a thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 2 says, And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thorn-bush: and he looked, and, behold, the thorn-bush burned with fire, and the thorn-bush was not consumed Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The thorn-bush represents Moses himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fact that God called from the midst of a thorn-bush indicates that the place of God s calling is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God does not call us from the heavens; He calls from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some may wonder whether this principle applies in the case of Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Initially, Saul was called by the Lord out of heaven, but eventually this calling became something within Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord who called him came into him, into the bush from Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our experience bears witness to the fact that the place of God s calling is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every one who has truly been called by God can testify of this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the beginning it might have seemed as if God were calling from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, however, it became clear that God was calling from within the thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>E. A Flame of Fire</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 2 speaks also of a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This refers to the glory of God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Bible God s holiness is likened to fire.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever God calls someone, He calls him in the glory of His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By calling a person in such a way, God separates him unto His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Apparently God s calling occurred at the back side of the desert; actually it took place at the mountain of God and, particularly, on holy soil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Experientially, it was from within the midst of a thorn-bush, and, ultimately, it was from the flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was the place of God s calling of Moses: at the back side, on the mountain, on holy soil, in the midst of a thorn-bush, and in a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the fire God was calling Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In fact, God was the flame of fire, for the voice which called Moses came out of the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, it was the fire that was speaking, that was calling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all need to be in such a place.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then God s calling will come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To be called by God is not simply a matter of consecrating ourselves to the Lord, attending a Bible school or seminary, and then being ordained after graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Such a calling means nothing in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God s calling takes place at the back side of our life in the world, on the mountain of God, and in a place where there is no human interference.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Furthermore, we are called by God in the glory of His holiness from within the midst of a burning thorn-bush.</S>
