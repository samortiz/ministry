To fulfill His eternal purpose God must accomplish two categories of work: the work of creation and the work of building
God's creation is for His building, and God's building is the ultimate consummation which fulfills His purpose in creation
These signify that the building of God is produced, nourished and sustained by God Himself and with God Himself in Christ as life to us
Among the many items of His creation recorded in Genesis one and two, God mentions three precious substances: gold, bdellium and onyx stone
At the beginning of Genesis we see the materials, and at the end of Revelation we see the New Jerusalem, composed of these materials
Immediately after the fall of man, mentioned in Genesis three, we read of the city of Enoch, built by the fallen sons of Adam
When he awoke he set up the stone which he had used for a pillow and poured oil upon it, saying, 'This is the House of God'
We need to remember also that the tabernacle was the very center of the people of Israel during their history of wandering in the wilderness
When they entered the good land of Canaan, the essential work of the Israelites was the construction of a temple- another building
Remember, at the beginning there were the materials, but at the end there is the finished building composed of these materials
After the serpent appeared, God immediately foretold that the Seed of woman, Christ, would bruise that serpent
We know what God made on the first day, the second day, and so on; but have we realized God's aim and goal in His creation?
There was life of the lowest form and without consciousness, the vegetable life; then, there was life of the higher form, the animal life
It is God's intention that man have dominion over all the earth, not just over the living creatures of this earth
If we could apprehend the real meaning of these four wordsman image dominion and earthI believe we would understand the entire Scripture!
The Psalmist was considering the heavens, yet he quickly reverted to man and to God's care for man on this earth
The answer is, when God created man He did not create a small individual, but a collective man, including you!
The New Testament says that Christ created in Himself one new man out of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles
It is impossible for any individual to glorify God or express Christ in a full way if he is not built up with other Christians
All of our problems are due to one thing: we are too independent and individualistic; we are disconnected and isolated from others
If we are willing to be vitally related and built up with others, we will find that our weaknesses and shortcomings will disappear
Suppose your hand is isolated and separated from your body yet it continues with great effort to live and function to be healthy and useful!
As in Genesis 1, there is only one man, so at the end of Scripture there is only one city, built of gold, pearls and precious stones
As Christians, can we point out other definite members of the Body of Christ with whom we are related in a practical way?
You may want to go to heaven and see a heavenly church life, but God is waiting and expecting to come down to this earth!
John saw the one and only expression of God, the New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven as a testimony to the whole earth
We must not be defeated by the wrong concept that it is impossible to have the church life on this earth and that we must wait for heaven
We must cast these negative thoughts beneath our feet and boldly declare that the Church must be expressed on this earth today
Because we are the children of God and members of Christ, there is no reason and no ground for us to be divided
Negatively, there is only one corporate representative to deal with God's enemy, and subdue this rebellious earth
It is true that the natural scenery of animals, trees and flowers portrayed in Genesis 1 and 2 is not a picture of building, but of creation
At the beginning of the Scripture, the garden is central in the universe; but at the end, the building is the center
When the ground is obtained and the materials are on hand, we naturally expect to see the construction work of the building proceed
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob had died, but God is not the God of the dead; therefore, resurrection is proven to be a fact
Eventually Adam became disappointed, for of the myriads of living creatures he could find none as a suitable counterpart for himself
It is very difficult to understand the record of Genesis 2 unless the Lord opens our eyes and imparts heavenly vision
Genesis 2, not as a continuation, but as a supplement, reveals to us in detail how God could attain the goal of His intention
The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul'
It is very important to realize that God formed man as a vessel, a container , not as an instrument for some kind of use
We may be like a foolish boy who appreciates the bright and shiny box given to him, yet does not know that it has an inner receiver
If you saw a painting of a fountain flowing with water and an empty vessel before it, what would you conjecture?
Genesis 2 shows a 'cartoon' of a tree with an empty little man with a receiver within standing before that tree
Every Christian has Christ within but how many are exercising their spirit to enjoy Christ feeding on Him as the reality of the tree of life
Now we are clear that God's intention in placing man before this tree was that he might receive life in the form of food
Being a Christian, as far as our relationship with God is concerned, is not a matter of working for God, but a matter of eating
We can never exhaust the subject of learning how to partake of Christ-that which was portrayed and foreshadowed in Genesis 2
Then this river springing forth from one source became four branches, flowing to the four directions of the earth
By experience we know that when we feed on Christ as our life, we immediately sense the flowing of something within watering us
If we do not feed on Christ, we will soon be withered and dried, for we will consequently lose the watering of the flowing river
When we fellowship with the Lord, feeding on Him continually, we not only sense satisfaction, but also a flowing within us
The life which is Christ Himself taken in the form of food and enjoyed by us is also the living water flowing within us
Once the tree is damaged or broken, it secretes this living sap, which eventually becomes a brilliant and transparent gum
John 12 and 15 respectively portray Jesus as the grain of wheat and the vine tree-these are of the vegetable kingdom
The principle of the animal life is that of sacrifice: Christ sacrificed His life by shedding His blood for us
In eternity pearl is again mentioned in the place of silver, for by that time redemption is fully accomplished
As such, if we want to be like those precious materials for God's building, we must partake of the tree of life
These three precious materials from the river are also related to the three persons and particularly the work of the Triune God
Christ the Son was wounded by us just as the oyster, and out from Him came the secretion of life which produces the pearl
If we learn to be built up with others, we will have the victory, the riches, sanctification, holiness, power, and the fulness of God
In the final picture of Scripture, the Holy City, New Jerusalem, is not only the tabernacle of God, but also the Bride of Christ
It is only when seeking Christians are locally built up together that there will be a real Bride to match Christ
At the beginning there is the blueprint, and at the end there is the completion according to the initial concept
Next we must realize that God in Christ by the Spirit is the tree of life, the real food for us to eat and enjoy
We all know that in ourselves, by ourselves, and with ourselves-in our natural life-we can never be one with others
Though we are husband and wife, the closest relationship on earth, we are individually peculiar and naturally divided
Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch
Chapters 4 through 6 of Genesis reveal that the city of Enoch was the center of the first civilization instituted by the fallen human race
God commanded Noah: 'Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch
Four signifies creation, as testified by the four living creatures mentioned in Revelation and the four winds of the earth, etc
Five signifies the mingling of God with man; it means that man with God mingled with him must take responsibility
The ark, as we have seen, typifies Christ in human nature with the three persons of the Godhead-God mingled with His creation
God's building is a building of Christ in human nature with the three persons of the Godhead; that is, divinity mingled with humanity
When Noah disembarked after the flood, he did not build another city, but erected an altar along with a tent for his dwelling
God's building is always of stone, while Satan's counterfeit building is always made with brick, the work of human hands
The angels did not visit the city in the day while the sun was shining, but in the evening at the setting of the sun
As darkness was descending, the two angels followed Lot, sitting not at a tent door like Abraham, but in a gate of Sodom
Spiritually speaking, this signifies that these men lived in God's building rather than in the building of the fallen human race
Notice that Jacob added something in his second visit: he still called the name of the place 'Bethel,' but he added the prefix 'El' to it
We have seen how Abraham was separated from Babel, the city of idols, and was kept from Sodom, the city of sin
Later we will see that the Israelites, freed from Egyptian bondage, were asked in the wilderness to bring forth materials for God's building
Those materials included gold and precious stones; onyx stones, the very stones mentioned in Genesis 2, were included
These counterfeits comprised four cities, or in principle, three kinds of worlds-a world of idols, a world of sin, and a world of enjoyment
Christians must have nothing to do with idols or with sin, but neither should we be entangled by the world of enjoyment
If you ask some Christians why they do not attend the meetings of the church, they will reply that they do not have time
When the people of Israel were delivered out of the work of those cities and brought to Mount Sinai, they were completely free
They no longer labored in mud, brick and straw, but rather with gold and precious stones to build up a dwelling place for God
We have traveled quite extensively in this country, yet we have seen few Christians who are really out of Egypt
It is difficult to find many Christians who are standing in the position of freedom and availability for God's building
In that position they can surely contact the treasure of worldly enjoyment, but they must give up these cities if they would contact Christ
We must always be on the alert, for we are endangered by these three fronts: Babel, Sodom, and the cities of Egypt
We can never enjoy Christ as the living water, continuously flowing to quench our thirst, if we are still in Egypt
Before proceeding further, we need a bird's-eye view of God's building in the entire Scriptures, especially in the first two books
The sixty-six books of the Bible contain many things, but we must be clear concerning the over-all view of the central matter
If we do not have a view whereby we see all things related to this matter of building, we do not understand the Scriptures
There we saw a tree with a flowing river and out of that flowing river came gold pearl and precious stone the materials for Gods building
By carefully considering that picture in the light of the whole Bible, we realize that it portrays God as life to us
In the New Jerusalem, he has become not only stone, but precious stone, as well as pearl and gold-three precious items
In the past, God accomplished His work of creation in six days, but in order to transform man He has used at least six thousand years
We have seen that God's purpose and intention in creation was to have a group of people as the center of His creation
God intended to have the corporate man to express Him and to represent Him by dealing with His enemy, thus recovering the lost earth
Satan captured man and carried him away from God's purpose, then utilized him to raise up a counterfeit of God's intention
Satan crept into the garden of Eden and stole this man, usurping him to build a city in opposition to God, a counterfeit of God's building
The enemy's goal in causing man's fall was to utilize the fallen race to construct a counterfeit in opposition to God's purpose
Immediately following the fall of man in Genesis 3, the city of Enoch was built by the fallen race in Genesis 4
The city of Enoch was the source of all the evil occupations of the human racewarring pleasure amusement polygamy and all fleshly enjoyments
The city of Enoch was the very center of the first civilization; it was the first culture invented by the fallen race
Out from the fallen people of Babel, God called and separated Abraham and brought him to an elevated place called the land of Canaan
On the one hand there is the danger of living in the city of idols, and on the other hand the danger of drifting into sin
A man standing on a plain, though he falls to the right or the left, is relatively safe; but in an elevated place he must exercise care
Praise God that Jacob had such a dream, that even on this rebellious, usurped earth there is the possibility for God's house to stand
Whenever and wherever there is a group of regenerated persons poured upon with the Triune God that is the reality of Bethel the house of God
They made their choice: all of Jacob's children went down into Egypt, where they became slaves to build Pharaoh's two treasure cities
Many Christians are enslaved by the enemy for the sake of a living; they are not free from the enjoyments of this world
We will see that the only proper place for us is to be built up as a local, corporate body to express God and to represent God
If you view the scene from on high, you will see all the satanic counterfeits: Babel, Sodom, and the treasure cities
Praise God that the children of Israel were separated, delivered out, and kept away from all these counterfeits
The ark was full of significance, but it was not as full in detail as the tabernacle, the all-inclusive type of God's building
During such fellowship the Lord will reveal that you must consecrate to Him all that you are and all that you possess
One day her third son, the weakest and dullest of her boys, came and offered himself in my presence to become a 'preacher'
My burden is to show why after the lapse of over two thousand years there is still no real building for God on this earth today
It is because some Christians are still in Babel some are still in Sodom and many many others are still being usurped by the King of Egypt
Have you seen that from the gold to the onyx stone, including all the items in between, everything God asks for is precious and the best?
Eventually, after many wanderings, they entered Canaan, bringing the tabernacle with them into that land and establishing it there
After seventy years, God initiated a recovery and brought the Israelites back to the proper ground that they might rebuild the temple
From that time, the church is the temple of God, and as such it is the very subject of the remainder of the New Testament
Christ is the subject of the first part, and the church is the subject of the second part of the New Testament
In the previous chapter it has been made clear to us that the tabernacle as God's dwelling place is the center of everything
Out of the realm of Babel, the realm of idolatry, God called Abraham, the first forefather of the builders of the tabernacle
Neither Abraham, his son Isaac, nor his grandson Jacob would build a city or live in a house; they were all satisfied to dwell in tents
They expected to move from their tents into that eternal tabernacle, of which their tents were but a very small shadow
Gods redemption and salvation brought these fallen people out of the cities of worldliness and back into a proper position for Gods building
By God's deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, the children of Israel were finally free from all of Satan's counterfeits
God brought them into His presence at Mount Sinai in the wilderness, where they saw His glory and heard His voice
The Israelites were not only freed from bondage, they were also spoiled for anything other than God's building
On the other hand it means we realize that we are good for nothing but death and that we have already been put on the cross
From the picture of the tabernacle we see that the reality of God's building is not possible without the altar being first experienced by us
The number five signifies the creature plus the Creator to bear responsibility for the fulfilling of God's requirements
The foursquare measurement of five by five gives the sense of the complete fulfillment of God's requirements in full responsibility
Before sharing the meaning of the laver, we must indicate in this connection that the altar was overlaid with brass
The source of this brass was the brazen censers of the two hundred and fifty Israelites who rebelled against God and were judged by fire
The Lord instructed Moses to gather all these brazen censers and make from them brass plates to overlay the altar
If we do not apply the cross to ourselves, we will always say, 'I am all right, there is nothing wrong with me'
At the brass altar we have the experience of being judged; at the brass laver we have the experience of being enlightened and cleansed
The vital problem and main issue today is that all we are, all we have and all we can do must be put on the altar, must be put on the cross
For when we are thus judged, redeemed, and consecrated, we will continually be in the position where the light may shine upon us
In spiritual experience this means that the foundation, the base of the wall of the outer court, comes out of the judgment of God
After we pass the cross and the exposing and cleansing work of the Holy Spirit, we will lay the foundation of the wall of the outer court
When we experience the brass altar and laver, we see the brass sockets laid as a foundation, drawing the boundary line of God's building
From our experience of being judged and cleansed comes the foundation of the outer court, the sockets of brass
In the record of the specifications of the tabernacle, the mentioning of the brass altar precedes the mentioning of the brass sockets
We must first experience the dealing of the cross, and the exposing, enlightening, and cleansing of the Holy Spirit
We must experience these items extensively; then we will have the foundation laid as the boundary line for God's building
Anything belonging to the building of God must be judged by the cross, exposed and cleansed by the Holy Spirit
Anyone who thinks he is clever and adequate for God's building has not judged himself, and has no boundary line
When there is no separating line, no outer court, then the whole world will be the outer court for the building of the church
By our experiences of the altar and the laver, everything is cleansed and adjusted; so everything is right and just
When the hangings are set upon the pillars of the sockets, those beholding the tabernacle from without see something white, pure and clean
All the hangings were five cubits high and were divided by the pillars into sections, each in the measurement of five cubits by five cubits
All the hangings were divided into foursquare sections of five cubits by five cubits, corresponding with the size of the altar
The foursquare top of the altar in the measurement of five cubits by five cubits covers the ground of God's requirements
The foursquare sections of the hangings in the same measurement stand as the testimony to all that is covered and accomplished by the altar
When we have been dealt with by the cross, our daily living and walk will be a testimony to the work of the cross
For the realization of God's building, for the practice of the church life, people must be dealt with and purged in the outer court
We must be dealt with by the cross and purged by the Holy Spirit; then there is the possibility for us to share in the building of God
It is not until we have passed through the outer court that we may enter into God's building, the tabernacle itself
Some have indeed departed from these evil realms, but they are still full of idolatrous germs, sinful germs, and germs of worldly enjoyment
The reason for this is that so many have not experienced the dealing of the altar and the purging of the laver
Within that line everything belongs to His building; outside of that line everything belongs either to Babel, Sodom, or the treasure cities
If we would practice the church life and share in the building of God, we must first experience the brass altar with the brass laver
In the outer court we realize and experience the cross, by which everything is judged, put to death and burned
Within this boundary line there is the possibility for us to realize the building of God and practice the church life
We have seen that if we would share in the building of God we must first enter into and experience all the items in the outer court
The experiences of the outer court deal only with the matter of righteousness; we must still have the experience of holiness
There is a lampstand made of pure and solid gold, and all the other items in the holy place are overlaid with gold
The first item of the holy place is the table made of acacia wood overlaid with gold , upon which was the bread, something good for food
We have seen that immediately after man was created, God put him before the tree of life that he might freely eat of that tree
Our thought is that since we are really hungry, we need the Lord Jesus to satisfy us; so we fulfill our desire by eating the bread of life
Whenever we are satisfied with the Lord Jesus we also have the sense that we are full of God that the divine nature has been imparted to us
If the table were foursquare, one cubit by one cubit, it would signify a complete unit; but here it is two cubits long
On each branch of the lampstand there are three cups, but on the shaft, the stand of the lamp, there are four cups
Without these four cups, we could find no hint in the lampstand that Christ has anything to do with His creatures
When the priests dressed the lampstand in the morning and lit the lamp in the evening, they had to burn the incense
It is by this shining then that we express something to God in a sweet sense-that is Christ in resurrection as the sweet odor to God
Prior to the experiences of the inner court, the most we had was brass, silver, and linen; we had nothing of gold
Prior to the experience of the outer court with its fine linen, we had only the clay and filth of our fallen nature
Through the work of the brazen altar and laver we were purged and purified from everything of Babel, Sodom, and the treasure cities of Egypt
We had nothing of gold until we learned to enjoy Christ, until we took Him into our very being day by day as food
The more we eat Him, the more light we receive; and the greater the light, the more fragrance we have to offer to God
We may experience the sweetness of Christ to the Father, and we may also experience His sweetness to us in the fragrance of His resurrection
As Christians, we may be delivered from the first three, and we may be presently enjoying Christ as everything to us
We must go on to experience the ark that we may be perfected by being overlaid with the divine gold within and without
In other words, until we attain the experience of the ark, we are not perfected and available for the building
Although many Christians talk much concerning the church life, strictly speaking, they are not available material for the church
The boards of the tabernacle itself are produced by our experience of the ark, for both are completely overlaid with gold
The principle is the same as that which we have seen in the producing of the brass sockets for the foundation of the outer court
Just as the veil must be riven, so our fleshly nature, our self, must be broken that we may enter the holiest place
In the holiest place of God's presence there is nothing but God's Christ as the all-inclusive embodiment of God
A one-year-old believer may experience Christ as life, but he does not as yet have much awareness of Christ as the embodiment of God
The more we experience Christ, the more we will sense that this Christ whom we are experiencing is the very embodiment of God
Many of us have had numerous experiences of Christ as food life light and incense but not many have experienced Christ as Gods embodiment
If we are in the holiest of all, we will realize that this is not really a commandment, but an element of what God is in Christ
In the holy place we enjoy Christ in many ways but once we experience the brokenness of the self the flesh we enter into the holiest of all
Strictly speaking, God does not meet us at the brass altar and laver, or even at the showbread table, lampstand, or incense altar
At the mercy seat we not only enjoy Christ as this or that to us, but Christ as God's embodiment, with all the fullness of God
Before entering the holiest place, a Christian must first be delivered from all negative things-idolatry, sins, and worldliness
Eventually, he must leave the self and the flesh that he may enter into the holiest place to experience the fullness of God in Christ
Madame Guyon says that the realization of spiritual experiences will eventually bring us to the point where we are lost in God
The experience of the ark in the holiest of all is much deeper than the experience of the things in the holy place
The overlaying of gold upon the ark is greater and deeper, signifying that the experience of Christ here is greater and deeper than before
They have both experienced Christ as their living bread, and they love to come to the meetings and show Him forth to others
He becomes so real and rich to us as the hidden manna, the hidden law, and the hidden resurrection power within us
At this point, we are fully and wholly mingled with God; we are overlaid with God as the gold in everything and in every way
We will not have words to utter, and we will not need to utter this divine reality of the fullness of the Godhead in Christ in our spirit
Later we will see how the tabernacle is built up with boards which are overlaid with gold on every side, just as the ark
All these things are just a picture of the proper way for us to practice the church life today and have the building of God
We have seen that these items represent Christ as the bread of life, as light, as incense, and as the very embodiment of God
We have seen that the ark, the last item of the tabernacle's interior, was overlaid both within and without with gold
The boards of the tabernacle issue from the experiences of the items within the tabernacle and are the main part of the building itself
If we know how to view this impressive picture, we will realize that the boards are the reproduction and enlargement of the ark
The forty-eight boards signify that all those related to the church building are human, yet they are resurrected
These things are a precious revelation, but now we come to a very practical matter-the composition of the boards
We must have the human element or human nature for the church to be built, but this human nature must first be put to death
These experiences produce the building up of spiritual character, which is the resurrected, uplifted, and strengthened human nature
As a Christian in the church life, we should be exceedingly strong, yet not naturally strong, but spiritually strong
They say, 'We must be loose to be acceptable to others; to be strict causes others to think we are cold and rather unpleasant'
In ourselves we are separate and independent boards, but when we are overlaid with gold, we are united together as one
We will become wooden boards with a golden appearance, and we will be proper materials, available for the building up of the church
When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He sent them two by two: Peter was one and one-half, and John was one and one-half
If we look closely, we will see that someone else, one who is unknown by most Christians, was his other half writing with him
Upon the gold overlay of each board there are rings, and through the rings are bars joining all the boards together
The other four bars are divided into two broken rows of two bars each, with one row above and the other row beneath the middle bar
Three signifies the Triune God, and five is the number of the creature plus the Creator to bear responsibility
In chapter five of Andrew Murray's book, The Spirit of Christ, there is a statement concerning the Spirit of the glorified Jesus
Wood is used in the type of the uniting Holy Spirit because He is not only the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of the glorified man Jesus
There are three groups of bars one on the north side another on the south side and the last on the west side at the rear of the tabernacle
Chapter 2 of Galatians tells us that Peter, James and John were the pillars or the stronger ones in the church at Jerusalem
There must not only be the boards as walls, separating and protecting, but also the pillars which afford the entrance
The building of God was not as yet established in a permanent location, but was involved in journeys and wanderings
The covering over the tabernacle consisted of four layers , which signifies the four-fold Christ, the Christ of four aspects
The third layer consisted of ram skins dyed red, thus revealing the sinless One who was made sin and died for our sins by shedding His blood
All these layers together signify the protection of Christ, who as the sinless One was made sin for us to be our Redeemer
The church is a composition of many people who experience Christ to such an extent that they are mingled with God
In Exodus 40 verse 2 the Lord commanded Moses On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting
Verse 17 tells us that according to the Lord's word, on the first day of the first month in the second year, the tabernacle was reared up
In the first year, the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt-that was the new beginning in their history with the Lord
The tabernacle, and later the temple as an enlargement of the tabernacle, were built for the purpose of expressing God
God's presence and glory fill the tabernacle; thus to be without the tabernacle is to be without God's presence
It was in the tabernacle that God instructed Moses to put the ark; He did not say that it should be put into the tent of meeting
Whenever the church comes together, there must be the outward aspect of the meeting with the inward aspect of God's dwelling in the meeting
A Christian may spend much time in personal Bible study, but he can never receive such a living word from God as when he is in the church
We must be clear, however, that God's living word is spoken only in the real building of the church, the real tabernacle
Peter 2:5 says, 'Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices'
In the Old Testament, boards were used for the building of the tabernacle, and the priests served within the tabernacle
In the New Testament, the living stones of the house, which correspond to the boards of the tabernacle, are the priests
How many Christians there are who think that as long as they love the Lord, they can serve Him individually, irrespective of the church
They certainly could not minister in their homes, for real service is a coordination with others in the tabernacle, in the building of God
It is a dreadful thing to attempt to serve the Lord apart from the proper church life, apart from being built up with others
The priests could never be separated from the tabernacle; they were one with the tabernacle and always with it
That city portrayed in Revelation has twelve gates, three on each of its four sides, containing the names of the twelve tribes
In the beginning God formed the army, and at the end we have a record of the dividing of the land conquered by this army
God had given Israel a good land called Canaan, but the Israelites had to take this land from the usurping hand of God's enemy
We can testify of this from our experience: whenever we are in the real service of the Lord, there is always a battle taking place
The book of Revelation begins with a record of the seven churches, which are divided into one section of four plus another section of three
Revelation ends with the New Jerusalem, where all the numbers are twelve; that is, three times four, signifying God's mingling with us
These Old Testament illustrations reveal clearly the principle that all the fighting of God's army accompanies the building of the church
We must go on to experience this Christ, but the more we experience Him in our daily life, the more spiritual warfare we will encounter
The main point concerning the possessing of the good land is the actual fighting, as seen in the book of Joshua
The book of Numbers informs us concerning the formation of the army, while Joshua records the army marching and fighting to possess the land
We must be reminded again of Genesis 1 and the principle of the earth being subdued by man as God's representative
The tabernacle was set up at a place called Shiloh; the tabernacle was an established center where the people could seek and find God
Even so, when the proper church is built up and the battle is won, a center is established where people can easily meet God
Numbers then reveals the formation of the army for the purpose of conquering the enemy and possessing the land
We will be an army to fight and win the battles, and thus we will recover the land that God's house may be established
The history of the tabernacle with the ark is vitally important if we would realize God's desire concerning His building
We must realize that whenever the children of God are defeated by the enemy, it is proof that they are wrong with God
Though the Israelites were defeated, they would not learn their lesson, they would not be judged and dealt with by the Lord
The Philistines had vanquished thousands of the Israelites in battle, but they could not vanquish the little ark
Eventually they decided to send the troublesome ark back to the Israelites and did so , sending it to Beth-shemesh
Upon receiving the ark, the people of Beth-shemesh dealt carelessly with it, and many of them were smitten by the Lord
The Beth-shemeshites then sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, asking them to take the ark to their place
The men of Kirjath-jearim fetched the ark and brought it into the house of a priest named Abinadab, where it remained for twenty years
The situation was indeed abnormal: the tabernacle with the altar was in Shiloh, but the ark was in Kirjath-jearim
All these events in the history of Samuel, Saul, and David occurred with only one object and purpose in view-God's building
The Lord's presence is always with the ark, for the ark is the very embodiment of the Lord and the testimony of the Lord
Although David was such a man after God's heart, yet before he ascended to the throne he had no authority to act
Once on the throne, however, he had the ground to accomplish God's will and attempted to bring the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Zion
He had to learn not to do things according to the way of worldly people, but according to the way of God's holiness
The oxen pulling the cart stumbled, and the ark began to fall; whereupon Uzzah, one of the men, put forth his hand to steady the ark
David was indeed wrong in moving the ark according to the worldly way, and he was also mistaken in his human opinion
Praise the Lord for the good intentions and motives, but is your way by 'the cart,' or by the priests carrying the ark?
If we would be men after God's heart, then we must also be men after God's mind, after God's way, not using our minds or our way
It is always like this with spiritual blessings: people discover where the blessing of the Lord is, and they want a share in it
One day David realized the need of a proper and established temple to be built up to house the ark of the Lord
Many times after accomplishing something for God, we do not have full peace and rest; we do not have full satisfaction
God told David that He would first build a house for David, and from that house God would raise up a son to build a house for Himself
The temple built by Solomon was not according to any human design, for God had clearly shown David the pattern of the building
The tabernacle was made of wood overlaid with gold, while the temple was built with stones and wood overlaid with gold
The tabernacle was portable and lacked a floor, but the temple had a strong foundation and a floor of wood overlaid with gold
Not only was acacia wood used in the temple, such as was used in the tabernacle, but there was also cypress , cedar, and olive wood
Finally, the ark and the entire tabernacle as well, including the brass altar and all the other vessels, were brought to the temple
History reveals that this wonderful situation, this pleasant prospect of the ark contained in the tabernacle, did not last long
Because of the sins of Christians and the failures of churches, Christ has departed from many so-called churches
The blessing of God came upon Obededoms house because of the arks presence yet the tabernacle was still in Shiloh separated from the ark
That is the condition of the so-called formal churches-they are the tabernacle without the reality, without Christ
When Solomon was a young king, he thought that if he would worship by offering his offerings to the Lord he must do it at the tabernacle
If Christ is separated from the church, it is better to choose Christ; but this is still an abnormal situation
King David had prepared a tabernacle in Zion, but it was not according to the pattern revealed by God on the mount
Later, they sense the need of the church life to express Christ just as David sensed the need of a tabernacle to contain the ark
They pitch a tabernacle, they set up a meeting according to their own understanding, according to the same principle practiced by David
Some Christians pitch a tabernacle on their 'Zion,' while others pitch another tabernacle on the ground of their choosing
Some Christians have even relinquished their family life and their jobs in order to pitch a little tent for the ark
There are many attacks from the enemy, but the Lord is faithful; the faithfulness of the Lord will see to it-He cannot deny Himself
By the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit the six books of history to which we have referred are put together as a set
At the very beginning there is a good prospect-God's building has been established in a definite place called Shiloh
The people need wander no longer; from that time anyone desiring God had a definite place to which he could go
According to chapters 5 and 6 of 1 Samuel, it appears that the purpose of God has been overthrown: the ark was captured by the enemy
All the enemy's activity and frustration only opens the way, not only for God's recovery, but also for God's enlargement!
During our early years in the Lord's service, we were somewhat influenced by the negative teaching of these Christian teachers
In 1 Samuel, the beginning of this set of six books, there is a tabernacle, but in the last three books of this set there is a temple
The tabernacle had some sort of foundation, but there was no floor, for the tabernacle was erected in the wilderness
Some Bible teachers, as we have mentioned, do not see how things which are once degraded can ever be recovered
According to typology the picture is exceedingly clear that something which has been degraded can not only be recovered, but also enlarged
Some Bible teachers are always bemoaning the fact of how far the church today is removed from its wonderful state at the day of Pentecost
The Lord told Balaam, the Gentile prophet, 'He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel'
In 1 Samuel 13:14, God told Saul: 'Now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart'
If you are interested in the recovery and enlargement of God's building, you by God's mercy must be a man after His own heart
The book of 1 Samuel portrays David as the man after God's heart, but also as one who is inexperienced and young
He became a real student in suffering; he learned the lesson of suffering; he became completely successful in suffering
Many young brothers today need such a Saul, a Saul who will continually deal with them, ill-treat them, and suppress them
Following his enthronement, he still found it in his power to do something for the Lord for which he could boast and take the credit
Even Nathan the prophet, upon hearing of David's desire, encouraged him in this project; he went along with David in a natural way
We have seen how David was told to wait until God built a house for him then from that house a son would come forth to build a house for God
Even so today, the finished building will not be a testimony of how much we can do for God, but of how much God has done for us
Regardless of how much we are after God's heart or how much we have learned the lessons of the cross, we still must be humble
We will realize that it is not we but the Lord, that it is not our attributes but the Lord's mercy, the Lord's grace
It is through such a life that the building, the site, the material, and the pattern for God's building are prepared
All these incidents are not simply a record of history, but types which indicate the way for the recovery of God's building today
Now Solomon began to build the temple at Jerusalem at the place prepared by David and according to the pattern which God had given to David
Now according to Gods way of recovery the old proper tabernacle was mingled with the new temple and the one ark was brought into that temple
According to our human opinion and way, as long as a better, enlarged temple is built up, we would forget the old one
We do not have the measurements of the old laver in the tabernacle, but we do know that there was only one laver
Formerly we experienced Christ in a small way as our bread of life, but now our experience of this living bread must be increased ten times
Our experience of Christ as the light of life shining within us must also be increased to match the showbread tables in the enlarged temple
In the temple there are at least three kinds: There was cypress , a tree commonly planted in cemeteries in ancient times
We human beings were originally composed of clay, but now by the work of the Holy Spirit we are being transformed into something precious
There is also the experience of the pure gold, the divine nature of God being added to us, and the experience of constant transformation
We must have an enlargement as well as an increase of our experiences of Christ that we may match the enlarged expression
A final matter for us to learn from God's way of recovery and enlargement is seen in the pattern of the temple
The principle we must learn here is that in the church life there are all kinds of gifts and functions and all must be properly proportioned
Some so-called churches emphasize the need of going to the mission fields, thus lengthening their feet out of all proportion
The situation today among the Lord's people and in the so-called churches is all out of proportion and balance
If they should observe some serving as ushers in a meeting, they would tell them to abandon that and just learn to fellowship with the Lord
Praise the Lord that in the vision given to him David not only saw the size of the vessels, but also their weight
David and Solomon, the two men vitally related to the building of the temple, were both types of Christ, representing Him in two aspects
Some Bible teachers give the wrong impression by saying that Solomon typifies only the Christ who will come again in glory
We are indeed waiting for the second coming of Christ, but we are presently in the period of the resurrected Christ
If the building of the church is to be accomplished in the next dispensation, then what was it that took place on the day of Pentecost?
The apostles in their writings were very definite and strong at that time concerning the building up of the church in this age
We must be clear that by His suffering and death Christ prepared all the materials and now in His resurrection Christ is building the church
By the time of the building up of the temple, God was marching on more gloriously than at the time the tabernacle was completed
The pleasant prospect, the glorious condition, never lasts too long; that is, not until we reach the ultimate goal
Not only did he damage the temple, but eventually Satan sent the Chaldeans, the Babylonians, to completely destroy God's building
The destruction inflicted upon Jerusalem by the Babylonians was not perpetrated merely by human hands, but by the enemy, Satan
It is evident that this fight was not merely between the Babylonians and the Jewish people, but between Satan and God
Through His chosen people, especially through men like David and Solomon, God regained at least a portion of this earth
Because God had gained a place on this earth through His people, He could be called the Lord of earth as well as the Lord of the heavens
God's intention is to have a building on the earth, a Bethel, a gate to heaven, a place where God can put His feet to exercise His authority
Later in history, when the people of Israel crossed the Jordan, the priests who carried the ark stepped into the waters and remained there
The New Testament records that one day while the Lord Jesus was on the earth He prayed, 'I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth '
For the Israelites to have God's building in Babylon was quite all right-all their enemies agreed concerning this
When the Israelites returned to Jerusalem, one of their first projects was to rebuild the altar upon its original base
It would be the same in every respect except for one vital factor-it would be on a different ground, a different standing
In the recovery of the church life the first thing to which we must pay attention is the old ground, the original standing
The book of Nehemiah records how the enemy stirred up an intense struggle to frustrate the Israelites from God's building
We want to have positive fellowship; we do not want to waste our time; we do not want to be frustrated from the recovery of the building
The Lord says in Haggai that when we neglect His house to do our own labor and sow our own seed, the result will only be emptiness
If we give our full attention to the recovery of the church life today, being willing to be built up together, we will attain this building
On the other hand, if we neglect God's house, the building up of the church, no matter what we do the end results will be very poor
If we would attend to the church life and be built up in our locality, we will see the Lord's abundant blessing upon us
He knew that there had been no advertisement in the newspapers and that before each meeting not many knew who was to be the speaker
When Satan through the Babylonians assaulted Jerusalem, they first destroyed the city, then they had the liberty to demolish the temple
The order of God's recovery is first that the altar must be recovered , then God's house , and finally the city
At the end of Scripture, in the book of Revelation, we see the city and the temple mingled together as one building
That recovery was begun according to Ezra's record, but the recovery of the destroyed temple has not yet been fully accomplished
In Ezra's account of the recovered temple there were no measurements given, but Ezekiel saw the measurements of the temple in his vision
If we have foresight to see things through to the end we will realize that this recovery of Gods temple has not yet been fully accomplished
Neither the temple in Ezra's day nor the temple of Herod's time was the full recovery of the temple Solomon had built
The temple of Ezekiel's vision, however, is the more than full recovery of Solomon's temple, which had been destroyed
Most Bible students agree that Ezekiel's vision was to some degree a prophecy which will be fulfilled in the future
When we compare the temple in Ezekiel with the temple built by Solomon, we see a further, tremendous enlargement
Are just a few items of this enlargement: firstly, there is both an outer court and an inner court -two courts
Of course, this temple is the same size as the one built by Solomon, but there are many additional attachments
The stadia, an ancient measurement of length used by the Greeks, is thought to be similar to our length of three feet
There will be twelve foundations, twelve gates, twelve months, twelve apostles, and twelve tribes-many twelves
In the first stage there was something very small, as a building in miniature: there were the tents of Noah and Abraham with an altar
The altars at which Noah and Abraham worshipped were undoubtedly crude, being composed probably of just a few stones put together
In Ezekiel's vision there was an even more greatly enlarged temple with a wonderful altar at the very center of the premises of the temple
The steps in this Psalm show that seeking Christians are those who go on after they have enjoyed the riches of the Lord
The green pastures and still waters are just the initial experiences of Christ; they are the stage of childhood
Our enjoyment of the Lord in the first stage, in the green pastures and still waters, is very elementary and rather rough
In the final stage goodness and mercy follow us all the days of our life, and we dwell in the house of the Lord forever!
Oh, we must go on to hit this mark and attain this goal; we must go on until one day we remain in the house of the Lord forever
If we would really redeem the time, it is best to dwell in the house of God, for one day there will redeem a thousand days elsewhere
The Psalmist continues, 'I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness'
If he could not dwell in the house of God, the Psalmist would be satisfied to be even a doorkeeper of that house
Noah and Abraham's small tents portrayed in Genesis were the seed, and the New Jerusalem is the final harvest of that seed
In eternity past there was only God, but in eternity future divinity will be mingled with humanity in the Son of man
The essential point of John 1:51 is the open heaven with the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man
Jacob's dream had two items, an open heaven and a ladder joining heaven and earth, upon which the angels ascended and descended
In the second chapter of John's Gospel the Jews asked the Lord Jesus, 'What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things'?
The Jews destroyed only one person on the cross, but the Lord raised up millions of people with Him in His resurrection
The temple raised up by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus includes the Lord Himself with all the members of His Body, the church
Another aspect in the New Testament of the Lord Jesus as God's building is the rock, first mentioned in Matthew 16
Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace unto it'
Each building has a foundation stone and a cornerstone then when the building is nearly finished the builders put on the topstone the roof
As a stone, Christ is good not only for the building up of the temple, God's house, but also for the building up of the city, the kingdom
Before the incarnation, God was God and man was man; but by the incarnation God was brought into man, and man was brought into God
Before the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, there was only one Person on the entire earth who constituted God's building
By His death and resurrection, millions of parts of God's building have been reproduced, thus greatly enlarging it
Christ Himself is the foundation of this enlarged building, as well as the cornerstone and the topstone to complete the building
His Gospel is unique among the four Gospels, and Revelation, his last book, is the conclusion of the New Testament and of the entire Bible
In the beginning of Scripture there is a tree called the tree of life, and at the end of Scripture there is a city, a building
The end result of the life mentioned in John's Gospel is found in the book of Revelation-that is, the building, the city
In the center of this building is the tree of life, growing in the flow of the living water, to nourish and supply the entire city
Came His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and entering into us as the Spirit, and we were regenerated
The tabernacle of the first stage, the Lord Jesus, will have increased to a tabernacle including millions of persons!
In that glorious day, Christ, who was the tabernacle in the first stage, will be the very center of the tabernacle in the second stage
Since Christ is the center in the New Jerusalem, there is no need of the sun or moon or any other kind of light in the city
The original one grain is included in the many grains, and the many grains have been blended together into one loaf
In order to realize this oneness we must learn how to enjoy Christ as our life, rather than just understand the doctrine concerning Him
In the spirit we are a part of Christ, because in the spirit we have been regenerated by Christ and with Christ
Christ was the one grain, and all who have been regenerated of the Spirit have become the many grains of Christ
The kind of love manifested among some Christians is not a love for the Body of Christ, for it is not a love which comes out of Christ
Sometimes we need a little rest but if we try to rest very long without meeting together we deeply sense our need of meeting with the saints
In this way, day by day, Christ will grow in us, and we will be transformed from Adam's nature into Christ's nature
All of us together with Christ will be one in the Spirit, and this will be the real building of God, the real mingling of God with us
It is only realized by taking Christ as our life, living by Him, abiding in Him, and allowing Him to abide in us as the Spirit
Most Christians know that the Gospel of John speaks of the matter of life, but how many have seen the building revealed in this Gospel?
We can do nothing but learn how to live by Christ, taking Him as our life, and seeking to help others live by this life
They had all the gifts; they paid too much attention to the gifts and overused the gifts; therefore there were divisions
Let us take for example two local churches: in one church, the brothers seek to go on in the way of the grains and the branches
By regeneration another source of life, Christ Himself as the Life-giving Spirit, has come to live in our spirit
As we thus abide in Him, we sense the need for the church life, and as we continue abiding, we will have the church life in a proper way
Most Christians know that Christ came that we may have life abundantly, but very few realize the purpose for which He became our life
The first stage is the individual Christ, whereas the last stage is Christ enlarged in millions of His believers
Corinthians 14:12 says, 'So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church'
John's ministry was far more spiritual than the condition of those churches; yet he did not set up his ministry as a lampstand
We must be aware of the dangerous tendency for any local church to become a work, kept in the hands of some gifted person
Much the Lord may use a gifted person, however great his ministry may be, the local church must not become his work
In the New Testament there are the titles, the 'church of God' , the 'church of Christ' , and the 'church of the saints'
Look at the situation even from the time of the Reformation: four or five hundred years have passed, and it is still basically the same
If one gifted brother comes to build a local church and a second gifted brother comes to build up the same church there will be no division
Although a gifted brother may sometimes not speak openly in a way of ministry, yet he still may quietly maneuver behind the scenes
We all must realize that as members of the Body of Christ we must care for two things: first we need growth in life
Most Christians feel that since they have a good pastor with several competent assistants, they need do nothing
It is by such growth that the building of the church exists, and it is in such a way that we will have the real New Testament church
If you say that you do not know how to function or that you cannot function, it is possibly due to the fact that you have not grown
If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire'
On one hand we must learn to function, but on the other hand we must learn to discern the materials we use in functioning
Gold speaks of the nature of God, silver of the redemptive work of Christ, and precious stones of the work of the Holy Spirit
An example of the way we can damage the church rather than build it up is in the way we conduct ourselves daily
Whenever we begin to speak, we must exercise care that the words which proceed out of our mouth may build up the church
We may protest that we have never done anything to damage the church life; yet we may have killed people with our gossiping tongue
If you have experienced the real church life, you are already aware of how much the enemy utilizes the gossipers
Let us forget ourselves, our personal spirituality, and our personal victory; let us just care for the building
Pay full attention to the building; forget your personal problems; bring your problems to the Body, and the Body will swallow them up
If we have a critical attitude or participate in gossiping, we spread the element of death and thus destroy the church life
There was a little tent with an altar; then came the tabernacle with the brass altar, and afterward the temple with a larger altar
Now we have seen the order in the New Testament: Christ came to be the tabernacle, and His intention was that the tabernacle be enlarged
It is for this purpose that He is life to us, and it is for this purpose He has given the church many gifted persons with gifts
Eventually, in the fullness of time, the New Jerusalem will come as the ultimate manifestation of God's building
Whatever we are, whatever we do, and wherever we go, we will be completely for this vision, for God's building
There are many lessons to learn in this matter of building; yet, praise the Lord, we will also experience many blessings
The Old Testament clearly reveals how God called out the children of Israel and put them together as a corporate body
Old Testament history shows how, in a sense, the Israelites did eventually become the expression and representation of God on the earth
The end of the Scriptures clearly reveals that there will eventually be an enlarged corporate body called the New Jerusalem
Both the Old and New Testaments reveal that all the redeemed people of God will eventually become God's dwelling-place
In the New Testament there are several passages which clearly reveal that the redeemed people of this age are the dwelling-place of God
In the history of both the Old and New Testaments all the redeemed people of God are also God's Bride, God's counterpart
Basically, a dispensation does not mean a certain age or period of time, but the way in which God deals with people
From the first coming of Christ to His second coming is the dispensation of grace and also the age of the church
Finally, the fourth dispensation is from the second coming of Christ to the end of the millennium, a period of one thousand years
The vital question is, What has God been doing and what has He been seeking to achieve in all these dispensations?
The building will be completed, however, by the end of the millennium, when all four dispensations will have passed
It is not till chapter 21 that we see a new heaven and a new earth with the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of God's building
During the millennium, the holy city is still not fully completed, but at the end of the kingdom age it is fully consummated
The second dispensation includes Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Phinehas, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and Malachi
God has perfected a certain number of saints in each age, and He is still perfecting a large number of saints in this dispensation
We must note that the saints of whom the New Jerusalem is composed are kings and priests, kings to rule the nations and priests to serve God
We know that the tree of life symbolizes Christ, but what are the fruits and what are the leaves of this tree?
We can illustrate this by pointing out that the moon does shine in the daytime, although it can barely be seen
Because God is always brightly shining in the holy city, there is no need of the sun or the moon; so there will be no night there
When we do not have God in Christ, we need many other things; but if we have God in Christ, we need nothing more
That tabernacle was composed of the dwellers, and there were no dwellers in that tabernacle except those who composed it-God and man
Some Christians are told that just as long as they believe in the Lord Jesus, someday they will go to the New Jerusalem
The Lord Jesus has ascended into heaven and has been there for nearly two thousand years; yet the New Jerusalem has not yet appeared
Perhaps you have been saved for ten years, but have you been fully transformed yet from a piece of clay to a precious stone?
The Apostle Paul clearly tells us that we must be careful to build up the building of God with gold, silver and precious stones
The main point is that we all must be worked upon, transformed, and built up together; then there will be the new city
Following His initial work of creation, God has continued to work through many generations to achieve His ultimate building
Genesis 1 and 2 record God's creation work, but from Genesis 3 to the end of the Scriptures God is continually working for His building
Let us recall the vital meaning of God's building: it is that God is building Himself into man and building man into Himself
The Scriptures mainly reveal that God's whole work since creation has been to mingle Himself and man together as one
When the Word of God God Himself became incarnated as a man this was an expression of the living tabernacle a real mingling of God with man
At the time of incarnation and since that time, something has happened on this earth: God has mingled Himself with man
By Christ's incarnation, God was brought into man; and by His death, resurrection and ascension, man has been brought into God
While Jesus was on this earth, He was a man with God in Him; today, while Jesus is in heaven, He is the very God with man in Him
We immediately begin the work of edification-that is, we bring people into God by the cross and the resurrection of Christ
When this reproduction work is fully completed and composed together, the result is the enlarged tabernacle, the New Jerusalem
Bible students speak of many dispensations, telling how God works in one age in a certain way and in another age in another way
Our second major point is that this ultimate consummation of God's work is not only a tent, a tabernacle, but also a city
Even so, in the church life there must be the real building, not just a group of wonderful believers gathered together
Our first need is to be transformed into precious material; then we must be built up with others as a building
Adam did not find his counterpart in any of the other living creatures, for none possessed a life which matched his own
Everything is wonderful on the wedding day, but afterwards the bride must become the wife, and that is more serious
Even in our personal lives, when we admit the headship of Christ and subject ourselves to Him, He brings us into light
When God in Christ is on the throne in a local church, when He is exercising His authority and shining, that church becomes a lampstand
If anything flows out of God, it must be something of God Himself; hence, this flow is God Himself, flowing out as life
In the church, when God is allowed to exercise His headship in Christ and thus shine as the light, He spontaneously flows out to us as life
In the church, whenever there is the flow of life, the complete supply of God as our spiritual food will come to us in that flow
Let us check our own experience: if we do not have the flow of life and the supply of life, there is no way; we do not know how to go on
From the throne, the river of life flows downward in the midst of the street until it reaches all twelve gates of the city
Whenever we have the flow within us it will always bring us the way and when we follow the way the street will bring us to the throne of God
At least to some extent we must experience these points which we are covering; otherwise, it is rather difficult to understand them
In the last chapter we have covered thirteen points concerning the real meaning of the ultimate manifestation of God
In the city there are three gates on each of its four sides, covering every direction: north, south, east, and west
After Christ's work, the Holy Spirit came as the woman to enlighten us, seeking within our hearts to bring us back
Some Christians are deeply in the process of transformation day by day, but with others the process stopped at regeneration
With some the work of transformation is taking place now, but by this evening or at least by tomorrow it will be frustrated
Sometimes we would even tell the Lord that we want to give it all up, we do not care whether we are transformed
Our sixteenth point is that once we go through the pearl gate, we immediately step onto the golden street in the city
We must realize the work of regeneration in our experience and day by day experience the hurt of the oyster, the work of the cross in us
By the secretion of the resurrection life, we will experience a continuing on in the golden street, the divine nature
In the midst of this street we will experience the flow of life, and in this flow we will enjoy the supply of life, the spiritual food
In a city there may be two streets which are quite alike, but this street is the one street, which means that there is only one flow
The problem is that although the inward flow is one and we are all in that one flow, we care for too many outward things
When we fellowship together about Christ, there is a wonderful flow; but when we talk about the denominations, everyone's face becomes long
Eventually, in the New Jerusalem, we will all be in the same flow, in the one street, and we will all partake of the same food
When we are in the flow of life enjoying the supply of life and walking in the way of life spontaneously we have fellowship one with another
The throne represents authority, and the proper fellowship in life is always related to the authority of the throne
Moses represented the kingship in the building of the tabernacle, and Aaron, the high priest, represented the priesthood
Following the seventy years of captivity, in the recovery of the building, there was Zerubbabel, the governor, and Joshua, the high priest
The building of the church is accomplished only by these two offices-the authority and the fellowship, the kingship and the priesthood
In the church the authority of the headship must be exercised among all the members that we may have order without any confusion
Spontaneously, all the materials will be put together and the reality of the building will be realized and accomplished
The wall of the holy city is a real separation: everything within this wall is holy, and everything without is common
The more a local church is in the likeness of God, the more it is separated from the world and everything common
If the life of God flows within us, we will be in His very likeness, and His likeness will be the separating power of the church
It is one hundred forty-four cubits high, that is, twelve times twelve, which signifies completion in completion
Some people accuse us of having such a high wall and giving the appearance of being sectarian; yet we must have such a high wall
We must have a wall one hundred and forty-four cubits high to keep out everything common, and this wall must be built with precious stones
We may easily produce a large quantity of clay bricks overnight, but in one month's time we can hardly acquire one piece of precious stone
Today we are pieces of clay hence we must be transformed into pieces of jasper and then built up to a height of one hundred fortyfour cubits
The twenty-third point is that the measurement of the wall is 'according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel'
The New Jerusalem is a city which is absolutely saturated and mingled with God; therefore it is absolutely holy
In anything we do, if we have some experience of God in Christ being mingled with us, we experience holiness in that very thing
The church must be without spot, without any wound or damage from the enemy, and the church must be without wrinkles due to oldness
Our twenty-sixth point is that in this city there is no need of any man-made light or even of any natural light such as the sun
We have previously indicated that day and night will continue in the new earth, for there is still the sun and the moon
Because God enlightens the holy city, neither the sun nor the moon is needed; thus there is no night within the city
Today, in the church life, we are still physically in the old creation; thus there is always a certain period when we are tired
With the current of Satan there is a city called the Great Babylon , and with the current of God there is the holy city, New Jerusalem
Even so, if the church is to be adequately built up today, there must always be a judgment upon all worldliness
The measurement of the city is equal in three dimensions, each dimension being twelve times one thousand furlongs
Regarding the serpent, the real symbol of Satan, nothing is straight or square; every part of him is cunning and crooked
Many times brothers in the Lord have come to us and to other Christian workers to try to teach us to be a serpent
During His last week on earth, the Lord Jesus was confronted by the elders and Pharisees, the chiefs of the Jewish people
These men reasoned among themselves, saying, 'If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?
Strictly speaking, the glory of God is the very content of the city, for the city is completely filled with His glory
It is exceedingly difficult to understand electricity; we cannot isolate a little of it and take it into our hands for study
The entire city of the New Jerusalem is a mingling of man with God-this is why the whole city is represented by the number twelve
The church must begin with the divine nature being added to the human nature; then each person must be mingled with God
We must realize that at the time of the Ephesian letter some things were still not fulfilled; hence prophecy was required
On the other hand all the apostles abide forever for on the twelve foundations of the city are the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb
The apostles signify that this new city, which is the building of God and the testimony of Jesus, is not of man, but of God
If there is any human element, sooner or later that will be a weak point and will be heavily attacked by the enemy
Let us consider now a second instance in which the second brother is not so lovable; let us suppose he is a poor and dirty beggar
These twelve layers of precious stones as the foundation appear as a rainbow, eternally declaring God's faithfulness
A precious stone, however, is a compound of several elements which have been pressed together under intense heat
Pearl, as we have seen, clearly signifies regeneration; thus it constitutes the entrance, the gates, to the city
We all appreciate Peter, John and the other disciples, but most of us little realize how much pressure they experienced
All the members of Christ's Body must be transformed that God may have the foundation and the wall of His city
The Lord Jesus is too great and wonderful: He needs many different persons to express Himself; one individual Christian is not sufficient
We may ask, then, since God and Christ are the temple, are They the Dwellers within the city or are They the dwelling place?
On one hand They are the temple in which we dwell, and on the other hand They are also the Dwellers within the city
If we would serve God and Christ in the church, we must be surrounded by God and Christ, and covered by God and Christ
Since the city is foursquare and equal in three dimensions, the whole city is not just the temple, but the holiest of all
Later, the temple of Solomon was built in the same pattern as the tabernacle, with the dimensions all enlarged
Finally, the New Jerusalem, as the ultimate stage of God's building, has just one part: everything is swallowed up by the holiest of holies
God's name written on our forehead proves and even declares that we belong to God and that we are one with God
Perhaps the best illustration is that of a little babe: nothing can satisfy a little child like its mother's face
All the nations will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem, for this city will be the unique, universal lampstand
In conclusion, we must remember that this ultimate consummation of God's building is a full picture of today's church life
O Lord Jesus, Thy redeemed ones Are Thy Body and Thy Bride; As Thy fulness, Thine expression, In her Thou art glorified
Thou, her all in all forever, She Thy riches doth declare; Thou dost fully saturate her And Thy glory with her share
God with man completely blended, Mystery of godliness, God in glory, full, resplendent, Man, His dwelling, doth express
Tis a living composition Of the saints He hath transformed; As the pearls and stones most precious, To His image they're conformed
From the throne of God, its center, Flows the living water free; Christ the tree of life doth flourish, Bearing fruit abundantly
Tis th' eternal golden lampstand, Holding Christ, the lamp of light; God in Christ, the light of glory, In the Spirit shineth bright!
Tis the ultimate expression- Man in God and God in man; 'Tis their mutual habitation, Goal of God's eternal plan
