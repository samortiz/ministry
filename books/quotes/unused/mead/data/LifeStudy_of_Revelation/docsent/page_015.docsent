   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FOUR THE TRIUNE GOD IN REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The whole Bible is the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the book of Revelation we have the ultimate and complete revelation of who God is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all are familiar with the term the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a great matter in God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Throughout the centuries, however, most Christians have not fully realized the meaning of the term the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the book of Revelation, the book which reveals things in an ultimate way, we see something deeper, higher, richer, and sweeter concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that in Revelation, the revelation of Christ and the testimony of Jesus are ultimate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message, we need to see that here the revelation of the Triune God is also ultimate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 1:4 and 5 say, Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He who is and who was, and who is coming is God the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The seven Spirits who are before God s throne are the operating Spirit of God, God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus Christ, who is to God the faithful Witness, to the church the Firstborn of the dead, and to the world the Ruler of the kings of the earth, is God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As God the eternal Father, He was in the past, He is in the present, and He is coming in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As God the Spirit, He is the sevenfold, intensified Spirit for God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As God the Son, He is the Witness, the testimony, the expression of God; the Firstborn of the dead for the church, the new creation; and the Ruler of the kings of the earth for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From such a Triune God, grace and peace are imparted into the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I. THE ALMIGHTY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The book of Revelation tells us that God is the Almighty God 1:8; 19:6, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Hebrew language, the title God means the mighty One, the One who is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in Revelation we see that God is not only mighty, but Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is powerful in every way, in every aspect, in everything, and with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s title means that He is the Almighty One.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. The Lord</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This Almighty One is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being the Lord means that He is the owner of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may say that He is the landlord of the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the Ruler, the authority, in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What we or others say means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But what God says means everything because He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When He says, Yes, it means yes, and when He says, No, it means no. God is not only the Lord, the owner, and the authority; He is also the Master.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The whole universe, including the angels and all human beings, is under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have a Master who possesses us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before I was saved, I did not know to whom I belonged.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But now I can shout, God is my Master, the One who possesses me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah, He is my Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>B. The Alpha and the Omega</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 1:8 says that the Lord God is the Alpha and the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The eternal and Almighty God is the Alpha, the beginning for the origination, and the Omega, the ending for the completion of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the book of Genesis He was the Alpha, and now in the book of Revelation He is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever He has originated He will complete.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Governmentally, He continues His universal operation which He originated from eternity and will bring to completion 21:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>C. Who Is, Who Was, and Who Is Coming</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is also the One who is, who was, and who is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the meaning of the name Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Hebrew, Jehovah means, I am that I am.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His being the I Am signifies that He is the One who exists from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His title, I Am, not only indicates that He exists but that, in a positive sense, He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is life, light, and every other positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you need life?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do you want light?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do you desire holiness?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God exists from eternity to eternity and He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As we have seen, our God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His being triune means that He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is impossible for us to understand the Triune God thoroughly, for the divine Trinity far surpasses our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not exercise your mentality so much.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rather, exercise your spirit to realize and experience the Triune God as the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
