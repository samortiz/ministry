<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE TWO CORPORATE MEN</h1><p>We have seen that one cannot separate Christ from truth or from the doctrines. Nor can He be isolated from the Christian faith. What then is the relationship Christ has with us human beings?</p><h2 class="head1">THREE IMPORTANT CONCEPTS</h2><p>Before we come to look at the relationship Christ has with man, we have to investigate the law of heredity a little. A life which bears a particular trait or feature in its nature may transmit that same feature to the next generation. Looking at it another way, we can find the temperament and idiosyncrasies of the father in a child. But whatever is acquired by learning is not hereditary. For example, a blacksmith may acquire strong and husky arms through his training, but his children's arms may remain small and thin. Whatever is acquired after birth cannot be transmitted to the next generation. This is a fact and phenomenon recognized by biological science.</p><p>There is a very important concept in the Bible known as the unity of men. According to the Bible, apart from our individual existence, the whole world, regardless of how many millions of people there are, can be considered as being composed of two men. These two men are corporate, embracing millions of people. The whole of humanity is included in these two men. They are two juristic persons. Due to this reckoning in the Bible, the man Jesus could die for all of us and bear all of our sins. Now all of us can receive life through Him.</p><p>A student in biology can tell us that there is an amazing concept in biology which is quite contrary to ours: a son's life is considered to be older than that of the father, and a grandson's life is much older than that of his grandfather. This is perfectly true. The son inherits the father's life and continues it. Hence, the son's life is older than that of his father. Your life and mine are naturally older than that of Adam, for his ended at the age of a little over nine hundred years. But you and I are still living and will go on living.</p><p>These are three important concepts we have to consider when we look at the relationship between Christ and man: the heredity of human life, the unity of men, and the continuation of human life.</p><h2 class="head1">A HUGE CORPORATE MAN</h2><p>Man is not only an individual, existing by himself, responsible only for his own conduct and behavior. He also belongs to a corporate man. Every person is a part of a huge life. He is a continuation, and he is continuing this huge life. The first man in this corporate man had a life that embraced all other human life; his conduct became that of everyone that follows, and his traits are transmitted to all successive generations; they all bear the same features as he did.</p><p>This is a vast subject to be covered. But we have to understand these concepts before we can see the salvation of God and the relationship of Christ with man.</p><h2 class="head1">MELCHISEDEC AND ABRAHAM</h2><p>Now we can turn to chapter seven of the book of Hebrews. Let us first read verses 1 through 10: "For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace; being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually. And consider how great this one was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the choice spoils. And they of the sons of Levi, who received the priestly service, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham. But he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises. But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. And here men, who die, receive tithes; but there, one of whom it is testified that he lives. And, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, he who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes, for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him."</p><p>In this passage, the writer of the book told the Hebrews that the priesthood that they depended on came from the lineage of Levi. The Christ that we believe in, however, did not come from the Levites. Rather, He is of the lineage of Melchisedec (who also was a priest).</p><h2 class="head1">MELCHISEDEC GREATER THAN LEVI</h2><p>Which one is greater, Levi or Melchisedec? The answer is, of course, Melchisedec. But why? Here the writer brought in Abraham. Abraham offered up one tenth of what he acquired to Melchisedec as a gift. Not only did Melchisedec accept it, but he blessed Abraham as well. Therefore, beyond dispute, Melchisedec is greater than Abraham.</p><p>But what does that have to do with Levi? The link is in the fact that Levi "was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him." Although Levi was born after another hundred or so years, according to the principle of unity, Levi offered up one tenth to Melchisedec when he was inside Abraham. On that same day, he was blessed by Melchisedec within Abraham. For this reason Melchisedec is greater than Levi.</p><p>Our faith has a central concept: whatever a man does or however he acts affects his future generations. If our ancestors have done such and such, so have we. It does not matter whether or not we were born yet, because we did the same while we were in them.</p>
