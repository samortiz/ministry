<P>John 10:28 says, "They shall by no means perish forever." This means that those believers who commit sins and do not repent will temporarily suffer what the unbelievers will suffer. They will be released when the official criminals arrive. The Catholic purgatory begins with a person's death. Moreover, they have the teaching of the so-called release of the soul from suffering. Reference to this heresy should not be made to oppose the matter that Christians will be punished. We can only use the Bible to prove that the punishment is at the judgment seat. Sin in a Gentile is sin; sin in a believer also is sin.</P><P>Mr. Govett translated Raca as "useless"; others, as "stupid" or "good-for-nothing." Some say that the word Moreh is Syriac and that a more proper translation is "rebel." According to the context, it is more serious to call one's brother "Raca" than to be angry with one's brother. While to be angry is merely within one's heart, to call others "Raca" involves the using of one's mouth. The punishment for one who calls his brother "Moreh" is that he will be liable to the Gehenna of fire. We may thus see that the meaning of Moreh is stronger than that of Raca. Raca means "stupid," whereas Moreh, as Mr. Pember said, means "rebel." "The Gehenna of fire" is mentioned here. This indicates that Christians cannot escape judgment. If this referred to unbelievers, would they go to hell simply because they scold a person for being stupid?</P><P>Verse 23:"Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you..." "Therefore" means "for this reason." Here it does not say "offering your sacrifice" but "offering your gift." The offering of a sacrifice is for dealing with sin, whereas the offering of a gift is to give something to God and has nothing to do with sin. "Has something against you" indicates that you have done something wrong.</P><P>Verse 24:"Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift." The requirement in this verse is many times higher than that in the Old Testament. Not only the gift and the person should be right, but also the spiritual condition should be right. When the Lord spoke these words, the ceremonial law had not been abolished. "Offer your gift" and "before the altar" were the background at that time.</P><P>Verse 25:"Opponent at law" in Greek means "plaintiff"; "opponent" implies enmity. "On the way" means that you have not reached the end of the way and have not arrived before the judge. Therefore, be well disposed quickly toward your opponent for the following three reasons: (1) He may die. If he dies, there is no possibility for reconciliation. (2) You may die. Once you die, there is also no possibility for reconciliation. (3) The Lord may come back. Once the Lord comes back, there is no possibility for reconciliation. If you mistreat someone and do not deal with it properly, even the sound of his sighing can prevent your prayer from reaching God. The voice of Abel caused Cain to be troubled.</P><P>"The judge" refers to the Lord; "the officer" refers to the angel. The "prison" is a place where there is no freedom and a place of darkness as well. One who is put into prison cannot live glorious days; he cannot be like those who follow the Lamb wherever He may go. However, since this is the prison, this is not forever. We may thus see that there is still the possibility for Christians to be put in the Gehenna of fire in the future.</P><P>Verse 26:"You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans." Since the debt has to be paid back sooner or later, why not pay it back today? Here, "come out" will take place in the coming age, that is, the age of the millennial kingdom. This refers to the forgiveness in the coming age.</P><P>Verses 27-32:This section is on adultery. In verse 28, " looks" indicates that it is intentional; "a woman" refers to another's wife. What is condemned by Christ is not any sudden thought put into us by Satan or any sudden evil thought that came up in our mind. Rather, what is condemned is that after seeing, we look with intention. Any action that our will disagrees with is not counted as a sin. However, the action of our will after we surrender to temptation is a sin.</P><P>The Lord teaches us here that we must guard our heart. Otherwise, we would surely commit adultery if it were not for reasons of ethics, environment, or position. It is written in Proverbs, "He that hath no rule over his own spirit / is like a city that is broken down, and without walls" (25:28). A city without walls is a place where the enemy can go in and out freely.</P><P>Verse 29:Unbelievers still have to go to hell even if they pluck out their eyes. Therefore, this word here is not spoken to unbelievers but to Christians.</P><P>Verse 30:Both the cutting off of the hand in this verse and the plucking out of the eye in the preceding verse are not to be taken literally. Rather, what is meant here is to cut off the opportunities for sinning. (Peter once cut off someone's ear with his hand, but his hand was not cut off.) This means that we should pay any price to cut off the opportunities for sinning.</P><P>Verses 31-32:Here the Lord puts the matter of divorce altogether in a new position. The Lord acknowledges that husband and wife are one body. Before this one body is damaged, nothing can destroy this oneness. Adultery destroys oneness. The certificate of divorce is only a recognition that the oneness has been destroyed. Unless the divorce is due to adultery, the oneness still exists before God. If the wife marries someone else, that means the husband causes her to destroy the oneness. He also causes the man who marries her to be guilty of destroying the oneness. Furthermore, if the husband himself marries another woman, he also commits adultery.</P>
