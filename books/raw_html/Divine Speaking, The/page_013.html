        <h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF THE LIFE-STUDIES</h2>
<p>Now let us come to the divine speaking with the Life-studies. In the past some have had the thought that we use the Life-studies in our meetings to replace the Bible. But we do not replace the Bible by anything, even by using the Life-studies. Rather, I must say honestly, and you have to admit the fact, no book ushers us into the Bible as the Life-studies do. Anyone can prove and can testify how much we love the Bible, how much we pay our attention to the Bible, and how much we get ourselves into the Bible through the study of the Life-studies.</p>
<p>So the Life-studies are not to replace the Bible, but to open the Bible and to expound the Bible and to release all the unsearchable riches in the Bible. Quite a few in the past came to me to express how the Life-studies opened the Bible and helped them to know the Bible. After I got saved at close to twenty years of age, I began to study the New Testament. I got stuck on the first page. I wondered, &ldquo;Who is Abraham?&rdquo; I got a lexicon which told me that Abraham was the father of Isaac. Then when I looked up Isaac it just said that Isaac was the son of Abraham. After that, whenever I came back to Matthew I just skipped the first seventeen verses. I would not read that portion on the genealogy of Christ. There were too many names I did not know how to pronounce. It seemed impossible for me to understand, and I thought to myself, &ldquo;Probably there&rsquo;s no one on this earth who knows this portion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But today if you have trouble with the first seventeen verses of Matthew chapter one, you can go to the Life-study of Matthew. There are seven messages on the genealogy of Christ. Those messages open up this portion and expound its full significance to you. They also release all the riches. In the summer of 1936 I was able to write an article which was published as a book in Chinese entitled <em>The Gleanings of the Genealogy of Christ.</em> The messages I gave in the <em>Life-study of Matthew</em> on chapter one were all based upon that article. Now that portion is fully opened and expounded and all the riches are released now in black and white. This is not to replace Matthew 1; this is to open up that difficult section of the Word with a full exposition and with a rich presentation of all its unsearchable riches. This is the use of the Life-studies.</p>
<p>For the six chapters of Ephesians we put out ninety-seven Life-study messages. Ephesians contains a lot of deep, profound, spiritual terminology. How could you understand what is the glory of God&rsquo;s inheritance in the saints? And what is glory? It is difficult. I have been spending years to study the text, to study the Greek text, to study some expositions, and to study to know the Bible by experience. Through many years of study and observation I surely got an accumulation.</p>
<p>The Bible has been in the hands of Christians for over nineteen centuries. A number of great scholars have studied and expounded this book. Following the lead of Brother Watchman Nee, some of us have read and become familiar with all the great writers&rsquo; masterpieces. The Life-study messages are now just the cream of the milk produced in nineteen centuries. I presented them in a very simple way and in very plain English.</p>
<p>All of my writings have been polished by the American brothers and sisters because English is not my native tongue. Sometimes in their polishing they added in some deeper words. When I made the final review, I always took away all the deeper words added by them. Whether the word is deep or shallow, as long as it conveys the thought to people, that is good enough. I like for people to be able to read my writings without a dictionary. Right away they can understand what the black and white says. Then the Holy Spirit has a way to work within them. If you use language that is too deep or too profound, their mind might be fully occupied just with the language. This leaves no capacity in their mind to understand the spiritual denotations or the spiritual significances. Such a thing is absolutely wrong. The language in the Gospel of John is so simple: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo;; &ldquo;I am the light of the world&rdquo;; &ldquo;I am the bread of life.&rdquo; Probably even some in kindergarten today could read John. The denotation, the significance, is very profound, but the language does not bother people. The language does not occupy people&rsquo;s mentality. This is the way we have taken with the Life-studies. They are written in a very simple and plain way with the intention to open the Bible.</p>
<p>I believe if you do have a heart to read any book of the New Testament with the help of the Life-studies, right away that book would be opened to you. This is what the Lord Jesus did in Luke 24. Firstly, He opened the Scriptures (v. 32), then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures (v. 45). The Scriptures were altogether closed to the disciples. In the Pentateuch, in the Psalms, and in the Prophets there are many things concerning Christ, but none of the disciples saw anything. Why was this? It was because the Scriptures were not opened to them and their spiritual understanding was not opened. So the Lord Jesus came to the two disciples going down to Emmaus. They saw Him, but they did not recognize Him until they sat to eat with Him. Once their eyes were opened, Jesus disappeared from their sight. They said to one another, &ldquo;Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening to us the Scriptures?&rdquo; (v. 32). Then they turned to go back to Jerusalem. There the Lord Jesus appeared to them again and opened their understanding to realize what is mentioned in the law of Moses, in the Psalms, and in the Prophets concerning Christ. The purpose of the Life-studies is just to open up the Bible.</p>
<p>Another example of the opening of the Bible is found in Acts 8. As Philip the evangelist was traveling, the Spirit told him to go and join the chariot of an Ethiopian eunuch. The eunuch was reading the passage of Scripture in Isaiah 53. When Philip asked him, whether he understood what he read, the eunuch answered, &ldquo;How can I unless someone guides me?&rdquo; So Philip explained to him the significance of what was spoken in Isaiah, that Jesus Christ as the Lamb was slaughtered for our sins. That was a real gospel. Right away the eunuch believed and was baptized. Without the help of such a guide when you open up some of the books of the New Testament, it is really hard for you to understand.</p>
<p>Readers of the New Testament have found at least fifty points that are very difficult for people to understand. In the Life-studies I solved each one of these major problems. For instance, after Jesus was buried in the tomb, He went to the spirits in prison. What was that? There are many different explanations, but after much study, I came to a conclusion and wrote an adequate note on this matter (1 Peter 3:19 and note 19<sup>3</sup>). When you come to any book in the New Testament with the help of the Life-study, you will have no problem with the difficult points.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Life-study is to minister life. This is why I call it a Life-study. In history this term has never been used. No one has ever called their study of the New Testament a Life-study. Actually it is a study that concerns life only. These Life-studies are not intended to pass on mere knowledge to you. There is some amount of knowledge, but I purposely limited it. The main purpose is to minister life. I have received many letters expressing appreciation for the Life-studies. These letters testified that every page and every paragraph supplied life. Many good books are just like a deep mine; you need to read through eight pages before you get one diamond. But the Life-studies have a diamond within the first half of a page. It seems I am boasting. Actually I am not boasting; I am speaking the fact.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
