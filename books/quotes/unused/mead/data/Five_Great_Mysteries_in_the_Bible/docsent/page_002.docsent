   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY OF THE UNIVERSE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1; Rom 1:20; Psa 19:1-3; 8:1-4; Heb 1:3; Isa 40:22; Job 26:7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Praise the Lord that we brothers and sisters who are scattered in the United States and Canada can have a happy reunion here today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are truly joyful to see the faces of so many dear ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the Lord has given me a heavy burden, and I have been considering what to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE MYSTERIES BEING MANY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day a few months ago, I had the inner sense that the universe is a story of mysteries, and the Bible is also a record of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then I considered: According to my general knowledge and the knowledge which I have obtained from reading the Bible, how many mysteries are there in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, how many mysteries are there in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is strange that the word mystery is not found in the Old Testament; however, it is used again and again in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can probably find ten to twenty different mysteries in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, Matthew 13 speaks about the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the universe, even a mosquito or a bee is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only the animals are mysteries, but the plants also are mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consider this: Two seeds may look exactly the same, yet after they are sown, one bears white flowers and the other bears yellow flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I planted a number of "bird of paradise" plants in my yard.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When one day they bloomed, I was shocked.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been observing the "bird of paradise" flowers for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The blooms are golden yellow and blue, with a little white, and the leaves are green.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we asked even the best Chinese artist to paint with the best colors, he still could not paint something so beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No biologist can tell us why the "bird of paradise" flowers are golden yellow and blue.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our elderly Brother Weigh, who graduated with a biology major from the Chin-ning University in Nanching, was an expert in raising bees.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I met him for the first time, we spoke about bees.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said, "Brother Lee, bees are very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some of them are leaders, some are queens, some are in groups, some are guards, and some are night-watchers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is really marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are more submissive than the Chinese wives; some know how to exercise their headship in a way that is superior even to the way we Christians exercise our headship."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was very glad to learn that even the little bee is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE FIVE GREAT MYSTERIES IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have no intention to speak about the mystery of plants or animals; my intention is to speak about the five great mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Bees are a mystery, but they are a small mystery, not a great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then what are the great mysteries?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, the heavens and the earth are the first great mystery, which is also according to the sequence of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first two items listed in the record of God's creation are first the heavens and second the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How mysterious are the heavens and the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you know how big heaven is?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>More than twenty years ago when I first came to the United States to work for the Lord, I lived in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An observatory there published a report, saying that the sun we see and the nine great planets form one solar system; two hundred forty million solar systems constitute one galaxy; and forty billion galaxies constitute the entire system of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Try to calculate this!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then in 1975 there was a report of a new discovery, saying that one hundred billion galaxies constitute the entire system of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How many can you count?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The astronomers claim that their study was very thorough, but I do not believe so.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Twenty years ago they said forty billion galaxies form the universe, then after twenty years the number was increased from forty billion to one hundred billion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am afraid that after another twenty years the number will go up to two hundred billion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The universe is too mysterious; its vastness is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are mainly five great mysteries in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first great mystery is the universe, and the second is man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Zechariah 12:1 says, "Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You should not consider man to be so small.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man is as great as the heavens and the earth, because this verse, after referring to the heavens and the earth, immediately mentions man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even the Chinese sages considered heaven, earth, and man as three powers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every one of us is important; we are all very great persons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man's greatness is not like the greatness of the universe that lies in its vastness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Man is great in that there is a mystery in him, a mystery which is of three layers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first layer is the mystery of the body, man's outward part; the second layer is the mystery of the human soul, man's inward part; and the third layer is the mystery of the spirit, man's innermost part.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The third great mystery in the Bible is God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God is too mysterious!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fourth great mystery is Christ, and the fifth is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The universe, man, God, Christ, and the church are the five great mysteries shown to us in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are humans standing on the earth with the heaven above us; we have God; we are Christians, and we are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have a share in heaven and earth, in humanity, in God, in Christ, and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hallelujah, we have a share in each of the five great mysteries!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible is a written explanation of these five great mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should never think that we are already clear about all these things because we have been Christians for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have been a Christian for more than half a century and have also read and worn out several Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I feel, however, that I still do not know these five great mysteries in an adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible is a book of mysteries that records in particular the Christian mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These five great mysteries, which are universal facts, require a book of explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The universe is a story of mystery, and the Bible is its explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Actually, the explanation of this mystery is found also in the universe itself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have the universe and the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What is the story of heaven and earth?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What is the story of man?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What is the story of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>And what is the story of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All these matters are clearly spoken of in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I have not delved into many books, but the one book I have read the most is the Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Bible is the unique book, the book of books.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Blessed are those who diligently study the Bible!</S>
