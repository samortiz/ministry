   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING DESPERATE BEFORE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO WRESTLE WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person who is unwilling to submit to the Lord s shining cannot be helped by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may pray for him, speak to him, or fellowship with him, but time after time we will realize that his problem remains.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we fellowship with him, it seems as if he has received some help, but afterward he will remain in the same condition and still be reluctant to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one can help him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He himself must bear some responsibility to overcome his being slothful and stingy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At least he should be like Jacob, who wrestled with the Lord at the ford of the Jabbok Gen 32:22-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many of us realize that in our service, coordination, and spiritual life, we have come to a point where we cannot go further.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although outwardly speaking, nothing has gone wrong, there is no apparent dispute, and it seems as if nothing is amiss, yet inwardly we may be clear that we, like Jacob, have come to the ford of the Jabbok.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On that day Jacob made a determination to wrestle with God, but our problem is that we lack the resolve to wrestle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are slothful both in spirit and in feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this training there is nothing to offer that causes excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more one gains the Lord and touches the Lord s word inwardly, the more a killing element operates in him to put him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, this training is held not in spring but in winter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On our part, we need to be put to death again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps when some brothers go back to their localities after the training, they will not be able to speak a message or even open their mouths to pray in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because a problem still remains in them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The problem has always been there, but it was not exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through the training, however, the problem has been exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more a person s problem is exposed, the weaker he becomes until eventually he is not able to rise up inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This causes him to not be able to break through.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He cannot break through in the work, in the ministry of the word, in coordination, or in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the ford of the Jabbok.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to look to the Lord for His mercy that we, like Jacob, will become so desperate before the Lord that we will wrestle with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can discuss our weakness with the Lord, saying, Lord, even though I am not desperate, I should not be slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What should I do with my slothful attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we cannot rise up inwardly, we need to discuss this with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we approach the Lord in this way, we should not be too concerned about the price we need to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be concerned about the price is a big distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should simply tell the Lord that we want to solve our problem and discuss with Him what we should do about the slothfulness in our being and what we should do when our spirit cannot rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to pray to the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should never ignore our inward sense of condemnation, and we should never let a feeling of condemnation go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should accept every feeling of condemnation and not make excuses for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To excuse ourselves is to be loose with ourselves, to let ourselves go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Feeling condemned stops and restricts us, whereas excusing ourselves frees us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The extent to which we try to excuse away our inner sense of condemnation is the extent to which we miss out on grace, whereas the more we accept the condemnation, the more grace we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our condition before the Lord very much affects the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether the church of God will have a free way to advance depends on whether we can get through this crisis.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If our inward problem is resolved, the church of God will have a way to progress.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, I do not know how long the Lord will be delayed before the church has a way to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I implore all the brothers and sisters, especially the responsible ones in the churches, to receive this word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
