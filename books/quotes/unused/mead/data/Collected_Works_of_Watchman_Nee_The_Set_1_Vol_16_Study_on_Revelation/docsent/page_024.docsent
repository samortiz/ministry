   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Scene in Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>after the Church Is Raptured</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 7:9-17</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 7:9 through 17 is a description of the rapture of the church to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Who are these people?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although I dare not say definitely that they are the whole church, I do say that they are the majority of those who have been redeemed by God the majority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This includes those who are raptured first and those who are resurrected from the dead which constitute a large number , as well as a small number who are still living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No mention is made here of how the church is raptured; rather, we are given only an outline of the scene after the church has been raptured to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, these verses may be considered as a description of the scene of the entire church in the heavens after the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How does one know that what is spoken of here is the scene in heaven after the rapture of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reasons are as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 The number.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one could number the multitude v. 9 . There cannot be so many in the first rapture, so it must be the gathering of several raptures of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2 "Standing before the throne and before the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Revelation 4:2 says that "there was a throne set in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that those standing before the throne are already in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This word is recorded after the sixth seal and before the seventh seal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is an indication that there are four raptures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3 The word "tribulation" in Revelation 7:14 is the same as the word "tribulation" in John 16:33 KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, this "great multitude which no one could number" includes the persecuted ones and the martyrs throughout the past generations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Among them are also the believers who were resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The resurrected ones must be greater in number than those who are first raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 7:9 through 17 speaks of the situation that begins with the rapture the first rapture and continues until eternity the new heaven and new earth .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those "standing before the throne" must have been raptured; otherwise, how can they be standing in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verses 15 through 17 are a description of the scene in the new heaven and the new earth in Revelation 21:3-7.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This portion is not on the rapture specifically or exclusively; rather, it speaks only in a general way about the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither does it go into detail concerning the scene of the enjoyment in eternity; it is only briefly described.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not misunderstand, thinking that because the church is raptured to the heavens to enjoy the blessings in eternity, we can then assume that the whole church is raptured all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Remember that this portion does not say in detail how the rapture takes place; it presents only an outline of the raptured majority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are given a glimpse in advance of the scene of the rapture of the church in the heavens and the consummation in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we are shown only where they are, not how they got there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Revelation 7:9-13</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"After these things I saw, and behold, there was a great multitude which no one could number, out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes and palm branches in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God, saying, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanks and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"After these things..., standing before the throne and before the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the rapture begins here, this implies that there is a rapture before the opening of the seventh seal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These are the people redeemed by the Lord's blood throughout the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The positive reasons are as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>1 The number.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Revelation 7:9 reads "I saw, and behold, there was a great multitude which no one could number."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anything to do with the Israelites is usually numbered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Examples are: the twelve tribes, the seventy going down to Egypt, the number leaving Egypt, the numbers recorded in the book of Numbers, and the numbers at the time of David.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From generation to generation, the Israelites were numbered.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Israelites who are sealed are also numbered vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In regard to the church, although there are numbers, such as the twelve disciples, the seventy sent out by the Lord, the one hundred twenty who gathered together, the three thousand and the five thousand who were saved, and so forth, sometimes the Bible only says, "The Lord added together day by day those who were being saved" Acts 2:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Revelation 7:9 says, "Which no one could number."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By simple arithmetic we know that these people are not those from the age of tribulation since the world population is 1.7 billion at the beginning of the twentieth century .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Revelation 9:16 the horsemen are numbered at two hundred million.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the largest number in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But 7:9 says that "no one could number" them; hence, the number must be more than the two hundred million horsemen!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>2 Where do they come from?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Revelation 7:9 reads, "Out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you refer to 5:9-10, you can see that the "men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation" are those chosen from the Gentiles to be given to God; they are the church Acts 15:14-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the church age, if the Jews are to believe in the Lord, they do so in the position of Gentiles and are saved according to the principle of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, the church can be considered as saved Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It can also be said that in the church there is no difference between the Gentiles and the Jews.</S>
