   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN PATIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Patience is something that it is very difficult to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe all of us know what patience is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But allow me to say this nine out of ten people who think they are patient understand patience in an incorrect way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The patience that most people understand has to do with being slow and not being in a hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Patience to them is to do nothing when others offend you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If someone promises to come at twelve o'clock, and he has not come at 12:15, I exercise patience towards him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is what most people understand patience to be, but this is not the patience we are speaking of here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The patience we are speaking of refers to having hope in others despite encountering many troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter how much work you have invested in others, and no matter how terrible the result is, you still have hope in them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter how much you have worked, and despite a lack of results after repeated labor, you are still not disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person looks hopeless today and tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He looks hopeless after a year or two years, but you still go to him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is what we mean by patience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have met a brother who in some aspects is a typical patient man, but who in other aspects is a typical impatient man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, this person is never in a hurry; he speaks slowly, acts slowly, and contacts people slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is indeed a patient man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, however, he does not have any patience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he gives a message, he finishes it in three to five sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he deals with the affairs of the church, whatever he can accomplish he accomplishes, and whatever he cannot accomplish he simply lets go.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may say that he is a very forthright person, but actually he is simply an impatient person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is patience?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not patience to do things slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not patience to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Patience is to be able to endure setbacks in your work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you are repeatedly mistreated, yet you still hold on, this is patience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There was a co-worker in Tsingtao who had really learned the lesson of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1934 he was led to work in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After staying there for half a year, there was no result.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After one year, he still saw no result.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In July and August of 1935, when Brother Nee went with a few of us brothers from Tsinan to Tsingtao, we saw that the condition there was completely barren; there was absolutely no result.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All of us had the feeling that perhaps this brother should not remain in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was too much a suffering for him to remain there all the time without seeing any result.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time his circumstances were difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He rented a small room underneath the stairway of someone else's house.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was only an old bed and an old chair.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing looked proper, and there were absolutely no results in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everyone would tell him to go to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet he continued to stand fast there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He persevered under this kind of condition for another three years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By that time there was some upturn in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The saints there found a house to meet in on the top of a hill.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everyone going to the meeting had to climb up the hill.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was only a little over thirty years of age at that time, but even I complained and said, "Are you going to ask people to climb a hill to come to the meeting?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That was all the result there was of three years of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I thought there were so many places that he could work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why did he have to stay in Tsingtao?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But he was still working enthusiastically there and was not discouraged at all.</S>
