   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR STEWARDS OF THE MYSTERIES OF GOD 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 4:1-9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The subject of 1 Corinthians 4 is stewards of the mysteries of God 4:1-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The focus of this chapter is neither Christ nor the church; it is the stewards of God s mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 4:1 Paul says, In this way let a man account of us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word rendered stewards in this verse is of the same root as the word economy or dispensation in 1 Timothy 1:4 and Ephesians 1:10.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means a dispensing steward, a household administrator, one who dispenses the household supply to its members.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostles were appointed by the Lord to be such stewards, dispensing God s mysteries, which are Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ Col 2:2; Eph 3:4 , to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The dispensing service, the stewardship, is the ministry of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In God s economy revealed in the New Testament there are mainly two mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first mystery, revealed in the book of Colossians, is Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is God s mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Himself God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is real, living, and almighty; however, He is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because no one has ever seen God, He is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This mysterious God is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is not only God, but He is God embodied, God defined, God explained, and God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, Christ is God made visible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus said, He who has seen Me has seen the Father John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first mystery in God s economy is Christ, God expressed, as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second mystery, revealed in the book of Ephesians and explained in it, especially in chapter three, is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ also is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Ephesians 3:4 Paul uses the expression the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, Colossians 1:27 says, To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As believers, we have Christ dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But this Christ whom we have is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although Christ lives in us, worldly people do not realize that He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To them, this is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But although Christ is mysterious, the church is the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the Body of Christ, the church is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we see the church, we see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we come into the church, we come into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we contact the church, we contact Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is truly the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When in 4:1 Paul refers to the mysteries of God, he means Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul and the other apostles were stewards of these mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have pointed out that the Greek word for stewards in 4:1 is of the same root as the word economy or dispensation used elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This word, oikonomia, denotes a household administration or management.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the New Testament a steward is one who serves and takes care of the dispensing of God to His family.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has a very large family, and His desire is to dispense Himself into all the members of His family.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The place of a steward in God s family may be illustrated by the function of a steward in a wealthy family in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A steward in such a family was responsible to care for the dispensing of the means of life food, clothing, and other necessities to the members of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wealthy families often had an abundant supply of these necessities in storage.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The responsibility of a steward was to dispense this supply to the members of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Using this as a metaphor, Paul refers to himself as a steward in God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is exceedingly rich; He has a vast storehouse of goods which He intends to dispense into His children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But this dispensation requires a steward.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, a steward is a dispenser, one who dispenses the divine life supply to God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As such a dispenser, Paul dispensed Christ into all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Receiving such a dispensation through Paul, the believers could then grow with the supply they had received.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By this we see that Paul s ministry was a dispensing ministry, a ministry of dispensing the unsearchable riches of Christ into our being so that we may grow and become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul dispensed Christ s riches not only into the saints individually, but also into the Body corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul s service of dispensing is called the stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In other words, this stewardship is the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The ministry is a stewardship, a service, that dispenses the riches of Christ into the saints, the members of the Body, and into the church, the Body as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May we all be impressed with the two crucial matters of the mysteries of God and the dispensing steward.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we read 1 Corinthians 4 carefully, we shall see that this chapter on the stewards of the mysteries of God emphasizes four main points: faithful servants of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>1-5 , a spectacle both to angels and to men vv.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>6-9 , the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things vv.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>10-13 , and the begetting father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We shall cover the first two points in this message and the last two points in the following message.</S>
