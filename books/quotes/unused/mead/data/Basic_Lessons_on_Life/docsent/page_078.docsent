   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Breath of Life Becoming Man's Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Generally speaking, the word in Hebrew for spirit is ruach, but the Hebrew word for spirit here is neshamah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Neshamah is the same word used in Genesis 2:7 for breath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Proverbs 20:27 it is translated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this we can see that the breath of life breathed into man by God at man's creation was the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spirit of man is something within us that is very close to God's life and God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that the spirit of man was created for the purpose of receiving and containing the life of God and the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our spirit can become one spirit with the Lord because it was created with the breath of life, which is very close to God's life and God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ITS IMPORTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>RANKED WITH THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one can deny that these three items the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man are crucial in God's creation to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The heavens were created for the earth, the earth was created for man, and man was created for God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Zechariah does not refer to "man," but to "the spirit of man."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is because the spirit of man is the very organ that can take in God to enjoy God's life and God's Spirit and be one with God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why man's spirit has become so crucial and important, even to the extent that it is ranked with the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The philosophy of man does not rank anything of man with the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But Zechariah ranks man's spirit with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows how important the human spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to point this out to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to give a training lesson in which we point out that our human spirit was created with a material that is very close to God's life and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also need to point out that our spirit is so important that it is ranked with the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>ITS THREE PARTS A. The Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not easy to pick up a verse or verses which directly show that the conscience is a part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to compare Romans 9:1 with 8:16.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 9:1 says that our conscience bears witness with us in the Holy Spirit, whereas 8:16 says that the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These two verses strongly prove that our conscience is a part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1 Corinthians 5:3 Paul judged a sinful one in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To judge is to condemn sin, and that is mostly the function of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Psalm 51:10 speaks of "a right spirit within me" KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a spirit which is right.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Knowing right from wrong is related to the conscience, so this verse shows that the conscience is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Other verses we can use to show the function of the conscience as a part of the spirit are Psalm 34:18 and Deuteronomy 2:30.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For verses related to the parts of the human spirit, we need to read The Economy of God, pages 56-59.</S>
