        <h2 class="head2">The Connecting Rods of Silver</h2>
<p>When we are judged, the Holy Spirit will show us that our corruption has been judged by God on the cross. No corrupted, filthy, fallen, or backslidden person can be used by God without first passing through the judgment of the cross. Even a believer who has been revived, accepted by God, or used by God still needs to pass through the judgment of the cross. In other words, everything that has been judged and condemned by God has been judged and condemned at the cross.</p>
<p>As soon as we experience the judgment and condemnation of the cross, there is redemption. After we are judged and condemned before God, we are redeemed and forgiven through the washing of the precious blood of Christ. This is a fine theological detail, because God cannot forgive the sins of a brother who has never judged and condemned his own sins. This is the principle in 1 John 1:9, which says, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s forgiveness is based on our confession of our sins, and our confession includes judging and condemning. Whenever we condemn and judge a sin, God forgives us of that sin.</p>
<p>If a brother sees that he needs to be material for the building of the church, his heart will be inclined toward God&rsquo;s building, and the Holy Spirit will immediately move within him so that he senses his sins. After he condemns his sins, the Holy Spirit will cause him to see that his sins have been judged on the cross and forgiven by God. Then he will inwardly have peace. This experience of redemption is signified by the connecting rods of silver and issues from the bronze sockets.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fine White Linen Hangings</h2>
<p>After a person is judged and experiences redemption, he no longer wants to sin. Hence, a just, clean, and white living is manifested within him. This is the fine white linen hanging on the silver rods. In the Bible garments refer to a person&rsquo;s living before God, but fine linen garments refer to the righteous acts of the believers before God (Rev. 19:8). After we experience being judged and redeemed by God, we will spontaneously have a righteous living with righteous acts.</p>
<p>The building up of the church begins here. We should not talk about being built up when there are still sins, improper things, the world, darkness, and discord among us. God&rsquo;s building begins with His judgment. Everything that is incompatible with His righteousness, holiness, and glory must be judged in His light. After we are judged and condemned, we will experience being redeemed and forgiven by God, and we will spontaneously manifest a just and righteous living. This is the boundary of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>A brother who is not at peace with his wife does not have a just condition and cannot participate in God&rsquo;s building. He cannot touch the tabernacle if his sin is not judged and forgiven by God. Nothing unrighteous, evil, corrupt, worldly, or dark can participate in God&rsquo;s building. Thus, if this brother sees the vision of God&rsquo;s building, he will judge the abnormal condition between himself and his wife. Then he will experience redemption and receive grace to deal with the offense and be reconciled with his wife. In this way he will manifest the fine white linen hanging in his living. Furthermore, he will enter into the realm of the tabernacle and take part in God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>The children of God must realize that they cannot neglect their offenses, sins, and unrighteousnesses and still talk about God&rsquo;s building. Only those who have been condemned, judged, redeemed, and forgiven by God can enter into the tabernacle. In other words, we can experience the redemption of the silver rods and the silver hooks only after receiving the judgment of bronze, and we can manifest the fine white linen hangings only after experiencing the redemption of the silver rods and the silver hooks. By these experiences we enter within the boundary of the tabernacle and are able to discern the things outside the tabernacle from the things within. We are able to differentiate between the things that belong to the world and the things that belong to God&rsquo;s house, and we are able to separate the things of human society from the things of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This is where God&rsquo;s building begins.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ALTAR</h2>
<p>The first large piece of furniture in the outer court was the altar. In the Old Testament no one could bypass the altar and still enter into the tabernacle. In order to enter into the tabernacle, both the high priest and the priests first had to offer an offering upon the altar (Exo. 40:29-32). Nadab and Abihu were consumed by fire and died because they did not take fire from the altar but rather presented strange fire before God (Lev. 10:1-2). Therefore, the altar is a crucial gateway. Those who serve in God&rsquo;s dwelling place must pass through the altar.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of the significance of the altar. One aspect is judgment, and the other is consecration. The aspect of judgment is seen in the bronze censers, which were used by the two hundred and fifty men of Korah&rsquo;s company and which were beaten into plates for a covering of the altar (Num. 16:35-38). This was to cause the people who saw the altar to remember that they must pass through God&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p>Hence, the first significance of the altar is that those who come to God must pass through His judgment. We cannot go to God in our original state; we must be judged by God. As those who want to be in God&rsquo;s building, His dwelling place, we must pass through the bronze altar, the place of judgment. The first thing that we encounter when we take a step toward God is bronze, God&rsquo;s judgment. This causes us to sense that we are incompatible with God&rsquo;s will, His heart, and His righteousness and that we are short of His glory and still have much of the world and the flesh. As a result, we will condemn our sins and confess them before God. This is the work of the Holy Spirit convicting us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment (John 16:8). This is our experience when we are newly saved and every time that we are revived.</p>
<p>If we see the vision of being God&rsquo;s building and are willing to care for His need, the Spirit will operate to convict us. We will sense that we cannot stand under the shining of God&rsquo;s light and that we are short in our service, work, testimony, coordination, and private living, and we will spontaneously experience God&rsquo;s judgment. We may have heard many messages concerning dealing with sins, but this is a matter of experience, not of understanding doctrine. If we truly see the vision of God&rsquo;s building, we will be judged. We were judged at our salvation, and we are judged when we are revived. But these experiences are not sufficient. We must also be judged for God&rsquo;s building. The dark, corrupt, evil, or shameful things within us, the things that God condemns, must be judged at the bronze altar.</p>
<p>The second significance of the altar is consecration. The altar was the place where persons offered themselves to God. Although we will never see a person lying on the altar, every offering on the altar represents men. When an offering was of the herd or of the flock, the offerer laid his hands on the head of the offering. This signified the offerer&rsquo;s identification with his offering (Lev. 1:4). The offering of cattle was the offering of oneself.</p>
<p>In order to participate in the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, that is, to enter into the tabernacle, we need not only to be judged by God but also to offer up ourselves completely to Him. We cannot participate in the building if we are not absolutely consecrated to God. In this chapter we are focusing on judgment and consecration. We must first judge and condemn ourselves in God&rsquo;s light and then offer up all that we are on the altar. After experiencing God&rsquo;s condemnation, judgment, redemption, and forgiveness, we must put ourselves on the altar and consecrate ourselves to God.</p>
<p>I hope that the serving ones will focus on the two matters of being judged by God and of consecrating ourselves to Him. Everyone who hears a message on the building must go before God and present everything that he has, item by item, so that his sins can be condemned and forgiven in the light of God&rsquo;s presence. Then he must consecrate himself to the Lord anew.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
