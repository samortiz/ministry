   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE SERVICE OF THE ELDERS AND DEACONS IN THE CHURCH 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This message is concerned with the elders responsibilities, the service of the deacons, and the relationship between the elders and the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE ELDERS RESPONSIBILITIES Leading</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders responsibilities consist of four main items, and the first item is leading.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word leads is used in the New Testament, but it is regrettable that in the Chinese Bible this word is translated as administrates.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 12:8 in the Chinese Union Version says, He who administrates, in diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word administrates in this verse should be translated as leads, because here it refers to taking the lead diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the Greek text there is only one portion in the New Testament where the word administration is used in relation to the elders responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians 12:28 says, God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Except for this verse, all the other verses that have the word administrates in relation to the elders responsibilities should be translated with the word leads.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hebrews 13:7 says, Remember the ones leading you, who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their manner of life, imitate their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word leading in this verse and leads in Romans 12:8 clearly indicate that the main responsibility of the elders in the church is to lead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This also corresponds to 1 Peter 5:3, which says that elders should not lord it over their allotments but should become patterns of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The flock is the allotment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The elders should not lord it over the flock but rather they should become patterns of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Becoming a pattern means to take the lead as the lead sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I was in Scotland in 1958, I saw many herds of sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I observed that the herd would follow the way that the first few sheep in the herd took.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The shepherd did not need to guard the whole herd.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He only needed to direct a few sheep in the front.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the sheep in front made a move, the entire herd moved accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the sheep in front stopped, the herd also stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the sheep in front turned, the whole herd turned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I saw this, I understood why the Bible says that the elders are entrusted to shepherd the flock of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Strictly speaking, the elders shepherd the flock by taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the sheep taking the lead say to go left but do not go left themselves, how can the herd go left?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, to genuinely shepherd the flock of God, the elders have to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The main responsibility of the elders in the church is to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the elders take the lead in everything, the rest of the saints will spontaneously follow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the elders love the world, it is guaranteed that the saints in the church will also love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Peter was such an example.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the Lord had resurrected and ascended, Peter said to the rest of the disciples, I am going fishing, and they responded, We also are coming with you John 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The primary responsibility of an elder is to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Timothy 3:2 says, The overseer then must be without reproach,...apt to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The elders must be apt to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This does not refer to being a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Testament says that God gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Shepherds and teachers are not two different persons but one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Teachers must be shepherds, and shepherds must be teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The elders being apt to teach is not the same as teachers teaching in schools.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is more like parents helping their children with their studies at home.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If parents are able to help their children with their schoolwork at home, the children will succeed in school.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If parents do not know how to teach their children, the children will suffer a big loss.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The teaching by teachers in the schools differs from that of the parents at home.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These are two different kinds of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The elders in the New Testament are parents, not teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These two kinds of teaching are different in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to their duties, the elders must teach, whereas according to the gift, a teacher is able to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Teachers teach the truth, which includes defining the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, to teach the truth concerning justification, one must explain clearly the objective and the subjective aspects of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the teaching by teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The teaching by the elders, however, is different.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>An elder may stand up in a meeting and say, The New Year is near, and the people in the world are busy shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, we who belong to the Lord cannot be the same as they.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should be separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We use the New Year holidays for prayer and for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This word of exhortation is a kind of teaching by a parent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The church needs this kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church needs ones to speak words of exhortation and teaching to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some elders progress gradually from teaching as parents to teaching as teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, they can release message after message on the mystery of the faith in order to unveil Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This progress is encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The local churches need these two kinds of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The elders should regularly speak a word for three to five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They should teach the saints how to have the table meeting, and how to pray, call hymns, and testify.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This home teaching is needed in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I hope that in every meeting hall there will be at least one elder who is responsible for this kind of teaching every week.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then after fifty-two weeks, there will be an accumulation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This will render help to the young ones who recently entered the church life as well as to those who attend the meetings regularly.</S>
