If we do not speak, we are unprofitable to the Lord. In 1984 I went to Taiwan to fight against the killing practice of annulling the speaking function of the members of the Body of Christ. I have not yet fully succeeded, so I am still fighting. My fighting depends upon my speaking. Before giving a message, I pray much about my speaking. My speaking has not yet fully convicted or convinced all the saints in the Lord's recovery. I have stressed that in the meetings of the church, there should not be just one man speaking. Everyone should prophesy one by one (1 Cor. 14:31). However, eight years have passed since I began to speak concerning this matter of having the church meeting in mutuality with all speaking, and this practice has still not been fully recovered.</P><P>Christianity is a total loss to the Lord in the sense of annulling the functioning of the members of the organic Body of Christ. Revelation 3 says that Christ is standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door (v. 20). Today Christ is outside the door of Protestant Christianity. Revelation 17 reveals that the Roman Catholic Church is a great harlot (vv. 1-6). Eventually, Antichrist will annihilate the Roman Catholic Church in the avenging judgment of God (vv. 16-17).</P><P>There is nothing of the Lord's interest in either Protestantism or Catholicism, but how about the Lord's recovery? Even in the Lord's recovery, the Lord has gained too little. The crucial point, the key, in the Lord's recovery is our speaking. The Lord's intention is to save a people and make this people His oracle. All of them should be speaking ones. However, many among us do not like to speak. On the other hand, some are ambitious, hunting for the chance to speak. These ambitious ones abuse the right to speak. They do not need to speak that much. In the recent turmoil, some of the so-called gifted ones rejected my ministry because the God-ordained way to meet took away their platform in the Lord's Day morning meeting. They said that my intention was to kill all the prophets. This was certainly not my intention at all. Rather, the God-ordained way of meeting gives everyone the opportunity to speak.</P><P>If you have the portion and the capacity, you should speak more. But there is no need to hunt for a speaking opportunity. All the church meetings are open to everybody. Our situation today is this: on the one hand, some ambitious ones are hunting for an opportunity to speak, and on the other hand, many saints who have been properly and rightly privileged to speak do not speak. Your keeping silent becomes Satan's victory over the Lord.</P><P>In Psalm 8 the Lord boasted to Satan&#151;His adversary, His enemy, and His avenger&#151;that He had established praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings (v. 2). The Lord has perfected, established, or completed praise in the youngest ones, the smallest ones, the weakest ones, among His redeemed people to stop the enemy. Yet today among the Lord's people, most are silent. The Lord cannot display His victory over Satan if we are silent. When we come together, why would we not speak one by one? To speak one by one for two hours would be wonderful. Then the Lord Jesus, sitting in the heavens, could say, "Satan, look at the saints in the church speaking for Me. Their speaking is My victory!" We must fulfill our duty to prophesy. We must try our best to speak something for the Lord within three minutes. If you have something extra, the Spirit will give you more time to speak.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
