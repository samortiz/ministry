<h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN LIFE &ldquo;RUNNING OUT&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to the wedding feast, but the wine ran out (v. 3). Wine is the focus of a wedding. A wedding depends primarily on wine. Wine is different from water. Water does not come out of life, but wine does. In those days the Jews drank wine made from grapes, which is the life of the grapes. Hence, wine signifies life. A wedding feast depending primarily on wine signifies that the pleasure of human life depends on life. If there is no wine, a wedding feast becomes meaningless. When life comes to an end, man loses his pleasure and enjoyment. The pleasure of human life disappears when life ends. Therefore, when life is terminated, the pleasure and enjoyment of human life are also terminated.</p>
<p>The wine in the wedding feast ran out. This signifies that human life is limited and will end. Human life will reach an end. Not only do old couples die, but even young couples die as well. When either the husband or the wife dies, the happiness goes. In other words, the wine in the wedding of human life runs out. When a person&rsquo;s life comes to an end, the pleasure of his human life also comes to an end. A newly married couple is in the happiest time of their human life. If the husband is diagnosed with tuberculosis, the wine in their human life is running out. Suppose an elderly couple celebrates their fiftieth wedding anniversary. This also indicates that the wine is running out. After they drink a little more, it will be finished. This is true not only of the joy of human life that exists between a husband and wife. It is also true in respect to the many other aspects of the joy of human life. We all understand that the aspects of the joy of our human life will eventually end because our human life is limited and will end.</p>
<p>The people at the wedding in Cana did not know the Lord&rsquo;s intention. However, I believe that the Lord knew that their wine would run out and that they needed Him to change their wine into a better wine. This signifies that although man does not know the Lord&rsquo;s purpose in coming to him, the Lord knows that man has a need. Man may be feasting and living an &ldquo;enjoyable life,&rdquo; but the Lord Jesus knows that human life will reach an end one day; it will be finished. Therefore, the Lord comes to man in order to meet such a need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYTHING OF THE NATURAL MAN BEING DEATH</h2>
<p>John 2:6 says that there were six stone waterpots. The number six represents created man, because man was created on the sixth day. The waterpots were made of stone. Because stone is something natural, the six stone waterpots signify the natural created man. Cana, the land of reeds, signifies our being weak and fragile, and the six stone waterpots signify our being created and natural. As weak and fragile human beings, we are the reeds in Cana; as created and natural human beings, we are six stone waterpots.</p>
<p>It is very meaningful that the Lord told the servants to fill the waterpots with water (v. 7). Wine is different from water because wine comes out of life but water does not. Therefore, just as wine signifies life, so water signifies death. The Lord told the servants to fill the waterpots with water; this indicates that the natural created man is filled with death. We should not think that someone dies because he has been sick for a certain period of time. Rather, someone dies because death is in him. We all have death in us. We are weak and fragile because death is in us. Our physical weakness and fragility and our psychological weakness and fragility prove that death is in us. The factor of death, the element of death, in us makes us weak, fragile, and unable to withstand pressure both physiologically and psychologically. We are fragile, sick, aging, failing, and dying. These conditions prove that we are filled with death. We need the Lord Jesus because we are filled with death. We need the Lord of life to come into us. We need resurrection life, the Spirit of resurrection, to be our life in order to meet our needs. Because we are filled with death, everything that the sages did is ineffective in solving our problems. The sages are not able to impart into us a life that cannot die and is strong, an eternal life. Only the Lord of life is able to give us a life that cannot die and is strong. He can give us a life that is eternal to meet our need.</p>
