   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTY DEALING WITH THE GIFTS 4 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 13:1-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 13 is the direct continuation of chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last verse of chapter twelve, verse 31, Paul says, But earnestly desire the greater gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And yet I show to you a way of excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The way of excellence is love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, chapter thirteen presents this excellent way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter twelve Paul emphasizes speaking, the Spirit, the Body, and God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now in chapter thirteen we have love as the fifth emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Speaking ushers us into the Spirit, the Spirit brings us into the Body, and the Body preserves us in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, the Body is for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul s fifth emphasis, the matter of love, is the way to use the gifts, the way to be in the Body, and the way to be for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapter thirteen is not an isolated section of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, it comes between chapters twelve and fourteen and with them forms a portion in this Epistle dealing with the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we should never consider chapter thirteen as if it stood by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No, it is a continuation of chapter twelve and leads into chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first verse of chapter fourteen indicates this: Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The last verse of chapter twelve brings us into chapter thirteen, and the first verse of chapter fourteen concludes chapter thirteen and brings us into chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 12:31 Paul speaks of the excellent way to exercise the gifts, in chapter thirteen he presents love as this excellent way, and in 14:1 he advises us to pursue love and desire earnestly the spiritual gifts, especially that we may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, these chapters make up one unit, with chapter thirteen continuing chapter twelve and chapter fourteen continuing chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is love only a way, or is it also a gift?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Romans 12, there is ground to say that love is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Romans 12:6-8 Paul says that we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us and that we should exercise them accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to verse 8, even the showing of mercy is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then in verses 9 and 10 Paul goes on to say, Let love be without hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Love one another warmly in brotherly love, vying with one another in showing honor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then in verses 12 and 13 he says, Rejoicing in hope, enduring in tribulation, persevering in prayer, communicating to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these, along with love, are spoken of in a chapter concerned with gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we may say that love is at least on the border of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul s word in 1 Corinthians 13:8 may also indicate that love is a gift and not merely a way: Love never falls away; but whether prophecies, they shall be done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be done away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here Paul lists love along with the gifts of prophecy, tongues, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no doubt that to prophesy, speak in tongues, and teach with the word of knowledge are gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although prophecies will be done away, tongues will cease, and knowledge will be done away, love will never fall away.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have pointed out that there are certain brothers and sisters who apparently do not have any gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, they are absolutely for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be for the Body is a matter of love, and to care for the members of the Body requires love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not have love, how can we care for others?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Love is necessary to care for the members so that the Body may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, love is the greatest gift.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nothing edifies people as much as love does.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Love is a spiritual antibiotic.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If there is love in a local church, there will be no need to worry about spiritual diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Love is the best medicine to cure such diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Love is a gift, even the greatest gift.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not difficult to have the gift of love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no need to fast for love or pray to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, there is no need to imitate, pretend, or perform.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Love is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as you have the divine life through regeneration, you also have love, for love is the expression of life, another form of life.</S>
