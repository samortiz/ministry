There it says that the Head, Christ, has given to the church gifts such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. These people do not build up the Body of Christ directly. Rather, they perfect the saints that the latter may do the work of the New Testament ministry (vv. 11-12). This matter has never been properly carried out by anyone in the practice of the church. But at this time we are carrying it out. I cannot say that we are completely successful, but I have definitely seen the success. This also is an undeniable fact.</P><P>The third point is covered in Romans 15:16. There it says that everyone is a priest of God's gospel, offering repentant sinners as sacrifices to God. Here in Taiwan we do not see big gospel campaigns, yet hundreds and thousands are saved. This is an amazing thing.</P><P>Today on the whole earth, although the Lord's recovery has encountered many weaknesses and shortcomings, it has reached all six continents. The Lord's recovery has gone to North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australasia. Moreover, I have the definite assurance that the churches in all the continents welcome the new way. In spite of this, the day of glory has not yet come. This is the burden in my heart. In these two meetings you will not receive many great doctrines. What we need now is to labor, to be diligent, to strive, and to struggle. In 1984 I came back to carry out the new way. Taiwan can be considered the first place that responded to this. Although we were a little slow in the beginning, later we picked up this way. After the three years of 1985, 1986, and 1987, the big meeting on Sunday morning was still practiced in Taipei. It was in October 1987, after we had the gospel festival in Taipei, that we said goodbye to the meeting in which one man speaks. This is very good. Yet not long after that, everyone became relaxed again.</P><P>In the process of our studying, I have found out that the God-ordained way in the Bible is that man must labor. This is like a farmer farming in his field. If he does not labor even for one day, the effect will be evident. A saying among the northern Chinese is, "The grains are dropping!" This means that when the grains are ripe, one must hurry and harvest them in the field, even if he has important engagements at home. Once the time is past, the grains will all fall to the ground. Hence, the farmers not only need to labor, but they must also labor on time if they expect to see a good harvest.</P><P>All of you sitting here are either elders, co-workers, or full-timers. I would like to ask whether you are laboring like a farmer. The reason I say that our condition is not yet up to the standard is that we are not laboring enough. Moreover, the God-ordained way is not that a few would labor; rather, it is that every one of us would labor. Because our laboring is not sufficient, the result of our work is not very apparent. When I saw this situation, I went back to the Bible and considered what it says. I discovered that in the Old Testament, not much is mentioned concerning laboring and diligence. Only Proverbs speaks about these things a little. It says that the sluggard sleeps and slumbers, and his poverty comes quickly (6:9-11). It also says that the sluggard will not plow because of the cold; therefore, he will beg during the harvest and have nothing (20:4). The New Testament says more concerning this matter. For example, the book of Romans is a book on Christian living and the church life. There it says that we should not be slothful in zeal, but burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave (12:11).</P><P>We do have a problem in serving the Lord, and this problem is slothfulness. Perhaps some would say, "Brother Lee, we are not slothful. Every week we come regularly to the meetings. How can you say that we are slothful?" Today I must tell you that if you have only scheduled meetings, you will never be successful. You must add to this, diligence. According to my observation, the way that we have now is correct and according to the truth. The saints have no objection or dissension toward it. Everyone receives it gladly. But we seldom see any response outside the regular meetings. This says one thing: that in their service, the brothers and sisters are not lacking in regular labor; but there is no exceptional labor. However, the secret to success lies in the exceptional labor.</P><P>In addition to diligence, Paul used some very strong words in describing his service to the Lord. He said that he was laboring, striving, contending, and struggling. If I remember correctly, these words are borrowed from the ancient Olympic games. In the arena, whether one engages in running, wrestling, high jumping, or any other sport, everything can be summed up in these words. Everyone gives himself to strive. Paul said, "I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me" (1 Cor. 15:10). Furthermore, he said, "For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power" (Col. 1:29). At that time Paul was facing opposition from three directions: from Judaism, from the Gnostics, and from the heathen traditions. All of these opposing things were very strong. However, he was not at all subdued. On the contrary, he labored and struggled all the more.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
