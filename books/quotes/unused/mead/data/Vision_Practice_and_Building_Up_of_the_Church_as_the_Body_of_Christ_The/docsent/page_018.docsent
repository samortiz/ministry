   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH THE INNER EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:13-14; 2:15; 3:8, 16-19; 4:11-16, 22-24; 5:18-19; 6:18</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous messages we saw that there are three main items in God s purpose concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first is that the church would have the full sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a matter of life, not only the life we receive in our new birth but the growth of life, life in maturity and in fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that God wants to work Himself into us to make us not only His sons but also His heirs to inherit all that He is and all He has.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, through this life and under the headship of Christ, all things will be headed up by Christ the Head through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This aspect of God s purpose involves the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First there is life, and then there is building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The building is something in life and under the headship of Christ to bring us all into the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The third item of God s purpose is that in life the church will be built up so that Satan, the enemy of God, will be defeated and put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In life we are built up under the headship of Christ, and through this God has the ground to make His multifarious wisdom known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies so that He can challenge His enemy and put him to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is God s purpose that through the church He would manifest Himself through His Son, Christ, and put His enemy to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God planned, and He created the heavens, the earth, and many creatures for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then as the center of God s creation, He created man to be His container, His vessel, that He might put Himself into man to be his life, wisdom, power, light, way, and his everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever we need is God in Christ Himself, including patience, humility, meekness, and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By being life and everything to us, God makes us His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A son is one who inherits everything from his father, including the father s life, blood, and character.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever the father is and whatever the father has is imparted into the son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, a son must be born, not adopted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be born of the Father means that whatever the Father is and whatever the Father has is imparted into His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God comes into us to beget us, He imparts Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First God created us, and then He begot us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By creating us, He made us to exist, and by begetting us, He imparted Himself into us as our life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this purpose God created a human spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may compare our human spirit to the filament of a light bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without the filament within the bulb, the bulb cannot contain the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The bulb needs the filament within it to be the recipient of the electricity and to express the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as the bulb has an outward form, we also have an outward form, which is our body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then just as within the outward form of the bulb there is the filament to receive, convey, and express the electricity, within our body there is a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are the vessels, the containers, made by God, so God purposely created a spirit within us to receive Him, contain Him, keep Him, and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From our spirit God will spread Himself throughout our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Triune God God in Christ as the Spirit spreads through us not from without but from within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God first comes into our spirit and fills our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then constantly from our spirit He spreads outward.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By this spreading God permeates and saturates all our inward parts, our whole heart our conscience, mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When God came into our spirit, we received the birth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now by His spreading from our spirit throughout our whole being we have the growth of life and eventually the maturity, the fullness, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ultimately, even our body will be transfigured; that is, it will be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will be our full sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this way we all will be one in being headed up under the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Head and the Body are a great corporate man Eph 2:15; Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Within this man is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is the Head, and by being life to us He saturates, transforms, and transfigures us to bring us into the proper order under His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is through this Body that the Head, Christ, will head up all things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE DISTRACTIONS FROM</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE CENTRAL MARK OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to see the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the earth today there are three classes of people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, there are the Jews, God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Second, there are the Gentiles, the unbelieving, worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Third, there are the Christians, the members of the church 1 Cor 10:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Without exception, all three classes of people have been distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For the purpose that humans may exist, God prepared many material, physical things for them, such as food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to today s situation, however, the unbelievers, the Gentiles, pay all their attention to their eating, drinking, housing, and material life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Regardless of what kind of people they are rich, poor, high, low, cultured, or barbarian they have been distracted from God s central mark by the material things which God prepared for them to exist in order to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Food, drink, and all the material things were intended to be a help, a means, for men to fulfill God s purpose, but Satan came in to utilize these things to distract the unbelievers from God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After God prepared everything for men to exist, He came in to give some of them, the Jews, spiritual knowledge through the Scriptures, the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God revealed His law and His will to them with the intention that the Scriptures would help them to know God, God s plan, and God s Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Eventually, however, Satan utilized even the Old Testament to distract the Jews from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The four Gospels clearly show how the Jewish scribes, elders, Pharisees, and learned ones were very distracted from Christ by the Scriptures John 5:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Under Satan s utilization, the Old Testament distracted the Jewish people from Christ to the extent that they even opposed Christ by means of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now not only the unbelievers, the Gentiles, have been distracted from God s eternal purpose but even the Jews, who were chosen by God, are distracted from God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christians have not merely the material things created by God and the Old Testament revelation of God but also the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this New Testament many kinds of gifts are given so that people may know Christ, realize Christ, and be built up together as the Body to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet how subtle the enemy still is!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Satan utilizes even the New Testament and all the gifts given by God to distract people from Christ to the gifts and even to the letter of the New Testament apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we consider the entire situation, we will realize that everything prepared by God and given by God for the purpose of fulfilling His economy has been utilized by the subtle enemy to distract people from God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The unbelievers enjoy all the material things, but not for the purpose of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Similarly, the Jews today have the Old Testament in their synagogues, but not for God s purpose since they are fully distracted from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is the same in the so-called Christian churches.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>People there have the Old Testament with the New Testament, and they claim that they have many gifts, but many are still distracted from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is a pitiful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we have the vision from the heavens to know God s intention, we will weep for the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christians are being distracted even by spiritual gifts to things other than Christ and His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many fundamental, sound Christians do not have the proper thought concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Fundamental Christianity tells people, God is the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He loves you and is merciful and gracious, so He sent His Son to save you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You are sinful and are going to hell, but Christ died for you on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you believe in Him, your sins will be forgiven and you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then you will have peace and joy, and after you die, you will go to dwell with Him in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, others say, This is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We are not satisfied with only this.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We desire the gifts, the manifestations, to prove that God is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All these Christians may never have heard a message on how God intends to work Himself into us through Christ as the Spirit so that Christ as the Head will be expressed through His Body to bring the whole universe under His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They have neglected the central mark of God s economy and have not seen the vision of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Therefore, they too are distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We need the material things.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need food, drink, a home, and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, we are not for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Rather, these things must be for us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we seek God s kingdom and all His righteousness, God will care for all the things we need Matt 6:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>All these things are for us, and we are for God and His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After many years of experience, I can testify that if we care for God s purpose, God will care for our need.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He is faithful in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>There is no doubt that many times He has tested us, and Satan also has attacked us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Nevertheless, after more than thirty years of living for God s purpose, I am still here.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>For the sake of His word and His interest, all the necessary material things have passed through my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we care for Him and for His interest, He will care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He has given us this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Likewise, the Scriptures, knowledge, teachings, gifts, manifestations, operations, functions, and ministries are all for the central mark of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>All these things are for us, but we are not for those things apart from God s purpose.</S>
