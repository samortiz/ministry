   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SATISFIED WITH LESS THAN OUR DUE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point we need to consider in a fuller way the meaning of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Forbearance means that we are easily satisfied, even with less than our due.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the meaning of the Greek word rendered forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be satisfied with less than our due is in contrast to being just in an exacting way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To forbear is to make no demands on others; it is to be satisfied with whatever another party does to us or for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose a brother s wife serves him a cold drink when he preferred a hot one, and, very dissatisfied, he rebukes her for what she has done.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not forbearance; it is being just in a very exacting manner.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the brother had shown forbearance toward his wife, he would have been satisfied with whatever she served him, even if he had not been able to drink it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He would have been satisfied with less than his due.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>AN ALL-INCLUSIVE VIRTUE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In his Word Studies Wuest points out that the Greek word rendered forbearance not only means satisfied with less than our due, but also means sweet reasonableness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word includes self-control, patience, moderation, kindness, and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, according to Christian experience, forbearance is all-inclusive, for it includes all Christian virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that if we fail to exercise forbearance, we fail to exercise any Christian virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a brother s wife serves him a cold drink contrary to his preference and he complains about it, then at that time he does not exhibit any Christian virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if by the grace of Christ he is satisfied with less than his due and exercises forbearance toward his wife, not criticizing her or condemning her, he will show in his forbearance an all-inclusive Christian virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His forbearance will include patience, humility, self-control, looking to the Lord, and even the virtue of admitting that the Lord is sovereign in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reason we sometimes behave in an unseemly manner is that we lack forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Negative attitudes and unkind words also come from a shortage of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we fail to love, it is because we have no forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, we may be intolerant because we lack forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even talkativeness may result from having no forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not have forbearance, we shall not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not show forbearance toward the members of our family, there will be no peace in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peace comes out of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>MAGNIFYING CHRIST BY MAKING KNOWN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>OUR FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul realized that forbearance is an all-inclusive virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the reason he says, Let your forbearance be known to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This forbearance is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1:21 Paul says, To me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since Christ is forbearance, for Paul to live was forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul s earnest expectation was that Christ would be magnified in him, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For Paul to magnify Christ was for him to make known his forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, for Christ to be magnified in us is equal to making our forbearance known to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason for this is that forbearance is Christ experienced by us in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may speak of living Christ and testify that for us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, day by day in our life at home what we need is forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have forbearance, then in our experience we truly have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a brother s wife offends him, what he needs to make known to her is Christ as his forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is very difficult to be a good husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The key to being a good husband or wife is forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To repeat, forbearance includes much more than gentleness or humility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As an all-inclusive Christian virtue, forbearance is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In both the family life and in the church life, we need to live Christ by living a life of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we consider the significance of forbearance, the more we can appreciate why Paul spoke of it in 4:5.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our failures and defeats in the Christian life come because we are short of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the saints, young and old alike, have a tendency to neglect forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we would live Christ, we must be satisfied with less than our due.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not make exacting demands on others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord Jesus lived a life of forbearance when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In one sense, He was very strict, but in another sense He was very tolerant.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, although He prayed a great deal, He did not make demands of His disciples concerning prayer or condemn them because they did not pray enough.</S>
