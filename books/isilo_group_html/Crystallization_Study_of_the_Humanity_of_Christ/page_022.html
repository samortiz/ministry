Coming in His Humanity<br>to Seek and Save the Lost Sinners</H2><P>Christ as the Son of Man came in His humanity to seek and save the lost sinners (Matt. 18:11; 9:13; Luke 19:10). He ate and drank with the tax collectors and sinners (Matt. 9:10-11; 11:19; Luke 7:34), making friends with them. He visited and lodged with a sinful man, a tax collector named Zaccheus (Luke 19:5-7). He also came as a Physician to the ill (Matt. 9:12), having authority to forgive sins (v. 6). As the Son of Man, Christ came not to destroy men's lives but to save them (Luke 9:56). We need to enjoy Christ as the Son of Man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B.

Asking His Disciples<br>Who They Knew Him to Be in His Humanity</H2><P>The Lord Jesus asked His disciples who they knew Him to be in His humanity and guided them to know Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, who will build the church to be the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 16:13-20).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Humanity of Christ &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
