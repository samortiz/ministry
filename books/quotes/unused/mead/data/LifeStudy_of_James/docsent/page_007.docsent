   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GLORYING IN EXALTATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND IN BEING BROUGHT LOW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 9 and 10 James continues, And let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation, and the rich in his being brought low, because as a flower of the grass he will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word rendered glory in verse 9 also means boast or rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a lowly brother glories and rejoices in exaltation, it leads him spontaneously to praise the Lord 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He should not glory in a secular way without praising the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But although it is easy for a lowly brother to glory, rejoice, and praise the Lord in his exaltation, in his elevation or uplifted estate, it is not easy for a rich one to do so in being brought low.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, whether in exaltation or in being brought low, to rejoice and praise is a virtue of practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all need to realize that no matter how wealthy we may be, our environment may change.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A person may be rich today, but after a short period of time he may be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, a brother may have a high position at work, and suddenly and unexpectedly he may be demoted or even fired.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because such things happen, we should not put our trust in our environment, wealth, position, or education.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 11 James explains, For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass, and its flower falls off, and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so also the rich shall fade away in his pursuits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What a sobering word to those who pursue riches!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet it is a soothing word to the rich who are being brought low through loss of their riches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>James used the surge of the sea in verse 6 to illustrate a doubting heart, and the flower of the land in verse 10 to portray the fading rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now, in verse 11 he uses the sun in the heavens with its scorching heat to illustrate the fading factor of man s riches under God s governmental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He used even the turning of the planets in verse 17 to illustrate a variation which is in contrast to God the Father s invariableness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In dealing with the problem of our tongue in 3:3-12 he used twenty kinds of things for illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, he used vapor in 4:14 to portray the brief appearing of our life, and the farmer s longsuffering in 5:7-8 to teach us how to await the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was a wise and experienced man, with not only the experience of human life, but also wisdom from the divine source through seeking by prayer v. 5; 3:13, 15, 17 . Yet it seems that he may have been frustrated by his sympathy and compromise with Judaism, from seeing a thorough vision of the wisdom concerning God s New Testament economy, as Paul saw and unveiled in his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>RECEIVING THE CROWN OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 12 James says, Blessed is the man who endures trial, because having become approved, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 2 through 12 deal with trials.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Trials come from the believers environment to prove their faith vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2-3 through suffering vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The believers should endure the trials with all joy v. 2 because of their love for the Lord that they may receive the blessing of the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 12 the word approved refers to the approving of the believers faith v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The crown of life is the glory, the expression, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The believers endure the trials by the divine life, and this will become their glory, their expression, the crown of life, as a reward to them at the Lord s appearing for their enjoyment in the coming kingdom 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word life in verse 12 indicates that the underlying thought of verses 12 through 27 is the crucial need of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The begetting Father and His begetting us, His making us the firstfruit of His creatures vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>17-18, 27 , the implanted word of life v. 21 , and the perfect law of life v. 25 are all confirmations of this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 12 James says that the crown of life is promised to those who love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To believe in the Lord is to receive the divine life for our salvation; to love the Lord is to grow in the divine life for maturity that we may be qualified for a reward the crown of life to enjoy the glory of the divine life in the kingdom.</S>
