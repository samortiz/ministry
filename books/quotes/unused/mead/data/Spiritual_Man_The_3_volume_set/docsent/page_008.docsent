   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>POSTSCRIPT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today I rejoice because I have finished the last section of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I wrote the preface, I had only finished the first four sections.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While I was writing the last four sections I felt that I still had much to say to my readers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, this postscript.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sixteen months ago I began writing this book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During these sixteen months, I have been burdened with this book every moment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The enemy is not happy when he sees God's truth being preached in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, attacks came from all angles, and it seemed as if they had become too much for me to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But thank the Lord that His grace sustained me until today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times I thought that there was no way to go on; the pressure in the spirit was too great, and the body was too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was as if I had lost hope of my very life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the God whom I serve and to whom I belong has strengthened me according to His promise and in answer to the prayers of many.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today everything is over, and my burden is released.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a consolation for me today!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today I offer this book up with both hands to our God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My prayer before Him is that since He has finished what He has begun, He would bless this book for the accomplishment of His commission in His church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I pray that God would bless every one of the readers that they would find the proper path and would learn to follow the Lord unto perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My spirit and my prayer now go out with this book.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May God use this book according to His excellent will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers, humanly speaking, a writer ought not to be too enthusiastic about his own book.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But I cannot care about this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am not drawing attention to it just because it is my book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we are here for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this book were written by someone else, I would have more liberty to recommend it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, I would ask for your forgiveness in this matter; I am compelled to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I only know that the truth in this book is important, and for that reason I cannot shy away from recommending it just because it was written by me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to my understanding of God's will, I realize that the truth contained in this book is very much needed in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I may be mistaken, but one thing is sure: I know that I did not initiate the writing of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was clearly commissioned by the Lord to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, the truths in this book are not mine but are given to me by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even while I was writing this book, He gave me many new blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I want my readers to fully understand that this book is not on theories of spiritual life and warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I myself can testify that the truths contained in this book were learned through many sufferings, trials, and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Almost all the teachings have the mark of fire on them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The words were not written lightly but were produced out of the deepest part of my being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God knows where these truths come from.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who read this book will naturally feel that its style is different from ordinary writings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In addition, there are many special terms which are quite incomprehensible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me clarify a few points.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a man has never set out to write a book like this, he will not realize in reality how many difficulties there are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is when he takes up his pen and starts writing that all these problems come before him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Chinese language does not lend itself easily to spiritual writings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, I have to express the meaning of the truth in a style that is half Chinese and half foreign.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many terms in the book were created by me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Had I not done this, many truths could not even have been expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope that the readers will pay special attention to the proper spiritual terms.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After they are more widely used, they will not sound that strange anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I thank the Lord that during the past few years, many spiritual terms have become common among Chinese believers and can be understood without much explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope that the readers will not find difficulty with this category of terms.</S>
