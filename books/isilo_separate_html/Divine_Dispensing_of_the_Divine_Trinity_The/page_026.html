<p>Second Corinthians 11:2 reads, &ldquo;For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.&rdquo; He is our husband so that He might dispense all the riches of God which are embodied in Him (Col. 2:9) into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">32. AS THE FIRSTFRUIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:20 says, &ldquo;But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; Verse 23 says, &ldquo;But each one in his own order: the firstfruit, Christ; after that those who are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming.&rdquo; Christ was the first one raised from among the dead as the firstfruit of resurrection. Since He, the Head of the Body, has been resurrected, we, the Body, shall also be resurrected. This is also to enjoy the dispensing of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">33. AS THE LAST ADAM</h2>
<p>Christ was the last Adam. First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; As the last Adam, Christ on the one hand terminated the old man, and on the other hand, He became the life-giving Spirit so that God could be dispensed into us to be our life that we may be God&rsquo;s new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">34. AS THE SECOND MAN</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:47 says, &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second Man is out of heaven.&rdquo; Christ is not only the last Adam but also the second Man. The first Adam is the beginning of the old man in the old creation; the last Adam is the ending, the termination of the old man in the old creation.</p>
<p>As the first man, Adam is the head of the old creation, representing it in creation. As the second Man, Christ is Head of the new creation, representing it in resurrection. In the entire universe there are these two men: the first man Adam, including all his descendants, and the second Man Christ, comprised of all His believers. We believers were included in the first man by birth, and we became a part of the second Man by regeneration. Our belief has transferred us out of the first man into the second. As a part of the first man, our origin is the earth, and our nature is earthy. As a part of the second Man, our origin is God, and our nature is heavenly. This is also for the dispensing of the divine life.</p>
<p>All these points indicate that Christ is everything to us so that God can dispense Himself into us. What a wonderful Christ! He is so rich for the dispensing of God into our being.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
