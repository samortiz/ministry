THROUGH THE LIFE-STUDY MESSAGES</h2>
<p>Some criticize us, saying that we read the life-study messages and not the Bible. Those who speak this way are completely misinformed. The goal of the life-study messages is to bring people into the truths of the Bible. In the past when people read the Bible, they could not find the way to enter in, so they had no way to understand it. This is like having a house with no entryway, no door, and no windows to allow people to enter in. The life-study messages do the work of paving a way, building a door, and opening a window so that people can enter the house and enjoy everything inside.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-STUDY MESSAGES<br />
LEADING PEOPLE TO TOUCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Another function of the life-study messages is to bring people into life. The life-study messages are not a set of philosophical or classical writings apart from the Bible. The life-study messages do not merely expound the Bible and present the truth; rather, they also bring people into the truth to enjoy and experience its riches. Mere exposition of the Bible is just the impartation of knowledge which causes people to know doctrines mentally. The life-study messages bring us into the depths of the Bible to touch and enjoy the life within (cf. John 5:39-40).</p>
<p>Many Christians after reading Exodus 12 only know that something happened on the night of the Passover (v. 12); they do not know the meaning of what happened. However, today through the life-study messages we can all understand the deep meaning of this matter and enter into the application of the precious blood, the enjoyment of the meat of the lamb, and the reality of the unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Therefore, the life-study of the Bible is a proper and accurate study of the Bible which ushers people into the Bible to obtain the life supply and enjoyment contained in it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FACTOR FOR RICH MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Today pastors and preachers in Christianity must search everywhere to find a good word for their sermons. Some pastors do not have anything to talk about, so they speak about things such as sanitary practices and personal hygiene. Some are a little better and speak about matters such as redemption, the washing away of sins, and justification. There are some who are even deeper and speak about things such as how to fellowship with the Lord and how to enjoy the peace given to us by the Lord. But even this is not really enough when we speak of the richness of the meetings. We have seen from our experience and our research that the richest meetings are those with the life-study messages as their content. If every Lord&rsquo;s Day we would take two life-study messages as the content of our fellowship, the meeting would be very rich.</p>
<p>I personally have spent eleven years laboring to carry out the summer and winter life-study trainings. This year I have completed the life-study of the entire New Testament, and next year I will begin another eleven years to complete the study of the entire Bible. We should bring all the saints in the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery into the practice of carefully reading one or two life-study messages each week. If we do this, over the long term&mdash;perhaps over ten, eight, or even just five years&mdash;the saints will make much progress in all areas, and the condition of the entire church will also be reversed.</p>
<p>Nutritionists tell us that to eat healthily, we cannot eat just one kind of food. Fish is very nutritious, but if we only ate fish for three meals a day without eating anything else, we definitely would not be healthy. In order to eat healthily, we must eat all kinds of foods. For example, a salad does not contain only one kind of vegetable but many kinds mixed together; thus, salads are rich and nutritious. The life-study messages are like a salad that is made not with just one kind of vegetable but with all different kinds. However, we must have our staple food, our center. Christ as life is the center of the life-study messages, so when we read the life-study messages, they help us to grow strong and healthy in life.</p>
<p>Before 1974, we mainly emphasized releasing messages on one topic at a time through conferences. Later we realized that we should dig out the matter of life because life is the center. So from that time on, we began to dig out life from the Bible, book by book through the life-study messages. At present, we have dug out life from each book of the New Testament and even the Old Testament books of Genesis and Exodus. Although the Bible was written comprehensively, speaking much on many topics, it always has life as its center to clearly point out the way.</p>
<p>Even the short book of Ephesians with only six chapters is composed in a comprehensive way, speaking on many topics. For example, the book of Ephesians speaks of very high matters&mdash;matters which could not be any higher&mdash;such as God&rsquo;s selection in eternity and His predestinating us (1:4-5). It also speaks of very low matters&mdash;matters which could not be any lower&mdash;as in the word that those who steal should steal no more (4:28). If today we were to choose a topic and speak of God&rsquo;s calling and predestination, we would not also speak of such things as stealing. However, after the book of Ephesians speaks of such high matters, it suddenly inserts just such a sentence, telling those who steal to steal no more. It also tells the husbands to love their wives and tells the wives to submit to their husbands (5:25, 22). This proves that the Bible&rsquo;s way of speaking is comprehensive. Nevertheless, the Bible still has its center. When we use the life-study messages, we must firmly grasp this point and see that the Bible has an intrinsic central lane and also speaks comprehensively on many matters.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth, Life, the Church, and the Gospel-The Four Great Pillars in the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
