[3]  23 March 1, 1951 THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH
[4]  I would like to speak to the brothers a little more concerning the problem of the church.
[5]  If we want to determine whether or not the church in Tientsin is a church, all we have to do is see whether or not it receives all those who are saved in Tientsin.
[6]  The universal church receives all whom God has received in the whole world; a local church receives all whom God has received in a locality.
[7]  Does this mean that we must receive all believers in a locality without any reservations?
[8]  A church in a locality must not only receive all whom Christ has received in that locality, but must also exercise church discipline.
[9]  When a brother who has been received by the Lord commits something that requires the Lord to exclude him from fellowship, we too must exercise discipline upon him.
[10]  We should not say that we want all whom the Lord wants and all whom the Lord does not want.
[11]  If the Lord puts a certain one into the world, yet we put him into the church, we open a door to the world in the church.
[12]  First Corinthians 5 speaks of six different kinds of persons who are saved and have God's life, but they have indulged themselves and become a fornicator, a covetous man, a reviler, a drunkard, an idolater, and an extortioner v. 11 . Paul told the church in Corinth to "remove the evil man from among yourselves" v. 13 . The command in 1 Corinthians 5 does not say that we must put a brother away from among us as soon as he has sinned.
[13]  Whomever the Lord does not want in the church, we also must not want in the church.
[14]  This is the deceiver and the antichrist...Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God...If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!
[15]  If the Lord Jesus is not God manifest in the flesh, that is, if He is only flesh, then He is not God, and the Lord Jesus could not have accomplished redemption for us.
[16]  Furthermore, the most important matter for the church in a locality is that she must be inclusive, not exclusive.
[17]  The church must be inclusive in two aspects of its behavior and its doctrine.
[18]  First, we will consider the aspect of Christian behavior that the church should not exclude.
[19]  In Acts 20:27 Paul told the elders of Ephesus, "I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God," or "I did not shrink from declaring to you the perfect, complete will of God."
[20]  If the church in a locality is standing in the position of the church, she must not shrink from declaring the perfect, complete will of God.
[21]  We cannot expect that every brother will touch the perfect, complete will of God, but like Paul we must not shrink from or reject one truth concerning the perfect, complete will of God.
[22]  As soon as we do not believe in spiritual gifts, we cannot be the church in Shanghai; we can only be called "a church in Shanghai that does not believe in spiritual gifts."
[23]  2 Consider a greater matter, such as selling all to follow the Lord.
[24]  Suppose the brothers in Shanghai do not believe in selling everything, but instead believe in working diligently to earn money and taking out a certain percentage of it for distribution to the poor.
[25]  If one hundred brothers in Shanghai are moved by the Spirit of the Lord to sell everything and follow the Lord, they will feel that there is no place for them in this church.
[26]  If we have no way to include them, we are exclusive to them.
[27]  If we cannot include the brothers who have this portion of life, if we ostracize them, we can see that our church is both too small and it is maimed.
[28]  If it does not, these one hundred brothers will eventually form a church that sells all to follow the Lord, bringing forth one more sect.
[29]  4 Regarding the matter of holiness, many of God's children believe that once they believe in the Lord they are perfect.
[30]  Other children of God believe that they still need the second blessing in order to be perfect.
[31]  In the Bible some were made perfect once they were blessed, but some also were blessed a second or third time before they touched perfection.
[32]  If a church picks only the Scriptures it believes in, it is not standing in the position of the church but, in fact, in the position of a denomination.
[33]  But if some brothers have not seen it, we have to take the attitude of Romans 14 and wait for them to see it, because we must receive those whom the Lord receives.
[34]  In summarizing the above points, there are several basic principles.
[35]  First, the church must stand on the positive side of whatever is in the Bible and forbear the negative side.
[36]  If some are weak and unable to come up to what is in the Bible, the church needs to forbear.
[37]  If we have some special doctrine or some special emphasis, if we accept certain kinds of teaching at the expense of the rest of the children of God, we cannot be considered as the church.
[38]  If the church includes rather than excludes God's children, the church will not be responsible for brothers who desire to go another way, because it is they who are creating the division, not the church.
[39]  Whether or not a church can stand in the position of the church also depends upon whether she gives all the brothers and sisters the opportunity to work, that is, whether she gives all the brothers and sisters the opportunity to serve God.
[40]  First Corinthians 12:27 says, "Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually."
[41]  Following this it says, "And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues" v. 28 . It is wonderful that Paul asks in the next verse, "Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all have works of power?" v. 29 . Are all apostles? God is asking here.
[42]  Because there are prophets who want to occupy God's whole church, teachers who want to occupy God's whole church, and workers of miracles who want to occupy God's whole church, the Lord asks, "Are all prophets?
[43]  Even if everyone in the whole church does works of power, that is still not the church.
[44]  Finally, we absolutely must not cherish any thought of having a system.
[45]  We should not think for any reason that the truth and gospel of God only issue forth from our midst.
[46]  We do not necessarily go to many places to lead others, because God has His own leading in every place.
[47]  Suppose fifty brothers are standing on the ground of the church in a certain locality, and later, another fifty brothers in the same place become enlightened and clearly see the ground of the church.
[48]  After I returned to Peking, I fasted and prayed for one day with Brother Fang, Brother Xing, and Brother Sun. We wept loudly and felt very ashamed that we had not attained to the will of the Father.
[49]  We all felt that we would not be able to get through inwardly if we did not practice this.
[50]  We had a conference in Peizhuang of Rongho for seven days beginning on December 28, 1950.
[51]  We invited a total of fourteen brothers and sisters from Yitang of Linjin to come preach His gospel in one accord with us.
[52]  When we went out this time, we felt that we learned something on the way and in each assembly.
[53]  As Brother Chu mentioned, we did not have any assurance when we left.
[54]  In the few days before we left, we prayed before the Lord that if He would not work, we had no way.
[55]  Hoping for the Opportunity of the Third Session Lanchow
[56]  Since receiving the material for the edification of new believers which you sent me, not only have the brothers and sisters who are new believers been edified greatly, but the brothers and sisters who believed long ago feel as if they have been well-fed and satisfied as well.
[57]  May the Lord have mercy on me that the day would come soon when I would be able to follow at your heels and receive the word you receive from God directly from your mouth.
[58]  Over the past nine months we have seen something of the Lord's goal and plan as well as His requirements for us.
[59]  We really cannot keep up; we can only prostrate ourselves in worship to Him and rely on Him to walk in the way set before us.
[60]  After a conference with Brother Fang Ai-guang from Peking, we established the Lord's table on January 29 of this year.
[61]  We preached the gospel during the first month of the lunar calendar, and the Lord gradually has added the saved ones to the church.
[62]  Through eight fellowship meetings in Mei County concerning the church service and the way of the gospel, the brothers have gained the benefit and have been revived.
[63]  There are more than ten brothers and sisters in Bangkok, but we still do not have the Lord's table.
[64]  The brothers and sisters are all burning and hoping that the Lord would send some here to work and lead us.
[65]  From now on we hope that God will lead us more in His will, and we also hope that the brothers and sisters everywhere will pray much for us so that we would be strong to work for the Lord.
[66]  Going On in the Light of the Lord's Grace
[67]  Your brothers and sisters in Dalian prayed for over half a year crying out that God's servants would come help us.
[68]  When He led His believers to go positively in the way of the church, He did not treat us poorly.
[69]  They held a fifteen-day edification conference and showed us the light which the God of glory has given His church in this age.
[70]  Through your labor, we have received six copies of The Open Door.
[71]  I was led by the Lord to leave Sian and return to Shanba on November 8.
[72]  I stayed in Peking for more than ten days; then I spent six days in Guisui, thirteen days in Salachi, and seven days in Baotou.
[73]  When we see the Lord, we fall, our views fall, our personality falls, our prejudice falls, our good judgment falls, our good criticism falls, our great zeal for the Lord falls, our work for the Lord falls, our thoughts fall, our spiritual haughtiness falls, our falseness falls, and our incorrectness falls; everything falls inwardly and outwardly!
[74]  The county seat of Changching is about seventy miles from Tsinan, and there are fifteen brothers and sisters who were baptized in Tsinan.
[75]  Because transportation is inconvenient, we cannot often go to the meetings in Tsinan.
[76]  The church moved out of the place in Taoxiang this spring, and we have been continuing the table, fellowship, and prayer meetings in the Lan's home at Ru-Nan village.
[77]  Since we began this last month, the Lord has opened a door for the gospel.
[78]  Although the brothers who speak for the Lord are very weak, He has given us a number of saved ones, and the numbers have not diminished from when we met in the hall in Taoxiang.
[79]  Thank the Lord that the situation of the church here is very good.
[80]  Thank God for giving us the book on the edification of the new believers that we could understand some of the truth and know the importance of serving God.
[81]  24 April 15, 1951 THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH
[82]  We must be clear which one is in accordance with God's will, which one is scriptural, which one is the proper way for the church, and which one we must take.
[83]  When we see one that is of God, we must reject the ones that are not of God.
[84]  We must take notice of one condition that prevailed after the Roman Catholic Church came into being.
[85]  Why did no brothers or sisters in the church stand up to deal with the situation for eleven hundred years?
[86]  If it is only one church, we must say that the local church is wrong, and even the many denominations in Protestantism must also confess that they are wrong.
[87]  Does the Bible ever say that there is only one church on the earth?
[88]  The Bible shows us that God establishes churches on the earth, that is, one church in each locality.
[89]  Here is an important matter which we must notice before God: In the Bible, God has never united the churches in the many localities together as one church.
[90]  The Bible never indicates that the churches in a province should unite as one church, that the churches in a country should unite as one church, or that the churches on a continent should unite as one church.
[91]  The Bible does not use the phrase the church of God when it refers to the churches on earth; it does not use the phrase the church of the saints.
[92]  There is a second kind of unity today which can be found throughout the world, and it is called "spiritual" unity.
[93]  What is the definition of this spiritual unity, and from where does it originate?
[94]  This view creates two problems: we have just seen the problem from the viewpoint of the state church; now we must see it from the viewpoint of the dissenters, many of whom did not approve of the state church.
[95]  They not only disapproved but also stood up to oppose the errors of the state church.
[96]  Since people already have the denominations today, what should we do?
[97]  We have already testified that it is not good for God's children to have denominations and divisions.
[98]  The first factor is state churches, in which a small church was found within a large church, a true church within a false church, a church of reality within a church of externality.
[99]  The basic principle for us to serve God is that if we feel the denominations are right, we must support them; if we feel they are wrong, we must break them down.
[100]  For a clearer understanding, I will give an illustration.
[101]  The Bible shows that God accepted Abel's offering but not Cain's Gen 4:2-7 .
[102]  This is very simple and has but one significance: What man did before he sinned was acceptable to God, but nothing can be worse before God than to do the same thing after man sinned.
[103]  Now we will look at the third kind of unity, that is, the unity in the Scriptures.
[104]  The Scriptures show us that the church is the Body of Christ and that there is only one Body.
[105]  The Scriptures also show us that God through the Holy Spirit dwells in the church and that the Holy Spirit is one Spirit.
[106]  If we only consider it as the church, we may not feel that it matters whether or not there is some division, thinking that little harm is done even though there is a little division here and a little division there.
[107]  But the Word of God also tells us that the church of Christ is the Body of Christ.
[108]  Our brothers say that we should have a "spiritual" fellowship, a "spiritual" unity.
[109]  Although we acknowledge the fellowship and unity of Ephesians and Colossians before the Lord, we must remember that this kind of fellowship and unity can easily become idealistic.
[110]  Before the Lord, we need to see that the unity of Christians in the Bible is not spoken of in just the Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians but also in two other Epistles: 1 Corinthians and Philippians.
[111]  in a Certain Time and at a Certain Place
[112]  We have just seen the negative view of division; now let us see the positive view of unity as is demanded in the Bible.
[113]  The one Body with the one Holy Spirit is discussed: "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ" v. 12 . "If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body.
[114]  And if the ear should say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body....And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you" vv.
[115]  In Corinth there were envy and strife; so Paul said that love does not envy, does not seek its own things or take account of evil, and does not divide or separate.
[116]  Let me tell you that God says to the brothers in Shanghai: Love the brothers in Shanghai first and the brothers in Nanking later.
[117]  Today we need to add one more word: "If we cannot love the brothers whom we see, we cannot love the brothers whom we cannot see."
[118]  Now we shall go on to see the reason we stress the expression of unity in locality.
[119]  In 1 Corinthians for example, which we have just read, there is a very good word: "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church" 4:17 .
[120]  Now let us see the importance of the boundary of locality.
[121]  Therefore, we must see clearly before God that in the Bible there is one locality with one church, or in short, one locality, one church.
[122]  When it swings to one side, it is wrong because it causes three or four localities to have one church or the whole world to have one church.
[123]  If I am right with the brothers in Sian, I am in the church in Sian; if I am not right with the brothers in Sian, I am still in the church in Sian.
[124]  If I am a believer of congregationalism and I am right with the brothers, then I will break bread with them; if I am not, we will break bread separately because you love your group and I love my group.
[125]  Suppose there are a few brothers with whom the church really seeks oneness.
[126]  Within these few days I have heard someone say, "We can talk and fellowship, even though you can still have your church, I have my church, and he has his church.
[127]  I must tell these brothers emphatically that there is only one church in one locality.
[128]  If we do not pay attention to the unity in the locality, then other kinds of unity are vain words because they are not found in the Bible.
[129]  A brother asked, "As the word concerning the unity of the church goes out from us at this time, people may very easily misunderstand that we are asking others to unite with us.
[130]  In order to answer this question, we must let them know the basic problem: Before the Lord we can yield in certain things, but there are other matters in which we can never compromise.
[131]  It is not just a matter of saying things one way as opposed to another; we cannot alter the Word of God.
[132]  We can yield in our own position, but toward brothers who are in the denominations, whether in a congregational church or a united church, there are things which we cannot compromise.
[133]  Brother Niu Shu-guang in Hangchow saw the Lord's way a long time ago in northern China, but like other brothers, he tended toward the so-called "spiritual" unity, thinking that it was all right as long as he did not have sectarianism or division in his heart.
[134]  Recently, he was reading Ephesians, and when he came to the phrase all arrive at the oneness in verse 4:13, the Lord particularly showed him the word arrive in arrive at the oneness.
[135]  By the Lord's mercy, Brother Zuo-xin and I went to Talien, Shenyang and held ten-day conferences.
[136]  The Lord gave us grace, and His word made the way clearer.
[137]  We really could not meet the need in each place, but could only humble ourselves at God's feet and ask for more bread for our friends in the way.
[138]  Since the beginning of the year, we have seen the Lord's presence and blessing.
[139]  Every meeting is very fresh, and we meet the Lord Himself in every fellowship meeting.
[140]  A few young, immature brothers here have received mercy from the Lord and much care from the brothers in sending the publications.
[141]  Because we have been touched by the Lord's love in shedding His blood and dying for us, we feel terrible if we do not remember Him.
[142]  37 January 1, 1951 LIFE OUT OF DEATH Life out of death dear Master, is it spoken
[143]  And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth; I being in the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren" Gen 24:26-27 .
[144]  And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
[145]  And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance" 34:5-9 .
[146]  If we want to learn to walk before God, we will have no future unless we can learn to worship the ways of God not just to worship God.
[147]  It says that when he came unto Nahor, the city of Abraham, he prayed, "O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.
[148]  Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master" vv.
[149]  Giving glory to God does not mean that we meet with a situation which turns out well after prayer and then we say that we were lucky, that things fell into place at the right time, or that we did things well ourselves.
[150]  We have said before and we will say again that if we really want to worship God, we will find again and again that He gives us many opportunities to worship Him.
[151]  Our second illustration is found in Exodus 4, when God sent Moses to tell the children of Israel that He had visited them and would deliver them out of the bondage of Egypt.
[152]  Verse 31 says, "And when the people heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped."
[153]  Do we have a group of people worshipping God for His ways?
[154]  Perhaps the children of Israel said, "We have been slaves for so many years, God does not care," just as we may say, "I have been sick for so long, God would not heal me.
[155]  But when we think of the way in which He forgave our sins, the process He went through to justify us, and the pains He took to pull us out of the muck and mire from among the thousands of other people around us, and when we think of how we happened to be in a certain church and happened to hear a particular gospel message preached by just the right person, and how that enabled us to receive Him, we remember God's ways.
[156]  In Exodus 32 34 we read of a serious difficulty that Moses encountered.
[157]  God gave him two tablets of stone with the Ten Commandments written on them.
[158]  This provoked God to great displeasure and He said to Moses: "Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
[159]  And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiffnecked people: now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation" 32:7-10 .
[160]  In the book of Joshua, God commissioned Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land of Canaan.
[161]  In 1 Samuel 1 we truly touch the spirit of worship.
[162]  Finally, we need to see that God sometimes refuses prayer because He wants to break us, like breaking David, or wants to vindicate Himself and His holiness.
[163]  Brothers and sisters, I do not know what you have gone through, but I do know that God is doing a stripping work on many people, causing them to lose much and blocking their ways.
[164]  Here, I would like to add another principle for living: the principle of sin.
[165]  You could say that everyone in the world can live according to at least three principles: they can live by sin, or they can live by right and wrong, or they can live by life.
[166]  When we feel right inwardly, when we feel the life inside of us moving, when we are strong within and sense the anointing, we know that we have life.
[167]  His only excuse was that he was two years older than I. I could argue with any other reason, but I could not argue with the fact that he was two years older than I. I could not get around this argument, but inwardly I did not agree with him.
[168]  The greatest error among God's children is that many people determine right and wrong by what they see.
[169]  Therefore, they do not know what is really right and what is really wrong.
[170]  I recall a story of two brothers, both Christians, who had a rice paddy.
[171]  Sometimes we come across a brother who has acted very foolishly.
[172]  According to what is proper, we should strongly exhort or rebuke him.
[173]  O Lord, we stand before You beseeching You to speak again.
[174]  Every time we open our mouths or make decisions, cause us to come before You and ask if our decision is according to right and wrong or according to the inward leading of life.
[175]  38 March 1, 1951 THE OLD RUGGED CROSS On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
[176]  I would like to bring out the matter of multiplying the five loaves Mark 6:35-44; 8:1-9 with respect to God's blessing.
[177]  It is not a matter of how many loaves we have in our hands, but whether or not God has blessed them.
[178]  Even if we had ten times or even one hundred times more, we still would not have enough to feed four or five thousand people.
[179]  Sooner or later, we must be brought to the point of seeing that it is not a matter of what we can pull out of our storage shed, nor is it a matter of how great our gift is or how much power we have.
[180]  The basic concern today is that we must learn to live in a way that does not hinder God's blessing.
[181]  Some habits force God to withhold His blessing, and these must be eliminated.
[182]  If the work is not going well, if the brothers and sisters are in a poor condition, or if the number of saved ones is not increasing, we should not use the environment or certain people as an excuse.
[183]  Oh, that blessing might flow from us as it flowed from Abraham.
[184]  I believe that there will soon be a great turn in the gospel work.
[185]  We do not want to frustrate God from blessing us greatly.
[186]  We often may do something right, but what can we do if God does not bless us when we do things right?
[187]  If we only look for results based on what we are, if we only look for a little fruit, and if we do not hope for great results, we run the risk of losing God's blessing.
[188]  We must say to the Lord, "Based on what we are, we should not obtain any results, but, Lord, for the sake of Your name, Your church, and Your way, we hope You will give something to us."
[189]  It is good to work and do things, but we must have our capacity increased.
[190]  We must come before God to see that we do not expect the results of our labor, but expect God's blessing.
[191]  As we read 2 Corinthians carefully before God, we seem to meet two persons Paul in himself and Paul in Christ.
[192]  If we summarized Paul's message in this book, we could cover everything with his words in chapter four, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels."
[193]  After reading these words before God, we spontaneously will see under His enlightenment that the earthen vessel does not hinder the treasure from shining.
[194]  Many people have a concept of an ideal Christian.
[195]  Please remember that this ideal was created by us, not by God.
[196]  That kind of ideal Christian does not exist, nor does God want us to be such.
[197]  Before God, I confessed that I had been empowered, but I was angry because I did not know the reason God was treating me this way.
[198]  Today I would like to say that no Christian has an earthen vessel that is earthy enough to prohibit the Lord's treasure from being manifested.
[199]  No matter how weak we are, remember that the Lord's treasure is manifested in it.
[200]  Finally, I would like to say that I especially thank God because no human weakness can limit God's power.
[201]  We tend to think that if there is sorrow, there should not be joy; if there are tears, there should not be praise; if there is weakness, there should not be power; if there is pressing on every side, there should be constriction; if there is casting down, there should be destruction; and if there are doubts, we should be unable to believe.
[202]  God wants us to arrive at the point where we see that everything human is just an earthen vessel to contain God's treasure.
[203]  CONTENTS: The contents describe the light received before God and the lessons learned in order to help God's children have practical growth in the aspect of life.
[204]  39 April 15, 1951 JESUS IS ALL THE WORLD TO ME Jesus is all the world to me:
[205]  CHRIST IS GOD'S MATTERS AND THINGS Scripture Reading: John 1:29; 6:53; 8:12, 24, 28; 11:25; 14:6; 1 Cor 1:30; Col 3:4; 1 Tim 1:1; Psa 27:1 God's Goal and Means Christ
[206]  God's goal is Christ, and Christ is also God's means.
[207]  God uses Christ as the means to reach the goal, which is Christ.
[208]  There is one difference between these two books: Ephesians shows us that according to the economy of the fullness of the times, God wants to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth 1:10 ; Colossians shows us that God has not only made Christ to be Head over all things, but God has made Him all and in all 1:18; 3:11b .
[209]  I would like to point out that not only does the Lord Jesus' own word testify to this, but Paul said the same thing.
[210]  He knew the Lord, and he showed us one very interesting thing.
[211]  If I stand here and say to you, "The Lord Jesus is our Savior," you will respond, "That is right.
[212]  Today we are Christians, and we are saved; God has given Christ to us to be our life.
[213]  But we constantly ask for one thing after another; we ask for one, two, three, ten, fifty, one hundred, ten thousand, one million, and ten million things.
[214]  We can find one fact in our spiritual experience.
[215]  When we first believed in the Lord, we felt that we lacked love, and we asked God for love.
[216]  I may say that knowing Christ is to know Him through matters and things.
[217]  Some people can say that they know Christ as their patience, Christ as their love, or Christ as their humility; this is knowing Christ.
[218]  Many people know Christ as the Lord of justification, but they still fear God and do not know that Christ is their righteousness.
[219]  CHRIST ONLY NOT MATTERS OR THINGS Scripture Reading: John 8:28; Col 3:3-4; 1:16-20 Man's Thoughts and Demands
[220]  But different people have different degrees of knowledge of God.
[221]  Among God's children, some know the Lord Jesus as one of the many gifts of God, while others know Him as God's unique gift.
[222]  In other words, we think that we are lacking just a part; we think that we are lacking only a little and that as long as we can fill up that little part, we will be perfect.
[223]  Many Christians have not seen that there are not many things in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.
[224]  There is no patience in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.
[225]  Those who serve the Lord want to serve Him more.
[226]  But the strange thing is that when we do these things, we often do not touch life.
[227]  While we are serving the Lord, while we are working and planning to do this and that for the Lord, we become weakened, and something within strongly rebukes us.
[228]  What does it mean for Christ to be our matters and things?
[229]  What is the significance of having Christ as our matters and things?
[230]  Lord, we confess that our eyes are blind; we do not see clearly enough.
[231]  We know about things, but we do not know Christ.
[232]  Lord, we pray that You would open our eyes so that Christ would become real to us, so that the things will pass away and life will fill us.
[233]  Lord, we pray for deliverance from the many things, so that we can know the Lord as a person.
[234]  May the Lord who is our person become our things so that everything in us becomes living and full of life, and so that others would see Christ when they see the things.
[235]  Do not allow us to deceive ourselves, to think that we have seen it when we have not seen it, to think that we have touched the right way when we really have not touched it, to think that we are full of life when we are full of behavior, and to think that we are full of Christ when we are full of things.
