<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In John</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Concerning the Flowing Triune God</H2><P>John 1 through 7 is concerning the flowing Triune God to be the living water for the enjoyment of the believers in Christ. We enjoy the Triune God with the Father as the fountain, the Son as the spring, and the Spirit as the river flowing into the totality of the eternal life, the New Jerusalem (4:14b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Concerning the Mingling and the Incorporation of the Processed and Consummated Triune God with His Regenerated and Transformed Elect and the Issues</H2><P>John 14 through 17 is concerning the mingling and the incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated and transformed elect and the issues. The issues of this mingling and incorporation are the believers' participating in the Father's house, in the Son's vine, and in the Spirit's child to be in the oneness of the Body of Christ incorporated with the oneness of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Christ's Divine and Mystical Teachings Nourishing Us for Our Growth and Maturity in His Divine Life</H2><P>All these divine and mystical teachings of our great Shepherd and Comforter are not only His unveiling and enlightening but also His nourishing to us for our growth and maturity in His divine life that the eternal economy of God may be consummated through us.</P><P>Christ came to seek the sinners that they might have His life and have it abundantly, so we should not go out to reach people in a shallow and empty way. We should go out full of the divine life so that people may have Christ's life through us. We must be filled to the brim with Christ's life so that His life flows out of us to be dispensed into others. We need to be saturated and soaked with Christ inwardly and outwardly. In this sense, we become Christ and the eternal life because we have drunk of God as the fountain, emerging into the spring, and gushing up into a river of life to flow out of our innermost being.</P><P>We also need to teach the divine truths to people to strengthen our shepherding and reach its goal. We may share with a theological professor concerning the four ins in John 14:17-20. Our going out as Christ to give people life and truth will attract and convince them. We need to be discipled to be such a Christ. On the one hand, we should shepherd people by dispensing the divine life into them. On the other hand, we should teach them the divine truths in the divine, mystical realm. This is my burden.</P><P>If we practice these things, there will be a real revival in the Lord's recovery. We must be shepherds with the loving and forgiving heart of our Father God in His divinity and the shepherding and finding spirit of our Savior Christ in His humanity. We also must have the heavenly vision of all the divine and mystical teachings of Christ. Shepherding and teaching are the obligation of the vital groups and the basic way ordained by God to build up the Body of Christ consummating the New Jerusalem.</P>
