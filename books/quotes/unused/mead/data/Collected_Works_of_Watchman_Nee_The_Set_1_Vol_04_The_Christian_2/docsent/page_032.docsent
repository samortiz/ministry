   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE SEVEN EPISTLES</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have mentioned that the seven churches were actual historical churches at their time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition, they also represent the conditions and history of all the churches on the earth at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Strictly speaking, these seven epistles were sent to the seven designated churches of that day to exhort the churches to hold on to their good works and to repent of their evil ways.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, these seven churches also represent all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, these seven epistles represent Christ's view concerning His church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As such, they form part of the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that these seven epistles are prophecies concerning the history of all the churches on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some have said that Revelation 2 and 3 are "a collection of love letters."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although this description does not fully represent these two chapters, it does reveal how concerned the Lord is for His church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These seven epistles are the last written communication from the Lord to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How crucial this is!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But how few are those who would carefully read through these seven epistles!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That Christ would personally and directly send these seven epistles to His churches indicates that they are of special value and deserve His servants' special attention.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But how many actually care for the Lord's heart?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These seven epistles are divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know that at the end of each epistle there is a promise to the overcomer and an admonishing warning to him who has an ear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Bible the number seven is often divided into four and three, but in these seven epistles, it is divided into three and four, the first three epistles forming one section and the last four another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This division is as follows: in the first three epistles the sequence is first the hearing of what the Spirit says to those who have an ear and then the promise of reward to the overcomer, but in the last four epistles this sequence is reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is very meaningful to divide the number seven into three and four in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Three is a number of God, and four is a number of man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that the church will fall from her position.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the beginning, the church had God's glory and grace, but at the end, she is filled with man's traditions and organization.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before we examine the prophecies and spiritual instructions of these seven epistles individually, let us first consider some general points regarding them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1 The recipients of these seven epistles were the messengers of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As I have mentioned earlier, these messengers were not pastors of churches nor were they other officials.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, they were those in every church who were saved by the Lord's blood, who were willing to bear responsibility for the Lord, and who were serving the Lord faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They had received gifts from God to influence and to build up the church where they were.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord regarded them as His lights; they were shining as the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The rise or fall of the churches was their responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord raise us up to be the messengers of His churches!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May we serve the Lord faithfully!</S>
