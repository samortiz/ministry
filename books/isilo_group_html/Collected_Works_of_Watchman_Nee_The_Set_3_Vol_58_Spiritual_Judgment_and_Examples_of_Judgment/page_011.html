We can begin talking to them and leading them on the way to deliverance and healing. It is easy to speak about this process, but when we are confronted with practical problems, we have to be able to open others' eyes. In order for others to experience deliverance, we must have the adequate experience ourselves. Furthermore, we must be able to relate this experience clearly and thoroughly to others so that they will receive the help, light, and deliverance. We are frustrated in rendering help to others because we are short in experience and short in utterance. If both our experience and utterance are adequate, others will see the light. A few years ago, I was not able to render help to a brother because my own experience was short. He was strong-willed, arrogant, and quick-tempered. Many people have a quick temper, but they are not arrogant. This brother was strong-willed as well as quick-tempered. It was not easy to deal with him. Having a strong will is not disastrous when it is coupled with a well-tempered emotion. In such a case the problem is confined to the person himself; when he loses his temper, he only has to confess his sins. But if a person has a strong will that is coupled with an impulsive emotion and extreme subjectivity, he will be driven to act by impulse. He also will insist on his impulse without any thought of repentance whatsoever. This combination of traits is a great problem. Some people only have one problem. Others have two or three which affect each other and complicate the issue. In pathology, when two diseases in a person do not affect each another, a cure to both is simple. But if they affect each other, they are harder to heal, and the sickness can become more serious. The same can be said of human nature. We have to understand the interaction of different dispositions within a person. A person who is strong in his will and also arrogant and quick-tempered requires strong and severe dealings.</p><p>After we know the condition of a brother, there are two ways to help him.</p><h2 class="head2">Exhortation</h2><p>The first way to help a brother is by exhortation. We should point out the way of deliverance to him. Some people have never seen any light. They are blind to themselves all the time, and no one has ever said an honest word to them. As we talk to them, we should tell them what we have seen. We have to tell them our experience and let them know that they should experience the dealings and the discipline of the Holy Spirit. We have to show them that their pathway is not a straight one, that they are living by the mind and the emotion, and that their spirit is not strong. In addition, their rejection of the discipline of the Holy Spirit in many areas has resulted in their many problems with God. If the light we render is clear, we will be able to save them out of their condition. We cannot be unclear in ourselves. Light always brings in deliverance as well as liberation. We have to point out that they have not accepted the discipline of the Holy Spirit in this and that matter. Our word of exhortation has to be very positive. It cannot be general, and it must be very accurate. We should point out a few things to them to prove our point. Committing accidental mistakes is not a frequent occurrence for a person. Most of the time we commit dispositional and temperamental mistakes. Those who are slow are always slow. Those who are quick are always quick. Dispositional or temperamental mistakes relate to the person. We are here to help others correct their dispositional or temperamental mistakes, not their accidental mistakes.</p><p>Our help to others should not be general. It has to be very specific, and it must follow a definite order. First, we must make note of the facts. We should have a notebook in which we write down the mistakes of others. For example, a brother may speak inaccurately habitually. The first time we hear him we should write down what he said and where he said it. If it is a dispositional mistake, he will surely repeat the same mistake. We should write down such occurrences again and again. After ten or twenty times, perhaps we will be convinced that his mistake is a dispositional one. When the opportunity arises at the proper time, we should point out to him that his words are not accurate. Second, we have to be strengthened in our inner being. We need to build up ourselves in God before we can have the strength to help others. As the entries in our notebook increase, the strength in our inner being should also increase. Our inward condition must grow sharper, higher, and stronger. We have to wait until our inward condition is strong enough before we can extend help to others. A brother may lie once, twice, or many times. Every time we catch him lying we should write down the occasion. As his mistakes increase, the pressure within us to help him should also increase. At a certain point we will be ready to deal with him. Third, we have to wait for a suitable time to speak to him. As time goes on, the burden within us will increase. When the indignation reaches a certain level, we should pray for God to open up an opportunity to speak to him. As we speak to him, we should note the following: 1) We should say to him, "I need to say a few words to you. You do not have to answer me. The words may be right or they may be wrong. But you should take my words and consider them before the Lord." Do not give him a chance to speak. 2) We should continue, saying, "These words are for your own good. I have no desire to meddle with your affairs. I do not interfere with others' business. I am doing this to help you." 3) We can also add, "I say this without any personal motive of my own." We should then point out examples of his lying and let him see that he is accustomed to lying. We should say, "You have to repent before the Lord. Otherwise, you will not have a way to go on." While we are speaking, we should not turn our face aside. Some problems, such as lying, need to be addressed in a solemn way. Other problems only need to be addressed in a light way. Serious sins have to be addressed seriously, while trivial sins need to be addressed lightly.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
