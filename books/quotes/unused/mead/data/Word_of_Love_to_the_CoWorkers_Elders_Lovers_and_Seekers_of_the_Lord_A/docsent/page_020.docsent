   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being a Person Loving the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Living for the Lord, and Renouncing His Self, Natural Life, Preference, and Ambition</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One whom we follow should be a person loving the Lord, living for the Lord, and renouncing his self, natural life, preference, and ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regardless of how good one is and how high his spiritual capacity might be, you must ask, Is this one to whom I have been attracted a person who all the time renounces his self, his natural life, his preference, and ambition?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ambition is sometimes hidden, but every man s preference is always exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If one says he likes to do things in a certain way, that is his preference.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes people have exposed their preference by coming to me and saying, Brother Lee, you are too loose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We know what the right way is, but when the brothers fellowship with you and propose a certain way, you always agree with them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is true; I have often done this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Deep within I know what the right way is, but there is not only one way to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have illustrated this by the way we drive a car.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once three brothers intended to drive to Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first one proposed a way to go, the second one proposed a better way, and the third one proposed yet another way that would save time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The three argued for so long that by the time they finished arguing, they could have been there no matter what way they went.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why I often say to others, Simply do it any way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the same in the way we take care of our training.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>People consider that this is Brother Lee s training, but in actuality I let others do many small things in any way they can; any way is right.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to keep a peaceful spirit, we all have to learn how to give in. In order to keep peace, do not argue and have no preference.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not think that it saves time to discuss everything first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many husbands have learned this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many times to discuss things with their wives takes twice as long as doing the thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To discuss not only wastes time, but it often causes the husband and wife to become angry with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The best way is for a husband to say, Dear, whatever you say is good; go ahead and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not easy to be this way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you are a strong man, no one can change your preference.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You insist that you are right and that your way is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the church life in the Lord s recovery we all have to learn how to give in, even if it means that we suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may ask, Don t we need to protect the recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Dear ones, if you try to protect the recovery, that is your mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Can you protect the recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee said once that no one can protect God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only God Himself can protect His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who are we?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To insist upon your preference is a real damage to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Your intention may be to protect the recovery from mistakes, but in actuality your insistence on your preference is the biggest mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To give in is right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can only do this by the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the Lord s grace, who can give up his preference?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No one can.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those dear ones especially who are born with a strong character must be aware of their strong character in insisting on their preference.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Being a Person Holding the Complete Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>of the Entire Holy Scriptures Properly</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>without Any Twisting and Deforming</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One whom we follow must hold the complete revelation of the entire holy Scriptures properly without any twisting and deforming.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The word twist is used in 2 Peter 3:15-16, in which Peter says, Our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you, as also in all his letters, speaking in them concerning these things, in which some things are hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist, as also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to my observation, deforming is different from twisting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To deform the truth is simply to change it a little or add something.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To put a small cap on my head, for example, deforms the appearance of my head.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not cut off anything from the truth, and do not add anything to it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Take the truth as it is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you do not take the truth as it is, you may say that you are not twisting the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yes, you may not twist them, but you are deforming them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Concerning one whom you follow, you must check how he handles the truth.</S>
