   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAYER IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every time we pray before God, we need to deeply experience death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, you may pray for the church or for the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you remain for a time somewhat quiet before the Lord, you will have an inner realization that there are so many natural and human elements in your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You will discern the presence of human ideas, desires, inclinations, choices, and demands.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At this time, if you are careless and negligent, you will feel as if you are offering a prayer of strange fire or strange incense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not the incense of the sweet spices which God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You will sense that God will not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And you will also condemn yourself within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have learned the lessons precisely, once you come to this point, you will not be able to utter a word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First you need to pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You need the cross to do a separating and purifying work, so that the natural things may be thoroughly removed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, you will have no way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we first got saved, it was very easy for us to open our mouth before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seemed that we were very relaxed and prayed freely for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But gradually, as we learned the lessons, we could no longer pray for many of these things before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later, as we knelt to pray, we had the inner sensation that in those matters we still had our inclinations, desires, choices, prejudices, ideas, and biases.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes we notice that two brothers are at odds with one another, and we intend to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But as we are about to open our mouth, we realize that there is something not right within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our emotion is moved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have some prejudice in the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Unless we deal with our situation first, we will not be able to pray before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Also, in praying for our material needs, often we discover that we are very much in ourselves and not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we simply cannot utter any words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such experiences prove that we have learned a great deal before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When those who have not learned the lessons go before God, they are really daring and are not afraid to pray for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I know of someone who went before God and prayed, "O God, You see how much that person has hurt me; You must stretch out Your hand to give him a heavier blow than he has given me."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And some sisters who have been offended by their husbands would pray with weeping and crying, "O Lord, You must vindicate me; You must extend Your hand to deal with my husband."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By listening to such prayers, you know those individuals probably have not even entered the gate to the outer court of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is why they are so daring.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a person has really entered into the Holy Place, touched the altar of incense, and learned some lessons, he would not be able to pray in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times he is unable to pray, but can only groan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, I am convinced that when Romans 8:26 says, "The Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered," it is due to our ignorance of the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times we pray in ourselves, and when the Spirit forbids us within, we do not know how else to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose we go to visit a brother who is sick, and we are very clear inside that God's hand is upon him for some reason.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But his wife, who is also a sister, naturally hopes that her husband will be quickly healed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At such a time it is very hard for us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes we would try to do her a favor by praying, "O Lord, You are omnipotent, and You are able to raise the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>O Lord, Your intention is to give peace and not to send woes; surely You will cause our brother to be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While you are praying in this way, you know you are merely trying to please her.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ordinarily, under such circumstances, we have no way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot say, "O Lord, we thank and praise You, for it is You Who are doing a work in this brother."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we do not dare pray in this way, we can only groan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because we cannot measure up to the principle of death and resurrection, many times the Holy Spirit has to pray with groanings in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since we cannot pray for him in either a negative or a positive way, we can only allow the Spirit to intercede in us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
