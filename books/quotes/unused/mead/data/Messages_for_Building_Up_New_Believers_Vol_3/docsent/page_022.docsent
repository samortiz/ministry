   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us come next to the matter of food.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 2 God gave man food to sustain his life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This happened before man sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The matter of food is found as early as Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Clothing began in Genesis 3, but food began prior to man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God ordained that man should partake of fruits of every kind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before man sinned, the God-ordained food for man was fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. The Need for Meat after the Fall</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Genesis 3, after man fell, God gave man herbs for food and ordained that man would eat bread in the sweat of his face.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was God s food for man in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we come to Genesis 4, God put His seal of approval upon Abel but not Cain, even though no ordinance of any kind had yet been instituted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Cain was a farmer, and Abel was a keeper of sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abel shepherded sheep, and God s seal of approval was upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He offered sacrifices to God, and God accepted him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Cain was a tiller of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He brought the produce of the land to God, but God did not accept his sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Genesis 4 does not say anything about God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when we come to Genesis 9, God gave the animals to man for food v. 3 , just as He had given fruit to man for food in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sacrificing Life to Preserve Life</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why did God give animals to man for food?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, this indicates that man has a need for food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man s need for food before the fall was different from his need for food after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must understand the meaning of food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Food sustains our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a man does not eat, he will die.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one can live and survive without eating.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In addition to eating herbs, vegetables, and fruits, God ordained that man should take meat in order to live and survive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, God shows us that after sin entered the world, life must be sacrificed to preserve life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is the need for an animal to lose its life to maintain our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After sin entered this world, there was a need for the shedding of blood to maintain life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason that man s food after the fall is different from his food before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christians should not be vegetarians; they should be free to take meat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This does not mean that meat will necessarily do our body any good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether or not it is good for our body is a different thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not medical researchers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Researchers claim that animal protein is better than vegetable protein.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The basic principle with us is that since sin has entered the world, man can no longer have life without the sacrifice of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After man sinned, he could no longer receive life without death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Life can only come through death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without death, man cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order for man to live, there is the need for the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we have death, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the basic principle of eating after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since the time of Abel, and in particular after the flood, God placed this way before men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being a vegetarian is a subconscious declaration that we can live without death, that we can live without the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By eating meat, we are indicating that we cannot live without death and the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is this principle clear?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the reason that God gave animals to man for food after the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man can no longer have life without the loss of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ gave up His life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we can receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 14 indicates that some people still believed that they could be vegetarians like Adam before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some of them only ate vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul told us not to criticize these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He told us not to stop them or to condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who eat meat should not judge those who do not, and those who do not eat meat should not judge those who do.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, Paul pointed out one thing: Those who only eat vegetables are weak v. 2 . Do not criticize them for their weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But this does not mean that vegetarianism is right.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It only means that we do not want to embarrass others over the matter of food.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, we must realize that Christian redemption involves life out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before there can be life, there must first be death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Vegetables alone are not enough; death must precede life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Life is sustained through death.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a fundamental Christian principle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some may be weak in their conscience and may only eat vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not expose their weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But a Christian s stand is that meat is needed because it sustains life.</S>
