   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 20 Date:July 20, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER J. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I studied in a non-Christian school and joined my classmates and teachers in opposing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1934 I attended an evangelistic meeting and was touched to accept the Lord one night.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After I believed in the Lord, I prayed with tears for my unbelieving family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My father was put into prison for his business, and my mother became sick from anxiety over my father; she vomited blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I became quite worried and wept often.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In one revival meeting, I consecrated myself to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later I met with the church in Tung-An, Fukien, and was baptized in 1938.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My father stayed in prison for six years and accepted the Lord during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Two years after my mother became sick, she passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After staying in jail for six years, my father was found not guilty and released.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of my father's bankruptcy and my mother's death, I could not pray for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One day the Lord told me that I had to humble myself under His mighty hand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For three years I stayed quietly at home.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The deep shock stripped me of all burden for the gospel; I could not open my mouth anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In April of 1947 my family was robbed by bandits.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank God for His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was spared from any danger.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Later Brother Nee allowed me to come to Foochow to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the Lord's mercy that I can be on the mountain now to receive the training.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the four Gospels we see many people being healed yet receiving no spiritual blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their physical eyes were opened, but the eyes of their heart were still closed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The four thousand and five thousand who ate the fish and the bread were fed materially, yet they were not fed spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both Lazarus and the son of the widow came back to life, yet they were not transcendent and victorious in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a basic principle: A man can go through many experiences with the Son of God yet be still void of any spiritual blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who were fed with bread could be fed again and again, but they would still not have received the spiritual blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although our sister encountered many troubles, such as misfortunes with her father, mother, bandits, etc., and although she has received some spiritual blessing, I feel that the light she has received is still too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although she can thank the Lord for His grace, she still does not realize how great this grace is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although she has experienced some sufferings, she does not realize how deep the sufferings are, nor does she realize how obvious God's hand behind these things is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some are veiled in their eyes; they cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They know that they should thank the Lord for many things, but they do not know what they should thank Him for.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is like a lame man who is able to walk again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He only knows the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He only realizes that his sickness is healed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet he does not understand the spiritual benefit of this healing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether or not a man has received spiritual benefit from an encounter depends on how much light he has received from it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The crux of the matter is whether or not one encounters the Lord's great light in the midst of all his difficulties and trials.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When some people go through difficulties, their inner being is enlightened, and they realize what the Lord is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Others realize the Lord's sovereign hand in everything, yet all they see are the outward facts; they do not know anything about the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The five thousand who were fed might have gone home thanking the Lord for His compassion and love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What they said might have amounted to more than what they ate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet they only touched the outward bread; they did not see the great light before God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They only knew that the Lord is rich and that there is a rich supply with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Behind every trial there is God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who receive mercy see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The supply and charm of this light enlighten their understanding like flashes of lightning in a darkened sky.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything becomes clear.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suffering can make us understand what we otherwise could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Was God dealing with Job merely concerning his sons, his houses, and his livestock?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These things were dealt with, but in addition to dealing with these things, God had another purpose in mind, which did not relate at all to Job's children, houses, and livestock.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was another far more hidden issue: Job himself needed to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Job's children, houses, possessions, and livestock were not the target of God's dealings; Job was the target.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have to see that God was actually dealing with you when He was dealing with your father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In dealing with your mother, He was also dealing with you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not enough for a person to see that God is dealing with his children, houses, and livestock.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He has to see that in addition to these things, there is another far more hidden thing which God is dealing with himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When he sees this, his eyes will become bright.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If another Job would join us today and testify in our meeting that his three- or four-story house, which was covered with red tiles, was blown down by the wind because it was too high, this testimony would only expose his darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He would still be far from the goal of God's dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we were to hear such a testimony, we would surely sigh, saying, "Job, God is not dealing with your house.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is dealing with you."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Job had houses, children, livestock, and camels, and all of these needed to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet even if he did not have all these, he still needed to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's dealings are never focused on the individual things alone.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is a pity if a man's mind is set on these things alone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God deals with you through dealing with your parents, family, and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The one who is attached to your parents and who is behind all things is yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When our Lord was on the earth, those who witnessed the miracle of the breaking of bread only saw the bread, those who witnessed the healing of the lepers only saw the healing, and those who witnessed the healing of the blind only saw the opening of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The grace they received was too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Here is a grace that is far greater than the visible bread, the healed leprosy, and the enlightened blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If these ones had received more than healing and bread, there would have been more than twelve disciples at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every major dealing must be understood in a major way, a profound way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If all you saw during the past six years were the things and events themselves, it is a pity.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If God is merciful to us, He can deal with us in a great way and speak to us great things through the smallest incidents.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God can speak spiritual things to us through material things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A toothache may be a small thing and tuberculosis may be a big thing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But to God, healing one is just as easy as healing the other.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Many people are trapped in medical healings or in matters having to do with their family, their spouse, their children, or their money.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They have no idea what the feeding of the five thousand and the four thousand means.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They only know that God's grace is manifested through these miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the principle of eating bread and being filled John 6:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we are not careful and our eyes are set on the trials around us, we will be taking the way of "eating bread" as well.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We will only know the grace of the bread; we will not know the God who imparts grace.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have to be delivered from touching merely the superficial things that surround us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have to see that the Lord is dealing with our very person.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In Job's experience, we find God dealing with his self-righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A small revelation often is a hindrance to bigger revelations, a small blessing often is a hindrance to bigger blessings, and a small grace is often a hindrance to greater grace.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In dealing with us and trying us, God is not only dealing with the things around us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He does not want our eyes to be set on the trials and the things around the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He has far greater things that He wants us to see.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God intends to speak great matters of spiritual significance to us through our surroundings.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Once the great matters are settled, the small matters will be resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God wants us to lift up our eyes to see the kind of persons we are.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Once we see this, other problems will be solved easily.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Many people only pay attention to the scourging when they are scourged.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They may even have received some benefit from the scourging.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But others who are scourged receive great light; they see what God wants to do through them.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is to know great things through small incidents.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Although the incidents are small in themselves, the transaction is great.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Children, houses, and livestock are small things.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>They are for the purpose of perfecting the great things.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>You can pray to God for His guidance, saying, "Lord, what is the deeper and greater thing that You are dealing with me about?"</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Humanly speaking, the deaths of Job's sons, the collapsing of his houses, and the perishing of his livestock were big things.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>God's finger and work, however, only point to one thing, which is what God Himself wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>You can ask God to grant you the light to see the great thing that He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Once you see it, everything is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>You have to realize that God may deal with you through this and that means, but His finger is always pointing to one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Once you see that one thing, God's will is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Therefore, none of God's dealings come in a fragmentary way.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If you see the great thing, the small blessings will not mean much to you.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If you dwell on the small things, you will miss the great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If your dealings are fragmentary, your blessings will be fragmentary.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If you do not see the central, great issue that the Lord has for you, but instead dwell on the fragmentary things, you will become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Job was very strong-willed.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He had to be hit with item after item before he fell down on his face and said, "I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear,/But now my eye has seen You;/Therefore I abhor myself, and I repent/In dust and ashes" Job 42:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In your past experiences, you only saw the superficial things; you did not see the things beyond the dealings themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>You have to realize that God's dealing involves things far higher than what you can imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Once you touch those things, you will be able to render help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>May the Lord be merciful to you so that you do not dwell on the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Even if you deal with the small things fifty times, they will still come back to you.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>There will be a fifty-first time.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>But if one is dealt with in the fundamental and great issue, he will overcome the other things even when they come back the fifty-first, the five hundredth, or even the thousandth time.</S>
