<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE EIGHTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MIXED EXPRESSIONS<br>OF THE PSALMIST'S SENTIMENT<br>IN HIS ENJOYMENT OF GOD<br>IN GOD'S HOUSE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(6)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Psa. 40&#151;41</H1><P>In this message we have come to Psalms 40 and 41, the final two psalms in Book One of the Psalms. In these psalms we can again see the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVI. IN HIS SUFFERING OF HIS ENEMIES<br>AND THE RECOMPENSE<br>WHICH HE EXPECTED FOR THEM</H2><P>Psalms 40 and 41 show us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his suffering of his enemies and the recompense which he expected for them. No doubt, when David wrote these two psalms he was under the persecution and mistreatment of his enemies. Because of his suffering, he wanted to see his enemies recompensed. In the New Testament, however, the Lord Jesus told us that we should love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us (Matt. 5:44). This shows that David's prayer to recompense his enemies is not according to the divine concept.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Waiting on Jehovah for His Deliverance</H2><P>David waited on Jehovah for His deliverance (Psa. 40:1-5, 11, 13, 16-17; 41:1-2, 10-12). In 41:10 David said, "But You, O Jehovah, be gracious to me and raise me up/That I may recompense them." David was praising God for God's deliverance and looking to God for His salvation. This is not wrong, but it was wrong to ask Jehovah to raise him up that he might recompense his enemies. I hope that all of us can see this. Do you believe God is happy to see His children ask Him to raise them up that they might recompense their enemies? This is absolutely wrong. This is why we say that what is written in many of the psalms is a mixture.</P><P>In verses 11-12 David said, "By this I know that You delight in me,/That my enemy has not shouted in triumph over me./And as for me, You uphold me in my integrity,/And You set me before Your face forever." David indicated that he would know that Jehovah delighted in him if Jehovah raised him up so that he could recompense his enemies. He also asked God not to let his enemies shout over him triumphantly. In the light of the New Testament revelation, we can see that this is absolutely according to the flesh. David also said that God upheld him in his integrity. He should have said that he was upheld in God's mercy, in God's compassions. Actually, we do not have any integrity before God.</P>
