<h1 class="title">THE CROSS SOLVING<br />
THE PROBLEM OF MAN&rsquo;S SIN<br />
FOR MAN&rsquo;S REGENERATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:8, 17; 8:3; Num. 21:4-9; John 3:14-16; 1 Pet. 2:24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">MAN HAVING SIN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Three Aspects of Sin&mdash;<br />
Sinful Deeds, the Sinful Nature,<br />
and the Record of Sin</h2>
<p>In order to see how man can obtain the highest life, God&rsquo;s life, we need to see that we are different from Adam when he was first in the garden of Eden. In the beginning in the garden of Eden, Adam had the created human life but not the uncreated life of God. Similarly, when we were born, we also had the created human life but not the uncreated life of God. However, we have something more than Adam had; in the beginning in the garden of Eden, Adam was sinless, but we are sinful.</p>
<p>Sin involves both outward sins and inward sin. These two aspects of sin result in a third aspect&mdash;a record of sin before God. Whenever sin is mentioned, these three aspects are involved: one is outside of us, another is inside of us, and the third is before God. Outside of us are sinful deeds, sinful acts; inside of us is a sinful nature, a sinful disposition; and at the same time, before God there is a record of our sin.</p>
<p>Sinful deeds refer to sinful acts, such as lying, reviling, cheating, and stealing. I believe that we all have stolen something from others. At the least we have stolen from our parents; some steal candy, and others steal money. In our heart we all know what we have stolen. Moreover, we all have hated others and been jealous of others. For example, we are discontent when we score ninety-seven in an exam but someone else scores ninety-eight. These are sinful acts.</p>
<p>The sinful nature refers to an element in our nature. In our nature there is an element called sin. What is sin? Romans 7:8 says, &ldquo;Sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind.&rdquo; Hence, the sin in us is something living. It is not only living; it also has power and authority. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;Now then it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me.&rdquo; This verse points out that sin with its power dwells in us. The word <em>dwells</em> is a particular verb. We do not say that a bench dwells in a room, because a bench is not living. We can say that a dog or a cat dwells in a room, because they are living. For something to dwell, it must be living. Sin not only lives in us; it also dwells in us. Therefore, we should never think that sin refers only to the sinful deeds we commit. There is something living in us that drives us to commit sins and that thing is our sinful nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man Having a Sinful Nature,<br />
and Sin Having Power</h2>
<p>Romans 6:6 and 14 say that we are slaves of sin and that sin is ruling over us as our lord. Sin dwells in us as our lord, and the power of sin is able to rule us. Not only so, sin also has the power to force us to do the things that we dislike. This can be likened to a person who is standing in the middle of a river. The river exerts such power on the person that he is carried along by the flow of the river. The sin in us has this kind of power. It will cause us to do the things that we hate and go to places that we dislike. This proves that the sin in us is living and has authority and power.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SINFUL NATURE IN MAN<br />
BEING THE NATURE OF SATAN, THE DEVIL</h2>
<p>What is this sinful nature, the power of sin, within man? To put it simply, it is the nature of Satan. When we were saved, we were born of God to have the life and nature of God; in the same way, when man fell, he was born of Satan, to have the life and nature of Satan. The Bible says that all who sin are children of the devil (1 John 3:10; John 8:44). Every child is born of his father and, hence, has his father&rsquo;s life and nature. All the descendants of Adam are sinners and children of the devil. They are born of the devil and have the life and nature of the devil. This nature of the devil within us is sin. The sinful nature in us is the nature of the devil.</p>
<p>Everyone who is saved has God&rsquo;s nature within him. This nature of God, which is God Himself, is the element of God. In the same principle, fallen sinners as Adam&rsquo;s descendants have the sinful nature within them. This sinful nature is the nature of the devil, or we may say that it is the devil himself, his element.</p>
<p>When someone says that the devil is in us, perhaps we do not believe it, or we may even become angry. However, if someone says to me that I am a wicked person, I would reply, &ldquo;Of course I am. Since I have the devil in me, how can I not be wicked?&rdquo; When Adam was created, he was pure and had only the human element. However, one day he received Satan&rsquo;s word and ate the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Thus, Satan, through his word and through the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, entered into Adam. From that time Adam was no longer pure, because within Adam there was not only the element of man but also the element of Satan, the devil.</p>
<p>We can use a glass of water as an illustration. Originally, Adam was like a glass of water. In the garden of Eden he was very pure. However, one day Satan, through his word and the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, injected his element and thoughts into Adam. From that time onward, Adam was no longer pure; instead, he was filled with Satan&rsquo;s poisonous element. Adam became another person; he became the devil, Satan.</p>
<p>Whom do you look like when you are angry or play mah-jongg? If you look at yourself in the mirror, will you see a demon or a human being? You may seem to be kind and polite and to look like a human being who is very proper. However, since you are fallen, you are contaminated and damaged, and you have the poisonous element of Satan in you. I am not saying this in a casual way. The gamblers in a casino look like demons. The Chinese refer to gamblers as gambling demons, drunkards as drinking demons, and opium-smokers as opium demons. There are all kinds of demons. When people commit sin, they look like the devil.</p>
<p>Initially, Adam was like a glass of water; however, Satan, through his words and the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, injected his thoughts as poison into Adam. Therefore, as Adam&rsquo;s descendants, we have inherited this poison in our nature. Therefore, we are not only human beings from birth; we are also contaminated with the element of Satan. We have to admit that as sinners our sinning is involuntary; it is not dependent on us.</p>
<p>The first time a person plays mah-jongg, he may think that he likes it. Later, however, he becomes sick and tired of playing and even hates playing mah-jongg. At this time he discovers that whether or not he plays mah-jongg is not up to him. He discovers that there is a force within him that propels him and forces him to play. There was once a man who played mah-jongg to the extent that he felt that he was imprisoned by it. Then he began to hate playing mah-jongg. However, he could not stop playing, because there was a force in him propelling him to play.</p>
<p>There was another person who would dance until two or three in the morning every day. It was as if his two legs would mysteriously begin to dance as soon as the sun went down. After dancing, his back would ache and his legs would be sore, such that he lay on the bed and wondered why he caused himself to suffer so much. When he woke up in the morning, he would tell himself that he would never go dancing again. However, as soon as the sun set, inexplicably he would go to the dance hall. When he finished dancing and returned home, he would berate and loathe himself. It was not until he was saved that he realized that it was not he who went to dance but that there was an evil power, an evil nature or a corrupted life, within him that propelled him, forced him, and pushed him to dance. Those who drink, smoke, or gamble will invariably discover that there is an evil force compelling them to do these things.</p>
