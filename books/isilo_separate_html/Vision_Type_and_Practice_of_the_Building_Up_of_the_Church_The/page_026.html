<p>Building calls for grueling warfare. In the Old Testament there was the need of fighting every time something was to be built. The children of Israel came out of Egypt to enter into Canaan and build the temple of God. Before the children of Israel left Egypt, the battle had already begun. Therefore, God said to Moses, &ldquo;I will...bring forth My armies, My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt&rdquo; (Exo. 7:4). In order to get out of Egypt, they had to fight the Egyptians. After they left Egypt and arrived in the wilderness, they fought with Amalek (17:8). When they reached the border of the good land, the children of Israel needed to fight again in order to enter the land (Num. 21). They also needed to destroy the seven nations that occupied Canaan before they could take the land (Deut. 7:1-2). The way for the Israelites to enter into and occupy Canaan was a way of warfare. They were not carried into Canaan on a palanquin but fought their way into the land. After they crossed the river Jordan, they waged war with Jericho (Josh. 6) and fought again and again until they conquered the entire land of Canaan. This warfare lasted until the time of David. It was not until David became king that all the enemies were completely subdued (2 Sam. 8:1&mdash;10:19). Only at this time could the matter of building the temple be considered. Hence, the site for the building can be gained only through much warfare.</p>
<p>The materials that David collected for building the temple were the spoil gained in his victory in battle. For example, the gold for building the temple was part of the spoil that David gained. Therefore, even the building materials can be gained only through warfare (8:10-11; 1 Chron. 22:14). When the children of Israel returned from their captivity, Ezra, Nehemiah, and others rose up to rebuild the holy temple and the holy city through intense warfare. They did the work with one hand and held a weapon in the other (Neh. 4:16-17). This means that with one hand they did the work of building and with the other hand fought to defend themselves against the repeated attacks of their enemies. While they were restoring the walls of Jerusalem, there was the attack of their enemies from without (vv. 7-8) and also discord and opinions from within the midst of the children of Israel (5:1-5). Hence, the building of God&rsquo;s house is not a simple matter.</p>
<p>We need to put in a great deal of effort and patiently carry out the building up of God&rsquo;s house one step at a time. We must exercise patience, be fine, and work slowly instead of rushing, being rough, and doing a quick work. To be slow does not mean that we are passive; rather, we are actively carrying out the building work step by step.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF CONSECRATION<br />
IN THE PRACTICE OF BUILDING UP</h2>
<p>There are numerous details related to the practice of building up. The first item is to consecrate ourselves. Doing something is not more important than consecration. After a person is saved and becomes material for God&rsquo;s building, he needs to be worked on. Building a house is an example. A piece of raw material must be shaped before it can be built with other material. Likewise, after a person is saved, God must work on him before he can be built up. However, in order for God to work on a person, that person must have a thorough consecration. The responsible brothers and the serving ones in every locality must deal once more with the Lord concerning their consecration. If we neglect the matter of consecration, our efforts to build up the church will be in vain no matter how many messages we give. Everyone who desires to be built up must be a consecrated person and must also help others to consecrate themselves.</p>
<p>In order for God to work on us, we must consecrate ourselves, hand ourselves over to Him. It is true that a person becomes material for the building as soon as he is saved. However, if he does not put himself into the Lord&rsquo;s hand, he is not properly situated for the building. No matter how many messages he hears, without consecration he has no way to be built up. Thus, in order to be built up, we must be consecrated.</p>
<p>If we truly see the need of God&rsquo;s building, we will be constrained to consecrate ourselves to the Lord again concerning this matter. Even if we consecrated ourselves many years ago, we must consecrate ourselves again. The burnt offering was offered every day in the morning and in the evening (Num. 28:3-4). It was also offered on every Sabbath day (vv. 9-10), at the beginning of every month (vv. 11-15), and in every feast (vv. 16-19, 26-27; 29:1-2, 7-8, 12-13). The burnt offering was offered whenever there was an important event. The burnt offering typifies our consecration. Hence, we should consecrate ourselves every morning and every evening. We should consecrate ourselves when we leave the house and when we return. We should consecrate ourselves at every critical juncture of our human life, such as when we begin our education, graduate, get engaged, get married, and find employment. We should also consecrate ourselves when we visit the saints or go out to preach the gospel. In short, every occasion is a time for us to consecrate ourselves again.</p>
<p>Since we have seen the need for the building up of God&rsquo;s house and are willing to allow Him to build us, we must have a thorough consecration to commit ourselves into His hand once more. Unless we renew our consecration, we cannot be built up.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
