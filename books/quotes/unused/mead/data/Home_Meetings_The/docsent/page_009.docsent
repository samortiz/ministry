   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE EQUIPPED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE HOME MEETINGS 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8; Acts 5:42; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Cor 1:21</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the last message we saw that the way to be equipped for the home meetings is to be filled in spirit and to be strengthened into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall consider two more aspects of the way to be equipped: to experience the unsearchable riches of Christ and to preach Christ as the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Surely we need the strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need the filling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet if we have only the filling and the strengthening, we would still not be rich for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be filled is one thing and to be strengthened is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet these two could not be our riches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our riches are just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, for us to be rich in the home meetings, to have something to minister to other people, we need the experience of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TO EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians is a profound book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter three Paul first speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ v. 8 . Then he goes on to pray that we may be able to comprehend or apprehend with the saints the dimensions of Christ v. 18 . This is to know the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These four dimensions are an illustration of Christ s unlimitedness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the height of the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How high is the height?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one can measure it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How long is the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Can you measure the length?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How broad is the breadth, and how deep is the depth?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one can measure this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These dimensions are used by Paul to speak of the unlimitedness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is not only rich in what He is, He is also immeasurable in His dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever I come to such a point, I am in trembling that I may miss the mark due to the shortness of human language, the lack of the adequate expression to tell others what the riches of Christ are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the Lord s mercy I began to see this about forty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But whenever I spoke on the unsearchable riches of Christ, I regretted that I was so short in the human utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In my speaking I was not so adequate to itemize all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our hymnal includes over eight hundred pieces collected from more than ten thousand pieces from different sources.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After collecting these top Christian songs, we felt there was a big shortage of hymns on the things that the Lord has shown us in this half century and on the things we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hymn #542 was written at the time we were preparing the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The chorus says:</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>O the riches, O the riches,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ my Savior has for me!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How unsearchable their measure,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet my full reality!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In writing verse 2, I tried to itemize some of the riches: life and light, wisdom, power, healing, comfort, treasures rich of God s delight.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then verse 3 says:</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s redemption, full salvation,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And His resurrection pow r,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sanctifying, glorifying,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All transcending every hour!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 4 says:</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>O the riches of my Savior</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nothing less than God as all!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is easy to say, Nothing less than God as all, but what is the all ?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 4 continues:</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All His person and possessions,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now my spirit doth enthrall.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Still, not many riches are itemized.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verses 5 and 6 continue:</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>O the riches of my Savior!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Who can know their breadth and length,</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Or their depth and height unmeasured,</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet they are my joy and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May I know these boundless riches,</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ experience in full;</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There still is not the adequate itemizing of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the training outlines on The Conclusion of the New Testament there is one section on the attributes of Christ in which I counted altogether twenty-two items.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But it is not too much to say that there should be two thousand items.</S>
