OF THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Supplying Life</h2>
<p>The flow of living water is also the flow of the Spirit in our spirit. This flow supplies the divine life. Whoever is in this flow will have a richer spiritual life and will receive more inspiration and revelation. In this flow we enjoy the riches of God. The supply for our spiritual life is obtained in this flow. If we lack the flow of living water, our spirit will become dry and weak. When we are open to God and to man, we allow the water of life to flow through us so that we can have a fuller and richer supply of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bringing Light</h2>
<p>This flow brings light. According to the Bible, the flow of life brings in light (John 1:4; Rev. 21:23; 22:5). Those who are experienced know that when the flow of life passes through us, light shines within us. The more we allow the water of life to flow through us, the brighter we will be within. On the contrary, when we do not allow the water of life to flow through us, we become dark within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Quenching People&rsquo;s Thirst</h2>
<p>This flow supplies water to quench our thirst. When our spirit is blocked, we will feel dry and thirsty. Furthermore, those whom we contact will feel as if they have come to the bitter waters of Marah (Exo. 15:22-23). But when the river of water of life flows within us, those whom we contact will feel as if they have come to Elim, where there are twelve springs of water (v. 27). They will be able to drink living water, and their thirst will be quenched. Some brothers and sisters are like a river; when they open their mouths, everyone is able to drink.</p>
<p>Two chapters in the Bible speak of the Lord Jesus being living water. John 4 says that He is the fountain of living water (v. 14), and chapter 7 says that He is rivers of living water (v. 38). His being the fountain is for us, and His being rivers is for others. With the fountain, the emphasis is on His flowing into us; whereas with the rivers, the emphasis is on His flowing out of us. We must not receive the Lord as the fountain but not allow Him to flow out as rivers. We should always allow others to receive the supply of living water from us. In order to flow out rivers of living water, we must be open in two directions. Only those who are open toward God and toward man, allowing the living water of life to flow through them unhindered, can supply others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Swallowing Up Death</h2>
<p>The flow of living water swallows up death. In Ezekiel 47 the flow of the river caused the water of the sea to be healed and caused things to live and grow (vv. 6-12). This shows that life swallows up death and produces abundant fruit. Churches do not bear fruit because death reigns in their midst. Some churches are like the Dead Sea, full of salt water. Hearing idle talk, gossip, criticism, judgments, and opinions can be compared to drinking salt water. This is the reason that hardly anything grows in some churches. For many years not many have been saved, edified, or raised up to serve the Lord, nor have elders been produced. This kind of condition in a church can be compared to the Dead Sea; it is full of salt water. If the living water of life can flow through, the salt water will be healed, and all kinds of living things will begin to grow, because life will swallow up death. Hence, if a church desires to have fruit, it must allow the living water to freely flow through it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Washing Away the Filth</h2>
<p>The flow of living water is able to wash away the filth and make everything clean. The New Jerusalem is not only clean but also pure, because of the washing of the flow of life. When the water of life cannot flow through a believer, silt will accumulate in his being, and those who contact him will become dirty. Some churches are like this. Many of the saints in the churches are filled with so much silt that they are dumb in the meetings. This deadens the atmosphere of the meeting and stops the flow of living water. However, as soon as the meeting is over, everyone is anxious to talk by criticizing or judging. Such talk only stirs up mud and filth. Doctrines and teachings are futile in this kind of situation. These saints need living water. If they can be brought into the flow of living water and will let it flow through them, it will wash away the mud and filth. Only when this happens will the filth that has accumulated be washed away so that the situation becomes clean.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being New, Not Old</h2>
<p>The flow of living water makes everything new. It is one thing to be filthy and dirty, but it is entirely another matter to be old. Some things are not dirty, but they are very old. This can be compared to cleaning an old garment. Even though the garment is clean, it is still old. Some saints are old and stale because they lack the flow of living water. The tree of life in the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem bears fruit every month (Rev. 22:2). This fruit is not old or stale; it is completely new and fresh. If we desire to have new believers as fresh fruit, we must let the living water flow through us continually.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Producing Results in the Work</h2>
<p>The flow of living water will produce genuine results in the work. We give messages because we expect results in the work. However, messages that do not cause the water of life to flow in the saints are not effective. We visit the saints because we hope for results. However, if we do not bring the saints into the flow of life, our visitation will be ineffective. In this respect our past labor offended the Lord. We depended on our speaking of messages, but we did not let the Lord flow into the saints so that He could work in them. We have given many messages, and we have also worked much, but we have done little in terms of opening our spirit and praying, thereby transmitting the Lord into the saints for Him to work directly in them. As a result, the saints have received many doctrines but have not gained much of the Lord. We have offended the Lord, we have not given Him the first place, and we have not glorified Him.</p>
<p>A lack of results is the issue of not bringing the saints into the flow of life. If we could reduce the number of messages that we give and spend more time to lead the saints to pray, the water of life would flow into them.</p>
<p>Whether we give a message or visit the saints, our purpose is for the saints to receive the life supply, to be enlightened, to have their thirst quenched, to have death swallowed up, to be washed so that they may be made new and fresh. If we do not lead the saints to pray, none of these results will be manifested in them. In order to produce such results, we must bring the saints into a spirit of prayer. There is no other way but to pray.</p>
<p>We must admit that we have been short in the past. We have not prayed much; hence, we have not led others to pray. We do not pray when we contact others or visit the saints. We did not know how to lead the saints into a spirit of prayer so that they would be willing to pray regularly. This is a serious lack among us. We must learn how to bring the saints into a spirit of prayer so that they would want to pray, would be able to pray, and would pray regularly. If we can accomplish this, we can be at peace, because the water of life will flow in the saints. As the flow increases and becomes stronger, the positive results listed above will be manifested. Only then will we obtain genuine results in the work that can genuinely build up the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
