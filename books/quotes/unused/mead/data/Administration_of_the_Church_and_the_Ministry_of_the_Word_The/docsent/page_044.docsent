   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING THE STRATAGEMS OF THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Old Testament says that the city of David was David s stronghold 1 Chron 11:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, when Nehemiah went forth to recover the city, the enemies appeared Neh 4:7-8 , and those who built the wall did the work with one hand and held a weapon with the other v. 17 . This type is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It means that those who build the church must build and fight at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Authority is a protection to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must fight for this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to fight for the authority of the church, we must learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we lead the brothers and sisters to love the Lord and live for Him, thereby enabling them to obtain God s presence, we will not encounter much warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, as we lead the church to have a proper order and enter into God s authority, the enemy will come.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The book of Nehemiah shows that the first stratagem of the enemy is not a frontal assault.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He attacks from the side.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those involved in the building work need to learn to fight in spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We first need to know how to deal with the enemy s stratagems.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul says that we need to stand against the stratagems of the devil Eph 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not ignorant of his schemes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever we build up the order in the church, Satan will use skillful ways to destroy our work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will make a good proposal through a dear brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we accept such a proposal, the entire building will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The enemy s stratagems are often seen in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is doing an exceedingly treacherous work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is doing a work to damage the order in the church, to tear down the wall of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In spiritual warfare it is more crucial to understand the enemy s stratagems than it is to pick up a sword to deal with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what Nehemiah did.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nehemiah first understood the stratagems of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the enemies said, Come,...and let us take counsel together, Nehemiah s reply was, None of these things that you are saying have happened; rather you have invented them in your own heart Neh 6:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nehemiah saw through the enemies stratagems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, in the building work we need to know persons, matters, and the schemes of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our knowing the schemes of the enemy depends on our knowing persons and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not know persons and matters, the enemy can hide in them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If Nehemiah had accepted the enemies suggestions, he would have fallen victim to the enemies stratagems.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not know a matter, we will not know the enemy s stratagems, and it will be easy for us to fall victim to his devices.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The enemy desires to destroy God s authority, the order, in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, there was once the problem of whether the cup for the Lord s table should be a large cup or small individual cups.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This problem is actually a matter of authority, not of the size of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In principle, the elders in our district or local church should have the administrative authority to determine what size the cup should be.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The administrative authority for this problem is with the elders, not the ones responsible for a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a very important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we would build up and administrate the church, the determination of the size of the cup is not related to the truth but to the elders decision.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should obey the representative authority of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if a local church uses a large cup, but a district wants to use small cups, the decision still depends on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is an administrative matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no need for discussions related to the size of the cup for the table meeting and what to use for the baptistery apart from the elders; such discussions can only cause chaos and lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates a lack of knowing authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, there is no building in the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Strictly speaking, we may express our opinion any place other than the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we want to take the way of the Gentiles to practice democracy in the church, we will lose God s presence and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must know God s building work, and we must know God s presence and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In matters relating to the church, those who serve the Lord should not talk freely.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Expressing our opinions makes the church a debate club.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This does not mean that we should not express our considerations; rather, it means that we should see the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A brother responsible for a group meeting should deal with problems according to the proper channel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He can fellowship with the elders and let them know his feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The problem should be brought to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The elders should not hastily reject the feeling of the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, they should bring the brother s feeling to the Lord and see how the Lord will lead them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The responsible brother should then follow the decision of the elders without any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The elders may feel to follow the feeling of the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They may also feel that the whole church should take the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a proper church.</S>
