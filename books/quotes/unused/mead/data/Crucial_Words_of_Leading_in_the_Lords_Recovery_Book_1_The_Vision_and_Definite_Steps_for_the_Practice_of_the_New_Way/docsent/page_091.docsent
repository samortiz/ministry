   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEVIATIONS AND SHORTAGES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF BIBLICAL TRUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is easy for man to have a biased understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we consider creation around us and as we study the Bible, we find that under God s sovereignty everything physical and spiritual is not one-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not even two-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In most cases it is many-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This has been a big problem to students of the Bible throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who are shallow in their understanding argue that the Bible is not consistent and that many passages do not agree with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some have said that since the central thought of the Bible is consistent, we need only to lay hold of this central thought and not concern ourselves with the other things the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some have even argued that all the contradicting portions are probably not God s own words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In reality, God s word is not only many-sided; it is all-embracing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have been studying this Bible for sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Almost every day I open to it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How many sides are there to the truths in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even today it is difficult for me to count them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all know that there are four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They describe the Lord Jesus from four different angles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This may be compared to working on a sculpture; a man has to express the object from all four sides.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if we study the four Gospels, we will see that there are actually more than four ways to describe the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is difficult to count how many sides the four Gospels depict.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I say this to give us a certain assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is true that there are subjects, central thoughts, and lines of truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in addition to these things, there are facets to the truths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not understand this principle, it will be easy for us to conclude that the Bible is not consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We will complain that God said one thing yesterday, another thing today, and still a third thing tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if we dive into God s word and dig into its depths, we will see that our God is very consistent, yet He is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Take the human body as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one can fully understand what the human body is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God created man with a body to support and sustain his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With the body there is also a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With such faculties man is able to express God, receive God, mingle with God, and become one with God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the body that God created is so complicated yet consistent, the God who created it should be even more complicated yet consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today some people in Christianity are too simple in their mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In their simplicity they consider it a heresy to say that God and man can be mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their argument is that God is great and man is small.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can the great Lord dwell in the small man?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the Mount of Olives the disciples saw with their own eyes that the Lord ascended with a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, to some today Christ is high up on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These people argue that the Lord promised that He will come back again, and clearly He has not yet come back.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How then can He be in us?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not believe in Galatians 2:20, which tells us that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They cannot understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They dismiss it, saying that although this is what the Bible says, it is not what it means.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To them, the Lord s representative dwells in us the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They explain that this may be compared to a great king who cannot personally be present in a foreign country but who sends his ambassador to be his representative.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because they consider it impossible for the same Jesus to be dwelling in millions of Christians, they say that He puts the Holy Spirit inside the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows how shallow Christians are in their study of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The study of the truth is not a one-day affair.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It has been going on for more than two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The completion of the New Testament was followed by the first generation of scholars known as the church fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They were the first group of people to study the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to our research, these church fathers were higher and deeper than modern scholars in their understanding of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After them, more studies were made concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some discovered that God is triune; He is not a simple monad.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With Him there is not only the distinction of three and one but also the distinction of His economical aspect and His essential aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The essential aspect refers to His essence, His existence, and His being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The economical aspect refers to His move and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is great, and His move constitutes His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to His economy, He plans and works out everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such theological studies eventually produced three terms trinity, essence, and economy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today almost all theologians have accepted the term trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet many are still ignorant, blind, and bewildered concerning the economical and essential aspects of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the Lord Jesus was baptized, it was the Son who was standing in the water, the Father who was speaking from heaven, and the Spirit who was hovering in the air like a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, some argue that this clearly depicts three persons in three places; how can we say that They are one?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Such an argument sounds convincing, but I can defeat it with one stroke.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I would ask them, Before the Spirit descended on the Lord Jesus like a dove, did the Lord have the Spirit within Him?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They dare not answer me, for any answer would be a defeat to them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I would ask, Since the Lord was conceived of the Holy Spirit, surely the Holy Spirit was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Bible clearly says that the One in the womb of Mary was begotten of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means that the essence of His divinity was the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At that time He was conceived, and He was begotten and born of the Spirit as His essence in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When He stood in the water, the Holy Spirit was already within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Why then was the Holy Spirit hovering like a dove above Him?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They would not be able to answer me.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can say that God is three-one, and we can also say that there are two aspects of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Holy Spirit was in the Lord Jesus from the time He was conceived.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Yet after thirty years, He also descended upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Are there two Spirits or one Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For those who have a shallow understanding of the truth, this is a thorny question.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This shows that the truth is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There are at least two sides to every truth.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Ancient theologians have delved deeply into the mystery of this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They have discovered that there are two aspects to God s being triune, the essential aspect and the economical aspect, that is, the aspect related to God s existence and the aspect related to His expression in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Bible translation is not a simple task.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>For example, consider Matthew 1:20.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Chinese Union Version says, That which has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is clear, and no one would question it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But if we dig into the original language, we find that this verse actually says, That which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Bible does not merely say, That which has been conceived in her but that which has been begotten in her.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This means that at the time the Lord Jesus was conceived in the womb of Mary, a certain One was born in her.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Who is this One?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>To be sure, He is the Holy Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Holy Spirit is not only the essence that brought about the Lord Jesus conception; He is the very One who was begotten in Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>With such a consideration, we can readily understand the words of John 1:1 and 14: In the beginning was the Word...the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>How did the Word become flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It was by being begotten in the womb of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This indicates that the God who was realized through the Holy Spirit was born into a man.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is a great truth.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>That which was begotten in Mary was the Holy Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Luke 1:35 proves this: The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The word overshadow connotes a hen brooding over her chicks.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>As God brooded, the Holy Spirit was begotten within Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Who is this Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He is the One who makes God realized and real.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is a great truth, but it has been neglected through the limitation of man s knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Chinese Union Version is one of the seven best versions in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>But even if we read this portion a thousand times, we will not be aware of the mystery and reality of God s birth within man.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Actually, the revelation in the original language is plain and obvious, but because man s study of the Bible is inadequate and his understanding of theology incomplete, he becomes muddled and shortsighted.</S>
