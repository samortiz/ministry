   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning to Have Insight</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Insight requires knowledge and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a unique view in which a person perceives the need and recognizes what should be done.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Generally speaking, most people who like to voice their opinions do not have much insight; that is, their view is not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our view and opinion concerning a matter is often affected by several factors: our habits, environment, and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, some people think that we should eat white rice with kimchi every morning, whereas others want to have coffee and toast.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, insight comes from knowledge and experience and from having a thorough understanding of the needs in a matter and knowing how to carry out the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we serve with others in prayer and fellowship, we need to discern what is an opinion and what is insight.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Debates in social meetings are mostly due to different opinions, but in society people do not consider that what is an issue is merely an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are serving the Lord together, we have spent many years in the church, and we have all kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to differentiate between opinion and insight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We at least need to learn to be delivered from our opinion and to exercise to have insight.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then what we say will not be an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to practice to speak without opinions and to speak with insight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Opinions should not be expressed, because they lead to arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A husband and wife may have morning revival together, pray-reading the Lord s Word and calling on His name in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then when they sit down to eat breakfast, the husband might express an opinion, and an argument ensues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a scenario is quite common.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not have opinions about our husband or wife, and we should even refrain from expressing our opinions to our children.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we express too many opinions to our children, it will be easy for them to be confrontational when they grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some children consider their parents opinions and are reluctant to express their own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, all their frustrations remain pent up inside, and they express their feelings by pounding on the wall or stomping on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who understand the situation know that this behavior is directed toward their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Most arguments in a family come from opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fights and arguments in human society are due to opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Over the years I have learned many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes a word would be on the tip of my tongue, but I would swallow it as soon as I felt that it was an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Chinese say that disease enters through the mouth, but misfortune issues from the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times when I was meeting with the elders, my words got me into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, I have learned the lesson to swallow my words as soon as I sensed that they were an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes, if the urge to say something was strong, I would leave the meeting and return when I was calm.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is my practice not only with the elders but also with my wife, my children, and my grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes my grandchildren would say, Grandpa, this is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then I close my mouth and do not say anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not easy to learn not to express any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should learn not to speak casually when we fellowship or to say whatever we like.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what the Bible calls gossip 1 Tim 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Idle people do not have anything to do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They gossip about others and say things that they should not say.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In our fellowship, however, we should try not to express our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When there is a need to say something, we should look to the Lord to give us wisdom so that we have a thorough view and speak with insight.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then our words will have light and revelation and will render help.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1936 the work arranged for me to labor in Tientsin and to cover the need in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I therefore traveled between the two places often.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church in Peking had many lovely brothers and sisters, but they had the problem of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even the elders had many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There were many opinions because all the saints loved the church and were full of burden.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, they were about the same age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While I was with them, I did nothing but solve the problems caused by their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I tried my best to help them put an end to their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The brothers were willing to be subdued, because they appreciated me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when I left, their opinions would again arise.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brother Watchman Nee said that the elders in that locality were the best elders.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He felt that those brothers were open and frank, unlike most Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brother Nee had insight.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He knew that Chinese people pride themselves on being patient and tolerant.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It may seem as if nothing is amiss, but everyone has many things within, and no one is willing to open.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those elders expressed their differences so that everything was apparent and open, and this troubled the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was not until the Japanese occupation of Peking, when many brothers and sisters retreated to Chungking, China, that the opinions were eradicated.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some might ask whether this means that we should not speak so as not to have opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brother Nee had much insight, and he said that those who do not speak may have even more opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Chinese people have a culture that emphasizes tolerance and a kind of Christian pursuit of ethics; therefore, it is difficult for our work to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, a brother can have the strength of not speaking, but I am not certain that this is truly a strength.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether or not we speak, we have to reject our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the one hand, it may be better not to speak so that no problems arise, but on the other hand, when we hide things and do not speak, it is even more troublesome.</S>
