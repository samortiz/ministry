   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can we exercise our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spirit within us is released only to the extent that our outer man, that is, our mind, emotion, and will, is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only then can we exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to learn a basic lesson from God allowing Him to break our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible divides man into two parts, the outer man and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have one more person than an unbeliever; we have an inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the time of our regeneration, God begot this man within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today our inner man is surrounded by our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When others touch us, they may touch our outer man or they may touch our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is a clear difference between shaking hands and shaking gloves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When some come to us, we touch their spirit, their inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When others come to us, we only touch their mind, emotion, and will, their outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their spirit is altogether concealed by their strong mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is like shaking hands with a person wearing gloves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can only touch the gloves; we cannot touch the hands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An unsaved person does not have this distinction between the outer man and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The outer man and the inner man are not side by side.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, the inner man is wrapped within the outer man; one man is within the other.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today man's need is the release of our inner man, that is, the release of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the only way men will receive supply from us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How then can the inner man be released?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can we separate the outer man from the inner man?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can the inner man not be "gloved-in" by the outer man?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Gospel of John says that except a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if it dies, it bears much fruit 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If those who follow the Lord would lose their soul-life, they would gain life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our soul-life dies, we will minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Expressing life means the breaking of the outer shell and the release of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today many people are living, but they are not enlivening.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, they cannot reproduce; they cannot impart life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only those whose outer man is broken are able to release their inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not think that we can learn some teachings from Foochow and then go home to carry on a work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That would be too cheap!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If our outer man is not broken and there is not a free channel through it, our spirit will not be released, and we will never touch others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We also will not have a proper knowledge of men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those whom we think are good are not necessarily good, and those whom we think are bad are not necessarily bad.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If our outer man is not broken, we are like an insulator.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a wire is insulated with rubber, no electricity passes through, and light is not produced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No matter how hard we touch the outer man, we can never strike inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is like shaking a gloved hand; only the glove is touched.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who are tried before the Lord and whose outer man is broken will be able to release their inner life; they will bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The breaking of the outer man involves the operation of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in what area does the cross apply its breaking?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is applied invariably to the strongest area of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever the strongest area of our life is, that is the area where the cross operates.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a man hits the wall, his nose gets hurt first because his nose is the outstanding part of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is hard to hide whatever stands out in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once this strong area is broken and removed, it will be easy for one to touch the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brother T. Austin-Sparks is robust in his mind, calm in his emotion, and strong in his will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is strong and steady.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when you touch him, you do not touch his mind, emotion, or will, but his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Miss M. E. Barber was astute and quick, but one did not feel her astuteness or her natural quickness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These traits were broken in her.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we say that the outer man has to be broken, we do not mean that the outer shell has to be removed altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We merely mean that the outer shell has to crack, and there have to be gaps and openings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the Lord does not secure gaps and openings in us, we will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is impossible to put up a spiritual performance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What we need is genuine breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Second Corinthians 4 speaks of the treasure in the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The earthen vessel does not need more paint or ornamentation; it only needs breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the only way for the treasure within to be made manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not have to act calm, godly, or gentle before God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All we have to do is to allow the inner man to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We only need to allow God's life to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may be very talkative, quick, or jovial.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is nothing wrong about this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if our outer man is not broken, it will not do us any good even if we shut our mouth, remove our smile, and remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today it is not a matter of whether or not the glove is good, but whether it is torn.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many people have been Christians for years.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet they do not yield to God's discipline, and God cannot get through with them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord is doing one thing on earth today He is buffeting our outer man daily.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people are always dissatisfied with the fellowship and coordination they have with the brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They criticize and complain that this is wrong and that is off.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They think that they are the only ones who are right and that everyone else is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They protect their outward shell.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is amazing that after the Lord has buffeted them daily through their environment, they still cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The more buffeting some people experience, the more they murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They maintain intact all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Such ones are altogether useless.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we are taking our own way all the time, how can we expect God to use us to become a blessing to others?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some people become rebellious as soon as they are put under some authority or are wounded a little.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>How can such ones become a supply to others?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the Bible, Job was an example of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But it was Jacob, who was greatly chastised, who received the greatest mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The more authority there is in the church, the more chastisement God's children will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Most of us are better than Jacob at birth, but none of us can match Jacob's end. He did not have a good start, but he did have a good ending.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He had the worst possible beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He held on to his brother's heel in his mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>From the time he was born, he struggled.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But he became crystal clear towards the end of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Among all the men in the Old Testament, Jacob had the best death.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Isaac lived in peace for the first half of his life, but he was a blind and deceived man when he was on his deathbed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Jacob's pathway, however, became brighter and brighter as he moved towards the end. Ultimately, he did not speak of his own wisdom but only of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He received the most mercy, because he received more chastisement from God's hand than others.</S>
