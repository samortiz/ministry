<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GOD HAVING PARTICIPATED<br>IN THE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRIST</H2><P>God participated in the crucifixion of Christ. The very One by the name of Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross, but God participated in that crucifixion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Crucifixion Being<br>the Suffering of Christ in the Flesh</H2><P>The crucifixion was the suffering of Christ in the flesh (Col. 1:22; Eph. 2:15-16). This is the fact in history, and this is also the record in black and white in the Bible. Hallelujah for God's incarnation, for His human living, and for the crucifixion of Christ! In all these things, God was moving in man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ in His Body of the Flesh<br>Being the Embodiment of the Triune God</H2><P>The crucifixion was the crucifixion of Christ in the flesh. Then who was Christ in the flesh? Christ in His body of the flesh was the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). The Triune God is invisible, mysterious, and spiritual, but He was embodied. The invisible, divine, spiritual God got into a physical, visible body. The crucifixion was the crucifixion of Christ, yet Christ was the very embodiment of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Manifestation of Christ<br>Being God's Manifestation in the Flesh</H2><P>First Timothy 3:16 says that the great mystery of godliness is God manifested in the flesh. Christ was God manifested in the flesh. The manifestation of Christ was God's manifestation in the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Hence, the Crucifixion of Christ<br>Being Also God's Crucifixion</H2><P>Since the manifestation of Christ was God's manifestation in the flesh, the crucifixion of Christ was also God's crucifixion. Since we can say and do say that God was manifested in the flesh, we also can say that God was crucified in the flesh.</P>
