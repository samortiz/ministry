   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jehovah Cleansing Israel and Giving Them</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>a New Heart and a New Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jehovah made a promise to Israel, saying, I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your filthiness and from all your idols I will cleanse you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and My ordinances you shall keep and do 36:25-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God will give them a new heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This new heart enables them to love God and everything of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God will put a new spirit within them so that their spirit is enlivened and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God will also give them a heart of flesh so that they are soft and sensitive toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God also promised that He would put His Spirit within them so that His Spirit can always strengthen them in their new spirit, causing them to have the strength to love God and to fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the restored people of Israel in the kingdom age will be able to walk in God s statutes and keep His ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Holy Temple, the Holy Land,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and the Holy City Being Recovered</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Ezekiel s vision recorded in chapters 40 through 48, the recovery of Israel will include the holy temple, the Holy Land, and the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The captivity of the children of Israel occurred in 606 B.C. About thirty years after their captivity, in 574 B.C., Ezekiel saw the vision of Israel s restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then after approximately forty years, in 536 B.C., some of the Israelites returned to the land of their forefathers as decreed by Cyrus the king of Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, they recovered the altar Ezra 3:2 , then God s temple vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>8-13 , and finally the city Neh 2:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The temple that was built at the time of their return from captivity was eventually replaced by Herod s temple, which was built in forty-six years John 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, neither the temple rebuilt in Ezra s days nor Herod s temple at the time of the Lord Jesus could compare in measurement, scale, or glory to the temple Ezekiel saw in his vision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, what Ezekiel saw concerns Israel in the restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to Ezekiel 40 through 48, God will gain the holy temple, the Holy Land, and the holy city among the restored Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The emphasis of the holy temple is the presence of God, the fellowship of God, and the service for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The existence of the holy temple depends on the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is no Holy Land, there will not be a building site for the holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the same time, the Holy Land provides a place for those who serve in the holy temple to live, dwell, and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, in order to have the holy temple, there must be the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The holy city is for government and administration so that God can have a center of administration among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The conclusion of the book of Ezekiel is that God will eventually gain a holy temple and a holy city in the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether it is the temple or the city, it is where God is, it is His dwelling place, and it is His resting place.</S>
