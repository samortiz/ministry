   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE HISTORY OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES 8 Scripture Reading: John 17:21; Rom 16:17; 1 Cor 1:10, 12-13a; Titus 3:10; Eph 2:22; 4:16; 1 Pet 2:5; Rev 1:11-12; 2:7; 22:17a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to realize that our history is not that of an organization or of a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a history of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A recovery is the restoration or return to a normal condition after degradation, damage, or loss.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord's recovery brings us back to the beginning to have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the early days of the Lord's recovery in China, the Lord showed us the wrongdoings of Christendom, on the negative side, and the church, on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE LORD'S RECOVERY BRINGING US</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>FULLY OUT OF BABYLON AND FULLY BACK</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>TO BEING IN THE SPIRIT AND IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It has been very difficult for us to fully come out of the old and unscriptural practices and concepts in Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christendom has been on earth for hundreds of years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It bears the name of Christ, it holds the Holy Scriptures, and it preaches the Lord Jesus as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These three items are positive, but Christendom is a mixture of these positive things with things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the book of Revelation, Christendom is the great prostitute and is called "Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth" 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This evil woman is seen holding "a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication" v. 4 . In typology gold signifies something divine, something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the apostate church has something of God in outward appearance, but within her golden cup are idolatry, pagan practices, and satanic things in a heretical, religious relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christendom holds something divine, but there is a devilish element within it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was predicted by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this chapter the Lord said, "The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened" v. 33 . Meal for making the meal offering signifies Christ as food to both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Leaven in the Scriptures signifies evil things 1 Cor 5:6, 8 and evil doctrines Matt 16:6, 11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fallen, degraded Christendom is a mixture of leaven with fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christendom has a devilish element, but it still holds something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It holds a golden cup, but within the cup are abominations and unclean things related to spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The golden cup is the outward appearance, but the inward reality is abominable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is easy for people to realize the outward appearance, but it is difficult to realize the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The appearance is divine, but the reality is devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Christendom is a mixture, when one gets the fine flour, he also gets the leaven because these two have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why it has been difficult for us to fully come out of Christendom.</S>
