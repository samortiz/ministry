<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE TWENTY</H2><P>Verse 20:"But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices."</P><P>Jezebel was a heathen queen. She induced her husband to worship idols and changed the ordinances concerning the Israelites' way of worship. She persecuted those who worshipped Jehovah and led the Israelites astray to worship Baal. Baal was the enticer outside the church. It typifies the world as the one enticing the church. Jezebel, on the other hand, was the enticer within the church. She typified the church being shamelessly joined to the world and idols. Although there was not much difference between the sin of Baal and Jezebel, their positions were entirely different. Jezebel was within the church. Hence, the sins she committed were much more severe than those of Baal outside the church. In Pergamos there were only "individuals" who sinned. Although the number of "individuals" might have been many, yet the "whole body" of the church was free. In Thyatira, only "individuals" were free from sin, and while this number of "individuals" was not small, the "whole body" of the church was defiled.</P><P>What was the special characteristic of the church in Thyatira? What made it different was that it allowed a woman who called herself a prophetess and who assumed to have inspiration from God to teach there. Jezebel reminds us of the Israelites worshipping idols and God's servant and His people being persecuted in the old days. She was an outsider, yet she reigned among God's people. This is why the Lord said, "She teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices."</P><P>God's servants often compare the seven parables in Matthew 13 with the seven letters in Revelation 2 and 3. The result of their study is that the seven parables and the seven letters are parallel and correspond with each other. Because of the shortage of space, we did not make the comparison between the first three letters and the first three parables. However, we know that the seven parables in Matthew 13 are prophecies concerning what will happen in the kingdom of the heavens during the time between the first and second comings of the Lord Jesus. The seven letters in Revelation also speak of the journey the church goes through from the time it was established until the second coming of the Lord. Since the parables and the letters in these two passages both speak of things of this age, we have to consider their similarities here. We have no time now to consider the other parables and how they correspond with the letters in Revelation 2 and 3. Here we will only consider the fourth parable, that of leaven in the flour, and how this parable corresponds to the fourth letter sent to those in Thyatira.</P><P>In the fourth parable the main character is a woman. In this fourth letter that we are considering the main character is also a woman. If we study carefully, we will see that these two women are the same woman. Although many people have different interpretations of this parable, if we take the way of interpreting the Scripture with the Scripture, we will readily find out the meaning of this parable. First let us study this parable, and then we will compare it with the letter we are considering. We have to remember that both passages are spoken by the Lord Jesus Himself.</P><P>"Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened" (Matt. 13:33). We know how many people have explained this parable. They consider the gospel as the leaven with a potential nature to affect everything that comes into contact with it. The world is like the lump of meal. When the gospel is preached, it will be fully victorious in the end, and the whole world will be influenced by the gospel. This kind of interpretation is of course very much welcomed. However, allow me to investigate without controversy by referencing other parts of the Scripture to find out if this is indeed what the Bible promises. Before going on, let me ask one question: what does the Lord Jesus mean when He says that the kingdom of the heavens is like leaven? If the Lord Jesus compares the kingdom of the heavens to leaven, then we must conclude that leaven is something good. If that is the case, then surely the kingdom of the heavens will gradually spread throughout the whole earth, and leaven leavens the whole lump. However, if we study carefully, we will find out that the question cannot be settled this way.</P><P>"The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven." If we read this sentence alone, we will think that this leaven typifies the kingdom of the heavens, but if we read through this chapter and compare this parable with the other parables, we will not be so bold to say that the Lord intends to use leaven to typify the kingdom of the heavens. For example, in reading the second parable, one may ask if the kingdom of the heavens refers to the sower that sows the good seed or to the whole parable with its different kinds of people and their different kinds of endings. Take another example: if we take the leaven as a symbol of the kingdom of the heavens and apply this principle to the fifth parable, then in the kingdom of the heavens there will be the treasure, instead of the person that has found the treasure. Furthermore, in the sixth parable, the kingdom of the heavens will be the man that has found the good pearl, instead of the pearl itself. Does this then sound unreasonable? Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens must refer to the whole parable and not just one point of the parable. This does not mean that everything said in the parable is positive. While it is true that in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens there is no evil, at the present time there are many counterfeits, and as such, there are many negative things. This is why when the man sleeps, the enemy can come in and sow the tares among the wheat. Furthermore, in the first three parables, each subsequent sin mentioned is greater than the preceding one. The first parable mentions the partial failure of some good seeds. The second parable mentions the enemy's sowing the bad seed. The third parable mentions how the smallest seed can grow to be the biggest tree under which evil spirits in the air can lodge themselves. If the fourth parable here speaks of the victory of the gospel, it would not follow the same line as the first three parables, but would instead be contradictory to them!</P>
