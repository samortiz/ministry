   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO READ REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must all see the character of today's age.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is no more the age of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is no more the age of mere quotations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is no more the age of mere teachings or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is no more the age of the gifts or the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is no more the age of the so-called elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the age of the Book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the age of the seven Spirits for the seven churches with the seven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this book the Lord Jesus declares that He is the living One 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What good is it to hold the sound and scriptural doctrines as long as you are dead?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Oh, the doctrines!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Oh, the teachings!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Oh, the gifts!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Oh, the dissension!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Oh, the deadness!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How much we need to give up our concepts and our dissenting thoughts!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How much we need to come to the Book of Revelation and to the age of this book!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Book of Revelation is the stepping stone to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we have never been in the reality of the Book of Revelation, we can never be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let us drop all the oldness and get into it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us just take one word Amen and mingle it with the words of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seven churches Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The seven Spirits Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Seven angels Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Seven stars Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One city, one church Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One church, one city Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church at Ephesus Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church at Smyrna Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church at Pergamos Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if I don't understand, I still must say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if I don't agree, I still must say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not the Lord He is the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we would do this we would be exceedingly blessed; we would be the most favored people on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We would have rest and we would be so very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We would not care what people say we would only care what the seven Spirits say.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I would not suggest that you burn all your books, but I beg you to put all your books aside and come to the last book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The last book of the Bible is the last word of the Lord, and the last word of any person is the most important.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The last word of the Bible is the Book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us pray-read every chapter with every verse, every phrase with every word, and say Amen every time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need not attempt to understand or analyze it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need only say Amen to every word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I challenge you to try it and see what the result will be.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have full assurance that you will be set on fire by the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>UP-TO-DATE WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The year is not 1770 nor 1870, but 1970.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord is marching on.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We thank the Lord for all His previous recoveries throughout the past generations without them we could never have reached the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we must be up-to-date with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not linger behind in some past age of the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since we are in 1970, we should be in tune with the Lord's move in 1970.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord deliver us from being backward Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to be brought on and on.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This month is different from last month, and today is different from yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We expect that tomorrow the Lord will go on to accomplish something further.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why must we hold on to so many old things? that is Satan's subtle snare.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all need to be rescued by the present Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What was good for yesterday may be the snare of the enemy to you today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let me say a word to the senior brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am not so young; I know all your problems.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Your problems can be summed up in three categories: 1 the doctrines you have learned, 2 the experiences through which you have passed, 3 all the things you have seen in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But in the Book of Revelation, I say again, there are no doctrines, there are no experiences, and there is nothing of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We all need to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Apostle John in this book is absolutely new, absolutely different from the John in the Gospel and in the three Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Listen to his tone in the Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Why is there such a change?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because he was in the spirit and heard the voice; because he turned himself and saw something new.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Oh, how we need to overcome the old doctrines, the old experiences, and all the things we have seen in the past!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to overcome and we need to come over.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Don't say that you sympathize with the young people because they are young and must be so active.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no need for you to sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Sympathize with yourself!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No one is so pitiful as you.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Ask the Lord to have mercy on you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The seven Spirits of God are sent forth into all the earth 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The seven Spirits today are just like the air throughout the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They are not only in Los Angeles they are everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Never say that such an intensified Spirit is only good for Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You may say that Los Angeles is Los Angeles and every church must have its own separate and distinct expression.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But what is your expression?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I fear that it may be the expression of deadness, the expression of your dissenting thought.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Christianity is just the expression of dead religion, the expression of so many divisive things.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The sevenfold intensified Spirit is sent forth into all the earth.</S>
