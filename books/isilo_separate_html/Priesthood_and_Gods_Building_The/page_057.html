<p>We also should speak concerning the Lord and all things.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord Creating All Things</h2>
<p>The Lord created all things. John 1:1-3 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.&rdquo; The heavens and the earth, mankind, all matters, and all things were created through the Lord, that is, through the Word. In other words, all things were created by the expressed God. All things were created by the God who explains, expresses, and declares Himself, not by a hidden God. Romans 1:20 says, &ldquo;The invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse.&rdquo; This verse shows that in creating all things, God expressed Himself. Hence, John 1 says that He is the Word and that He created all things.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 8:6 says, &ldquo;To us there is one God, the Father, out from whom are all things, and we are unto Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through Him.&rdquo; We have only one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things were created, and we are through Him.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:16 says, &ldquo;In Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&rdquo; All things, whether in the heavens or on the earth, visible or invisible, were created through Him. The creation of all things and the existence of all things are for God&rsquo;s expression. Christ is the Word of God, the expression of God; through His creation of all things, God is manifested.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:2 says that God &ldquo;has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son, whom He appointed Heir of all things, through whom also He made the universe.&rdquo; In the last days, God is speaking through His Son, and this speaking is God&rsquo;s expression. Furthermore, God made the universe through the Son. This means that God expresses Himself not only through the Son&rsquo;s speaking but also through the creation of the universe. The whole creation is God&rsquo;s expression and God&rsquo;s explanation. This explanation in creation is through the Word of God, the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord Being the Source of All Things</h2>
<p>No matter how much scientists differ in their opinions or explanations concerning the origin of the universe, they do not deny that the universe comes from one source. All scientific laws and theorems are predicated on the assumption that there is only one source, not dual sources. Even the author of the theory of evolution, Darwin, could not deny that the universe had only one source. Although there are many organisms, there is only one source, and the unique source of this universe is the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p> According to 1 Corinthians 8:6, &ldquo;to us there is one God, the Father, out from whom are all things.&rdquo; Although this verse says that all things are out from the Father, according to Isaiah 9:6, the Son is the Eternal Father. The Lord is the source of all things, and all things come out from Him. Romans 11:36 says, &ldquo;Because out from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.&rdquo; This is a sweet and precious verse in the Bible. We should help new believers learn and even memorize these verses.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord Being the Sovereign Lord of All</h2>
<p>Acts 10:36 says, &ldquo;Jesus Christ (this One is Lord of all).&rdquo; Being the Lord of all means that Jesus Christ is the sovereign Master. Although there have been many great men, sages, philosophers, and religionists throughout the ages, not one of them has said that he is the Lord. Throughout all of human history only Jesus Christ said that He is the Lord. Furthermore, those who preached Him said repeatedly that He is Lord of all (2:36). First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 4:5 says, &ldquo;We...preach...Christ Jesus as Lord.&rdquo; In the universe only Christ is the Lord. Confucius is not the Lord; neither is Mohammed. Only Jesus is the Lord. He said that He is the Lord, and others believed that He is the Lord, called upon Him as Lord, and preached Him as Lord. Everything in the universe belongs to Him, and everything is under His sovereign ruling. He is the sovereign Lord of all.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> </body></html>
