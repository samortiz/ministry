<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 16</h1><h2 class="head4">The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 323, Shanghai,<br />April 1939</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Hu Yi-min, Wei-Si,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brothers Kwang-hsi and Jung-jieh:</p><p>It has been a few months since we last corresponded. I have been traveling in places where postmen have never gone before. Every time I am away from home, my heart feels happy, and I feel transcendent in my private reading of the Word, in prayer, and in my preaching of the gospel to others. May the merciful Lord keep me on the road, working all the time. Since Brother Hsu's departure from Nu River, my foot ailment has flared up again. For more than ten days, I was unable to travel. After the ailment left, I brought my accordion and luggage and set off for Nu River again. By the time I got to the forest in Yen-Wah-Loh, rain was coming down unceasingly, and skies were not clear for six days. Later, we lodged in Yen-Wah-Loh for two days. The snow blocked the mountains, and I could do nothing except return home. During the second month of the year, I packed my luggage and traveled up the river to Yen-Za for four days. I had intended to cross the river and to go west to Men-Gung, but again snow blocked the way, and I had to remain in Yen-Za for four days. On the return journey I had to carry my own luggage. The trip took thirteen days. My original intention was to pass out Tibetan gospel tracts, and although I did not see my wish fulfilled, thank the Lord, I was able to preach to three to four or six to seven people everywhere I went. I hope that Brother Hsu can come back quickly. I went to Wei-Si on the twentieth day of the first month of the year. Brother He left home for his preaching tour, and Mrs. He was not at home either. While I was feeling lost as to what to do next, two Westerners arrived. They tracked me down by looking for me at Mrs. Luk's house. The Lord's love is truly wonderful! Who can search it? In the course of our conversation, the older of the two Westerners told me that they were given the names of Brother Huang, Brother Weigh, Brother Hsu, and myself by Watchman Nee when he was in Norway. Brother Nee told them that we could help them in their westward journey. I could not help but thank the Lord for the depth of His grace. In Wei-Si I helped them buy some daily necessities for their journey. I did not want to stay in Wei-Si and therefore left for home. After helping Mr. An in his journey, I waited for someone to travel with me westward. We will take whatever way that is open to us. Please continue to pray for us without interruption. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in K'un-ming.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hu Yi-min</p><p>The twenty-first day of the first month of the year</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Weigh and Brother Hsu, K'un-ming</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Two or three weeks ago a few brothers and sisters were baptized into the Lord's name. The Lord has started some work among the young students here. Please pray for this. Recently, Brother Hsu borrowed the local church meeting hall for a week-long conference. The subjects were: (1) the law, (2) the Holy Spirit, and (3) the bearing of the cross. There were seventy to eighty people in the audience. May the Lord gain what He is after.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />K. H. Weigh<br />March 16</p>
