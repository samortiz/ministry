OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>In the foregoing messages, we have considered the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the twenty-one Epistles of the New Testament. In these messages we have seen one hundred eighteen aspects of the riches of Christ, who we may experience and enjoy for His expression. We need to realize that to experience and enjoy Christ is to experience and enjoy the Triune God, for Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. In fact, to enjoy Christ is to enjoy the processed Triune God&mdash;the processed Father, the processed Son, and the processed Spirit. The Son of God passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Even God the Father was processed, for the Father was with the Son in whatever He passed through (John 8:29; 16:32). The Spirit of God was processed through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection to consummate in the life-giving Spirit. Such a processed Triune God is everything to us. The New Testament is a book of enjoying the processed Triune God to express Him in the universe for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. IN REVELATION</h2>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Revelation, the last book and the conclusion of the Bible. As we consider these aspects, we will see that Christ as our eternal enjoyment is the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Revelation 1:1 speaks of &ldquo;the revelation of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The book of Revelation, as the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the Bible, is &ldquo;the revelation of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This means that Revelation is the unveiling of Christ Himself. It is a picture, a depiction, of Christ, not merely a revelation given by Christ. We must see that Christ is the center, the focus, and the predominant figure of the entire book of Revelation. Thus, we must take the term <em>the revelation of Jesus Christ</em> in a subjective way. It is not merely a revelation given by Christ but a revelation which unveils Christ to us.</p>
<p>In this universe Christ was mysterious, secret, and hidden from human eyes and human understanding. However, after Christ&rsquo;s ascension the veil was opened, and Christ is now revealed to us. This is the meaning of &ldquo;the revelation of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ is revealed in the prophecies, types, and clear words of the Old Testament. If we read the Old Testament, paying close attention to the prophecies, types, and clear words regarding Christ, we will have a revelation of Christ. Through these revelations, we can see a view of various aspects of Christ. Nevertheless, no matter how perfect the revelations of Christ are in the Old Testament, they are not complete. Hence, we must come to the New Testament, which is a full revelation of Christ. If we read only the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles, we will see many aspects of Christ, but we will not see the aspects covered in the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation is the unique and ultimate revelation of Jesus Christ. The unique and ultimate revelation of Jesus Christ is a revelation of the all-inclusiveness of Christ&mdash;the excellent, marvelous, and wonderful One who is the focus of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. He is marvelous in that He surprises us to the uttermost; He is also mysterious in that we cannot fully understand or comprehend Him.</p>
<p>Revelation is a long book of twenty-two chapters, but it may be divided into three sections. The first three chapters comprise one section, revealing Christ in the church. The second section, from chapter 4 through 20, reveals to us Christ in God&rsquo;s judgment and kingdom. These seventeen chapters show us that in God&rsquo;s judgment and kingdom Christ is the center. Thus, even this section is the revelation of Christ. Throughout all these chapters there is the line of the wonderful, glorious Christ who is the essence, reality, and center of God&rsquo;s judgment and kingdom. The third section, Revelation 21 and 22, reveals Christ in eternity as the center, centrality, and universality of all things. In eternity Christ will be the centrality and universality of God and man. Christ is everything. The first section reveals Christ in the church, the second section reveals Christ in God&rsquo;s judgment and in His kingdom, and the last section reveals Christ in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Experiencing and Enjoying Him as:</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Last of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:4-7 Christ is revealed as the last of the Divine Trinity. The whole Bible is the revelation of God. In the book of Revelation we have the ultimate and complete revelation of who God is. God is triune. We all are familiar with the term <em>the Triune God.</em> This is a great matter in God&rsquo;s revelation. Throughout the centuries, however, most Christians have not fully realized the meaning of the term <em>the Triune God.</em> In the book of Revelation, the book that reveals things in an ultimate way, we see something deeper, higher, richer, and sweeter concerning the Triune God. In Revelation, not only is the revelation of Christ ultimate; the revelation of the Triune God also is ultimate.</p>
<p>Revelation 1:4-7 reveals the Triune God. As God the eternal Father, He was in the past, He is in the present, and He is coming in the future (v. 4). As God the Spirit, He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God&rsquo;s operation (v. 4). As God the Son, He is the &ldquo;Witness,&rdquo; the testimony, the expression of God; &ldquo;the Firstborn of the dead&rdquo; for the church, the new creation; and &ldquo;the Ruler of the kings of the earth&rdquo; for the world (v. 5). From such a Triune God, grace and peace are imparted into the churches (v. 4).</p>
<p>In Revelation the sequence of the Triune God is different from that found in Matthew. In Matthew 28:19 the sequence of the Triune God is: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In this verse Christ as the Son is presented as the second of the Divine Trinity. But in Revelation 1:4 and 5 the sequence is changed. The seven Spirits of God are listed in the second place instead of the third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking in 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13; 22:17. At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned; from Them grace and peace are given to the receivers. Here, however, the Spirit is included; from Him grace and peace are imparted to the churches. This too indicates the crucial need of the Spirit to counteract the degradation of the church for God&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>In Revelation we see that the first of the Divine Trinity, the Father, is modified by the phrases <em>who is, who was,</em> and <em>who is coming</em> (1:4). The second of the Divine Trinity in Revelation, the seven Spirits, is modified by <em>before His throne</em> (v. 4). The third of the Divine Trinity, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is modified by <em>the faithful Witness; the Firstborn of the dead; the Ruler of the kings of the earth; Him who loves us and has released us from our sins; made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father;</em> and <em>He comes</em> (vv. 5-7). All these modifiers are used to modify the three of the Godhead and indicate that the Divine Trinity in Revelation is not the essential Trinity but the economical Trinity. The essential Trinity refers to God&rsquo;s existence. In God&rsquo;s existence the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and coinhere from eternity to eternity. There is no modifier needed for the essential Trinity. The book of Revelation, however, does not touch the existence of the Trinity but the economy of the Trinity. According to God&rsquo;s economy the Father is the One who is now, who was in the past, and who will be in the future. These modifiers indicate economy. Also, in God&rsquo;s existence the Spirit of God is one, but in God&rsquo;s economy the Spirit of God is seven in function. Essentially God&rsquo;s Spirit in existence is one, but economically God&rsquo;s Spirit needs to be intensified to fulfill His function to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. In essence God the Son is simply the Son, but in God&rsquo;s economy He is Jesus, Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, the One who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood, the One who has made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, and the One who comes to execute God&rsquo;s final government. The sequence of every modifier of the Son in Revelation 1:5-7 is related to God&rsquo;s move, God&rsquo;s economy. Revelation does not touch the divine essence of the Trinity but the divine economy of the Trinity.</p>
<p>The Trinity in Matthew 28 is the Trinity of God&rsquo;s existence, the essential Trinity. At the end of Matthew we see the Trinity described in a simple way as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one in essence for their existence. We need to be baptized into the divine essence of the Divine Trinity; we do not need to be baptized into God&rsquo;s economy, His administration, His move, or His acts. We have been baptized &ldquo;into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 19). A name does not refer to a person&rsquo;s activity but to the being of that person. When we call a person&rsquo;s name, this indicates that we desire that person. To be baptized into &ldquo;the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; is to be baptized into the person of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This is a matter of the being, the essence, of the Triune Godhead.</p>
<p> In contrast, the Trinity in Revelation is the Trinity in God&rsquo;s economy, the economical Trinity. Revelation is a book on God&rsquo;s administration because the center of this book is God&rsquo;s throne. God&rsquo;s throne is seen in Revelation to administrate God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. The throne of God is not related to His person but to His administration, which is altogether a matter of God&rsquo;s economy. In Revelation we see the administration, the activity, the motion, the move, the act, and the work of the Trinity.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s essence the Trinity is simply the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, whereas in God&rsquo;s economy the Trinity is complicated. Also, in God&rsquo;s essence the Father is first, the Son is second, and the Spirit is third. In God&rsquo;s economy, however, the Spirit comes before God the Son. The Spirit carries out God&rsquo;s administration and infuses and searches the churches. In the four Gospels the Son was more present than the Spirit, but in Revelation the Spirit is more present than the Son; hence, the Spirit comes before the Son in the sequence of the economical Trinity in Revelation 1.</p>
<p>In Revelation 1:4 and 5 the Father is listed in the first place. He &ldquo;who is and who was and who is coming&rdquo; is God the eternal Father. The &ldquo;seven Spirits&rdquo; are mentioned second. The seven Spirits who are before God&rsquo;s throne are the operating Spirit of God, the unique Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, who was ranked third in the Divine Trinity in Matthew 28:19. The unique Spirit of God has been intensified sevenfold to become the seven Spirits of God, who is unveiled as the second of the Divine Trinity in the last book of the Bible. Christ, the Son of God, is then listed in the third place. Although Revelation 1:5-7 does not mention the expression <em>the Son of God,</em> it gives us a description of His person and work. As to His person, Christ was the faithful Witness in the flesh on earth, the Firstborn of the dead from the time of His resurrection, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth from the time of His ascension until His second coming. In the past Christ was the faithful Witness while He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then from the time of His resurrection Christ became the Firstborn of the dead to be the Head and the beginning of God&rsquo;s new creation. Finally, from the time of His ascension until His return, Christ is the Ruler of the kings of the earth, the Head of the government of this earth. Jesus Christ, who is to God &ldquo;the faithful Witness,&rdquo; to the church &ldquo;the Firstborn of the dead,&rdquo; and to the world &ldquo;the Ruler of the kings of the earth,&rdquo; is God the Son (v. 5). As to the work of Christ, verses 5 through 7 reveal what He has done, is doing, and will do. He loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood. He accomplished redemption in order to make us a priestly kingdom, a composition of priests to His God and Father. He also will come with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him, put Him, to death, and all the tribes of Israel will mourn over Him (Zech. 12). Based upon the description of Christ&rsquo;s person and work in Revelation 1, we may say that in the execution of God&rsquo;s final government, Christ as the last of the Divine Trinity is the consummation of the Divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head4">a. The Faithful Witness</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:5 Christ, the Son of God, is unveiled as &ldquo;the faithful Witness.&rdquo; The Son is God&rsquo;s Witness. Although He is God, He is also the Witness of God. Without Him, we cannot know, see, or gain God. God is testified by Him. He is the Witness of the entire Godhead.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being the faithful Witness refers to His earthly life of thirty-three and a half years. He was the Witness, the testimony, the expression of God, testifying in His human living what God is (3:14). His expressing God was His witnessing. Many people wondered who He was. This man was God, and He witnessed God. As the living and faithful Witness of God, Christ is the One who testifies God. All men know that there is God, but no one has ever seen Him. However, there is a man in this universe, who lived on the earth by the name of Jesus and who was and still is the testimony of God. In Christ, we can see whatever God is (John 1:18). Jesus testifies God not only by His word and deeds but also by what He is. His being is the testimony of God.</p>
<p>First, Christ, our Head, is the Witness of God, bearing the testimony of God. The believers are then the witnesses of Christ for the spreading of His gospel (Acts 1:8). As witnesses of Christ, we are His continuation to be witnesses, witnessing the all-inclusive Christ for the spreading of the gospel to produce His Body. We testify Christ&rsquo;s human living (10:37-39a), death, resurrection, and ascension (2:30-36; 3:15; 10:39b-41). In Acts, this was the apostles&rsquo; testimony. This testimony is to save sinners to be the members of Christ for the building up of His Body (2:37-42; 4:10-12; 10:42-43).</p>
<p>Revelation 1:2 speaks of the testimony of Jesus Christ. <em>Witness</em> refers to the person, but <em>testimony</em> refers to what the person bears, to his work and doing. For example, a witness is a person in a court of law who gives his testimony; the testimony refers to his doing. The Lord Jesus was God&rsquo;s faithful Witness, who testified God to produce the church. The producing of the church is His testimony. In other words, the Witness refers to Christ Himself, and His testimony refers to the church. Jesus was the Witness, and what came out of Him was the church as the testimony. The book of Revelation presents the testimony of Jesus, which is the church as the corporate expression of Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s goal in His creation of man was to have a corporate expression, a testimony, of Himself, and according to this goal, man was made in the image of God in order to be His testimony (Gen. 1:26). The living person of Jesus is the image, expression, and testimony of God, and the church today is the testimony of Jesus, His corporate expression (2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15, 18; 3:10-11, 15). Revelation is an unveiling of Christ, and Christ is expressed through the church; therefore, the church is the testimony of the Jesus revealed in Revelation. In the human living of Jesus, He fully expressed God; He was the real &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; of God. Now this one photograph has been reproduced in the believers. As believers in Christ, we are reproductions, &ldquo;photographs,&rdquo; of Jesus; therefore, today God has a corporate expression&mdash;the church&mdash;which is the testimony of Jesus, who is the expression of God (John 1:14, 18; 12:24; 2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 1:22-23; 4:16). The first God-man, the wonderful all-inclusive Christ, now lives in us as the life-giving Spirit; He is our life, we experience and enjoy Him, we are constituted with Him, and we live Him for His expression (1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; Gal. 2:20; Col. 3:4, 10-11; Phil. 1:20-21a). The corporate God-man living, the living of the many God-men as reproductions of the first God-man, is the genuine church life&mdash;the testimony of Jesus (1 Cor. 1:2; 12:27; Rev. 1:2, 11, 20).</p>
<p>In the book of Revelation the church as the testimony of Jesus is revealed in nine aspects: the lampstands (1:11-12, 20), the great multitude of the redeemed (7:9-17), the bright woman with her man-child (12:1-17), the harvest with its firstfruits (14:4, 14-16), the overcomers on the sea of glass (15:2-4), the bride ready for marriage (19:7-9), the army of the Lamb (17:14; 19:14, 19), the co-kings of Christ in the millennium (20:4, 6), and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth (21:1-3).</p>
<p>The book of Revelation is not only a revelation of Christ Himself but also a revelation concerning Christ in His church and in oneness with His church (1:1-2, 11; 22:16a; Eph. 5:25, 32). In Revelation we see Christ with His church and in the church (1:11-13). Jesus is the testimony of God, expressing God; God needs an enlargement of His testimony, which is the church (1 Cor. 12:12). Christ is the testimony of God, and the church is the testimony of Jesus, the enlarged Christ (John 1:18; 5:31-37; 8:14; Rev. 1:2, 5, 9). What God is, is fully expressed in Jesus, and what Christ is must be fully expressed in the church (Eph. 3:21). Today God has a corporate expression&mdash;the church&mdash;which is the testimony of Jesus, who is the expression of God (Col. 1:15, 18; 2:2; Eph. 3:4, 6). Our destiny as believers is that we would express the Triune God in a corporate way as the testimony of Jesus.</p>
<p>According to the book of Revelation, we need to realize that whatever we experience, enjoy, and realize of our Lord Jesus Christ is also our experience, enjoyment, and realization of the Triune God. In the book of Revelation Christ is revealed to a great extent, and we must experience and enjoy Him to such an extent. Our enjoyment then becomes His testimony, and this living testimony is the present revelation of Jesus Christ. Christ is revealed, we experience and enjoy Him and become His testimony, and our testimony becomes His present revelation. In our experience of Christ as a testimony to Him, He is revealed as the all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One. We need to experience the all-inclusive Christ in a detailed way so that our experience of Him becomes not only His testimony but also His present revelation (Eph. 3:16-17a, 19b, 21; Rev. 1:9, 11; 22:16a).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Firstborn of the Dead</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:5 the Son is also revealed as &ldquo;the Firstborn of the dead.&rdquo; In the universe God has two creations: the creation by His first work and the creation by His second work. We all know God&rsquo;s first creation, but not many of us are familiar with His second creation, resurrection. First, God created all existing things; second, He resurrected some of these existing things and brought them into another sphere, another realm, which is the realm of resurrection. While our body remains in God&rsquo;s first creation, our spirit is in His second creation. Our spirit has been regenerated. This means that it has been recreated; hence, it belongs to God&rsquo;s second creation. In both of God&rsquo;s creations, Christ is the first. Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, and in Revelation 1:5 we are told that He is the Firstborn of the dead. He was the first to be resurrected from the dead, and we will follow Him. Here the phrase <em>the Firstborn of the dead</em> indicates the creation of God in resurrection. This signifies a new beginning. In God&rsquo;s first creation there was a beginning, and in God&rsquo;s second creation in resurrection there was another beginning. When we were regenerated, we experienced a new beginning in God&rsquo;s second creation.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being the Firstborn of the dead refers to His resurrection. He is the Firstborn of the dead, the Firstborn of resurrection. Lazarus was resurrected from the dead (John 11:43-44), but his resurrection was only temporary. Later on he died. With the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, however, death is over. He will live forever (Rev. 1:18). Thus, He is truly the Firstborn of the dead.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider our experience and enjoyment of Christ as the last of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Ruler of the Kings of the Earth</h2>
<p>The Son of God is further presented as the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5). First, He lived on this earth as the faithful Witness. Then He resurrected from the dead to become the Firstborn of the dead for the church, the new creation. Today He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth in His ascension. He is ruling over the earth, the entire world, as the Ruler of the kings of the earth. Having passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, He has been enthroned above all kings.</p>
<p>In Revelation 1:5 Jesus Christ is described as &ldquo;the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.&rdquo; The name <em>Jesus</em> implies the incarnation, and the title <em>Christ</em> indicates that the Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s anointed One. He was the faithful Witness in His human living, and He is the Firstborn of the dead in His resurrection. In His ascension and enthronement He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth, for He is now Lord and Head of all. Furthermore, He will rule over all nations when He comes to reign in His kingdom. The title <em>the Ruler of the kings of the earth</em> thus refers to His ascension, to His present situation, and to His coming back. Therefore, the description of Christ in this verse covers everything from Christ&rsquo;s incarnation to His eternal kingdom.</p>
<p>The Son is the Ruler of the kings of the earth. Although many communists are against Christ, they use His calendar without realizing that they are doing so. According to history, the one whose calendar we use is the one to whom we are in subjection. If a person used the calendar of a certain king, he would be under the rule of that king. In like manner, even the ungodly are under Jesus Christ because they use His calendar. They may call it the international calendar, but actually it is the calendar of Christ. His calendar is the universal calendar; Jesus&rsquo; birth has become the landmark of the calendar of all the peoples on earth. To use His calendar is to acknowledge that He is the King. In this way they unconsciously admit that He is their Ruler. In the universe there is one unique Ruler. All mankind today uses the calendar of Christ and is under His rule. All the people on earth are His people, and He is the Ruler of all nations. He is the unique Ruler of the earth; the whole world is Christ&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>To call Him the Ruler of kings is to say that He is far above the earthly rulers. On the earth there have been many kings, queens, and presidents, but the Ruler of all these is Christ. The rulers of this world are not the real rulers. Christ is the One ruling over the world. In a very real sense, Christ as the Ruler of the kings dethrones all the kings. Only He is the Ruler.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Revelation 19:16, He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. Christ is both the Ruler and the King. As the Ruler, He rules the entire earth. It may seem that kings and presidents rule the earth and that the Lord Jesus is not on the throne. Nevertheless, this One who seems not to be on the throne is the Ruler of all the enthroned ones. Today the entire world is under the Lord&rsquo;s ruling. Every king, queen, president, and head of state is under His reign. He is truly the Leader, the chief Ruler. The entire world situation is under His rule, not under the control of any nation. Jesus Christ is the Administrator of today&rsquo;s universe. God made Christ the Ruler and exalted Him as the Leader. He is the Ruler of all the kings of the earth to administrate God&rsquo;s plan for man. He administrates the entire universe for the purpose of fulfilling God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<p>Christ carries out His mission as the Ruler of the kings of the earth by the seven Spirits of God burning before the throne of God (1:4; 4:5; 5:6). All of the world leaders are under the flaming of the seven Spirits. The seven Spirits are burning on this earth today for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration. The entire world situation is under the flame of the burning of the seven Spirits. The seven Spirits are carrying out God&rsquo;s administration on earth. The world situation and international affairs are all under the direction of this flame. The flame of the seven burning Spirits before the throne of God has sovereignly controlled the world situation. The throne of God in the heavens is the deciding factor of the world situation. We must realize that today the seven Spirits of God are burning before the throne, not only concerning the churches but also concerning the world situation for the churches.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Loving Us and Having Released Us<br />
from Our Sins by His Blood</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 1:5, Christ, the Son of God, &ldquo;loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood.&rdquo; He loves us and has accomplished redemption for us by shedding His blood, which washes us and cleanses us from all our sins. Only the blood of Jesus Christ, whom God judged on the cross (Isa. 53:8), is able to wash us from our sins. Thus, Christ&rsquo;s blood is the unique redeeming blood. Only His blood can redeem us from all our sins. Once we believe that the Lord died and shed His blood on the cross to make propitiation for sins, the Lord&rsquo;s blood causes God to forgive us of our sins and to spare us from the punishment of sin; it also washes away our sins and removes the filthiness of sin from us (1 John 1:7-9).</p>
<p>The Lord shed His blood to redeem us from our sins, cleansing us and releasing us from them so that we no longer have the problem of sins. All the troubles that come to us from our sins were resolved by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, which has released us from them. Since the Lord&rsquo;s blood has released us from our sins, it also has released us from judgment, condemnation, wrath, and death, which are related to sins.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Making Us a Kingdom,<br />
Priests to His God and Father</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:6 says that the Son of God &ldquo;made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) A Kingdom</h2>
<p>The reason God washed us in the precious blood of Christ was that we might be brought under His government. The believers, who have been redeemed by the blood of Christ, not only have been born of God into His kingdom (John 3:5) but also have been made a kingdom for God&rsquo;s economy. This kingdom is the church (Matt. 16:18-19). John, the writer of Revelation, was in this kingdom (Rev. 1:9), and all redeemed and reborn believers also are a part of this kingdom (Rom. 14:17).</p>
<p>Revelation 1 and 5 reveal that the Lord has purchased us by His blood to make us His kingdom (1:5-6; 5:9-10). The Greek word translated &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; in 1:6 and 5:10 implies the meaning of &ldquo;king.&rdquo; In Greek, as in English, <em>king</em> and <em>kingdom</em> have the same root. Whether the Greek word is rendered &ldquo;king&rdquo; or &ldquo;kingdom,&rdquo; it denotes royal authority, or sovereignty. In saving us through the blood of Jesus, God desires not only to transfer us into His kingdom but also to make us His kingdom. In other words, in God&rsquo;s eyes, we saved ones are not only saved into His kingdom but also constituted to be His kingdom. God purchased us by the blood of Jesus for the goal of making us His kingdom. His purpose in making us His kingdom is to rule, to reign, to accomplish His will on earth, and to gain a group of people on earth to be under His authority.</p>
<p>Every saved person has a measure of the kingdom within him. Some have a greater measure and others a smaller measure, but every saved person has the kingdom within. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation brings not only the Lord&rsquo;s life but also the heavenly rule into us. We know that every saved one has the Holy Spirit within. This Holy Spirit is not only life and power but is connected to the throne in heaven. The Holy Spirit in Revelation 4 and 5 is the seven Spirits before God&rsquo;s throne (4:5; 5:6). This indicates that the Holy Spirit is connected to the throne. The Holy Spirit brings not only God&rsquo;s life but also God&rsquo;s throne into us. On the one hand, He is the Spirit of power; on the other hand, He is the reigning Spirit, bringing God&rsquo;s throne into our spirit. He is the Spirit who causes God&rsquo;s throne to rule in our spirit within us. The Holy Spirit in us is not only the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power but also the reigning Spirit. Many Christians speak of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s pouring out of the love of God into us, but few realize that the Holy Spirit also brings and establishes God&rsquo;s throne and authority into us. The Holy Spirit is the authority&mdash;the seven Spirits of God before the throne&mdash;and He desires to establish the throne in us. The seven Spirits of God, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, has entered into us with God&rsquo;s throne and is ruling and reigning within us. If we submit to Him, we will be blessed, for the kingdom will be ours.</p>
<p>God is recovering His right over the earth in order to make the whole earth His kingdom (11:15). When Christ came, He brought the kingdom of God with Him (Luke 17:21; Matt. 12:28). This kingdom has been enlarged into the church (16:18-19), which will accomplish the establishing of the kingdom of God on the whole earth. On one hand, the kingdom of God today is in the church, but on the other hand, the kingdom of God is coming through the overcoming believers (Rev. 12:10). Then Christ and the overcoming believers will reign over all the nations in the millennial kingdom (2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4, 6).</p>
<p>If we allow Him to exercise His authority to a sufficient extent, we will be a group of overcomers. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, all the believers should be under the authority of Christ, should allow Christ to reign, and should be a realm where Christ can exercise His authority. Many saved ones, however, desire the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, the Lord&rsquo;s love, and the Lord&rsquo;s blessings, but they will not allow the Lord to reign in them so that He may gain His kingdom. In this situation the Lord must do a further work in the church to gain a particular group of people. Throughout the last two thousand years the line of these lovers of the Lord has never been broken. Apparently the church is in decline, and indeed the church as a whole is in decline. However, in this decline there are still overcomers. In this decline there are still some who love the Lord and tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, I am under Your authority. I am Your kingdom. I am willing to allow Your throne and Your authority to come in. I love Your ruling. Lord, You are the King, and I am under Your ruling. I submit to Your authority.&rdquo; When there is a group of overcomers in the church, these overcomers will bring the authority of heaven, the kingdom of God, to the earth. At that time the church will be victorious, and the enemy will be powerless.</p>
<p>We must seriously learn to be restricted, ruled, and trained under the authority of the kingdom. Only those who receive the training to be under this heavenly authority today will be able to exercise this heavenly authority in the future. If today we learn to be under God&rsquo;s authority, one day we will be enthroned to rule and reign with His beloved Son.</p>
<p>Revelation 1:6 and 5:10 say that God has made us a kingdom. This means that, as citizens of God&rsquo;s kingdom, we allow Him to reign, and we reign for Him. We are the sons of the Almighty God, who is the King of kings. This makes us members of the royal family. We are not only sons of God but also members of the kingly family. We need to know today not only that we are citizens of God&rsquo;s kingdom but also that we are actually being trained to be kings. Ultimately, we will reign as kings in the kingdom of God. This can be compared to a prince who grows up in a royal palace as a son but is actually being trained to reign as a king one day. Revelation 20 tells us that in the millennium all the overcomers will be co-kings with Christ, and these co-kings of Christ will be the priests of God and of Christ who will reign with Him for a thousand years (v. 6). In the New Jerusalem we will also reign with Christ in the kingship (22:5).</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Priests to His God and Father</h2>
<p>Christ made us a kingdom, and this kingdom is the priesthood. The redemption accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s blood made us not only a kingdom to God but also priests to God (1 Pet. 2:5). Revelation 5:9-10 says that we were purchased for God by the blood of Christ out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and we were made priests to our God. The kingdom is for God&rsquo;s dominion, whereas priests are for the expression of God&rsquo;s image. This is the kingly, royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9), which is for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s original purpose in creating man (Gen. 1:26-28). This kingly priesthood is being exercised in today&rsquo;s church life (Rev. 5:10). It will be practiced intensively in the millennial kingdom (20:6) and will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem (22:3, 5). The New Jerusalem is simply the kingship and the priesthood. All who will be in the New Jerusalem will be kings and priests. On the one hand, they will reign for God. On the other hand, they will serve God.</p>
<p>The entire Bible is a book of the priesthood. From the time that the children of Israel were brought to Mount Sinai and began to build and set up the tabernacle and through the entire New Testament, the Bible is absolutely a record of the priesthood. God&rsquo;s original intention was for the entire nation of Israel to be a &ldquo;kingdom of priests&rdquo; (Exo. 19:6). However, because of their worship of the golden calf (32:1-6), most of the Israelites lost the priesthood. Later, only Aaron and his sons were the priests, and the Levites served the priesthood in practical matters (Num. 3:6-10). Yet in the New Testament, according to Revelation 1:5b-6 and 1 Peter 2:5 and 9, every believer in Christ is a priest.</p>
<p>To say that a priest is a person who serves God is right, but this understanding is shallow. We need to understand the meaning of being a priest in a deeper way. In God&rsquo;s creation of man we can see the qualifications of a priest. The Bible, which is a book on the priesthood, reveals that God created man with the view that He could have a priesthood, a priestly body, to serve Him. God created man with four particular characteristics. First, He created man in His image so that man might bear His likeness, expressing Him (Gen. 1:26). Second, He gave man His authority for His dominion, which indicates that man is His representative (v. 28). Man expresses and represents God. Third, He created man with a spirit, and this spirit in Genesis 2:7 is called &ldquo;the breath of life.&rdquo; The Hebrew word translated as &ldquo;breath&rdquo; can also be translated as &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in Proverbs 20:27, which says, &ldquo;The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah.&rdquo; Our God-created human spirit is an organ to contact God and to receive God. Fourth, God put man in front of the tree of life, indicating that God desired to have man to receive Him as the tree of life so that man might live God (Gen. 2:8-9). God created man to make man His expression and His representative, creating within man an organ so that man could contact Him and receive Him as life that man might live God. These are the four particular characteristics that show God&rsquo;s desire in His creation of man. A priest is a person who bears these four particular characteristics.</p>
<p>The Old Testament also reveals that a priest offers the sacrifices, which typify Christ, to God for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. A priest is a person ministering God, bringing God to man and bringing man to God. Therefore, he must be a person who is close to God, that is, a person who is one with God. He knows God&rsquo;s heart, and he speaks God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s way, and God&rsquo;s plan. Such a person is a priest doing the priestly service in the Old Testament priesthood.</p>
<p>In the New Testament more items were added to the priesthood. A New Testament priest should be a person who lives Christ in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension (Gal. 2:20; Col. 3:1-3). In the Old Testament there were items typifying Christ, but they were not Christ in the actuality of His death, resurrection, and ascension. Paul was a pattern of the New Testament priests of the gospel of God. He was a person bearing God&rsquo;s image, expressing God, and having God&rsquo;s authority, representing God (Gal. 4:19; 6:16; 2 Cor. 5:17-21). He was a person who always exercised his spirit. In the New Testament he taught much concerning our human spirit, and he used his spirit to contact God, to receive God (Rom. 1:9). He enjoyed Christ as the life-giving Spirit in his spirit, and he enjoyed Christ as his life (8:16; Col. 3:4). In Philippians 3:10 he expressed his desire to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to the death of Christ. This shows us that a New Testament priest should be a person in the experience of Christ&rsquo;s death and in the enjoyment of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection power (2 Cor. 4:7-12).</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals that all the believers are priests of the gospel of God (Rom. 15:16). A minister of Christ Jesus to the nations is a ministering, working, and energizing priest of the gospel of God. As the New Testament priests, we need to preach the gospel of God&rsquo;s salvation in all His virtues to make the saved sinners spiritual sacrifices offered to God for His acceptance. When we preach the gospel, we make sinners the sons of God and the members of Christ, and we help them to grow in the divine life so that they can be the active members in the practice of the Body life. Whatever Paul did was his service in the gospel. The preaching of the gospel of God is the service that we should render to God in our spirit. To serve God is to handle the gospel, and to handle the gospel is to preach the gospel in order that Christ might be imparted to others, dispensed to others, that they might become the members of Christ, that Christ&rsquo;s Body might be constituted, and that many local churches could be raised up for His Body to be expressed in many localities. To preach the gospel of God, which is to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, is to preach Christ until His Body is constituted and expressed in different localities so that many local churches will be raised up. This is the preaching of the gospel, and this is the New Testament service, which is called the New Testament priesthood.</p>
<p>The unique pattern of the priests of the gospel in the New Testament is the apostle Paul (1 Tim. 1:16). We need to see how Paul did his work as a priest of the gospel. According to the New Testament record, he did it in three steps of offering. First, Paul saved sinners to offer them up to God as acceptable sacrifices (Rom. 15:16). Second, he brought the believers up to lead them to present themselves to God as living sacrifices (12:1). Third, he warned and taught every saint in all wisdom to present each one full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28-29). He did this by laboring and struggling according to God&rsquo;s operation, which operated in him in power. Paul&rsquo;s announcing of Christ in Colossians 1:28 is to tell out Christ. To present every man full-grown in Christ is to offer every man full-grown in Christ. All these steps are the work of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. The preaching of the gospel of God is the daily life of a priest of the gospel in the New Testament. Our preaching is our priestly service, and we need to make it our daily life and daily work; we need to make it even a part of our being. We must bear this responsibility for God&rsquo;s good pleasure.</p>
<p>If we practice the priestly ministry in the church life today, we will be made priests to God and Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward. In the New Jerusalem in eternity, one of the blessings to be received by the redeemed ones is to be priests serving God. The priests who compose the New Jerusalem will undoubtedly have the four characteristics in God&rsquo;s creation of man. They will be people bringing God to man and bringing man to God, and they will be absolutely one with God. Day and night they will be living a life in Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension. That will be the consummation of the priestly service.</p><h2 class="head4">f. Coming with the Clouds, and Every Eye Seeing Him, Those Also Who Pierced Him, and<br />
All the Tribes of the Land Mourning over Him</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:7 says, &ldquo;Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him.&rdquo; In Revelation Christ&rsquo;s coming back is revealed in two aspects. In one aspect Christ will come secretly as a thief (3:3; 16:15), and in another aspect He will come openly on the cloud (1:7; 14:14). This corresponds with Matthew 24:30 and 43. The day and hour of His coming in the first aspect are unknown (v. 36), whereas the day of His coming in the second aspect is clearly revealed&mdash;it will be at the last trumpet (the seventh trumpet) at the end of the great tribulation (1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:52; 2 Thes. 2:1-3).</p>
<p>Christ went to heaven on a cloud. He will come back to earth in the same way (Acts 1:9, 11; Matt. 26:64; Rev. 14:14). At the close of the great tribulation Christ will come on the cloud with power and great glory to be seen by all the tribes of the land. When Christ comes on the cloud, the earth will see Him. The Lord will appear as lightning, which flashes across the sky from east to west.</p>
<p>Revelation 1:7 mentions &ldquo;all the tribes of the land.&rdquo; Here the land refers to the Holy Land. All the tribes of the Holy Land will see Him. The basis for saying this is Zechariah 12:10-14, which says that they will look upon Him whom they have pierced and that the land will mourn for Him. The tribes mentioned in Revelation 1:7 are the tribes of those who have pierced Him. Revelation 1:7 surely is a reference to Zechariah 12. According to the context of Zechariah 12, the tribes are not all the nations of the earth but the twelve tribes in the Holy Land. Based upon this, we may say that the tribes in Revelation 1:7 are the twelve tribes in the Holy Land. When the Lord appears as lightning, coming with power and glory to be seen by all in the Holy Land, the twelve tribes will behold Him and will weep.</p>
<p>When Christ comes to the earth at the end of the war at Armageddon, the remnant of Israel will see Him whom they have pierced, will repent and wail, and will believe in Christ and receive Him (Zech. 12:10). In this way all Israel will be saved. This will be the household salvation rendered to Israel by God. The repentant Jews will look upon the One whom they have pierced. This means that they will look upon the Christ who was pierced by them. Although it was the repentant Jews&rsquo; forefathers who pierced the Lord Jesus, God counts that as something done by these repentant ones. The reason for this is that in the sight of God the entire people of Israel are one person.</p>
<p>Christ is the pierced One with whom there is the opened fountain. The piercing of Christ has opened a fountain for sin and impurity (John 19:34, 37; Zech. 13:1). This fountain is the flow of His precious blood from His hands and His side for the cleansing of sins; it was opened for the accomplishing of redemption. The piercing of Christ is the foundation of redemption. Apart from Christ&rsquo;s being pierced, there would be no base for our redemption.</p>
<p>Zechariah 12:10 says, &ldquo;They will wail over Him with wailing as for an only son and cry bitterly over Him with bitter crying as for a firstborn son.&rdquo; An only son is most dear to his parents, and a firstborn son has honor among the many sons. Repentant Israel will wail over Christ as the only Son of God and will cry bitterly over Him as the firstborn Son of God. They will mourn not for their sins but for their rejection of the Lord in the past.</p>
<p>In the New Testament Christ is revealed first as the only begotten Son of God and then as the firstborn Son of God. John 1:18 says that the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared Him. John 3:16 tells us that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. Through His death and resurrection, the only begotten Son became the firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:6a). According to the New Testament, Christ&rsquo;s being the only begotten Son is for us to be redeemed and to receive eternal life. Christ&rsquo;s becoming the firstborn Son through death and resurrection is for us to become sons of God as heirs to inherit all the riches of what God is, that is, to receive, participate in, and enjoy all the riches of the Triune God. In their repentance Israel will recognize Christ both as the only begotten Son of God and as the firstborn Son of God. They will realize that Christ, as the only begotten Son, has redeemed them and brought them eternal life and that He, as the firstborn Son, has made them heirs to inherit the riches of the Triune God as their enjoyment.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Son of Man</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:13-18 Christ is presented as the Son of Man. Christ as the Son of Man, in all that He is and does, is for our experience and enjoyment. In Revelation, Christ&mdash;the all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One&mdash;is unveiled as the Son of Man in chapter 1 and the Son of God in chapter 2. In Revelation 1:13 Christ not only is depicted here as the High Priest, as shown by His garment, but also is unveiled as being like the Son of Man. He is both divine and human. As our High Priest, He is caring for the churches in His humanity.</p>
<p>Christ as the Son of Man is not only for the accomplishing of redemption but also for the church life, because the church is composed of human beings. That the Lord is still the Son of Man after His ascension indicates that He has not put off His human nature after resurrection. His dealings here with the churches are based on His humanity. In His humanity He was altogether victorious and successful in bearing the testimony of God. The churches also, being in humanity, surely can be victorious and successful in bearing the testimony of God.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries some so-called Christians have taught that Christ was not the Son of God. Even today there are some so-called Christians who do not believe that Christ is the Son of God. To deny that Christ is the Son of God is heretical. Such a teaching is devilish and comes from Hades, and we must uncompromisingly stand against it. Some Christians, on the contrary, do not believe that Christ today is still the Son of Man. According to their view, Christ became a man by incarnation, but in His resurrection He put off His humanity. They think that Christ is no longer the Son of Man but only the Son of God. We believe, however, that according to the pure Word, today our Christ is both the Son of God with divinity and the Son of Man with humanity. He has two natures, divinity and humanity, and in Him we have true divinity and proper humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. In the Midst of the Lampstands&mdash;<br />
the Churches</h2>
<p>According to verse 13, &ldquo;One like the Son of Man&rdquo; is &ldquo;in the midst of the lampstands,&rdquo; which signify the churches (v. 20). In the Bible the lampstand is always related to God&rsquo;s building. The first time the lampstand was mentioned was in Exodus 25:31-40, when the tabernacle was built. The second instance was in regard to the building of the temple in 1 Kings 7:49. The third instance was closely related to the rebuilding of God&rsquo;s temple in Zechariah 4:2-10. In Revelation the lampstand is related to the building of the churches. In Exodus 25 the emphasis is on Christ being the lampstand as the divine light, shining as seven lamps with the Spirit (the oil). In Zechariah 4 the emphasis is on the Spirit (v. 6) as seven lamps shining, these seven lamps being the seven eyes of God (vv. 2, 10). The seven eyes of God are the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 5:6) for God&rsquo;s intensified move. This indicates that the lampstand in Zechariah is the reality of the lampstand in Exodus, and that the lampstands in Revelation are the reproduction of the lampstand in Zechariah. Christ is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is expressed as the churches. The shining Spirit is the reality of the shining Christ, and the shining churches are the reproduction and expression of the shining Spirit to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose that the New Jerusalem as the shining city may be consummated. Christ, the Spirit, and the churches are all of the same divine nature.</p>
<p>The churches, signified by the seven golden lampstands, are the testimony of Jesus (1:2, 9) in the divine nature, shining in the dark night locally yet collectively. The churches should be of the divine nature&mdash;golden. They should be the stands, even the lampstands, that bear the lamp with the oil (Christ as the life-giving Spirit) and shine in the darkness individually and collectively. They are individual lampstands locally, yet at the same time they are a group, a collection, of lampstands universally. They not only are shining locally but also are bearing universally the same testimony both to the localities and to the universe. They are of the same nature and in the same shape. They bear the same lamp for the same purpose and are fully identified with one another, not having any individual distinctiveness. The differences among the seven churches recorded in chapters 2 and 3 are all of a negative nature, not a positive one. Negatively, in their failures, the churches are different and separate from one another; but positively, in their nature, shape, and purpose, they are absolutely identical and are connected to one another.</p>
<p>Christ as the Son of Man today is &ldquo;in the midst of&rdquo; the lampstands, the churches. On the one hand, as the High Priest, He is interceding in the heavens for the churches (Heb. 9:24; 7:25-26; Rom. 8:34), and on the other hand, He is moving in the churches to care for them. The churches with Christ as their one center are the focus in the divine administration for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. If we would participate in His move and enjoy His care, we must be in the churches.</p>
<p>Revelation 4 and 5 unveil the Christ in heaven, whereas the first three chapters of Revelation unveil the Christ in the midst of the churches. The Christ in the midst of the churches is the Christ in heaven. Today the Christ on the earth is in the midst of His churches. Therefore, on the one hand, Christ is in heaven, and on the other hand, Christ is on earth, walking among His churches.</p>
<p>Today Christ is the glorious man walking in the midst of the golden lampstands, the local churches. If we want Him to walk in our midst, we must be in the local churches. If we are in the denominations, we are still in captivity. It is not a small thing to be in the local churches. Where the local churches are, there Christ is walking in the midst. To have Christ as the glorified man walking in our midst is the greatest reward for us in the local churches. To have Christ walking in our midst is inexpressibly glorious.</p>
<p>That Christ is walking in the midst of the lampstands (1:13; 2:1) is a sign, indicating that the place in which Christ can walk is the churches. If there were no churches on the earth, there would be no place for Christ to walk. Walking implies appearing to people. The place where John saw Jesus was in the midst of the churches. Many of us can testify that before we came into the churches, we knew of Jesus, but we did not see much of Him. In the churches we not only know of Jesus or hear of Him but also see Him and meet with Him. What the Lord truly desires to gain is the local churches.</p>
<p>When Christ comes to deal with us in the churches, He does so not only in His divinity but also in His humanity. When we are defeated, we may excuse ourselves, thinking that we are merely pitiful sons of man but that the Lord is quite capable and can overcome because He is the Son of God. When He comes to us as the Son of Man, however, we have no such excuse. He also was a man and overcame as a man, not only as the Son of God. We should not make any excuses for ourselves. If we are defeated and fail in the church life, we should not sympathize with ourselves, saying that our defeat is excusable because we are only human beings. Human beings are the right material for the church life. Thus, in the midst of the churches, Christ is walking as the Son of Man. In Daniel 3 we are told that the Son of God was walking in the fire (v. 25), but in Revelation 1 we see that the Son of Man is walking in the midst of the churches.</p>
<p>We must worship the Lord as the Son of Man. Because He is both human and divine, He is such a wonderful One. Because He is both divine and human, He knows God and man, heaven and earth. In Him we have divinity and humanity, and in Him we are both in the heavens and on the earth. Today the Lord is both in the heavens and on the earth, walking in His humanity in the midst of the local churches.</p>
<p>The Lord is with the church, but we cannot substantiate this with our eyes or our hands. In Matthew 28 the Lord clearly promised that even though He would ascend to heaven, He would still be with the disciples (v. 20). He promised that He would be with them not only temporarily but for all the days until the consummation of the age, until the time that He comes back. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s being with His disciples after His ascension is from the time of His ascension until His second coming. He will surely fulfill the promise that He personally gave to the disciples at His ascension. The situation of the church over the past two thousand years testifies that the ascended Lord has never left the church. He has been with the church the entire time.</p>
<p>If we spend time to enjoy Christ in His humanity, all the local churches will be bright and shining. In Revelation 1, Christ is unveiled as the Son of Man. This indicates that the Son of Man is for the local churches. All the local churches need the humanity of Jesus. We must take Him as our food, enjoy Him, and even eat Him in His humanity (John 6:57). We need to be nourished with His humanity, and this nourishing will swallow up all our weaknesses. The humanity of Jesus will make us spiritually healthy.</p>
<p>We need to see the difference between Hebrews chapter 1 and chapter 2. Chapter 1 unveils that Christ is the Son of God; it indicates that He is even God Himself (v. 8). Chapter 1 reveals His divinity, whereas chapter 2 reveals His humanity. It is at the end of chapter 2 that we find the succor, aid, support, help, and supply (v. 18). This comes not so much from Jesus as the Son of God but from the humanity of Jesus. The man Jesus is the succoring One, the aiding One, the supporting One, and the supplying One. Our help and support come mainly from His humanity. In order to succor and supply us, He must have His humanity. If we would enjoy His succoring, we must feed upon His humanity.</p>
<p>John 19:5 records Pilate&rsquo;s words regarding the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;Behold, the man!&rdquo; When Pilate spoke these words, Christ was crowned with thorns, but today He is crowned with glory (Heb. 2:7). He wore a purple garment, but now He wears a priestly garment (John 19:5; Rev. 1:13). He is crowned with glory and clothed with the priestly garment to care for all the local churches. We all need to see this man, for this man is our aid, our help, our support, our supply, and our all. This man is our food for the priesthood.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Clothed with a Garment Reaching<br />
to the Feet as a Priest</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:13 says that Christ, the Son of Man, is &ldquo;clothed with a garment reaching to the feet&rdquo; as a priest. This long garment is the priestly robe, the garment of a high priest (Exo. 28:33-35), signifying the fullness of Christ&rsquo;s divine attributes and human virtues (cf. Isa. 6:1, 3). Although the word <em>priest</em> is not mentioned in Revelation 1:13, we know by His garment that Christ is depicted here as the High Priest. Today the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, is walking in the midst of the churches, caring for them as a Priest. Among the three offices of priest, prophet, and king, the most dear, intimate, precious, and lovely office is that of the priest. The priest is so dear and lovely because he takes care of the people. In God&rsquo;s administration today, Christ is a Priest in the midst of the churches, taking care of them as lampstands for the shining of God.</p>
<p>Christ is wearing a long garment down to His feet, a perfect robe of the High Priest. In the Bible the garment signifies what a person is and what he does (Isa. 64:6; Rev. 19:8). Christ&rsquo;s long robe signifies His splendor in His virtues, which is expressed mainly in and through His humanity (Isa. 6:1). In the Old Testament a priest was not to be exposed in any part (Exo. 20:26); all parts of his body had to be clothed. Suppose the Lord&rsquo;s priestly garment was short, exposing His feet and legs. This would indicate that He lacked some virtues. However, Christ&rsquo;s wearing a perfect garment indicates that He is perfect. His long robe signifies that He is short of nothing and that this God-man has human virtues that are sufficient to cover His whole being. He has all the virtues with no shortage whatsoever. With Him, nothing is short, lacking, or needed. He is fully qualified to be a priest. He is walking in the midst of the churches as the High Priest in a perfect robe to bring the local churches into the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Girded About at the Breasts with a Golden Girdle</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:13 also says that Christ, the Son of Man, is &ldquo;girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.&rdquo; The priests in the Old Testament were girded at the loins for their ministry (Exo. 28:4). In Daniel 10:5 Christ also is girded at His loins, with fine gold. But in Revelation 1:13 Christ as our High Priest is girded about at the breasts. The breasts signify love and refer to His loving care and concern. To be girded at the loins is to be strengthened for work, whereas to be girded about at the breasts signifies care in love. Christ&rsquo;s work in producing the churches has been accomplished. He no longer needs to be girded at His loins for work. What He is doing now in the midst of the churches is to care for them in love. With respect to the work of producing the churches, the time of His labor is over. Now is the time of His loving care for the churches. This requires that He be girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle. This golden girdle signifies the divine strength. Christ is now exercising a divine care over the churches, moving among them in His humanity and caring for them with His divine strength. He is concerned for His beloved churches. What a loving care He exercises over His churches today!</p>
<p>Christ is wearing a golden girdle on His breasts. This girdle is a long piece of gold. The girdle and the gold are not two separate things. The girdle is the gold. The golden girdle is one piece of gold to become a belt. The Son of Man is in His humanity, and the golden girdle signifies His divinity becoming His energy. Christ&rsquo;s energy is totally His divinity. A piece of gold is now a girdle. The totality of Christ in His divinity has become a girdle. The golden girdle signifies Christ&rsquo;s divinity becoming His energy, and the breasts signify that this golden energy is exercised and motivated by His love. His divine energy is exercised by and with His love to nourish the churches.</p>
<p>Christ still walks in the midst of the churches. The churches are on the earth, whereas the One walking is not the earthly Jesus but the heavenly High Priest. His walking is in the atmosphere of the heavens. This is suggested by His garments. He is wearing a priestly robe and is girded at the breasts with a golden girdle. <em>Golden</em> indicates that He is divine, bearing the divine administration, whereas the girdle at the breasts indicates love. The atmosphere He brings is a divine atmosphere filled with love. We would be terrified if we saw the Lord&rsquo;s seven eyes, which are like a flame of fire. Therefore, we need to keep our gaze fixed on His breast, which is full of the divine love for us. How tender is His concern for all the churches! He even rebukes and chastises us in love. He is the loving Priest caring for His churches today.</p><h2 class="head4">d. His Head and Hair<br />
Being White as White Wool, as Snow</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:14 says, &ldquo;His head and hair were as white as white wool, as snow.&rdquo; White hair signifies great age (Job 15:10). The black hair with which the Lord is depicted in Song of Songs 5:11 signifies His unfading and everlasting strength, but the white hair with which He is depicted in Revelation 1:14 signifies His ancientness.</p>
<p>Although Christ is exceedingly ancient, He is not old. His head and His hair were white as wool and as snow. White wool issues from the nature of life, and white snow comes down from the sky, from heaven. Wool is not made white; it is born white, and its whiteness comes out of its nature. White wool is the color of Christ&rsquo;s nature. His ancientness is of His nature. Snow is white because it comes from heaven and contains no earthly dirt or stain. Hence, white wool, both in Revelation 1:14 and in Daniel 7:9, signifies that the ancientness of Christ is of His nature, not of His becoming old, while white snow signifies that His ancientness is heavenly, not earthly.</p>
<p>The Son of Man is ancient, but He is not old. He is eternally ancient. He is the One in the beginning without a beginning. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&rdquo; (John 1:1, 14). Christ was in the beginning that did not have a beginning. Jesus, the man of Nazareth, is ancient because He is God Himself. He is the God-man, the mingling of divinity with humanity. In the Bible God is called the Ancient of Days (Dan. 7:9, 13, 22). Christ is the Son of Man, yet He is unveiled as the eternal God.</p>
<p>Although Christ is ancient, He is &ldquo;living&rdquo; (Rev. 1:18). Christ is the most ancient One, yet He is the most living One. He is living forever and ever. The church, the Body of Christ, must be the same as Christ, the Head of the Body. The more mature we are, the more living we must be. As a local church matures, it should become increasingly living.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. His Eyes Being like a Flame of Fire</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:14 we see that Christ&rsquo;s eyes are like a flame of fire. In Song of Songs 5:12 the eyes of Christ are like doves. That is for the expression of His love. In Revelation 1:14 His eyes are &ldquo;like a flame of fire.&rdquo; This is for Him to observe and search that He may exercise judgment by enlightening. His eyes are like a flame of fire to look into us in order to test us and refine us. In Revelation His eyes are not two but seven (5:6). Seven is the number of completion in God&rsquo;s move. Hence, His eyes in this book are for God&rsquo;s operation. These seven eyes of His are the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God (4:5; cf. Dan. 10:6). The &ldquo;fire burning&rdquo; equals the &ldquo;flame of fire&rdquo; and is for observing and searching. The seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth are also for God&rsquo;s move on the earth. Thus, the eyes of Christ in this book are the seven Spirits of God for God&rsquo;s move and operation on earth today.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s eyes are for watching, observing, searching, judging by enlightening, and infusing. We should experience all these different aspects of His eyes, especially the aspect of infusing. His eyes infuse us with all that He is. His infusing eyes are a flame of fire which is continually burning. This can be proved by our experience. Since the day we were saved, Christ&rsquo;s eyes have been like a burning fire enlightening and infusing us. His eyes also stir us up to be hot. After Christ has looked at us, we can never be cold as we once were. By looking at us, the Lord burns us and stirs us up. Many times the Lord comes to us with His piercing eyes. Perhaps when we are trying to hide something from others, the Lord comes with seven shining eyes piercing into our being and exposing our true condition. When we are arguing with others, especially with our intimate ones, the shining eyes of Christ are upon us, and we cannot go on speaking. His shining stops our mouth. As the Lord watches us with His seven eyes, we sense under His gaze how poor and unworthy we are. As a result, we feel humbled, judged, and repentant, and we confess our failures. Through His tender care and judging fire that purifies us, day after day we may have the sense that we are poor, unclean, and desperately in need of His mercy.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation is a book with a judging nature. Fire is for divine judgment (1 Cor. 3:13; Heb. 6:8; 10:27). &ldquo;Our God is also a consuming fire&rdquo; (12:29). His throne is like the fiery flame and its wheels are burning fire, and a fiery stream issues and comes forth from before Him (Dan. 7:9-10). All this is for judgment. The main significance of the Lord&rsquo;s eyes being as a flame of fire is for His judgment (Rev. 2:18-23; 19:11-12). When He comes to take possession of the earth by exercising judgment over it, even His feet will be like pillars of fire (10:1).</p>
<p>Christ is the lamp, and the church is the lampstand. The church is the expression of Christ, but this expression must be completely purified. It must be entirely of pure gold without any mixture or alloy. Gold is purified by fire. Therefore, Revelation is a book of purging and purifying fire. The first vision in this book is a revelation of Christ as the One whose eyes are like a flame of fire and whose feet are like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace (1:14-15). When He looks at people, He burns them in order to purge away everything that does not correspond to the nature of God. This purging and burning is His judgment, and His judgment begins with the church (1 Pet. 4:17; 1 Tim. 3:15).</p>
<p>In the first of the three sections of Revelation (chs. 1&mdash;3), there is the judgment of the divine burning in the church, and in the second section (chs. 4&mdash;20) there is the judgment of the divine burning in the world. The last section (chs. 21&mdash;22) reveals the issue, the result, of the judgment by burning. Anything that does not match the nature of God is purged away by this burning fire and is cast into the lake of fire. After all of the judgments by burning, everything in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem is purified.</p>
<p>We should not think that the Lord&rsquo;s shining today is only to give us grace. Even in the present age of grace, He is observing us and judging us. Even in the church, the manifestation of the Lord Jesus is for the carrying out of His judgment. His eyes are like a flame of fire. In Revelation He is not the dear and lovely Lord; rather, He is the awesome and dreadful Lord. He is here shining, examining, and judging to execute God&rsquo;s will. This is His administration.</p>
<p>Nothing of the flesh, of the world, or of sin can stand the shining of the seven Spirits as the seven lamps before the throne and as the seven eyes of the Lamb. This shining is a burning. Whatever He shines on, whatever He searches, is judged and burned by Him. Even today the indwelling Spirit in us is sometimes this kind of shining, searching, judging Spirit. On the one hand, this indwelling Spirit is the Spirit of life, the Spirit of sonship, the building Spirit, the transforming Spirit, the Spirit for our living, and the Spirit of the Body, all of which are aspects on the sweet side. On the other hand, He is the judging Spirit, the administrating Spirit, who is in us and among us, shining over us, searching us, judging us, and burning us. We need the grace-giving Spirit, and we also need the judging Spirit. We need the Spirit as the living water flowing in us, but we also need the Spirit as fire shining, searching, judging, and burning in us.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s eyes, which are like a flame of fire, indicate that He is burning. In the local churches there should be no coldness or lukewarmness, for Christ is the burning One. Since He is burning, we all must be burning. All the believers in the churches must be burning. If we allow the Lord&rsquo;s seven eyes to look upon us as we read the Word prayerfully, we will not remain cold but instead will be burned and even burning.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son of Man.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. His Feet like Shining Bronze,<br />
as Having Been Fired in a Furnace</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:15 says, &ldquo;His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace.&rdquo; Feet signify the walk. In typology, bronze signifies divine judgment (Exo. 27:1-6). When Christ was on earth, His earthly walk and daily walk were tried and tested. Every step He took in His human living was tested, and He passed all the tests. Because His walk was tested, He came out shining. Now the feet of Christ are as shining bronze, as mentioned also in Ezekiel 1:7 and Daniel 10:6, signifying that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise divine judgment.</p>
<p>To be &ldquo;fired in a furnace&rdquo; is to be tried by being burned. Christ&rsquo;s walk was tried by His sufferings, even by His death on the cross. Hence, His walk is bright as the shining bronze, which qualifies Him to judge the unrighteous. Since His walk has been tested, He can test and try us. When He comes to possess the earth by judging it, His feet will be like pillars of fire (Rev. 10:1).</p>
<p>The Lord with His shining bronze feet is walking among the churches. His shining feet cause us to realize how dirty, unclean, sinful, dark, and earthly our daily walk is. Consequently, we fear and tremble before the Lord. Such humbling experiences are a strong sign that the Lord is walking through the churches. We should praise the Lord that He is shining today in the churches.</p>
<p>The Lord tests us by His shining feet. From His head to His feet, He is a shining person. When we come into His presence, there is no darkness. Instead, we are under the absolute shining. In His presence nothing can be hidden or concealed; everything is exposed. The apostle John saw this Christ, was frightened, and fell at His feet as dead (1:17). Similarly, in the church life we need to be in His presence, come under His absolute shining, and experience a thorough exposure that frightens us. Under this exposure, we will see that all that we are, all that we have, and all that we do cannot stand His test. Then we will fall at His feet as dead.</p>
<p>The feet of the Lord Jesus &ldquo;were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace.&rdquo; Feet signify walk. We all should have a walk like the Lord&rsquo;s walk. Ezekiel 1:7 tells us that the calf&rsquo;s foot &ldquo;sparkled like the sight of burnished bronze.&rdquo; The shining of bronze comes from the heat of the furnace. The more the bronze is burned and tested, the brighter it shines. This indicates that we need a walk that has been tested and burned by the Lord. If our walk has been tested in this way, it will be like shining bronze, enlightening others and becoming a kind of shining to them. If we have been tested and examined by the Lord, our walk will shine like burnished bronze, giving light to others, testing them, and causing them to realize whether their walk is right or wrong. Likewise, if we have been tested and examined by the Lord in the church life, then our walk in the church life will be like shining bronze, enlightening others and testing them. Wherever we go and whatever way we take, our walk will shine upon others, giving them light and testing them.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. His Voice Being like the Sound of Many Waters</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:15 also says, &ldquo;His voice was like the sound of many waters.&rdquo; This means that His voice is loud and mighty. &ldquo;The sound of many waters,&rdquo; a tumultuous sound, is the sound of the voice of the Almighty God (Ezek. 1:24; 43:2). It signifies the seriousness and solemnity of His speaking (cf. Rev. 10:3). Sometimes the Lord&rsquo;s voice is gentle and tender, but at other times His voice shocks us like thunder. Whenever we are sloppy or sleepy, the voice of the Lord will wake us up. His voice, which is that of the Almighty God, warns us and wakes us up.</p>
<p>In His human living, the Lord was at times silent (Matt. 12:19), but today He is different. Today He is in the churches with a voice like the sound of many waters. Like Him, we should be living and voicing. We are not serving a silent Christ but One with a voice like the sound of many waters. When we come together in the churches, we need to have many a sound. In the churches we must be filled with Him and make a joyful sound, a joyful noise, to Him (Psa. 100:1) so that our praises will be like the sound of many waters. We should praise the Lord with a joyful noise, because the Christ who is within us and who is walking in the midst of the churches is a Christ with a loud voice.</p><h2 class="head4">h. His Having in His Right Hand Seven Stars&mdash;<br />
the Messengers of the Churches</h2>
<p> Revelation 1:16 says, &ldquo;He had in His right hand seven stars.&rdquo; As verse 20 makes clear, &ldquo;the seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches.&rdquo; The messengers are the spiritual ones in the churches bearing the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus. Like stars, they should be of the heavenly nature and in a heavenly position. In the Acts and the Epistles the elders were the leading ones in the operation of the local churches (Acts 14:23; 20:17; Titus 1:5). The eldership is somewhat official, and at the time that Revelation was written, the offices in the churches had deteriorated in the degradation of the church. In Revelation the Lord calls our attention back to spiritual reality. Hence, it emphasizes the messengers of the churches rather than the elders. The office of the elders is easily perceived, but the believers need to see the importance of the spiritual and heavenly reality of the messengers for the proper church life to bear the testimony of Jesus in the darkness of the church&rsquo;s degradation.</p>
<p>Both the lampstands and the stars are for shining in the night. A lampstand, representing a local church, is a collective unit, whereas a star, representing a messenger of a local church, is an individual entity. In the dark night of the church&rsquo;s degradation, there is the need of the shining both of the collective churches and of the individual messengers. While churches need the care of Christ, their messengers need His keeping grace. As Christ walks among the churches, He holds the leading ones in His right hand. How comforting this is! The leading ones must praise Him that they are in His hands and that He is holding them. Since the leading ones are in His hands, there is no need for them to shrink back, to be weak, or to be mistaken. Christ truly takes the responsibility for His testimony.</p>
<p>The saints who are taking the lead in the churches as the messengers are held in Christ&rsquo;s right hand. This One is the holder of the leading ones in the churches. However, some of the so-called church leaders may not be held by Him. Christ holds in His hand only those He recognizes. To be held by Him, we must first be recognized by Him. We should realize that the leading ones in the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are held in His right hand. When we see this, it will save us from disappointment and discouragement and strengthen us to the uttermost.</p>
<p>In Revelation the Lord repudiates all formalities. Being an elder may be somewhat legal or formal. We should not aspire to be one who is merely in the position of an elder; instead, we should desire to be a shining star. We who are the serving ones need to be aware that we are not in our own hands but His. He administrates the lampstands and holds the stars.</p>
<p>It is significant that every one of the seven epistles to the seven churches was written to the messengers of the churches. Under normal circumstances the messengers of the churches are the elders of the churches. It is true that the different churches are God&rsquo;s lampstands in the different places. Yet when the Lord came to speak, He did not speak directly to the churches; rather, He spoke to the messengers of the churches. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, position means nothing. What we can do and how much we can accomplish also mean nothing. What matters is how much we are shining and how bright we are. In other words, what matters is not how much we can do but how much we shine. This is what it means to be a messenger of the Lord in the churches today. The night is so evil and dark that there is absolutely no light. But there are shining stars in the churches. Their presence in the church means very much. When they are in the churches, everything is in light. When they are gone, the whole situation is full of darkness.</p>
<p>As shining stars in the church, we do not have any light in ourselves. We can shine only by reflecting Christ as the sun (Luke 1:78). Hence, we must look unto Him with unveiled face that we might reflect His glory (2 Cor. 3:18). This causes us to become the shining stars.</p>
<h2 class="head4">I. Out of His Mouth Proceeding<br />
a Sharp Two-edged Sword</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:16 we are told that &ldquo;out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword.&rdquo; In Song of Songs 5:16 &ldquo;His mouth is sweetness itself,&rdquo; and in the Gospels &ldquo;words of grace&rdquo; proceeded out of His mouth (Luke 4:22). But in Revelation 1:16 &ldquo;out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword.&rdquo; This is His divine, discerning, judging, and slaying word (Heb. 4:12; Eph. 6:17). The &ldquo;words of grace&rdquo; are for His supply of grace to His favored ones, whereas the &ldquo;sharp two-edged sword&rdquo; is for His dealing with negative persons and things. The Spirit speaks to the churches, and the speaking Spirit today is this Christ who speaks with a two-edged sword. There is judgment here, and we have experienced this. Because of the church&rsquo;s degradation, we need a certain amount of judgment. Today all Christians need the judgment of the Lord by His word. Many times we have experienced this judgment because of our being mistaken and going astray from the Lord. Since we had wandered away from Him, He came to judge us. His speaking today is mainly a type of judgment. The Lord&rsquo;s call for His overcomers involves judgment. If the Lord would speak to us, most of His words would be words of judgment. When He speaks, He judges. Every word out of His mouth in the churches today is like a sharp knife which judges us. The words which proceed out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth are sharp, piercing into our being, dividing our soul from our spirit, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of our heart (Heb. 4:12). This is the Christ we experience today in the church life.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today we have One who is walking in our midst. He watches over us with His seven burning eyes, and out of His mouth proceeds a sharp two-edged sword. This sword kills all the different concepts among us and eliminates debates in the churches. Every time an opinion rises up, the sword cuts it to pieces. The more we think about our opinion, the more we are cut. This is not doctrine&mdash;this is our experience. Whenever two brothers are close to arguing, the third party, the strongest party, appears, using the sharp sword to cut the opinions of both brothers. The two-edged sword quells all the turmoil. This third party is Christ, the Son of Man, who, as the High Priest, walks among the churches and cares for them in love. In the Old Testament there was the need for the priests to trim the lamps. Today our Priest, the Son of Man, knows the right time to trim us. As a result, we enjoy calm in the church life.</p><h2 class="head4">j. His Face Shining as the Sun Shines in Its Power</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:16 we are told that &ldquo;His face shone as the sun shines in its power.&rdquo; In Song of Songs 5:10 and 13 His face appears lovely for His seeker&rsquo;s appreciation of Him, and in the Epistles His face reflects God&rsquo;s glory (2 Cor. 4:6) for the imparting of life into His believers. In Revelation 1:16, however, His face is &ldquo;as the sun shines in its power,&rdquo; as in Daniel 10:6. This shining is the judging enlightenment for bringing in the kingdom. This indicates that Christ Himself is the universal sun; with Him, there is no night. When He was transfigured and His face shone like the sun, that was His coming in the kingdom (Matt. 16:28&mdash;17:2). When He comes to take over the earth for the kingdom, His face will be like the sun (Rev. 10:1).</p>
<p>Before the Lord comes back to enlighten the whole world, He is now walking among the local churches, shining over us. The church life is full of life and light. In the genuine church life we cannot lie to the brothers and sisters. Before a lie can come out of our lips, the shining of Christ causes it to vanish. Then we turn to the Lord and thank Him for His shining. We may pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, forgive me. I was going to lie to the brothers, but Your shining saved me.&rdquo; This is the church life, where we experience the shining light of Christ. Christ is the real light in the church life. His face is like the shining of the sun, and He has seven eyes like flaming fire. When He looks at us, we are under His shining and exposing.</p>
<h2 class="head4">k. His Being the First and the Last</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:17 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the First and the Last.&rdquo; Christ is not only the First and the Last but also the Beginning and the End. He is the First, the One at the beginning, and the Last, the One at the end. This assures us that, having started the church life, He will surely accomplish it. He will never leave His work unfinished. All the local churches must believe that the Lord Jesus is the beginning and the ending. He will accomplish what He has begun in His recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head4">l. His Being the Living One, and His Becoming Dead and Living Forever and Ever</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:18 we see that the Lord is &ldquo;the living One,&rdquo; the One who &ldquo;became dead&rdquo; and who is &ldquo;living forever and ever.&rdquo; The Lord suffered death and lived again. He entered into death, but death could not hold Him (Acts 2:24), because He is the resurrection (John 11:25). Christ died, but in resurrection He will live forever. Resurrection is the lengthening of the Lord&rsquo;s days. He will exist forever and ever in His resurrection. Jesus Christ today is the living One, the One who is in resurrection. For Christ to dispense life, He must be the living One since a dead person can never dispense life to others.</p>
<p>The importance of His being the living One is that He is living in us. He is living forever and is living in us. Therefore, He wants us to leave every kind of death and rise up to be the living church. The living One within us can never be dead. His church should be neither dead nor deadened; instead, His church must be living all the time. We must learn to enjoy Christ as the living One. His living forever is His testimony, for the testimony of Jesus is always related to the matter of being living. If a local church is not living, it will not have the testimony of Jesus. The more living we are, the more we are the testimony of the living Jesus.</p>
<p>The Christ who walks in the midst of the churches, who is the Head of the churches and to whom the churches belong, is the living One&mdash;full of life. Hence, the churches as His Body should also be living, fresh, and strong. We have a living Christ who has overcome death. Our Christ, who is the resurrected One, is living in us and among us. He is living forever and ever. What a living Christ we have in the recovery! In the recovery all the churches should be as living as Christ, full of life and overcoming death.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the living One. For us to be living, we must have not only life but also the life supply. If we do not eat any food, we will not be so living, but if we eat nutritious meals, we will be living and even energetic. Our energy comes from our eating. The living Christ cares for the churches by giving to the believers Himself as their food and life supply. Therefore, in His seven epistles to the seven churches, the Lord as the living One presents three promises of eating: the tree of life (Rev. 2:7), the hidden manna (v. 17), and a feast full of His riches (3:20). If we would be living, we need to eat Christ as the tree of life and the hidden manna and to feast with Him.</p>
<p>It was to the church in Smyrna, the suffering church, that the Lord revealed Himself as the One who became dead and lived again. The suffering church needs to know Him as such a One so that she may endure all kinds of suffering. However severe the persecution may be, the church will still be alive, for the resurrection life of Christ within her can endure death. The most that suffering or persecution can do is to kill us. Following the death from persecution, there is resurrection. The Lord was persecuted to death. But that death was not the end&mdash;it was the gateway into resurrection. When He entered into death, He came to the threshold of resurrection. This indicates that the suffering church should not frightened by persecution or terrified at the prospect of being killed; rather, she must welcome death and be happy, for once she has passed into death, she also will be on the threshold of resurrection. Whenever we are undergoing persecution, we must rise up and declare, &ldquo;Hallelujah, I am about to enter into the gateway of resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the church, tribulation is a test of life. The extent to which the church experiences and enjoys the resurrection life of Christ can be tested only by tribulation. Moreover, tribulation also brings in the riches of the resurrection life of Christ. The Lord&rsquo;s purpose in allowing the church to suffer tribulation is not only to testify that His resurrection life overcomes death but also to enable the church to enter into the riches of His life. The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life is in the church. Christ, the One who is the resurrection, is living in us. Because we have resurrection life in us, there is no reason or excuse for us to fail. We need not be defeated by persecution. Rather, we must suffer this persecution victoriously by His resurrection life.</p><h2 class="head4">m. His Having the Keys of Death and of Hades</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:18 the Lord also says, &ldquo;I have the keys of death and of Hades.&rdquo; Due to the fall and sin of man, death came in and is now working on earth to gather up all the sinful people into Hades. Death resembles a dustpan used to collect the dust from the floor, and Hades resembles a trash can. Whatever the dustpan collects is put into the trash can. Thus, death is a collector, and Hades is a keeper. In the church life today we are no longer subject to death and Hades, for Christ abolished death on the cross and overcame Hades in His resurrection. Although Hades tried its best to hold Him, it was powerless to do it (Acts 2:24). With Him, death has no sting and Hades has no power. We must be the same as Christ. In the church life the keys of death and Hades are in His hand. It is impossible for us to deal with death; we simply do not have the ability to handle it. Whenever death enters, it will deaden many. But as long as we give the Lord Jesus the ground, the opportunity, and the free way to move and act among us, both death and Hades will be under His control. However, whenever the Lord Jesus does not have the ground in the church, death immediately becomes prevailing and Hades becomes powerful to hold the dead ones. We should praise the Lord that Christ has the keys of death and of Hades. Death is subject to Him, and Hades is under His control.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was also His victory over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave (2:24). Satan, death, Hades, and the grave form a group. Christ, the Son of Man, was not only vindicated by God and was proved to be a success in His achievements, but He was victorious over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave, all of which are a great concern and trouble to us. The Son of Man overcame death and destroyed Satan (Heb. 2:14). The keys of death and of Hades are now in His hand (Rev. 1:18), and He is victorious over the grave. Such a Christ is walking in the midst of all the local churches in His recovery, taking care of them as the golden lampstands.</p>
<p>The Christ in Revelation is different from the One in the four Gospels. Yes, He is the same Christ, but He is the same Christ in different aspects. In the four Gospels Christ was mild, gentle, and kind. When He looked at people, they felt loved. In the Gospel of John, Jesus looked at people and wept; He truly captured people by His loving look (11:35; Luke 22:61). This same Christ, however, appears differently in the book of Revelation. He has seven eyes, which are like a flame of fire (1:14; 5:6), burning and shining. In the Gospels His most intimate disciple could even recline on His bosom (John 13:23). John was close to Him, and He was nice, dear, gentle, kind, and loving to John. However, when John saw Him again in Revelation, he was frightened and fell at His feet as dead (Rev. 1:17). If such a Christ appeared to us today, we would all be shocked. Luke 4:22 says that words of grace proceeded out of His mouth, but Revelation tells us that a sharp two-edged sword proceeds out of His mouth (1:16; 19:15). Moreover, in John 1:29 He is introduced as the Lamb of God, but in Revelation 5:5 He is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah. The book of Revelation unveils Christ to us not in a common way but in an extraordinary way. This way is absolutely different from that in the Gospels. In this sense, Revelation continues the Gospels and the Epistles, but it does not reveal Christ according to the Gospels and the Epistles. In Revelation He is not a small, gentle, kind, patient, silent, and suffering Christ; He is a bold, fierce, rich, burning, and living Christ. If we experience the Christ unveiled in Revelation, we will be in life, enjoy His victory, praise Him, and shout for joy.</p>
<p>If we consider the picture of Christ in Revelation 1, we will see that this chapter presents a fierce Christ. His eyes are as a flame of fire; His feet are like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace; His voice is as the sound of many waters; and out of His mouth proceeds a sharp two-edged sword. We must have a new impression of Christ. Christ, the Son of Man, who is walking in the midst of the local churches, is living, burning, and fierce. He is gracious, yet He is terrifying. Particularly at the end of the age of the church, Christ must be fierce. Because the days are so dark, evil, and dead, we need a fierce Christ. If we contact the Christ in Revelation, we will not be cold but burning, and we will not be silent but will shout to praise Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">3. The Priest Who Trims the Lampstands&mdash;<br />
the Churches</h2>
<p>In Revelation 2 and 3 Christ is revealed as the Priest who trims the lampstands, the churches. As the testimony of Jesus, the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God. With the golden lampstand there are three main factors. First, the entire lampstand is gold. It is not only golden but gold itself. In biblical typology gold signifies God the Father&rsquo;s divine nature. Hence, the golden essence of the lampstand signifies God the Father. Second, the golden lampstand is not a lump of gold but a piece of gold in a definite form and a purposeful shape. The shape, the form, the appearance, of the lampstand signifies Christ the Son as the embodiment of the Godhead and the embodiment of the Father&rsquo;s nature (Col. 2:9). Third, the seven lamps of the lampstand signify the seven Spirits (Rev. 4:5). The seven lamps, which are the seven Spirits of God, shine for the expression of God. Thus, with the lampstand are the nature, the embodiment, and the expression. Based upon these items, we may say that the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God. God the Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is expressed through the Spirit. According to Revelation 1, the golden lampstands are the churches (vv. 11-12). Every local church is a golden lampstand, and the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God as the testimony of Jesus. Thus, the local churches are the multiplied embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Priests in ancient times, who trimmed the lampstands in the Holy Place for the shining of God, typify Christ as the Priest who takes care of all the local churches as the lampstands by dressing the lamps (Exo. 27:20-21; Lev. 24:1-4). The high priest in the Old Testament dressed the lamps of the lampstand every morning so that they would continue to shine brightly (Exo. 30:7). To dress the lamps, the priest first had to snuff the burned-out wick. The wick in the lamps burned with oil to give light. When the wick burned out, it became charred and black; hence, the priest had to come to cut off the black part of the wick. This is what it means to snuff the wick, that is, to cleanse the lamp so that the lamp may shine better. At the same time, to dress the lamps the priest had to add more oil. Christ in Revelation 2 and 3 is like the priest in the Old Testament coming to the Holy Place to dress the lamps.</p>
<p>The first vision of Christ in Revelation, recorded in chapter 1, is that of the High Priest clothed with a priestly garment. As the High Priest, Christ is walking among and taking care of the lampstands. He especially cares for their shining by trimming the lamps. Then in chapter 8 Christ is revealed as the Priest offering incense at the golden altar: &ldquo;Another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne&rdquo; (v. 3). Therefore, in chapter 1 Christ is revealed as the Priest taking care of the lampstands, and in chapter 8 He is unveiled as the Priest offering incense to God. In chapter 5 He is revealed as the Administrator over the whole universe. To the church Christ is the High Priest; as the ascended One in the heavens, He is now living, working, and ministering as a Priest. But to the universe Christ is not the Priest; He is the Administrator.</p>
<p>Christ is caring for the churches in an administrative way. The churches are God&rsquo;s lampstands shining forth His testimony. They need Christ&rsquo;s administration. Sometimes troubles and difficulties arise, requiring His administrative attention. Christ takes care of the churches as the lampstands in His humanity as the Son of Man (1:13a). Christ as our High Priest takes care of the churches, which He has established, in His humanity in order to cherish the churches, to make the churches happy, pleasant, and comfortable. He does this by dressing the lamps of the lampstands. To dress the lamps is to make them proper. Christ cares for the lampstands by trimming the wicks of the lamps of the lampstands. The charred part of the wick, the snuff, signifies the things that are not according to God&rsquo;s purpose and need to be cut off, such as sin, the world, the flesh, the natural man, the self, and the old creation. All the churches as lampstands are organic; they are living lampstands. Since each church is a living lampstand, each church has much feeling. A church with charred wicks will not feel comfortable, having no feeling of happiness or pleasantness. But when Christ as our High Priest comes to dress the lamps of the lampstand by trimming the wicks to snuff all the negative things, this is a cherishing to make the church happy, pleasant, and comfortable. This is Christ&rsquo;s taking care of the church in His humanity to dress the lamps of the church.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the churches need Christ to snuff out all the negative things. On the other hand, the churches need Christ to add more oil, which typifies the Spirit (Isa. 61:1). In Revelation the oil is the seven Spirits of God, the sevenfold Spirit. The Lord Jesus desires to add more oil into the lampstands. According to Revelation 2 and 3, in nearly every epistle to the seven churches, the Lord as the High Priest was snuffing the wicks and adding more oil to the lampstands in order to make all the lampstands golden, pure, and shining. When the Lord has to come in to cut off the burned-out, black wicks and to fill the local churches with the oil, the local churches will be cleansed from the burned-out wicks and be filled with more Spirit to shine more brightly as the testimony of Jesus. It is by this way that a local church is built up more and more until it becomes a golden lampstand in reality.</p>
<p>According to the vision, a local church is a golden lampstand, but in our locality the actuality, the practicality, of the church may not look exactly like what we see in the vision. But we should believe that the day will come when the churches of the Lord will be golden lampstands in reality. We may realize that the church in our locality is not yet according to the vision in Revelation 1 of a golden lampstand. But our saying &ldquo;not yet&rdquo; indicates that there is hope that the time will come when all the churches will be golden in reality. In the Lord&rsquo;s heavenly ministry, His intention is to snuff all the burned-out wicks of the local churches, to cut off the unnecessary, negative things. No doubt, there are some negative things in the local churches, but we must be careful not to focus on these things and talk about them with a critical spirit. If we are critical, we will become a part of the burned-out wick. We believe that in the church and ministry meetings, the Lord is continuing His work of snuffing out the negative things and filling up the lampstands with oil.</p>
<p>Year after year, the local churches are being brought more and more into the reality of the golden lampstands. More of the Father&rsquo;s nature as the gold is being added to the churches, and the churches are increasingly being shaped into the form of Christ the Son. Furthermore, as the Spirit, the oil, is being added to the lampstands, the churches shine brighter and brighter. Year after year we can see more light in the local churches. This means that the Lord as the Priest is cleansing the lamps by snuffing the burned-out wicks and filling the lampstands with the oil so that they are increasing in the Father&rsquo;s nature, the Son&rsquo;s image, and the Spirit&rsquo;s expression. As we enter into the Word with the help of the footnotes of the Recovery Version and the Life-study messages, we partake of more of the Father&rsquo;s golden nature (2 Pet. 1:4), and this gives the Lord a way to shape us more and more into the image of Christ and to add more of the Spirit into us so that the lampstand will shine more brightly. Every local church needs to be an embodiment of the Triune God shining in its locality.</p>
<p>In this lampstand there are only two basic elements&mdash;the gold and the oil. The gold is the solid form, and the oil is the burning element. When these two are put together, there is a lampstand shining to express God in His trinity with the Father&rsquo;s nature and essence, the Son&rsquo;s image and appearance, and the Spirit&rsquo;s expression. Zechariah 4:12 tells us that the oil of the lampstand is golden oil. This means that the gold flows as oil. The two elements of the lampstand are the golden element and the element of the oil, but according to Zechariah these two elements are actually one. When more oil is added into the lampstand, more gold is added also. The church as the lampstand is the solid embodiment of the Triune God with the sevenfold Spirit as the oil, the essence of which is the element of the gold.</p>
<p>This can be confirmed by the churches&rsquo; experience. Whenever Christ as the High Priest comes to snuff all the negative things and add more oil to the churches, He is actually adding more of the sevenfold Spirit, which is to add more of the divine nature, more of the gold, into the churches. At the beginning, the church in a locality may not have much gold. As time goes on, however, the Lord snuffs the negative things and adds the oil. Eventually, the church will have more gold, more of the divine nature. This indicates that the church as the embodiment of the Triune God must be reduced in all the human, natural things but increased in the divine nature all the time. Our flesh, our self, our natural man, and everything about us related to the old creation must decrease. By Christ&rsquo;s trimming the wicks and adding oil, the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation in the local churches are being reduced, and God&rsquo;s element, the Spirit, is being increased. Through this process, the churches become the pure golden lampstands in reality, and this is the testimony of Jesus in today&rsquo;s age on this earth.</p><h2 class="head4">a. By His Speaking&mdash;Words Proceeding<br />
out of His Mouth like a Sharp Two-edged Sword</h2>
<p>Christ as the Priest trims the lampstands, the churches, by His speaking (Rev. 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 1:16b). In Revelation 2 and 3 the most striking point is the speaking of this all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One. He spoke seven times, to each of the seven churches. At the beginning of each of these seven epistles the Lord told us what kind of person He is, according to the condition of the church revealed in that particular epistle. Based upon the claim of what He was, He spoke something. As He walks among the churches, He speaks to each one according to what the church is. His speaking is both practical and equipping. Revelation 2 and 3 are composed of seven epistles and are the Lord&rsquo;s last words written to His churches. These chapters reveal the speaking One&rsquo;s status and what He promises to the overcomers. We need to see all the main points of this person and His promises. In Revelation 2 and 3 the all-inclusive Christ as the Head of the church, walking in the midst of the churches and searching and infusing the churches, speaks to the churches in order to purify them and call forth the overcomers to enjoy Him so that they would overcome the deformed churches to bring in His kingdom.</p>
<p>Revelation 1 clearly depicts Christ as our High Priest, wearing the priestly garment, which signifies that He is ministering Himself and the divine life and nature into us. Chapters 2 and 3 cover His priestly service in His dealing with the seven churches; they reveal how He ministers the priestly service to us. This ministry of the priestly service is accomplished mainly by His speaking. Christ&rsquo;s heavenly priesthood is a speaking ministry; He is a speaking High Priest. As the High Priest, He speaks to God to intercede for us, and He speaks to us to minister the priestly service. He is carrying on His twofold speaking, a &ldquo;Godward&rdquo; speaking and an &ldquo;usward&rdquo; speaking. Besides His speaking Godward to intercede, He has a speaking which is usward. Christ&rsquo;s speaking to us surely follows His speaking to God the Father. In other words, first His intercession takes place; then by His speaking to us He continues to accomplish that for which He has interceded before the Father. What Christ intercedes for, He speaks to us. Then after He speaks to us, He again speaks to the Father. In Revelation 2 and 3 He has much to say to the seven churches; correspondingly, He has much to say to the Father for the carrying out of what He has spoken in the seven epistles. This speaking goes back and forth: first to the Father, then to us, then back to the Father again.</p>
<p>If our speaking is genuine and proper, it is also a part of the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. In our ministry of the word we should have a twofold speaking: while we speak to the saints, our inner being should be speaking to the heavenly One. Prior to our speaking, there is Christ&rsquo;s intercession before the throne for the ministry of the word. After our speaking, the intercession goes on again. All of this is part of the proper speaking.</p>
<p>The nature of Christ&rsquo;s priestly speaking to the churches, the lampstands, is trimming and infilling. In Revelation 2 and 3 Christ as the Priest was trimming away those things that were not needed and that frustrated the shining; simultaneously, He was supplying the oil, which was needed and which would make the lampstands burn brightly. As we have seen, the oil is actually the flow of the gold, which is the sevenfold Spirit as the divine element. The seven lampstands were receiving His trimming and His infilling.</p>
<p>Of all the things He trimmed away, the most striking is the synagogue of Satan (2:9). That the Lord spoke of Judaism in such a way indicates that by the time of the church age, Judaism had become satanic. A Jewish believer may still be for Judaism subconsciously. When he hears that it has become satanic, he may want to protest. Nonetheless, this is the word of our heavenly High Priest. In fact, He used the term a second time in 3:9. A synagogue is the symbol of Judaism, just as a building with a steeple is a symbol of Christianity. Judaism is utilized by Satan in rebellion against God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Today Judaism is in rebellion against God. It was neither Pilate nor Herod who sentenced the Son of God to death; rather, the high priest and the Jews called for His death (John 18:13-14; 19:14-15; Matt. 27:20). Judaism must take the responsibility for His crucifixion. This indicates that our old religious concepts are against God&rsquo;s economy and need to be trimmed away. These concepts are &ldquo;black&rdquo; and &ldquo;charred&rdquo;; they hinder the shining of the local churches as the lampstands. Thus, we need our High Priest to step in and trim them away.</p>
<p>Another thing that chars the wick is worldliness. Our heavenly High Priest cannot tolerate worldliness, which is seen in the case of the church in Pergamos, the church married to the world (Rev. 2:12-17). All our worldliness must be trimmed away. When the Lord came to the church in Thyatira, He condemned her for tolerating the woman Jezebel, whom the Lord described as one &ldquo;who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices&rdquo; (v. 20). This evil represents the apostate Roman Catholic Church, which is full of evil. All that Jezebel represents must be trimmed away.</p>
<p>In the last epistle, to the church in Laodicea, the Lord spoke of her lukewarmness: &ldquo;I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot. So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of My mouth&rdquo; (3:15-16). We ourselves may be lukewarm. We may come to the church meetings, yet we may be somewhat indifferent. We may be proud of being moderate or mild, thinking that it is good to be neither too zealous nor too apathetic. Many Christian meetings are in this category. Their church service is neither too hot nor too cold; it is just right for the indifferent audience who attends the service. Yet according to the Lord&rsquo;s word, we must be hot, and we need to burn others. Lukewarmness, along with religion, worldliness, and the evils of Jezebel, must be trimmed away.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s promise to the overcomers in the church in Ephesus, Pergamos, and Laodicea&mdash;eating of the tree of life, partaking of the hidden manna, and dining with Christ, respectively&mdash;refer to the refilling of the oil into the lampstands. By Christ&rsquo;s high priestly service, all the dark things of religion, worldliness, evil, and lukewarmness are trimmed away, and the heavenly, divine element of the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the heavenly feast is ministered to us. </p>
<p>The effect of this heavenly ministry is a metabolic transformation through which the old things will be discharged and replaced with something new, heavenly, and divine. We will be transformed into precious stones for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. We are transformed because our High Priest in the heavens is doing His priestly service, walking among us, speaking to us, and interceding for us. The heavenly High Priest has kept us in the church, and day and night He has been taking care of everything that concerns us. When we are under the proper ministry that is under the heavenly priesthood of Christ, such a ministry seeks to trim the churches and supply them with oil so that all the saints in the churches might be metabolically and organically transformed.</p>
<p>All of Christ&rsquo;s service and care have the aim of making us overcomers. Religion, worldliness, evil things, and lukewarmness are not part of the golden lampstand. But when we eat the tree of life, partake of the hidden manna, and enjoy the heavenly feast, this nourishment will become the divine element with which the lampstand is constituted. Consequently, every local church will be a lampstand, and in every local church there will be overcomers. These overcomers will constitute the lampstand. With them religion, worldliness, evil, and lukewarmness will have been trimmed away, and the heavenly element will have been supplied to them as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the heavenly feast. What they will have is the Triune God Himself, who will become their constituent. With such a golden constitution there will be the lampstand. A lampstand eventually is the overcomers in a local church.</p>
<p>According to 1:16, the words that proceed out of Christ&rsquo;s mouth are like a sharp two-edged sword. In the Gospel of John the words that proceeded out of His mouth may be considered words of love. Then in Acts and the Epistles the words that come out of the speaking Christ may be regarded as words of grace. But in the last book of the New Testament the words that come out of the mouth of Christ are portrayed as a sword to judge and destroy for dealing with negative persons and things.</p>
<p>According to the church in Pergamos, a fallen and worldly church, Christ, the speaking One, has a sharp two-edged sword (2:12) proceeding out of His mouth. Such a worldly church is qualified to receive the Lord&rsquo;s judgment in His sharp word. The sword out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth is to cut, to judge, to discern, to kill, and to slay. To the degraded and worldly church He is the One who has such a slaying and judging tongue. If we know Him as such a One, we cannot be worldly.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. His Walking in the Midst of the Lampstands</h2>
<p>Revelation 2:1 says that Christ &ldquo;walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ, the all-inclusive One, is now walking among the churches, the golden shining lampstands, to care for them. If we desire to touch Him, enjoy Him, and partake of Him, we need to be in the churches. We also need to see that Christ is speaking and walking in every church meeting.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s priestly service includes His walking in the midst of the churches, by which He gets to know the condition of each church. He could write the seven epistles to the seven churches because He visited all those churches. He traveled through Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. Such a tour made Him thoroughly familiar with the situation of every church. After seeing their situation, He spoke to the churches.</p>
<p> Today our High Priest in His heavenly ministry is walking among the churches to look into the condition of each one. Then according to what He sees, He speaks to us. This is the Lord&rsquo;s priestly service. His speaking is His serving, His ministering. Therefore, His speaking is not doctrinal but priestly.</p>
<p>For every local church to be an embodiment of the Triune God as the lampstand, Christ&rsquo;s heavenly priesthood is needed. His walking in the midst of the churches is His functioning as the heavenly High Priest. By ministering His priesthood to us, He purifies and transforms us, and we become white stones and are built into the temple as pillars. The outcome of our High Priest&rsquo;s ministering in the churches is that a number of overcomers are brought forth. In the local churches the Lord has the full ground and a full entrance to come in and purify His seeking ones, supply His lovers, and transform them into stones for His building and pillars for His temple.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>

<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Priest who trims the lampstands, the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. As the Tree of Life in the Paradise of God<br />
for the Overcomers to Enjoy</h2>
<p>In the epistle to the church in Ephesus, the Lord as the Spirit said, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God&rdquo; (Rev. 2:7). Christ is the tree of life in the Paradise of God for the overcomers to enjoy. While Christ is walking among the churches as the lampstands, He is feeding the believers. He is the life supply to all the overcomers. In the Lord&rsquo;s epistles to the seven churches, to overcome is to overcome the degraded situation of the churches. In the epistle to the church in Ephesus, to overcome is to recover our first love toward the Lord and to hate the works of the Nicolaitans, the hierarchy that the Lord hates.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) As the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>The tree of life is Christ with all the riches of life; to eat of the tree of life is to take in Christ as our life supply. We need to eat Him as the tree of life and take Him into us as our enjoyment. Nothing is as enjoyable as eating. We can forget every kind of entertainment, but we cannot give up eating. Christ is our enjoyment, our entertainment, our amusement, our joy, and our rejoicing. The Lord does not care how much we do for Him; instead, He cares for how much we eat Him and enjoy Him daily. We all need to enjoy Him. Every morning the first thing we should do is to eat the Lord Jesus and enjoy Him. Nothing pleases Him as much as our eating Him. The more we eat Him, the happier He is.</p>
<p>Religion always teaches, but the Lord feeds (John 6:35). The apostle Paul did the same thing; that is, he fed the believers (1 Cor. 3:2). For the proper church life and the recovery of the church life, that is, for the proper growth in the Christian life, what we need is not merely the mental apprehension of teachings but the eating of the Lord as our bread of life in our spirit (John 6:57). Even the words of the Scriptures should not be considered merely as doctrines to teach our mind but as food to nourish our spirit (Matt. 4:4; Heb. 5:12-14). In the epistle to the church in Ephesus, the Lord promised to give the overcomer to eat of the tree of life. This points back to Genesis 2, which concerns the matter of the eating ordained by God (vv. 8-9, 16). This indicates that the Lord desires to recover the eating of the proper food by God&rsquo;s people, the food ordained by God and typified by the tree of life. The degradation of the church distracts God&rsquo;s people from the eating of Christ as their food and turns them to the teaching of doctrines for knowledge. In the church&rsquo;s degradation there are the teaching of Balaam (Rev. 2:14), the teaching of the Nicolaitans (v. 15), the teaching by Jezebel (v. 20), and the teaching of the deep things of Satan (v. 24). Now in His epistles to the seven churches, the Lord came to recover the proper eating of Himself as our food supply. We must eat Him as the tree of life.</p>
<p>In Greek the word for <em>tree</em> in Revelation 2:7, as in 1 Peter 2:24, means &ldquo;wood&rdquo;; it is not the word usually used for <em>tree.</em> In the Bible the tree of life always signifies Christ as the embodiment of all the riches of God (Col. 2:9) for our food (Gen. 2:9; 3:22, 24; Rev. 22:2, 14, 19). Here it signifies the crucified (implied in the tree as a piece of wood&mdash;1 Pet. 2:24) and resurrected (implied in the life of God&mdash;John 11:25) Christ, who today is in the church, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the nourishment of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people for eternity (Rev. 22:2, 14).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) In the Paradise of God for the Overcomers to Enjoy</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s original intention was that man should eat of the tree of life (Gen. 2:9, 16). Because of the fall the way to the tree of life was closed to man (3:22-24). Through the redemption of Christ the way by which man could touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, was opened again (Heb. 10:19-20). But in the church&rsquo;s degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life. Hence, the Lord promised to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, as a reward. This is an incentive for them to leave religion with its knowledge and return to the enjoyment of Himself. This promise of the Lord restores the church to God&rsquo;s original intention according to His economy. What the Lord wants the overcomers to do is what the whole church should do in God&rsquo;s economy. Because of the church&rsquo;s degradation, the Lord came to call the overcomers to replace the church in the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The eating of the tree of life not only was God&rsquo;s original intention concerning man but also will be the eternal issue of God&rsquo;s redemption. All God&rsquo;s redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life, which is Christ with all the divine riches as the redeemed&rsquo;s eternal portion for eternity (Rev. 22:2, 14, 19). Because of religion&rsquo;s distraction and the church&rsquo;s degradation, the Lord in His wisdom made the enjoyment of Himself in the coming kingdom a reward in order to encourage His believers to overcome religion&rsquo;s distracting knowledge in teachings and return to the enjoyment of Himself as the life supply in the church life today for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life. The content of the church life depends on the enjoyment of Christ. The more we enjoy Him, the richer the content will be. But to enjoy Christ requires us to love Him with the first love. The first love will bring us to the tree of life. There is a kind of exchange: When we give our first love to the Lord Jesus, He will give us to eat of the tree of life. Our love is His enjoyment, and the tree of life is our enjoyment. To love Him with the first love, the best love, is to give the Lord the first place in all things. In order to give Him the preeminence, we must be willing to be adjusted, to be broken, and to be made nothing so that the Lord can have a way in us, through us, and among us for the building up of His organic Body. We should pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I love You first, and I love You best. My first love belongs to you. O Lord Jesus, I give the priority of my love to You.&rdquo; If we leave our first love toward the Lord, we will miss the enjoyment of Christ and lose the testimony of Jesus; consequently, the lampstand will be removed from us. These three things&mdash;loving the Lord, enjoying the Lord, and being the testimony of the Lord&mdash;go together.</p>
<p>When we overcome to return to Christ as our first love by giving Him the preeminence in every way and in everything, we will enjoy Him as life and will shine forth the divine light as the lampstand to keep the testimony of Jesus (1:9; 12:17) in our locality. We will testify of Christ&rsquo;s person as God and man as well as Christ&rsquo;s human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and second appearing. The shining of the light is a testimony. In every aspect of our daily life we should be shining forth Christ. This shining is the shining of the lampstand. We need love, life, light, and the lampstand. Then we will be rewarded by the Lord with what we live and are in Him.</p>
<p>The Paradise in Luke 23:43 is the pleasant and restful place where Abraham and all the dead saints are (16:23-26). But the Paradise of God in Revelation 2:7 is the New Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2, 10; 22:1-2, 14, 19), of which the church is a foretaste today. This Paradise will be much more pleasant than the garden of Eden. The Paradise of God is today&rsquo;s church and tomorrow&rsquo;s New Jerusalem. Today we are the church, and in the future the church will be the New Jerusalem. Today the church life is the precursor of this coming paradise; it is the miniature of the New Jerusalem in the coming kingdom. The church life is a small paradise. In this paradise we enjoy Christ as the tree of life. We are enjoying the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, the food supply in our spirit, as a foretaste today in the church. In today&rsquo;s human society, one does not have the taste of paradise; instead, one may have the taste of hell. But when we are in the church life, we are in paradise. The Paradise of God is located in the local churches. To be in the church life is to live a life in paradise. Eventually the consummation of the church life in the age to come and in eternity will be the New Jerusalem. This enjoyment of the foretaste will usher us into the full taste of the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life&mdash;our nourishment of life in the New Jerusalem for eternity, the eternal paradise with the tree of life in its center.</p>
<p>Today our paradise is the church life, which is a most pleasant place. Every local church is a paradise of God, where Christ is the tree of life for the overcomers to enjoy. Whoever enjoys the tree of life in the local church as the Paradise of God will be an overcomer. Yet if we do not give the preeminence to the Lord or enjoy the Lord as the tree of life, the church life may become an unpleasant place to us. Then the church is no longer at all a paradise to us. When we give the Lord the preeminence in everything and maintain our eating of Christ as the tree of life throughout the day, the church, no matter what its condition may be, becomes paradise to us. Thus, our feeling and attitude toward the church depend upon our situation. This is why the Lord indicates that we need to eat the tree of life in the Paradise of God.</p>
<p>In the Bible the principle is that our reward is always what we are. In other words, what we are will become our reward. There is a basic principle in the New Testament that what we will enjoy in the future we should enjoy in this age and that what we enjoy in this age will be our enjoyment in the future. This is the principle of the foretaste in the New Testament. The foretaste is a sign of the full taste to come. While we are enjoying the foretaste of the tree of life, we are looking for the full taste to come. To eat the fruit of the tree of life is to enjoy the blessing of eternal life, to enjoy eternal life itself. To have a foretaste of the fruit of the tree of life is to have an early enjoyment of the blessing of eternal life. Before the coming of the new heaven and the new earth, the Lord first gives the freshness of the blessing of eternal life, the fruit of the tree of life, as a reward to the overcomers as a foretaste and an early enjoyment in the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p>Strictly, &ldquo;to eat of the tree of life...in the Paradise of God&rdquo; in Revelation 2:7 refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers. The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Him as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom is a reward given only to the overcoming believers. If we overcome all the distractions in the church&rsquo;s degradation to enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the church today, we will be thus rewarded. Otherwise, we will miss this particular enjoyment in the coming kingdom, though we will still enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. If we enjoy the Lord in this age, we will be rewarded with the eating of the tree of life, Christ Himself, in the New Jerusalem as the Paradise of God in the thousand-year kingdom. Therefore, we need to continue in the enjoyment of the life supply of Christ in the present church life so that we can be rewarded with the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, the New Jerusalem, in the millennial kingdom. In the freshness of the New Jerusalem as the Paradise of God, we will fully participate in the enjoyment of the rich life supply of Christ as the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God. The Lord&rsquo;s promises concerning the reward and His predictions concerning the loss, at the end of each of the seven epistles, refer to His dealing with His believers in the coming millennial kingdom. They have nothing to do with the believers&rsquo; eternal destiny&mdash;their eternal salvation.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(7)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Priest who trims the lampstands, the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. As the Hidden Manna for the Overcomers to Enjoy</h2>
<p>In Revelation 2:17 we see that Christ as the Priest is the hidden manna for the overcomers to enjoy. &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna.&rdquo; Here to overcome is specifically to overcome the church&rsquo;s union with the world, the teaching of idolatry and fornication, and the teaching of hierarchy. The Lord promised the overcomers in Pergamos the hidden manna for their support and supply. In the local churches Christ is the hidden manna for the overcomers to eat and enjoy. Just as the tree of life is &ldquo;good for food&rdquo; (Gen. 2:9), the hidden manna is also good for food.</p>
<p>Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God&rsquo;s people to go His way. A portion of manna was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the Ark (Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4). The open manna was for the Lord&rsquo;s people to enjoy in a public way; the hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply. This promise is being fulfilled today in the proper church life and will be fulfilled in full in the coming kingdom. If we seek the Lord, overcome the degradation of the worldly church, and enjoy a special portion of the Lord today, He as the hidden manna will be a reward to us in the coming kingdom. If we miss Him as our special portion today in the church life, we will surely lose the enjoyment of Him as a reward in the coming kingdom.</p>
<p>The hidden manna mentioned in Revelation 2:17 was hidden in a golden pot in the Ark within the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:4). Gold signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature. Thus, placing the hidden manna in the golden pot signifies that the hidden Christ is concealed in the divine nature. The open manna is for all the people of God, but the hidden manna is for those who are intimate with the Lord, those who have forsaken the world and every separation between them and God. They come into the intimacy of God&rsquo;s presence, and here in this divine intimacy they enjoy the hidden manna in the divine nature. This is deep. It is not outward but absolutely inward. It is so inward that those who eat of the hidden manna are actually in the divine nature enjoying the hidden Christ. Today we must enjoy the hidden Christ in God&rsquo;s golden divine nature.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Hidden Manna Being God&rsquo;s Portion</h2>
<p>In Exodus 16 Jehovah commanded Moses to take a portion, one-tenth of an ephah, of the manna that He had given the children of Israel and to place it before His testimony (vv. 32-36). This portion of the manna was for God. The open manna was the people&rsquo;s portion, but this offered, hidden manna in the pot before God&rsquo;s testimony was God&rsquo;s portion. Manna signifies Christ, whom God has given to us as a gift. While we are enjoying Christ as our manna, we must take the best portion and offer it to God, offering Christ to God.</p>
<p>Once the manna had been presented to God, it was no longer the open manna; it had become the hidden manna because, after being presented to God, it was placed in a golden pot and hidden in the Ark in the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle. Originally, the manna was under the sky in the open air. It was open to anything and anyone. But after the top portion had been presented to God and placed in the pot, it was hidden within the innermost part of the tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, where it was placed before the Testimony of God. Among the children of Israel was the tabernacle, within the tabernacle was the Holy of Holies, within the Holy of Holies was the Ark, within the Ark was the golden pot, and within the pot was the manna. Hence, manna was altogether hidden. In this way the top portion of manna became hidden.</p>
<p>If we would eat the hidden manna, we must first eat the open manna. If we do not experience the open manna, we will have no manna to offer to God as the hidden manna. The hidden manna is the manna that we experience, enjoy, and then offer to God. We enjoy manna, and out of the manna we enjoy, we offer a small portion to God, saying, &ldquo;God, I offer to You the Christ whom I have been enjoying. You have given Christ to me as my portion, and now I give the best of Him to You as Your portion.&rdquo; God will then invite us to come into His Holy of Holies and enjoy this portion with Him. This is the hidden manna. Enjoying Christ as our hidden manna is not a sudden experience; it must have a history behind it.</p>
<p>Christ as the hidden manna is not the manna in the wilderness but the manna in the Holy of Holies. It is not the manna displayed but the manna hidden in a secret place. The hidden manna in the Holy of Holies corresponds to the bread of the Presence in the Holy Place. The difference between the two, however, is that the bread of the Presence was exhibited on the table, whereas the manna in the Ark was hidden in the golden pot (v. 33; Heb. 9:4). In the wilderness the people of Israel enjoyed the manna, but the manna they enjoyed was public manna&mdash;the manna that had fallen to the earth, not the manna hidden in the heavens. We need to experience Christ as the hidden manna, a Christ in the secret place, a Christ in the heavenlies. This is the Christ mentioned in Hebrews 7 as the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not according to the order of Aaron (cf. 5:6, 10; 6:20). Aaron ministered in the outer court, offering sacrifices on the altar; Melchizedek ministers on the throne of grace in the heavenlies (4:16; Rev. 4:2). We may experience Christ as our food, but this enjoyment may be only in the Holy Place; whatever we experience of Christ is immediately known by many people. This is but the experience of the open bread of the Presence. We need to press deeper to enter into &ldquo;the secret place of the Most High&rdquo; (Psa. 91:1) in order to touch the heavenly Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The way to overcome all kinds of degradation in the church life is to eat and enjoy Jesus as the hidden manna, the private manna, for the inner life and life supply. In Christ as the Ark, we can enjoy Him as the hidden manna, as a particular portion for our life supply, to overcome the worldliness of the degraded church. We should get away from all persons and distractions to have a personal time with the Lord, in which we can enjoy Him in a hidden way. We can enjoy Christ in a public way with all the saints, but we still need a time apart from everyone to enjoy Christ as the hidden manna. We need to be in a private place to contact Him, to praise Him, and to enjoy Him in the holy Word. Many believers may eat only an open, public Christ, but we all need a time to eat a private, hidden Christ. Our experience of Christ should not merely be open in the meetings but hidden in the Holy of Holies, even in Christ Himself as the Ark, the Testimony of God.</p>
<p>Today Christ as the Ark is in our spirit, which is joined to the Holy of Holies. In our spirit we have the Holy of Holies; in the Holy of Holies we have Christ, the Ark, and within Christ we have the golden pot, the divine nature. Today God&rsquo;s divine nature is in our spirit. Although we have the golden pot, the problem is that often we are far off from our spirit. We need not be quarreling or fighting with others in order to be out of the spirit. Even when we joke with the brothers, we are outside the spirit. Also, being religious is much different from being in the spirit. By being religious we are carried out to the wilderness. The golden pot is in the Ark, and the Ark is in the Holy of Holies, and the Holy of Holies is joined to our spirit. If we continually touch Christ in our spirit, we will enjoy Him as the hidden manna. The open manna was food for all the people who were outside the dwelling place of God and were wandering in the wilderness, whereas the hidden manna is for the person who is remaining in the innermost part of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, no longer wandering in the soul but abiding in the presence of God in the spirit.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Ministering to God Directly in His Presence</h2>
<p>If there is a distance between us and God, we may enjoy the open manna, but we cannot eat the hidden manna. If we would partake of the hidden manna, there must be no distance between us and God. In the Holy of Holies we enjoy something of Christ that all those who are far off from His presence cannot taste. Consider the service around the tabernacle in the Old Testament. The Levites served in the outer court, and the priests served in the outer court and also in the Holy Place, where they arranged the bread of the Presence, trimmed the lamp, and burned the incense. But when the high priest entered into the Holy of Holies, there was hardly any work to do. Here, in the Holy of Holies, the high priest ministered directly in the presence of God. Here, in the Holy of Holies, the ministering one enjoys the hidden manna. The hidden manna is that portion of Christ that we enjoy in the presence of God when there is no distance between us and Him.</p>
<p>The farther we are from God, the less service we have toward Him. The closer we are to Him, the more service we render to Him. Eventually, when we enter into the presence of the divine glory in the Holy of Holies, all service ceases. Here we have only the presence of the Lord and enjoy the hidden Christ, the hidden manna. It is here that we have direct fellowship with the Lord and know His heart and His intention. It is here that we can be charged with Him, with His intention, and with all He wants us to do. In this way we become a person who knows His heart and His intention. When we are such a person, His commitment will be ours. We have God&rsquo;s commitment because we are in His presence. We know that we are in the presence of God because we realize that there is no distance between us and God.</p>
<p>The hidden manna cannot be enjoyed by those who live outside of God; it is enjoyed only by those who live in the Holy of Holies before God&rsquo;s face. Those who stand on the Lord&rsquo;s side to maintain His testimony will be able to experience Christ as the hidden manna. They will have Christ as their life supply, but the flavor of that supply will be the hidden manna, which others do not know. Others will not be able to touch or taste the Christ that these overcomers experience and enjoy. If we seek fame or position, we will have no share in the enjoyment of the overcomers; we will not taste, touch, or experience the hidden manna. If we desire worldly fame and are married to the world, we cannot enjoy the hidden Christ before God.</p>
<p>When we become intimate with Christ, on some occasions we are so close to God that while touching the divine nature and partaking of it we are beyond the world, every situation, our self, and even our natural being. Everyone who enters into the Holy of Holies is with the High Priest. Christ, our High Priest, is in the Holy of Holies, and we also must be there. We must also be the priests in the Holy of Holies where the golden pot is. If we would be in this place, we must be beyond the world and every kind of situation. We must be beyond being bothered by people. When we are beyond all situations, good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant, we are in our spirit touching the Ark and the golden pot. If we would partake of the hidden manna, we must constantly be in our spirit touching the divine nature.</p>
<p>To eat the hidden manna is something absolutely outside of the world. While the worldly church is going down into union with the world, we are coming up from Egypt to the wilderness, from the wilderness to the good land, from the good land to the tabernacle, from the outer court to the Holy Place, and from the Holy Place to the Holy of Holies. After we have entered into the Holy of Holies, we must still dive into the Ark, touch the golden pot, and enjoy Christ as the manna hidden there. The more worldly the church becomes, the more we need to enter into the Holy of Holies to eat the hidden manna. If we would enjoy it, we must abide in the deep intimacy of God&rsquo;s presence. We must be in His divine nature where there is nothing worldly or distracting and where there is the intimate fellowship between us and God. Some of us who have had this experience of the hidden Christ have said, &ldquo;Lord, I do not care for the world. I care only for You, Lord, not for any human relationship or friendship. Lord, I am willing to drop every tie. Lord, now I am thoroughly free, and I love You from the depths of my being. I love You without anything frustrating me.&rdquo; When we say this to the Lord, we are in the golden pot, in the intimacy of the divine nature, partaking of the hidden Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) A Memorial before God</h2>
<p>The manna preserved in the golden pot was the center of the tabernacle, God&rsquo;s dwelling place in the Old Testament. Likewise, the Christ whom we have eaten, digested, and assimilated is the center of our being as a part of the church, God&rsquo;s dwelling place today (2 Tim. 4:22; Eph. 2:22). The Christ whom we eat as open manna spontaneously becomes hidden manna by being digested and assimilated into our inner being. The focal point of God&rsquo;s building today is the Christ eaten, digested, and assimilated by His people.</p>
<p>The open manna, the manna that lay on the ground every morning, was for the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s people in a public way. However, the omer of manna placed in a pot (Exo. 16:33) was hidden and was not for the congregation in a public way. The amount of manna kept in a pot before Jehovah was one omer, the same as the amount gathered and eaten by the people (vv. 16-18). In spiritual experience, this indicates that the amount of Christ we eat is the amount we can preserve. As we partake of Christ day by day, we are also preserving Him. The amount of Christ we preserve depends on the amount of Christ we eat. The more we eat Christ, the more we preserve Him.</p>
<p>The fact that the Christ we eat is the Christ we preserve indicates that whatever we eat of Christ will become a memorial in generations to come. The Christ whom we eat and enjoy will be an eternal memorial, because such a Christ becomes our constitution, enabling us to build up and even to become God&rsquo;s dwelling place in the universe. Nothing of what we are, what we have, or what we can do is worthy of remembrance. Only the Christ who has become our constitution is worthy to be an eternal memorial. Everything else may change, but our experience of Christ will remain for eternity.</p>
<p>When some Christians are in eternity, they may not have very much of Christ to remember. Because they are not eating much of Christ today, they will not have much of Him to recall in eternity. However, if we are right with the Lord day by day and eat Him consistently, we will have much to say about Him in eternity. We will recall the wonderful times we had in the church life eating Christ and enjoying Him. Whatever we enjoy of Christ in the church today will become an eternal memorial. This memorial will be preserved in the presence of God, even in His being. This hidden manna is a memorial of Christ as the supply to God&rsquo;s people for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p><h2 class="head5">(4) The Issue of Enjoying the Hidden Manna</h2>
<p>Exodus 16:36 says, &ldquo;Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.&rdquo; If we read Numbers 18:26-30, we will see that the tenth part denotes a special portion that was reserved for the priesthood. This indicates that the hidden manna was not for the congregation in general but for the serving priests in particular. If as children of God we do not eat manna, we will have only open manna, not hidden manna. Without the hidden manna we will not be able to function as priests. On the contrary, we will simply be among the general public, part of the congregation. But if we eat, digest, and assimilate the manna, we will have hidden manna. Spontaneously the manna we eat causes a transformation that transfers us from the general congregation to the priesthood. The more we eat of Christ, the more function we will exercise. In this way we will become a functioning priest, a priest in reality and practicality. Every proper priest is an overcomer. If we eat the open manna, Christ will become the hidden manna. This hidden manna will constitute us into an overcomer.</p>
<p>The contents of the Ark&mdash;the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the tablets of the covenant&mdash;are arranged in a particular sequence. First, we must enjoy the hidden manna. Then out of our enjoyment of the hidden manna our rod will bud. When we enjoy the hidden Christ in such a deep way, there will be the budding, the blossoming, which refers to the spread of the resurrection life and to glorification. As a result, we will have the law of life, signified by the tablets of the covenant. The inward law of life, the inward working of the Spirit of the Triune God, is operating within us, infusing the element of God into our being and making us a corporate reproduction of Christ as the standard model. In this way God can have the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</p>
<p>When we enjoy the hidden manna, we will partake of the budding rod, which signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry. If we enjoy the hidden manna, we will bud, for the issue of enjoying the hidden manna is the budding rod. How much we will bud with life depends on how much we eat of the hidden manna. If we bud, blossom, and yield almonds, others will know that we are the authority. When we enjoy Christ as our life supply in such a hidden and mysterious way, we will experience the rod budding with authority in resurrection life. If we are to be a true minister of the word or a genuine elder in the church, we need to have this kind of authority in the resurrection life of Christ.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 16:34, we read that Aaron placed the pot with an omer of manna &ldquo;before the Testimony to be kept.&rdquo; Since the golden pot with the manna was in the Ark (Heb. 9:4), the Testimony here must refer not to the Ark but to the tablets of the law that were in the Ark (Exo. 34:1, 29; 25:21; 40:20). The law is a testimony of what God is. Hence, the fact that the manna in the golden pot was placed before the Testimony indicates that manna corresponds to God&rsquo;s testimony, God&rsquo;s law, and meets its requirements. When we take Christ as our heavenly life supply, Christ as the hidden manna preserved in the divine nature within us causes us to correspond to God&rsquo;s testimony and to fulfill its requirements, thereby making us God&rsquo;s expression. In the words of Romans 8:4, the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk according to spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(5) For Our Supply</h2>
<p>If we suffer persecution from others yet remain with and in the Lord, He will be the hidden manna to us. A particular portion of Christ, a special portion, will be our hidden manna. This special portion will become our support and our strength. We can endure suffering and live in a situation in which no one else can live, because we daily enjoy the Lord Jesus as a special portion, the hidden manna.</p>
<p>In Old Testament typology, the hidden manna was in the Holy of Holies. In the New Testament reality, the Holy of Holies may refer to the church. In the church life Christ is our hidden manna. Because Christ is hidden, those outside the church do not know where we obtain our energy to attend many church meetings week by week. Our supply comes from the hidden Christ, whom we eat as our food. When we come into the church, we enjoy something hidden, Christ as our hidden manna, for our supply.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(6) For the Building of God&rsquo;s Dwelling Place</h2>
<p>In ancient times the eating of manna was related to the building of the tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Today the eating of Christ as the hidden manna is also related to the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. In Revelation 2:17, the Lord promised the overcomers in Pergamos, saying, &ldquo;To him I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knows except him who receives it.&rdquo; Enjoying Christ as the hidden manna produces transformation. In the Bible a stone signifies material for God&rsquo;s building (Matt. 16:18; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Cor. 3:12). In our natural being we are not stones but clay. Because we received the divine life with its divine nature through regeneration, we can be transformed into stones, even precious stones, by enjoying Christ as our life supply (2 Cor. 3:18). If we do not follow the worldly church but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life, we will be transformed into stones for the building of God. These stones will be justified and approved by the Lord, as indicated by the color white, while the worldly church will be condemned and rejected by Him. God&rsquo;s work of building the church depends on our transformation, and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply.</p>
<p>The white stone is for God&rsquo;s building. We cannot be built up together in the church life because of our peculiarities, our particular, peculiar traits. Therefore, we need to be transformed so that we will be delivered from our peculiar traits and be no longer natural. Yet when we are transformed, we can be properly and adequately built up with others. God&rsquo;s building, the building of the church, depends upon our transformation, and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply.</p>
<p>In Revelation 2:17 the Lord also said that &ldquo;upon the stone&rdquo; would be &ldquo;a new name written, which no one knows except him who receives it.&rdquo; A name designates a person, and the new name here is the designation of a transformed person. Every transformed believer as a white stone bears &ldquo;a new name...which no one knows except him who receives it.&rdquo; Such a new name is the interpretation of the experience of the one being transformed. Hence, only he himself knows the meaning of that name. As we eat the Lord Jesus as the hidden manna, we will have certain experiences and the Lord will write a new name upon us. This new name is simply the new designation of what we are. Since this new name is based upon what we are according to our experiences, others cannot know what it is. This is truly the greatest blessing. This involves our being, for it is related to what we are. The greatest blessing is not what the Lord gives us but what the Lord makes us.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s promise of the hidden manna to the overcomer in the church in Pergamos corresponds to the parables in Matthew 13. The Greek word translated &ldquo;Pergamos&rdquo; means &ldquo;a fortified tower,&rdquo; which is like the great tree in Matthew 13:31-32, in which everything was exposed for outward show. In principle, however, the precious things are hidden (v. 44). In this age Christ is the hidden manna. Therefore, we must be the hidden church. We must learn to be hidden and not exposed. We should not advertise ourselves in a worldly way. To do so is to be married to the world and to commit spiritual fornication. It is not only to have idol worship but also to become an idol. Since this is the age for Christ to be hidden, we as His Body must also be hidden. Then we will enjoy Him as the hidden manna.</p>
<p>The more we are hidden, the more we will experience Christ as the hidden One and experience the white stone (Rev. 2:17). <em>White</em> in Revelation signifies being justified, approved, and accepted by the Lord (3:4-5, 18). We should not try to be accepted or admired by people. We must not be afraid to be criticized and persecuted. Rather, we should try to be justified and accepted by the hidden Lord. When we become the hidden ones, we sense the Lord&rsquo;s hidden approval. Upon the white stone is a name that the Lord gives. This name is known only by us and the Lord; no one else knows it because it is a secret. We need to have hidden experiences of Christ. Then there will be something secret between us and Him.</p><h2 class="head5">(7) Eating the Hidden Manna<br />
to Be Incorporated into the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>The purposeful God has an economy, and in His economy He intends to have a universal incorporation. The word <em>incorporation</em> refers to persons indwelling one another, coinhering. God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation by coinhering mutually and by working together as one; the three of the Trinity are an incorporation by what They are and by what They do (John 14:10-11). The Triune God in eternity past held a council (Acts 2:23) to make a decision that the second among Them had to become a man and pass through the processes of human living, death, and resurrection so that all the redeemed and regenerated believers of God would be incorporated into God&rsquo;s incorporation to be an enlarged, divine-human incorporation. The processed and consummated Triune God and the redeemed and regenerated believers became an enlarged, universal, divine-human incorporation in the resurrection of Christ (John 14:20), consummating the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:2-3). The tabernacle in the Old Testament is a sign of the universal incorporation, and to eat the hidden manna is to be incorporated into the tabernacle.</p>
<p>Christ as the hidden manna is the center of the tabernacle. The hidden manna is in the golden pot; the golden pot is in the Ark, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold; and this Ark is in the Holy of Holies. The hidden manna, which signifies Christ, is in the golden pot, which refers to God. The manna in the golden pot indicates that Christ is in the Father. The Ark is in the Holy of Holies, and the Holy of Holies is our spirit. Today our spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit is the Holy of Holies. From this we can see that Christ as the hidden manna is in God the Father as the golden pot; that the Father is in Christ as the Ark with His two natures, divinity and humanity; and that this Christ as the indwelling Spirit lives in our regenerated spirit to be the reality of the Holy of Holies. This means that the Son is in the Father, that the Father is in the Son, and that the Son as the Spirit is the reality of the Holy of Holies. This implies and corresponds to the four <em>in</em> s in John 14:16-20. Verse 20 says, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you,&rdquo; and verse 17 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...shall be in you.&rdquo; The Son is in the Father, we are in the Son, the Son is in us, and we are indwelt by the Spirit of reality. This is the incorporation of the processed God with the regenerated believers.</p>
<p>The way to be incorporated into the tabernacle is to eat the hidden manna. The more we eat Christ, the more we are incorporated into the Triune God as a universal incorporation. By eating the hidden manna, we are incorporated into the tabernacle. The tabernacle in the Old Testament was a figure of the New Jerusalem, which is called the tabernacle of God. As the tabernacle of God, the New Jerusalem is the universal incorporation. This universal incorporation is God&rsquo;s eternal goal. The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God, and the center of this tabernacle is Christ as the hidden manna for us to eat. The way to be in the New Jerusalem is to eat Christ. The more we eat Christ, the more we are incorporated into this universal incorporation.</p>
<p>The world will perish in the lake of fire. We need to ask whether we are a part of the world or a part of the New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s tabernacle, the universal incorporation. The Lord promises the overcomers in the church in Pergamos that if they eat Him, they will be incorporated into the universal incorporation, the consummated New Jerusalem. We should not be joined to the world; we should be incorporated into the New Jerusalem by eating Christ as the hidden manna. The way to be incorporated into this unique incorporation is to enjoy Christ, to eat Him, and to partake of Him. When we eat Him, we live by Him in this incorporation, which today is the corporate Body of Christ and which consummates the New Jerusalem.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>Revelation 2:26-27 says, &ldquo;He who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ is the One who has received authority over the nations from the Father and that the overcomers will share in that authority. In the millennial kingdom the ruler is a shepherd. In Psalm 2:9 God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations. Here Christ gives the same authority to His overcomers.</p>
<p>To reign with Christ over the nations in the millennial kingdom is a prize to the overcomers (Rev. 20:4, 6). This promise of the Lord strongly implies that those who do not answer His call to overcome degraded Christianity will not participate in the reign of the millennial kingdom. We need to first reign as kings today. In order to reign in life today, we must receive the Lord&rsquo;s abounding grace (Rom. 5:17). If we do not reign as kings today in Christ&rsquo;s life, we cannot be kings in the coming age to rule over the nations.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus returns, He will assign the overcomers to rule over all the nations. In that day there will be no more nonsensical talk. Everyone will talk rightly because they will be under the proper ruling. The whole earth is waiting and groaning to be released from the improper rulers. The earth will be released from that kind of rule when the Lord Jesus comes back. The nations on earth surely need to be ruled by the overcomers.</p>
<p>Our work, our exercise, and our use of the talent given to us by God determine whether or not we will share in the Lord&rsquo;s kingship. The word <em>talent</em> in Matthew 25 is the equivalent of the word <em>gift</em> in the Epistles. Paul tells Timothy to &ldquo;fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:6). In life we need to grow, and in work we need to exercise our gift. The parable of the ten virgins reveals our need of transformation by the life-giving Spirit, and the parable of the talents reveals our need to have the proper exercise of the spiritual gifts. We need to be transformed by the extra portion of oil (the Spirit) in our vessel (our soul), and we need to exercise our gift to gain some profit for the Lord. We need to grow on the one hand and make profit in God&rsquo;s economy on the other. Our growth will determine the time of our maturity, and the exercise of our gifts will determine the position we will share with Christ in the millennial kingdom. If we do not mature and exercise our gifts, we will miss the enjoyment of reigning with Christ in the coming kingdom.</p>
<p>In the parable of the talents the Lord said to the servant with the five talents, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (Matt. 25:21). This is to be a co-king with the Lord Jesus and to enjoy the real rest, the Sabbath during the millennial kingdom. In Luke 19:17 the Lord said, &ldquo;Well done, good slave. Because you have become faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities.&rdquo; In the millennial kingdom, some will rule over ten cities and others over five cities (v. 19). We may be not merely a mayor of one city but a governor of ten cities.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. As the Morning Star to Be Given to the Overcomers</h2>
<p>Revelation 2:28 tells us that Christ will give the morning star to the overcomers. The New Testament reveals that Christ, who is signified by the heavenly luminaries, the lights, is the bright morning star (22:16). Concerning the types of Christ, the entire Bible begins with Him as the light (Gen. 1:3) and ends with Him as the morning star, a luminary. The morning star appears in the darkest hour, after midnight and prior to the dawn. This indicates that Christ will appear as the bright morning star in the darkest time, prior to the close of this age.</p>
<p>His appearing as the morning star (Rev. 2:28) and His appearing as the Sun of righteousness (Mal. 4:2) will not be at the same time. The former occurs before dawn, and the latter occurs after the dawning of the day. As the Sun of righteousness after the dawning of the day, He will appear publicly to all the people on the earth. As the bright morning star before the dawning of the day, He will appear privately to the overcomers who are watching, preparing, and waiting for Him. While people are sleeping soundly in the night, He will secretly give Himself as the morning star to those who love Him and who watch and wait for Him (Rev. 2:28), that they may have the priority to taste the freshness of His presence at His coming back after a long absence. This will encourage them to earnestly seek the Lord&rsquo;s presence and be watchful so that they will be able to stand before Him in the secret part of His coming, when He will come as a thief (Luke 21:36; Matt. 24:43). Christ as the morning star will be given to the overcomers as their first reward, the earliest prize (Rev. 2:26-29). We must make ourselves ready for the secret appearing of the Lord as the morning star.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Star out of Jacob&rdquo; (Num. 24:17) and the star appearing at the Lord&rsquo;s birth (Matt. 2:7, 9-10) consummate in the morning star in Revelation 2:28. No star is as bright as the morning star. At the darkest time, within the overcomers there is a star shining. The overcomers will have and enjoy the particular light, Christ as the morning star.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the New Testament the star was outside of religion (Matt. 2:1-6), but at the end of the New Testament the star is within the church. If we would see the star today, there is no need for us to look to the sky, as the Gentile magi did. Today the star is in the church and among the churches. Jesus Christ, who is the morning star, is walking today among the local churches. To see the star, we must come to the local churches. If we are for religion, we will not be able to see Christ as the star. But if we are in the genuine local church, we will see the star. When we are in religion, we have the sense of being in darkness, but when the Lord brings us into the churches, we see the bright star. The heavenly star today is in the local churches.</p>
<p>According to 2 Peter 1:19, the morning star is associated with the Bible. Peter tells us to take heed to the prophetic word. If we take heed to the word of prophecy, the day will dawn within us, and the morning star will arise in our hearts. To take heed to the prophetic word is to pay attention to the living Word. It is not simply to read the Word; it is to enter into the Word until something arises within us. We may call this the dawn, or the morning star. In 2 Peter 1:19 the term &ldquo;morning star&rdquo; in Greek is <em>phosphorus,</em> a light-bearing substance. A piece of phosphorus can shine in darkness. Christ is the real phosphorus shining in today&rsquo;s darkness. However, the Word cannot shine over us unless we take heed to it. We must take heed until something begins to shine within us. That shining will become the divine &ldquo;phosphorus&rdquo; in our heart. Then we will have the morning star. We will be like the wise men, and something from the heavens will shine over us. We must come to the sure Word and open up our whole being to the Word&mdash;our mouth, our eyes, our mind, our spirit, and our heart&mdash;until Christ as the morning star rises up in us and shines over us.</p><h2 class="head4">g. As the One Who Has the Seven Spirits of God<br />
and the Seven Stars</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 3:1, Christ is the One &ldquo;who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars.&rdquo; This verse implies that the seven Spirits are for the seven stars. The seven Spirits of God correspond to the seven stars. A star is a messenger of a church, a leading one in a local church. Such a messenger should be one with the seven Spirits of God.</p>
<p>The seven Spirits of God enable the church to be intensely living, and the seven stars enable her to be intensely shining. To the church in Sardis, the Lord was the One who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. The church, which the Lord considered dead, needed the living Spirits and shining stars, that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God and the shining leaders. The sevenfold intensified Spirit is living and can never be replaced by the dead letters of knowledge (2 Cor. 3:6).</p>
<p>The One who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars spoke to the church in Sardis (Rev. 3:1). The stars are the messengers; this means that the messengers should shine as the stars. In order to shine, they must be full of the intensified Spirit, the seven Spirits. Christ has the seven stars, and He has the seven Spirits as the supply to the stars so that the stars can shine. The seven Spirits are one with the seven stars, and the seven stars are one with the seven Spirits. If we have the living word as the morning star rising within us and if we are one with the seven Spirits, eventually we will become the stars. We not only have the star shining within us but also become the stars by looking to Christ as the star and by following in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Daniel 12:3 says, &ldquo;Those who have insight will shine like the shining of the heavenly expanse, and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars, forever and ever.&rdquo; The stars are those who shine in darkness and turn people from the wrong way to the right way. The present church age is the time of night; hence, we need the shining of the stars, the believers who shine. It is by the shining that in today&rsquo;s darkness people receive the guidance and are turned from the wrong way to the right way. Anything that is wrong is unrighteousness; anything that is right is righteousness. Those who turn many to righteousness are the stars that shine forever and ever.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the New Testament there was only one star in the heavens that led the magi to the place where Christ was. But at the end of the New Testament there are seven stars in seven local churches. Furthermore, immediately after Revelation 22:16, which says that the Lord Jesus is the morning star, the following verse says, &ldquo;The Spirit and the bride say.&rdquo; This implies that, as the morning star, the Lord Jesus is linked to the Spirit and to the church, which is the bride. Revelation 3:1 says that the Lord Jesus has the seven Spirits and the seven stars, and Revelation 1:20 says that the seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches. These verses show that the stars are linked not only to the Spirit but also to the churches. If we would have the living star or the living stars, we need the Spirit and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. As the One Who Will Come as a Thief</h2>
<p> Revelation 3:3 says, &ldquo;If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you.&rdquo; This verse indicates that Christ is the One who will come as a thief to steal away His treasures, His precious seekers. A thief comes to steal precious things at an unknown time. Since many believers are spiritually dead, they will be unaware of the Lord&rsquo;s coming as a thief in His secret appearing to His seekers. Hence, there is the need of watchfulness.</p>
<p>The revelation in the New Testament regarding the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is not according to our natural understanding. According to our natural thought, the Lord will suddenly descend from the throne in the heavens to the earth. According to the pure Word of God, however, the Lord&rsquo;s coming back is a process. His coming back will begin from the throne and will pass through a process until He descends to fight the battle at Armageddon. The Lord will descend from the throne to the air where He will accomplish many things: the rapture of the majority of the saints, the judgment at the judgment seat, and the wedding of the Lamb. After all this has been accomplished in the air, the Lord will descend to the earth. The rapture of the early overcomers, including the man-child (ch. 12) and the firstfruits (ch. 14), will occur at the start of the process of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. In other words, when they are raptured, the process of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back begins.</p>
<p>Christ will come back secretly as a thief (3:3b; 16:15). No thief tells you in advance the time of his arrival. In His secret coming as a thief, Christ will come to steal the precious things. No thief steals things that are without value. Thieves come to steal only what is valuable. We need to be a treasure in the eyes of the Lord. We need to be precious by being mature so that He will come and take us secretly. Only those who are matured in life and transformed in their soul will be precious enough for the Lord to steal. As long as we are untransformed, we can be assured that the Thief will never come to visit us. The time of His secret coming is unknown. We all must ask ourselves if we are precious and if we are worthy of being stolen by Christ in His secret coming.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some of the believers who are the early overcomers will be taken away by the Lord coming as a thief (Matt. 24:43). No one knows the time of the beginning of the process of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back and of the rapture of the early overcomers. When it comes, there will be no time for us to prepare ourselves. We must be thoroughly prepared before that time. Therefore, we must be ready and watchful.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24:40 and 41, the Lord spoke of His secret coming, saying, &ldquo;At that time two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus was very wise, using two brothers in the field and two sisters grinding at the mill as illustrations. Apparently the two brothers are the same and the two sisters are the same. But suddenly one of the brothers and one of the sisters are taken. After giving this illustration, the Lord said, &ldquo;Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes. But know this, that if the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming&rdquo; (vv. 42-44). As we are working, having no consciousness that Christ is coming, some of us will be raptured. Since He is coming as a thief, we must be watchful.</p><h2 class="head4">I. As White Garments to Clothe the Overcomers</h2>
<p>In Revelation 3:5 the Lord said to the church in Sardis that &ldquo;he who overcomes&rdquo; will be clothed &ldquo;in white garments.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ is the white garments to clothe the overcomers. To overcome here is to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism. To walk in white garments is to have a living that is unspotted by death and that is justified and approved in life by the Lord. The promise of being clothed in white garments is a prize to the overcomers in the millennial kingdom. What they have been walking in during this age will be a prize to them in the coming age.</p>
<p>White garments refer to livingness. To be living is to wear the white garment. If we are spiritually dead, we are dirty; such a dead person is the dirtiest one. Also, if we are dead, we are naked. We need the living garment to cover us; this living garment is Christ Himself wrought into us by the living Spirit. The only way to have this garment is to turn to the spirit.</p>
<p>Every Christian needs two garments. The first is the garment of salvation, signifying Christ as our righteousness objectively. In Luke 15, when the prodigal son returned home, the first thing the father did was to have the best robe placed upon him. Wearing that robe, the prodigal son was justified in the presence of the father. He had been a pitiful beggar, no longer worthy to be with the father. But once he had the robe upon him, he was justified and approved. This means that he was justified in Christ and that Christ became his justifying covering. He was covered by Christ as his righteousness. Thus, the garment of justification is for salvation.</p>
<p>However, besides this garment of justification, we need another garment to make us approved and well pleasing to the Lord. The &ldquo;fine linen, bright and clean&rdquo; in Revelation 19:8 denotes this second garment. According to typology, the queen in Psalm 45 has two garments: one for salvation and the other for her to be with the king in His reign (vv. 8, 13-14). We must run the race and reach the goal. As we are running the race, there are many things that would frustrate us from reaching the goal. But after we have been saved, we need to mature and overcome all frustrations and distractions. Yes, we have been saved and justified and have the first robe for our salvation. But we must go on to maturity and reach our destination (Heb. 6:1). If we do so, then we will receive a reward. This is not a matter of Christ as our objective righteousness but of experiencing Christ as our subjective righteousness. Christ as our objective righteousness has been put upon us, whereas Christ as our subjective righteousness comes out of us. We must live out Christ as our second garment. This garment is for the reward. The white garments mentioned in Revelation 3:5 refer to this second garment. When we have this second garment, we are well pleasing to the Lord and will receive the reward.</p>
<p>In Luke 15 the best robe is for our justification, our salvation. In Revelation 19 the fine linen is the wedding garment of the bride. In Revelation 3 the white garments are the clothing of the overcomers for them to express Christ. Therefore, Christ is our garment for our justification, for our marriage to Christ, and for our covering to enable us to express Christ, not ourselves.</p>
<p>In verse 4 the Lord said, &ldquo;You have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy.&rdquo; The defiled garments indicate the presence of death or the absence of life. To be an overcomer in that kind of situation is to keep oneself from death. This means that we need to be living and strong, and we must have an impact. Even when we stand up to share a testimony, we should not speak in a dead way. Rather, we need to speak with our spirit strengthened and released. We should overcome the dead situation in religion, conquer all kinds of death, and wear a white garment, with no stain of death.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head4">j. As the Holy One, the True One,<br />
Who Has the Key of David,<br />
Who Opens and No One Will Shut,<br />
and Shuts and No One Opens</h2>
<p>Revelation 3:7 presents Christ as &ldquo;the Holy One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens.&rdquo; To the church in Philadelphia, the church of brotherly love, the Lord is &ldquo;the Holy One, the true One&rdquo; by whom and with whom the church can be holy, separated from the world, and true, faithful, to God. In order to dispense life to others, He must be holy and He must be true. If we are not holy or true, we can never dispense life to others. When we enter into the Bible and see all the items of Christ&rsquo;s being, we can see that they are for the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>To the church in Philadelphia, the Lord is also the One who has &ldquo;the key of David&rdquo; (v. 7), the key of the kingdom, with authority to open and to shut. Here we need to consider the meaning of the term <em>the key of David.</em> According to Genesis 1, when God created man, He gave him dominion over all creatures. This indicates that in God&rsquo;s intention man is to be the power representing God on earth. Due to the fall, however, man lost this power and has never fully recovered it. Man has not regained dominion on earth to represent God. In the lives of Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, and Noah we do not see this power. Neither do we see it in the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We do not see this power until God&rsquo;s chosen people, the children of Israel, entered into the good land and built the temple. Apparently, the temple was built by Solomon; actually, it was built by David, for he was behind the building of the temple. In Genesis 1:26 God made man in His own image that he might express Him and with His dominion that he might represent Him. The temple is related to God&rsquo;s image because, being God&rsquo;s house, it is His expression. The temple was built in the city. The temple signifies God&rsquo;s expression, and the city signifies God&rsquo;s dominion. The image and dominion revealed in Genesis 1 are, at least to some extent, fulfilled in the temple and the city. In the temple we have God&rsquo;s presence for His expression, and in the city we have God&rsquo;s dominion. God&rsquo;s king is in the city representing Him as he rules on earth.</p>
<p>This is a necessary background for understanding what the key of David is. The key held by David is the key of God&rsquo;s entire dominion. God&rsquo;s dominion includes the whole universe, particularly mankind. This dominion has a key which is possessed by the person who fought the battle for the kingdom and who made preparations for the temple. The name of this person is David. David represents God in establishing God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth. Hence, he has the key of God&rsquo;s dominion in the universe. David, however, is just a type, not the reality. The real David is Christ, the greater David (Matt. 12:1-8). He is the One who built God&rsquo;s temple, the church, and established God&rsquo;s kingdom (16:18-19). Therefore, in the church today, which is both a house and a kingdom, we have God&rsquo;s expression and representation. As the greater David, Christ has built up the house of God, the real temple, and He has set up the kingdom of God, the dominion in which He exercises full authority to represent God. Thus, He holds the key of David, that which represents God and opens the whole universe for God. It signifies that Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s economy. He is the One who expresses and represents God, holding the key to open everything in God&rsquo;s dominion.</p>
<p>Revelation 3:7 also says that Christ is the One who &ldquo;opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens.&rdquo; He opens and shuts because the universal key, the key of God&rsquo;s economy, is in His hand. The Lord uses this key to deal with the church.</p>
<p>Isaiah 22:22-24 is a prophecy concerning Christ as the One who holds the key of David. The crucial subject in Isaiah 22 is the house of God. In this chapter it is prophesied that Christ would be not only the One holding the key of David but also a peg. If we consider the context of Isaiah 22 and read the context of the word regarding Christ as the One holding the key of David in Revelation 3, we will realize that Christ&rsquo;s holding the key of David is for God&rsquo;s house, God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>The epistle to the church in Philadelphia goes on to speak of the New Jerusalem (v. 12). The overcomers in Philadelphia will be pillars in the temple of God, and the temple of God will ultimately be enlarged into the New Jerusalem. According to Revelation 21:22, there is no temple in the New Jerusalem, for in eternity the temple will be enlarged into a city, which, having three equal dimensions (v. 16), will be the enlargement of the Holy of Holies. This is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s house. Christ&rsquo;s holding the key of David, fighting the battle for God, building the temple, and establishing the kingdom of God are all for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Christ, holding the key of David, opens and shuts, not that we might be holy or spiritual but that we might be built up. Both holiness and spirituality are to enable us to be pillars in the temple of God. Eventually, we will bear the name of the New Jerusalem. In 3:12 the Lord said, &ldquo;I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s purpose is to make us part of the New Jerusalem. God desires a builded church. He wants today&rsquo;s Bethel, the house of God, that will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Isaiah 22:22-24 records Jehovah&rsquo;s words regarding Eliakim, who typifies Christ: &ldquo;I will set the key of the house of David upon his shoulder&mdash; / When he opens, no one will shut; / When he shuts, no one will open. / And I will drive him as a peg into a sure place, / And he will become a throne of glory for his father&rsquo;s house. / And they will hang upon him all the glory of his father&rsquo;s house, / the offspring and the issue, all the smallest vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.&rdquo; The all-inclusive Christ, as typified by Eliakim, is the One upon whose shoulder the key of (the treasury of&mdash;39:2) the house of God (typified by the house of David for the building up of the kingdom of God&mdash;2 Sam. 7:16) is set (Rev. 3:7). The church is both God&rsquo;s house (1 Tim. 3:15) and God&rsquo;s kingdom (Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17). The key set on Christ&rsquo;s shoulder is the key for the keeping of all the treasures of the house of God, which are all the riches of Christ for our enjoyment. Christ is the One who can open and shut the door to the treasury of God&rsquo;s riches, which are embodied in Him (Col. 2:9). Christ has been driven by God as a peg, or nail, into a sure place (Isa. 22:23a), which typifies the third heaven (cf. 2 Cor. 12:2b), where Christ was exalted by God after His resurrection (Acts 2:33; 5:31). Because the Father is in the third heaven (Matt. 6:9), to be exalted to the third heaven is to be exalted to God the Father (cf. Luke 15:18). Christ today is in the heavens as a peg driven into God.</p>
<p>In Isaiah 22:24 <em>glory</em> is in apposition with both <em>the offspring and the issue</em> and <em>vessels</em>. Thus, the glory of the Father&rsquo;s house that hangs on Christ as the peg is the children of God as the offspring and the issue (descendants) of God, and these children of God are the vessels of Christ, who hang on Him as the peg, the holder, in order to contain Him and to minister Him to others. The children of God as the offspring and the issue are glory in the house of God, and they are also the vessels. The Speaker to the church in Philadelphia holds the key of David to deal with us so that we might be transformed and built up. Once we have been built up, He will become a peg to us, and we will be the vessels hanging on Him.</p>
<p>First, Christ holds the key of David, and eventually He holds us. Christ used the key to open the door of our prison. Before we came into the church life, we were all imprisoned. But Christ, the One who holds the key of David, opened our prison and released us. According to our experience, all the doors opened for us by Christ are prison doors. Although the opposers are trying their best to imprison us, we are released by the key held in the hand of Christ. As today&rsquo;s David, He has the key to open whatever God desires to open. Once He opens the door and we are released, we enter into the house of God where we become the household with many vessels held by Christ as the peg. Christ is the peg in God&rsquo;s house, and by this peg, we all are held up from the earth.</p>
<p>First, Christ uses the key to release us from prison. After we have been released and have entered into the house of God, He becomes the peg holding us off the ground. The purpose of His doing this is so that we might be transformed into a pillar in God&rsquo;s house. Eventually, we, the pillars, will become parts of the New Jerusalem. Christ&rsquo;s writing the name of the New Jerusalem upon us means that we have been transformed into a part of the New Jerusalem. This is the church life, and this is the temple of God. Within this temple our Christ is a great peg holding us off the ground for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>As the One who has the key of David and who opens what no one will shut, the Lord has given the recovered church an opened door, which no one can shut. Through the years, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has experienced the Lord as such a One. Since the recovery of the proper church life began in the early part of the nineteenth century, a door has always been opened wide to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. From the beginning of the recovery of the proper church life, Satan, the enemy of God, tried his best to shut the door. The more organized Christianity tries to shut the door, the wider it is opened. In spite of much opposition, today the door is open worldwide. The key is in the hand of the Head of the church; it is not in the hand of the opposers. No matter how much opposition there is to His recovery, the doors are increasingly open to the recovery, and the key is in His hand. As long as we are in His recovery, the door will always be open to us. Although many opposers rose up against His recovery and tried their best to shut the door, Christ nevertheless is the One who has the key of David. What He opens no one will shut, and what He shuts no one will open. Today we should praise the Lord for the door open worldwide.</p>
<p><em>Philadelphia</em> means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo; In the local churches we need the Philadelphia; we need the love for one another. We love one another because we love the Lord. We need the brotherly love, for in this love we have the open door. In a prevailing local church the door is always wide open, because the brothers love one another. As long as the brothers and sisters love one another, the door can never be shut. The more we love one another, the more the door will be open. If we invite others to come to the church meetings, we simply need to let them see the love with oneness and harmony that we have. This alone will convince them. The way to open the door is to love one another. The open door is set before Philadelphia. If we would have an open door, we must love one another. This will convince the world.</p><h2 class="head4">k. As the One Who Has a New Name<br />
to Be Written upon the Overcomers</h2>
<p>Revelation 3:12 tells us that Christ will write upon the overcomers His new name. Christ writes His new name upon the overcomers. Here He is a new Christ, not another Christ; He is the Christ who is exceedingly ancient yet who is new today, having a new name to write upon the overcomers. This indicates that the overcomers are one with this new Christ. In our experience, His newness is according to our enjoyment of Him.</p>
<p>The Lord promises to write upon the overcomer His new name. This new name will be according to our experiences. In other words, what we experience of the Lord will become us. We experience God, and God becomes us. We experience the New Jerusalem, and that also becomes us. We experience the Lord in an intimate and personal way, and that becomes us. Therefore, the Lord will rightly designate us, writing upon us His new name. This will indicate that we have become a person who has experienced the Lord Himself as the One who makes Himself us.</p>
<p>The name which is upon the overcomers indicates that this is what they are. To have the new name of the Lord Jesus means that they are Jesus, because they have His new name written upon them. Of course, their being Jesus is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</p>
<p>That the Lord&rsquo;s new name is written upon the overcomer indicates that the overcomer is possessed by the Lord, that the Lord Himself belongs to him, and that he is one with the Lord. The overcomer is the possession of Christ, and he is the expression of Christ, who has transformed him with His elements. The name of the Lord denotes the Lord Himself. That the name of the Lord is written upon the overcomer indicates that the person of the Lord has been wrought into the overcomer.</p>
<p>The overcomers&rsquo; bearing the new name of Christ does not mean that Christ has a new name. It means that Christ will be experienced by these overcomers in a new way. Thus, the Christ whom they are experiencing is new to them. If we choose to take the overcoming way, we will experience Christ in a new way, and Christ will become new to us. Our Owner will be the new Christ.</p>
<p>To many of us Christ is old, not new. At the beginning of our Christian life, Christ was new to us, but gradually that new Christ became old to us. We have Christ, but Christ may not be new to us. Mostly our experience of Christ may be old. But if we make the decision to be an overcomer in this age, we will have the sense that Christ is exceedingly fresh and new. We will enjoy Him as God&rsquo;s new compassions refreshing us every morning (Lam. 3:22-23).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s name will be on us. If we put a label on a brother with his name on it, everyone will know who he is because he bears a certain name. The overcomers also bear the new name of the Lord. In a sense they are experiencing a new Lord, a new Jesus, a new Christ. Yes, we have the same Jesus, but the defeated believers&rsquo; taste of Him may not be as good and sweet as that of the overcoming believers. Today our Jesus should truly be a new Jesus; every day He should be new to us. To have the new name of the Lord means that we experience something new of the Lord and that we have become the new manifestation of the Lord Himself. If we do so, we have the same Jesus, yet the taste of Him is new and better.</p>
<p>We need to have new experiences of Christ. Most Christians have only the limited experience of Christ as their Redeemer. Not many have the experience of Christ as their life. Most of those who experience Christ as life experience this in a shallow way. Christ is not only our Redeemer and our life; He is also our King, Prophet, Priest, light, power, righteousness, holiness, transformation, and many other things. The more we experience Christ, the newer He will be to us, and the more His name will be written upon us. First, Christ as Redeemer is written upon us. Later, Christ as life, light, humility, patience, and love will also be written upon us. His name is inexhaustible. The writing of His name upon us depends upon our experience. The more we experience Him, the longer will be the writing of this name. No one can say what the new name of Christ is because it is simply the designation of our new experience of Christ. When we experience Christ in a certain way, that aspect of Christ will become our designation, the new name written upon us. In this way our experience of Christ will be lengthened, and we will say, &ldquo;Not my will but His will.&rdquo; We will not act on our own but according to His heart&rsquo;s desire. Then the name of God, the name of the city of God, and the Lord&rsquo;s new name will be written upon us.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(10)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Priest who trims the lampstands, the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head4">l. As the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness,<br />
the Beginning of the Creation of God</h2>
<p>In Revelation 3:14 Christ is revealed as &ldquo;the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Amen</h2>
<p>Christ has a name, and His name is called Amen. The title <em>Amen</em> has various meanings: &ldquo;reality,&rdquo; &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;let it be.&rdquo; Amen is a kind of eternal yes. Because Amen is the Lord&rsquo;s name, our saying Amen is equal to calling on the name of the Lord. When we say Amen, we mean &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; May we all learn to say Amen.</p>
<p>As the Amen, Christ is also the ending. In His address to the church in Laodicea the Lord declares Himself to be the &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; first, &ldquo;the faithful and true Witness&rdquo; second, and &ldquo;the Beginning&rdquo; last. These expressions in such an order show us that He is One that we cannot explain. The order of these titles is not according to our human logic. He is the Beginning of the entire universe, the Witness to maintain it, and the Amen, the ending. Whatever God intended to do&mdash;including His intention to establish many local churches and to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;will be done. For instance, God wants us to be overcomers and co-kings of Christ. Instead of stating that we cannot be such, we need to simply say Amen. To all of God&rsquo;s promises and to all that God desires to do, Christ is the Amen. It is significant that He declares Himself to be the Amen not in the first epistle to the churches in Asia but in the last epistle. He is the Amen, He is everything, and He is Amen to everything. We all need to see and know Him to such an extent. He is the One who is all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) The Faithful and True Witness</h2>
<p>The word <em>Amen,</em> from Hebrew, means &ldquo;firm,&rdquo; &ldquo;steadfast,&rdquo; or &ldquo;trustworthy.&rdquo; The Lord is the firm, steadfast, and trustworthy One. Hence, He is the faithful and true Witness. This indicates that the church in Laodicea, the degraded recovered church, is not firm, steadfast, trustworthy, or faithful and true as the Lord&rsquo;s witness.</p>
<p>Christ is the true Witness, and He is faithful and true in testifying. He never tells a lie in His testimony. His being the faithful and true Witness is for dispensing. A liar, a false witness, can never give life to others. If we would give life to others, we must be faithful and true. We must have no falsehood. Then we will be qualified to give life. Because He is living and holy and faithful and true, He is qualified to impart life into us.</p>
<p>In Christ we see that God is love and light and that He is holy and righteous. Thus, the New Testament reveals that Christ is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9). For Christ to be the embodiment of God means that He is the portrait of God, and as such, He is the testimony of what God is. Because Christ is the testimony of what God is, He is called &ldquo;the faithful and true Witness&rdquo; (Rev. 3:14; 1:5). As God&rsquo;s Witness, Christ bears God&rsquo;s testimony to show us what kind of God He is.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) The Beginning of the Creation of God</h2>
<p><em>The beginning of the creation of God</em> refers to the Lord as the origin, or source, of God&rsquo;s creation, implying that the Lord is the unchanging and ever-existing source of God&rsquo;s work. This indicates that the church in Laodicea has changed by leaving the Lord as the source. Moreover, as the beginning of the creation of God, He is the chief of the creation, the first of all creatures.</p>
<p>Christ being the beginning of the creation of God means that the entire universe as God&rsquo;s creation began from Him. As the unchanging and ever-existing source of God&rsquo;s work, Christ was the beginning of God&rsquo;s entire creation. Without Him nothing could happen, because He was the beginning.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s dispensing is to dispense His life into His human beings, His creatures. It is Christ who originated the creatures. This indicates that the entire creation is under His control, His headship. He is the beginning, the origination, of God&rsquo;s entire creation. Thus, the entire creation is under His direction for the purpose of dispensing God into His chosen creatures.</p><h2 class="head4">m. As the Gold, the White Garments,<br />
and the Eyesalve for the Overcomers to Buy</h2>
<p>Revelation 3:18 goes on to say, &ldquo;I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.&rdquo; Christ is the gold, the white garments, and the eyesalve for the overcomers to buy. Buying requires the paying of a price. The church in Laodicea must pay a price for gold, white garments, and eyesalve, which she desperately needs. In order to be the overcomers, daily we need to pay the price to buy the gold (Christ as our increasing faith to partake of His divine element), the white garments (Christ expressed as righteousness in our daily life), and the eyesalve (the Spirit as the enlightening ointment to anoint our eyes so that we may see the spiritual things).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Gold</h2>
<p>In the Bible our operating, working faith (Gal. 5:6) is likened to gold (1 Pet. 1:7), and the divine nature of God, which is the divinity of Christ, is typified by gold (Exo. 25:11). By faith we partake of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:1, 4-5). The church in Laodicea has the knowledge of the doctrines concerning Christ but not much living faith to partake of the divine element of Christ. She needs to pay the price to gain the golden faith through the fiery trials that she may participate in the real gold, which is Christ Himself as the life element to His Body. Thus, she can become a pure golden lampstand (Rev. 1:20) for the building of the golden New Jerusalem (21:18).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in typology, or in biblical figure, gold signifies two things: God&rsquo;s divine nature and the living faith by which we appreciate and appropriate the divine nature. These two things are combined. If we do not have the living faith to appreciate and apply the divine nature, it cannot be ours. The divine nature can become our enjoyment only through our living faith. Christ is the embodiment of the divine nature, and He is also our living faith. If we have faith, then we can participate in the divine nature. This means that we must have Christ. We must pay the cost and tell the Lord, &ldquo;I have much knowledge of the Bible truths, but I admit that I do not have much of You. Lord, I would rather have You than mere knowledge or vain teachings. Lord, You are the real gold, the embodiment of the divine nature. In order to appreciate and apply this divine nature, I need living faith. Yet, Lord, I do not have this living faith, but I look to You. Lord, be my living faith. I want to live by You as my faith, the faith of the Son of God&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). If we speak to the Lord in this way, He will tell us that if we would gain Him, we must pay the price by dropping things that hinder Christ from becoming our enjoyment. If we keep these things, the Lord will stay away from us, but if we drop them, empty our hands, and grasp Christ, we will have Him as our enjoyment.</p>
<p>We can never separate living faith from the divine nature. Although this is difficult to explain doctrinally, we know experientially that when we have living faith, we enjoy the divine nature. Conversely, when we are in the divine nature, we surely have this living faith. Hence, these two things are combined and are both signified by gold. The church in Laodicea needs this gold&mdash;the divine nature applied, appropriated, by the living faith, which is Christ Himself. If we would gain this, we must pay the price.</p>
<p>In the New Testament our faith, the living faith, is a person, and this person is Christ. This is why we must look away unto Him, pray to Him, have fellowship with Him, and read His Word (Heb. 12:2). The more we read His Word and listen to His word, the more the living Christ will be inwardly unveiled to us, and this inward Christ will be the spontaneous faith to us. Faith is not a mere action but a living person, living in us and acting in us. The living faith, which is Christ Himself, is the gold that we need to buy.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) The White Garments</h2>
<p>The Lord counsels the church in Laodicea to buy white garments that they may be clothed and that the shame of their nakedness may not be manifested. In figure, garments signify conduct. White garments here refer to conduct approvable to the Lord, which is the Lord Himself lived out of the church, and which is required by the degraded recovered church to cover her nakedness. These white garments are not Christ as our objective righteousness for justification. Rather, the white garments are Christ as our subjective righteousness, Christ lived out of our being. The Christ who is lived out of us will be our second garment for us to be approved by the Lord. This is not for salvation but for being chosen (Rev. 17:14). We all need this second garment. When we have living faith and participate in the divine nature, this divine nature will eventually come out of us to be our living. This living is Christ lived out of our being, and this is the second garment, which gives us the standing and the qualification to be approved by Christ. This garment will cover our nakedness. Yes, we all have been justified and have been covered by the first garment, the best robe put on the prodigal son in Luke 15. But after being justified, we must love the Lord, be on fire, and be absolutely for the Lord. If we are this kind of Christian, we will have the living faith to participate in the rich, divine nature, which will become the Christ lived out of our being as the second garment to cover our nakedness.</p>
<p>After being justified, if we do not love the Lord and live by, for, and with Him, we are naked. A brother who does not love the Lord or live by the Lord is shameful and is naked. He does not have the lovely Christ as his covering. He believes in Christ and belongs to Christ, but since he neither loves Him nor lives by Him, he is naked both in the eyes of the Lord and in the eyes of other believers. He does not have Christ as his beautiful covering.</p>
<p>We must pay the price for this second garment, the Christ lived out of our being. This is the subjective Christ, the Christ experienced by us in a subjective way. According to our experience, we can testify that, on the one hand, we may have the assurance that we are justified, but on the other hand, we may sense that we are naked. Undoubtedly, as children of God, we have been justified, redeemed, saved, and regenerated, and we are members of Christ. But on the other hand, we sense that we are naked, not having Christ lived out of us to be our beautiful covering. Inwardly, we condemn ourselves for this. If we check this word with our experience, we will see that it is true. Thus, we all must pay the price, saying, &ldquo;Lord, whatever the cost, I will pay the price to have You live out of my being. Lord, I want to have You as my living. I do not want to behave myself, correct myself, or improve myself. Lord, I desire to have You lived out of me. Day by day I want You to live out of my being to be my outward living. Lord, be not only my inward life but also my outward living.&rdquo; If we pray this way to the Lord, He will become our outward covering, the second garment for us to be approved and chosen by Him. There is no need to wait for the day of His second coming. Even today we may have the assurance that we have been approved and chosen. Therefore, when that day comes, He will surely tell us to come with Him to enjoy our portion and to fight with Him against the army of the Antichrist.</p><h2 class="head5">(3) The Eyesalve</h2>
<p>Third, the Lord counsels the church in Laodicea to buy from Him eyesalve to anoint their eyes that they may see. The eyesalve needed to anoint their eyes must refer to the anointing Spirit (1 John 2:27), who is also the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Because she has been distracted by the dead knowledge of letters, the degraded recovered church needs this kind of eyesalve for her blindness. For the eyesalve the Lord counsels her to buy; she must pay the price.</p>
<p>Spiritual insight is always related to the Spirit. We need more Spirit, not more knowledge. We do not need many doctrines&mdash;we need more Spirit to anoint our eyes and the depths of our inner being so that we may have insight to see things from within. With this eyesalve, this anointing, we may have both foresight and deep insight to see things thoroughly. Then we will say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, because I now see what a treasure You are, I am ready to pay any price.&rdquo; Many Christians are unwilling to pay the price for Christ because they do not see what a treasure Christ is. They do not see the preciousness, the worth, and the value of Christ. But once our eyes have been anointed by the divine, spiritual eyesalve, we will realize that it is worthwhile for us to pay any price for Christ. If we would see this, we need eyesalve. This is so that we may have the sight to see the divine and spiritual things.</p>
<p>As we have pointed out, the gold, the garments, and the eyesalve are all Christ. Christ is everything; our need today is Christ. The intention of the ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to help the Lord&rsquo;s people to be enlightened that they might see the value, worth, and preciousness of Christ, and by having this insight, they might be willing to pay any price to gain Him. It is worthwhile for us to pay the cost of our future, our destiny, and our whole life for Christ. If we would pay all this, the price is still too cheap. Our self, our future, and our life are all worth nothing. We actually pay nothing to gain Christ who is everything. Paul says that all the things he counted loss for Christ were just refuse, dog food (Phil. 3:8). In the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we are for the rich Christ. The goal of the ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to minister some ointment that people&rsquo;s eyes may be anointed to see the preciousness of Christ and be attracted to Him. The degraded church needs eyesalve; she needs revelation, vision, and great grace.</p>
<p>As soon as we are willing to pay the price, to buy the eyesalve, we will see. The crucial matter is the willingness to pay the price. What we cannot put aside is the price. Whatever replaces Christ, is a substitute for Christ, or is even against Christ&mdash;whether it be our reputation, position, knowledge, wealth, desires, or thoughts&mdash;is the price. We need to buy the eyesalve, instead of excusing ourselves by saying that we have not seen the vision. We need to pray, saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, by Your mercy I will buy the eyesalve. By Your mercy I am willing to pay the price.&rdquo; If we say this to the Lord, the heavens will be opened, the scales will fall from our eyes, and we will see the heavenly vision.</p>
<p>In brief, the Lord counseled the believers in Laodicea to buy from Him gold, white garments, and eyesalve. The reason that the Lord charged them to buy from Him gold is that in the church in Laodicea there was much clay&mdash;many things other than God&mdash;but very little gold&mdash;very little of the element of God. With regard to white garments, the color white denotes purity, the absence of mixture, and garments refer to our walk and conduct. Hence, white garments signify a walk and conduct that express the purity of God. Eyesalve is for anointing the eyes. When the eyes have an ailment and are unable to see, there is the need to buy eyesalve to cure the eyes and make them bright again. In normal situations the inner nature of a Christian should be pure, and his outward living should be white and bright. All these three items require us to buy, to pay a price. God&rsquo;s intention is to accomplish His eternal purpose through man. Thus, after the Lord calls us, we need to pay a price so that we may become useful to Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(11)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Priest who trims the lampstands, the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head4">n. As the One Who Will Dine with the Overcomers<br />
and Give the Overcomers to Sit with Him<br />
on His Throne as He Overcame and Sat<br />
with His Father on His Throne</h2>
<p>Revelation 3:20-21 says, &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me. He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne.&rdquo; Christ is the One who will dine with the overcomers and give the overcomers to sit with Him on His throne as He overcame and sat with His Father on His throne. Here to overcome is to overcome the lukewarmness and pride of the degraded recovered church, to pay the price to buy the needed items (gold, white garments, and eyesalve), and to open the door so that the Lord can come in and dine with those who open the door.</p>
<p>This door is not the door of the hearts of individuals but the door of the church. The Lord as the Head of the church is standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door. The degraded recovered church must realize this. The door is the door of the church, but the door is opened by individual believers. The church in Laodicea has knowledge but does not have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The Lord is dealing with the whole church, but the acceptance of the Lord&rsquo;s dealing must be a personal matter. The Lord&rsquo;s dealing is objective, but the believers&rsquo; acceptance must be subjective.</p>
<p>We often shut the door on the Lord, leaving Him outside the door. Our condition may be like that of the church in Laodicea. Although we love the Lord and consistently pray and attend the meetings, we may not be willing to practically pay a price, and in the end we become lukewarm. The Lord has no ground in us and has been shut outside the door by us, the lukewarm Laodiceans. Even though He is in our spirit, we often shut Him outside the door. For instance, we shut Him outside the door of our emotion. Our spirit is like a prison in which we keep the Lord. Therefore, the Lord has no way to enter into our inner chambers and into our heart. The Lord is standing and knocking in our cold spirit, longing to enter into our heart and our emotion. The Lord desires to have mutual enjoyment with us.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) To Dine with the Overcomers</h2>
<p>In verse 20 the Lord also said that, after He comes in to him who opens the door, He will dine with him and he with Him. According to the Greek, the word <em>dine</em> signifies the principal meal of the day at evening. To dine is not merely to eat one item of food but to partake of the riches of a meal. This may imply the fulfillment of the type of the children of Israel eating the rich produce of the good land of Canaan (Josh. 5:10-12). During the yearly feasts the children of Israel feasted with God, and God feasted with them. Whenever the Israelites had a feast, they ate with God, offering what they were eating to God and letting God eat with them. In like manner, the Lord says that He will dine with us and that we will dine with Him.</p>
<p>The dining promised here is not only for the future but also for today. If we are an overcomer, we will have the special privilege of eating with the Lord when He comes in the kingdom. Before that day, however, we may enjoy His dining with us.</p>
<p>If we have an overall view of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, we will see that the Lord exalts the eating of Himself, the taking in of Himself as our life supply, that we may grow, be transformed, and be the same as He is. In His promises concerning the reward to the overcomers in the seven churches, Christ is considered as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast for us to enjoy with Him. This corresponds to the three stages of eating by God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament. God&rsquo;s people were destined to eat the tree of life, God&rsquo;s redeemed people were given to eat the manna while wandering in the wilderness, and in the good land they had a feast three times a year on Mount Zion to enjoy the rich produce of the land. These three stages of eating are repeated in Revelation, the concluding book of the Bible, as rewards promised to the overcomers, to whom Christ will be the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the rich produce of the good land. This is altogether for our enjoyment of Christ. We may eat Christ as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast for our enjoyment. Through our enjoyment of Christ, we may be constituted with Him. Eventually, we will be mingled with Him in our constitution as one entity in order to express Him as the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Revelation 3:20, regarding enjoying Him as a feast, was spoken to the church in Laodicea, which had become lukewarm. The lukewarm saints are self-contented; hence, they have become proud. The best way to help these saints overcome their lukewarmness is to help them open their hearts to the Lord in order to let the Lord come in to dine, to feast, with them. The enjoyment of Christ as a feast will cause us to gain the faith in Christ, the white garments, and the eyesalve (v. 18).</p><h2 class="head5">(2) To Give the Overcomers<br />
to Sit with Him on His Throne</h2>
<p>We need to be those who dine, who feast, with the Lord in this age so that we can sit on the throne with the Lord in the kingdom age. To sit with the Lord on His throne will be a prize to the overcomer that he may participate in the Lord&rsquo;s authority in the coming millennial kingdom. This means that the overcomers will be co-kings with Christ ruling over the whole earth. Strictly speaking, all the promises in these seven epistles concern the coming kingdom. Any negative word regarding loss or suffering refers to a loss during the coming kingdom, and any positive word regarding gain or enjoyment refers to the enjoyment of Christ as our special portion during the age of the kingdom. We must have the insight to understand these promises in a proper way. Nevertheless, in principle, these promises may also be applied today, and we may pre-taste them now. There is no need to wait until we enter into the kingdom age to enjoy all these special portions. Today in the church life we are privileged to enjoy the kingdom.</p>
<p>The overcomers will be on the throne with Christ as His co-kings (2:26-27; 3:21). Christ is on the throne, and they also will be on the throne. He has the authority, and they also will have the same authority to rule over the nations.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to work on man in order that man can be on the throne. God will not be satisfied until we are on the throne. God&rsquo;s intention is to take us to the throne. His desire is to make us people of the throne. God&rsquo;s kingdom cannot come in full until we are on the throne. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s enemy will not be subdued until we are on the throne. God&rsquo;s goal, therefore, is not merely to deliver us out of hell but to bring us to the throne.</p>
<p>God desires to bring us to the throne because of the rebellion of Satan against God&rsquo;s throne (Isa. 14). If we read the Bible carefully, we will see that the greatest difficulty God faces in the universe is that His throne has been opposed and attacked by rebel forces. God&rsquo;s throne is absolute, but one of His creatures has rebelled and seeks to exalt his throne to be equal with that of God. In his rebellion against God&rsquo;s throne, Satan intended to exalt his throne to the heavens and thereby to intrude upon God&rsquo;s authority. Isaiah 14:12-14 says, &ldquo;How you have fallen from heaven, / O Daystar, son of the dawn! / How you have been hewn down to earth, / You who made nations fall prostrate! / But you, you said in your heart: / I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne. / And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north. / I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will make myself like the Most High.&rdquo; From the time of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion until now, there has been a dispute in the universe regarding authority. Much of what is happening on earth is an expression of Satan&rsquo;s resistance to God&rsquo;s throne. The crucial question is this: Who is actually reigning on earth&mdash;God or Satan?</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus became a man, and as a man He went to the throne. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was absolutely submissive to God&rsquo;s authority. To obey God is to be a person under the throne. Because the Lord Jesus obeyed God the Father and submitted to God&rsquo;s authority in an absolute way, after He was resurrected from the dead, God gave Him all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18) and exalted Him to the throne. Now the One sitting on the throne is not only God but also man, for this One is the mingling of God and man. Therefore, after the ascension of the Lord Jesus, there has been a man on the throne.</p>
<p>Through His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the Lord Jesus was brought to the throne. A real man whose name is Jesus is on the throne. This is why we declare, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; and this is why we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; God has always been the Lord, but now a man is on the throne as the Lord. Through His resurrection and in His ascension, &ldquo;God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus&rdquo; (Acts 2:36). God has made Jesus, a Nazarene, the Lord, and now today the Lord of heaven and of earth is a man.</p>
<p>It would not seem strange to us to say that Jehovah Elohim is the Lord of the universe. But it is not easy for us to realize that a man who could be crucified and buried could be the Lord of the universe. When Judas and the multitude came to arrest Him, He did not run away. He willingly made Himself weak and allowed Himself to be arrested and crucified. In the words of 2 Corinthians 13:4, &ldquo;He was crucified out of weakness.&rdquo; But after He was crucified and buried, God resurrected Him and set Him at His right hand, making Him the Lord of all the universe. Today the Lord of the universe is a man.</p>
<p>We need to see that the Lord Jesus led the way to the throne. He was the Pioneer, the Forerunner (Heb. 6:20), cutting the path to the throne (2:10). This indicates that He is not the only man destined for the throne. He has cut the path and has taken the lead so that we may follow. He was the first one to the throne, and we will come after Him. Now we are marching to the throne, for God intends to bring us into glory and to set us on the throne. When we overcome, we will sit with Christ on His throne and have authority to reign with the Lord and rule over the nations.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s mind is on man (v. 6), and He wants man to express Him and to exercise His authority. Man has God&rsquo;s image and God&rsquo;s dominion with His authority. God desires to manifest Himself through man, and He desires to reign, to administrate, through man. God&rsquo;s intention is to cast Satan down and to redeem many of those taken captive by Satan and bring them to His throne. God cannot receive the full glory until we are brought to the throne. One day we will be brought to the throne, and then God will be able to boast to Satan. He will triumphantly declare that His chosen ones, who had been taken captive by Satan, have been brought to the throne.</p>
<p>However, we need to realize that in our present condition we may not be qualified to be on the throne. This is a very serious matter. We have been called to be sons of God, and we are destined to be kings, but we need God to work in us and on us to qualify us for kingship.</p><h2 class="head4">O. As the Spirit Speaking to the Churches</h2>
<p>In Revelation 2 and 3 Christ is the Spirit who speaks to all the churches (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). At the beginning of each of the seven epistles recorded in chapters 2 and 3, it is the Lord who speaks to a certain church (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). But at the end of each epistle, it is the Spirit who speaks to all the churches (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). In Revelation 2 and 3 the speaking of the unlimited, life-releasing, sevenfold intensified, pneumatic Christ to the seven churches at the beginning of each epistle becomes the speaking of the sevenfold intensified, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit to all the seven churches at the end of each epistle universally. Here we see that the speaking Christ becomes the speaking Spirit, the Spirit who speaks to all the churches. This implies that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one. Christ as the Spirit speaking to the churches is the processed Triune God. In Christ, the Triune God has been processed for our enjoyment so that we may be constituted with all that He is to become His ultimate manifestation and expression for eternity.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s speaking and the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking are one speaking. Christ speaks to a particular local church, and the Spirit speaks to the universal Body. This proves that the speaking Christ is the Spirit and that He speaks in the Spirit, with the Spirit, and through the Spirit. Whatever Christ speaks, that is the speaking of the Spirit. This not only indicates that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit, but it also emphasizes that in the darkness of the church&rsquo;s degradation the Spirit is vitally important, as indicated by the sevenfold intensified Spirit in 1:4. The same emphasis is seen also in 14:13 and 22:17.</p>
<p>It is significant that the Lord is speaking as the Spirit not only to a certain church but to all the churches. The Spirit, as the eyes of the Lord, looks into the situation of all the churches (5:6), and He speaks concerning the whole situation. The Lord as the Spirit speaks to the churches without any limitation of time and space. While the church in a certain locality reads the epistle to Ephesus, the Spirit looks into the church in that locality and speaks to the ones there. The seven Spirits of God are sent forth not only to Ephesus but to the whole earth. The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 are words spoken by the Lord Jesus, but today when we read them, the seven Spirits of God speak these words to us in our spirit for the purpose of God&rsquo;s administration. The Lord&rsquo;s word at the beginning is to a certain local church, but later when the people from all the ages read it, it becomes the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking to all the churches. Whatever the Lord speaks is recorded in the Bible, but when we read it, the Spirit still must speak it. First, this matter proves that the Lord&rsquo;s speaking is the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking and that the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking is the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. This indicates that the Spirit is one with the Lord, and the Lord is one with the Spirit. The Lord speaks in the Spirit, through the Spirit, and with the Spirit, because the Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord. Furthermore, although the Lord&rsquo;s word was already spoken to a certain local church, today when the churches want to hear His word, there is still the need for the Spirit to speak it. This indicates that the Spirit we have within us is the speaking Spirit.</p>
<p>If the Speaker were only Christ and not the speaking Spirit, He would not be able to speak words into our spirit, and His speaking would not be very subjective and touching. But as our experience testifies, if when we read these epistles, we are open in our spirit to Him the Spirit will immediately speak something of Christ into us. Because the Speaker is not the outward, objective Christ but the inward, subjective Spirit, He speaks not only in the black and white letters of the Bible but also in our spirit. Once we hear His speaking, something indelible is wrought into us, and nothing can take it away. Whenever we hear His speaking, Christ is wrought into us.</p>
<p>The speaking of the Spirit always turns us to the infusing of Christ. The Spirit&rsquo;s speaking is Christ&rsquo;s infusing. If we listen to His speaking, we will immediately be under Christ&rsquo;s transfusing and infusing, and we will be immersed into Christ. Today the seven Spirits are speaking to the churches, and anyone who has an ear and listens to this speaking will be turned to Christ&rsquo;s infusing. Whenever we listen to the speaking of the seven Spirits of God to the churches, we are immediately under a precious, sweet, and dear transfusing, an infusing that changes us, transforms us, makes us the proper material, and builds us into God&rsquo;s building. Whatever must go to the lake of fire is burned away by the seven lamps, and now we are under the seven eyes, being infused with all that Christ is in order that we may become part of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Because the Spirit today is speaking to the churches, we need to be in the churches in order to be rightly positioned to hear the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking. Those who are not in the churches cannot hear what the Spirit is speaking to the churches. Even though the believers in the churches are in a position to hear the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking and thus can easily have ears to hear, not all of them will closely follow His speaking. Hence, there is the call for the overcomers. When the majority of God&rsquo;s people have failed God and cannot meet His need, God calls a small group of overcomers. Whoever has an ear to hear what the Spirit speaks to the churches should first hear and then be an overcomer. Overcomers are produced by having an ear that can hear, and the ear to hear is produced through the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking to the churches. The Spirit speaks to the churches. Those who have an ear to hear what the Spirit says to the churches should hear, and those who hear will be overcomers.</p>
<p>Each epistle was written to a particular church in a certain locality, yet all the seven epistles conclude in the same way&mdash;with the Spirit speaking to all the churches. This means that each epistle was written to all the churches, and it indicates that all the churches should be the same. This is a base for all the churches to practice the one accord. There must be the one accord among all the churches. All the churches should listen to the word that the apostles have received of God, which is the teaching of the New Testament. This implies that all the churches, as the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in the Spirit, should be the same.</p>
<p>In Revelation 1 we see many titles for the wonderful One&mdash;Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, the Redeemer, the One who made us a kingdom and priests to His God and Father, the One who comes, and the Son of Man appearing as the High Priest. Yet in chapter 2 we see Christ, the all-inclusive Head, and the speaking Spirit. This means that all that Christ is in chapter 1 has been condensed into the all-inclusive Christ and the speaking Spirit in chapter 2.</p></body></html>
