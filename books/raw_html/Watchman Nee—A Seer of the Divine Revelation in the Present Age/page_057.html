<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WITNESSED</H1><P>This chapter contains the testimonies of five persons who knew Watchman Nee personally. What they have written concerning him is drawn from their personal knowledge and firsthand experience extending over a period of years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1. HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW</H2><P>The first testimony is that of his brother-in-law, Samuel I. L. Chang, who was an elder in the church in Los Angeles.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>His Relationship with Watchman Nee</H2><P CLASS=INDENT1>Watchman Nee's grandmother and my grandmother were classmates in school. Their friendship began the relationship between our two families. Our fathers were also schoolmates, as were our sisters, and in due time he and I also attended the same school. Our relationship, however, was not merely the kind of friendship persons in the world have, but became the kind of relationship which exists between two Christian brothers. This relationship between us continued down through the years. It was through fellowship with Watchman Nee in 1927 that I was made clear concerning my own salvation. In 1934 he married my sister, but even though he became my brother-in-law, our relationship continued to be based not upon family ties but upon our relationship in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Assurance of Salvation through Watchman Nee</H2><P CLASS=INDENT1>My spiritual relationship with Watchman Nee began when I received the assurance of salvation. He ministered Christ to me in the Spirit, bringing me into a genuine and living enjoyment of the assurance of salvation. He asked me simply, "Are you saved?" I replied, "I don't know." He asked again, "Why are you not saved?" Again I replied, "I don't know." Then he asked, "Do you believe John 3:16?" He then proceeded to break this verse down, clause by clause: "'God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.'" He asked, "Do you believe this?" I replied, "Yes, I believe this." He asked, "Do you believe that 'every one who believes into Him would not perish, but have eternal life'?" I said, "Yes, I believe that also." He asked, "Are you saved?" I said, "I don't know." Then he said to me strongly, "But God said this. If you don't believe what He says, you make Him a liar!" These words lifted the veil from my heart and quickened my spirit. Immediately, I sensed the anointing within and fully believed that I was saved.</P>
