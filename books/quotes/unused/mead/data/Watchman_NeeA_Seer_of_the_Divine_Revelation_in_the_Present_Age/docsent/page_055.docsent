   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Genesis reveals that by the time Jacob reached the end of his life, he had matured to become Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also see a matured life in Watchman Nee after his many experiences with the Lord and much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His maturity was manifested in a number of ways.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was one with the Lord because his whole being was saturated with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was difficult to find a trace of anything natural in his being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was always in the spirit, never frustrated by the flesh or restricted by the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was always prepared to minister the Lord to others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was unnecessary for him to prepare himself to minister; he was able to minister life to others constantly and instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Watchman Nee possessed a matured measure of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was full of insight and able to discern the situation of others in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had the ability to isolate a person's problem and thoroughly diagnose his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His heart was large, and he enjoyed bearing the burdens of others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The burdens of others were not a heavy weight to him; his care for them was like an ocean, without scarcity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He fully bore the burden of the Lord's recovery in building up the churches in China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet there was no indication that he was either striving or struggling to fulfill his commission.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his dealings with others, sweetness, tenderness, and softness were spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not perform.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The flavor of these virtues simply overflowed spontaneously from the fullness of his matured life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was his testimony that he was ready to be either raptured or martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As I write these words, on the desk before me are two paperweights made of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One bears the inscription of his word: "My future is to be either raptured or martyred."</S>
