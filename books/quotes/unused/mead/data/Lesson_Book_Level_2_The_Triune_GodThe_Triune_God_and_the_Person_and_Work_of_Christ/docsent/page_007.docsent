   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the Son is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some people think that the Son is separate and different from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They think that the Spirit "represents" the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But according to the Bible, the Son not only was born of the Spirit, lived according to the Spirit, worked and fought by the Spirit Luke 4:14; Matt 12:28 , but He even became the Spirit Himself through crucifixion and resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is not merely the second of the Trinity or only one-third of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Neither is He a separate God or someone other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus is the Mighty God, the Eternal Father; He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and He even is the Spirit; and His coming was "from-with" the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why Colossians 1:19 says, "For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell," and 2:9 says, "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."</S>
