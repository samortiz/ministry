   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO GOD WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN CONFERENCE 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:Evening, January 12, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading: Eph 2:10; 3:16-19</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prayer: May the Lord cause the word to come out of us tonight, and may You cause others to receive these words into them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although there is not much outward stimulation or excitement, may these words give others the freedom and the light as they enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We admit our darkness and our foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We admit that we have not given You the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We pray that You would have more ground in us tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE GOAL OF GOD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people think that God's will is to make the proud person humble and the violent person meek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, they think that God's will is to make the bad persons into good ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But God's central work in man is not to do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is not turning an evil man so that he becomes a good one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the goal of God's work?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the words and teachings will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has to open our eyes to see that throughout the ages, His work is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although this word is simple, most people have never thought of this matter before.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>SALVATION BEING GOD WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will start from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is it to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before we answer this question, we have to ask why do men have to believe in Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Men believe in Jesus because there are sufferings in the world and because they want to receive blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man has sicknesses and sins, and this is why he needs Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is true that this is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But this is not the center of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have to ask this: If man needs to believe in Jesus because he has sinned, would he need Jesus if he does not have sins?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One brother said that the gospel is for us to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But why do we have to receive Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today, many people can speak some spiritual terms, but they do not know what those terms mean.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, to many people justification and sanctification are but terminologies only.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is it to receive Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To receive Christ is to receive Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But what is the meaning of receiving Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To receive Jesus is not merely for the purpose of being delivered from sin, suffering, and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is right that a man is saved to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, salvation itself is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For a man to be saved is for him to have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Salvation is not merely for us to be delivered from sin and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After a man has received the Lord, surely he will be delivered from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But God's work in man is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Salvation is God entering into man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To receive Christ is to receive God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is God, and God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible never tells us that there are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When He is in heaven, God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day, when He came among men and was seen and touched by men, He was the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John 1 shows us that the Son is the Father manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Father is the hidden God; He is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the meaning of the word father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One end of the Son is the Father, and the other end of the Father is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When God is in heaven, He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When He walks on earth, He is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One day, when He comes into man, He is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He proceeds from the Father, passing through the Son, and becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In John 14 the Lord Jesus said that His going is the Comforter's coming, and the Comforter's coming is His going.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Not only was He dwelling among us; He wanted to dwell within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Son is the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His entry is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Spirit is the entry of the Lord, God, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God was originally in heaven, and man was on earth; there was a great distance between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But through the Lord Jesus, man can now come to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, although the Lord was among men, many did not know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is why there is the need of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Holy Spirit is the entry of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Through the Holy Spirit, man can now know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When I was in Hong Kong, someone asked me where Christ has gone according to Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we take the Gospel of Matthew to a place where people have never heard the gospel, they will never say that Christ has ascended to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is because Matthew never says this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the result of the teaching in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Matthew did not mention the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If it had twenty-nine chapters, it would have said that Christ has entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His name is Emmanuel, which means God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How is He being with us?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is with us by being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is what the Chinese mean by "the shadow following the person all the way."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>To be saved is not merely to be delivered from perdition and death, and to be forgiven of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These are the necessary results of salvation, but they are not the center of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The center of salvation is God working Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Salvation cannot be separated from the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Suppose someone gives you a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is wrong to accept the gift while rejecting the giver of the gift.</S>
