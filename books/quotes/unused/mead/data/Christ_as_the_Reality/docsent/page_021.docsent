   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENT APPRECIATIONS OF THE MEAL OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Leviticus 2 also reveals the different appreciations of Christ as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already seen this with the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There was the bullock, the sheep or goat, and the turtledove or young pigeon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The meal offering also has three kinds or degrees of appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"And if thou bring an oblation of a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And if thy oblation be a meal offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And if thy oblation be a meal offering baked in the frying pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil" Lev 2:4-5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the burnt offering, the degree of appreciation differs in size, but in the appreciation of Jesus as the meal offering, there are the different degrees of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The oven signifies one kind of suffering; the pan signifies another kind of suffering; and the frying pan signifies still another kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we put something into the oven, the suffering is within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a hidden suffering, a deeper kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the four Gospels, some of the sufferings of the Lord Jesus are just like the sufferings in the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are so hidden that only He knows; others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For instance, when He was in the Garden of Gethsemane, He was praying, but even His disciples who were with Him did not know the extent of His suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was really in a kind of oven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the deepest appreciation of the suffering Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His suffering was inward, without any sympathy from others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was put into an oven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether we present Christ as one suffering in the oven or in the pan depends upon our apprehension and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our appreciation comes out of our apprehension and experience of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The cakes and wafers which were baked in the oven were more definite in form.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every cake and every wafer is in a certain form.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our experience and appreciation of Jesus in this deeper way have something more of a definite form.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Hebrew word "cakes" which is used here means perforated cakes or pierced cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a cake that is perforated and full of holes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we read the four Gospels, we see that Jesus was perfect, but He was not whole.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was perfect, but He was perforated and pierced through.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am afraid that with many of us there is not even one hole.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not perfect, yet we are so whole.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be perfect is right, but we should not keep ourselves so whole.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the church life, the more holes we have the better.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not keep ourselves so whole that we are not broken, perforated, and pierced through.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The life of Jesus in the Gospels was one of piercing after piercing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why it is easy for us to feed upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is so easy to eat the perforated and pierced cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Hebrew word "wafers" means cakes that are very, very thin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Probably they were hollow, because the root of this word means "empty."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is so thin and so hollow; therefore, it is easy for people to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet His inward suffering in this way has a definite form.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the deepest appreciation of Jesus as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some who bring Christ to the tent of meeting as the meal offering must have this deepest appreciation of His suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second appreciation of the meal offering is the fine flour mingled with oil and baked in a pan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A pan is more open than the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This signifies the open sufferings which are easier for others to realize.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is some form, for it is divided into portions, yet it is not so much in form as the cakes and wafers in the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The third appreciation is the fine flour mingled with oil and baked in a frying pan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The suffering is more shallow, and there is almost no definite form.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the lowest appreciation of Jesus as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we were first saved, most of us had this kind of appreciation of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But as we feed upon the Lord's humanity and grow, we should have at least a little appreciation of Jesus as the cakes and wafers baked in the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our appreciation and experience of the Lord's humanity must become deeper and deeper, higher and higher, and much more definite in form.</S>
