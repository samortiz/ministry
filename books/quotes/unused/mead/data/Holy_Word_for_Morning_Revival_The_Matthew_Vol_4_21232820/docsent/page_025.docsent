   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After Judas had gone, the Lord established the table with the eleven real believers.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Beginning at verse 26, the Lord's table is established.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we are keeping the real Feast of Unleavened Bread Matt 26:17; 1 Cor 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The bread of the Lord's table is a symbol signifying the Lord's body, which was broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord's blood redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and back to God's full blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning the Lord's table 1 Cor 10:21 , the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the cup is called the cup of blessing 1 Cor 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In it are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion Psa 16:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Adam our portion was the cup of God's wrath Rev 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ drank that cup for us John 18:11 , and His blood constitutes the cup of salvation for us Psa 116:13 , the cup that runs over Psa 23:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By partaking of this cup we have the fellowship of the blood of Christ 1 Cor 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some manuscripts insert the word new before the word covenant in Matthew 26:28 .</S>
