   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE LEARNING TO QUOTE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SCRIPTURES ACCURATELY LAYING A GOOD FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapters we said that we should use appropriate verses when we shepherd the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we will consider this matter further.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Quoting the Bible can be compared to practicing Chinese calligraphy: one must practice according to set rules.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, a beginner should practice writing in standard type, which is the foundation of Chinese calligraphy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a person cannot write the standard type properly, he will be unable to write in running style, in script type, or in seal type.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the young people who are learning to serve the Lord should practice according to rules so that they can lay a good foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a carpenter wants to make furniture, he starts off with a big pile of wood, and each piece of wood varies in texture and size.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One piece may be best for a tabletop, and another piece may be best for a door.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If he wants to make an end table, he will carefully choose a piece of wood that is suitable in quality, color, size, and thickness so that the end table will be beautiful and so that he will save time and materials.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A carpenter who randomly selects a piece of wood will waste time cutting it to the right size, proving that he is not a trained carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Similarly, when a Christian quotes the Scriptures, he should not randomly use any verse.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is inappropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible is very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although there are hundreds of verses on prayer, we cannot use them in a random way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Selecting the right verse can also be compared to selecting appropriate fabric for a spring outfit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must not be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regrettably, many Christians quote the Bible carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verses for Leading</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>the New Believers to Pray</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are many verses in the Bible concerning prayer in the Christian life, but which verses should we use with new believers?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us consider some verses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 6:18 says, Praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a good verse, but it should not be the first verse that we use.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Thessalonians 5:17 says, Unceasingly pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This verse is more suitable than Ephesians 6:18, but it is still not the most suitable verse to begin with.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Philippians 4:6 says, In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the best verse for comforting people, but it is still not suitable for helping new believers to learn to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Matthew 6:9-13 is commonly called the Lord s prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Using these verses to teach new believers to pray is the same as being in the denominations and teaching people to recite the Lord s prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even Matthew 7:7-8, which says, Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For everyone who asks receives, is not appropriate to use at first.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jude 20 says, You, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse is more appropriate, but the book of Jude is too deep for new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 4:24 says, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This verse is not speaking of how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hebrews 4:16 is more appropriate: Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, this verse does not have the word prayer .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Helping new believers is like teaching children in kindergarten.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need a verse that has the word prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Acts 6:4 says, We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, steadfast prayer is related to the service of the apostles, not to the prayer of new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Acts 2:42 says, They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This verse is appropriate for helping new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Three thousand new believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread, and in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Following this verse, we should use Jude 20.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When helping new believers to live the Christian life, we should first lead them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The basis for this is Acts 2:42.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the first group of believers were saved, they continued steadfastly not only in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles but also in the breaking of bread and in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The teaching and fellowship of the apostles and the breaking of bread are part of the church life, but prayer cannot be limited to just the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Prayer must be a part of a Christian s personal life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, this is the first verse that we should use.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First Thessalonians 5:17 can be next, and then we can use Ephesians 6:18.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These three verses are sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no need to use many verses.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order to shepherd new believers, we must learn how to find appropriate verses.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This kind of study helps us to be equipped.</S>
