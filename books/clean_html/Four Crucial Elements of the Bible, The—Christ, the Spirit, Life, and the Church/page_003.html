<h2 class=head2>The Church Being the Life of God Himself</h2><p>God has called us out of the world, out of every nation, tribe, people, and tongue (Rev. 7:9) and has gathered us together to be the church. Today, regardless of our nationality or race, we have been called to become the people of the kingdom of the heavens. Hence, we have the heavenly citizenship. An American of Chinese descent is Chinese according to birth, but he becomes an American citizen by naturalization. Today we have become the people of the kingdom of the heavens by “naturalization,” by being called by God, and also by birth, by being regenerated by God. God not only has called us but also has regenerated us with His life. We were not adopted by God; we were begotten of Him with His life. We all have God’s divine life in us, and we are brothers and sisters of one another because we have been born of the same Father. Regardless of our color, race, or nationality, God has called us and regenerated us that we may become people of the kingdom of the heavens and brothers and sisters in His universal family. This is the church.<p>God’s life is God Himself. Therefore, when God regenerates us with His life, He begets us with Himself. Furthermore, He is within us today. The church is an entity of life, and as such, it has a life and a person. The church is not an organization; it is a life entity, an organism, with a life and a person. This life and this person are the Triune God Himself. He is the element of the oneness of the church (Eph. 4:1-6); hence, the church cannot be divided. Since we all have one God, one life, and one person, there is no factor that can divide us.<h2 class=head2>The Church Life Being to Live and Walk by the Person within Us</h2><p>Since we have the Triune God in us as our life and person, we must live and walk by Him in our daily life (Gal. 5:25) and grow up in all things into Him, who is the Head (Eph. 4:15). It is difficult for husbands and wives not to quarrel in their married life. By the Lord’s grace, I have been with my wife for close to thirty years, and although I dare not say that we have never disagreed, I can say that I have never quarreled with her. This is because I have another person in me, the heavenly God Himself who is my person. When I am displeased or unhappy and try to speak something unpleasant, this person who is in me says, “You may speak, but I won’t speak; you may go to quarrel, but I won’t go.” Thus, I can only say, “Lord, if You won’t go, then I won’t go either.” Then the Lord may say, “Wonderful! Since you won’t go, stay here and I will be with you.” In this way I have a sweet fellowship with the Lord. Instead of quarreling, there is only prayer, the prayer of two persons praying together. I pray and He prays with me; He prays in my prayer. What an enjoyment this is! This is to live and walk by the person in us.<p>According to what we are naturally, we are from different countries and different races. We may even be enemies of one another because of our cultural backgrounds or for historical reasons. However, in the church life all enmities have been resolved. Regardless of what kind of people we are naturally, we all have one life and one person through regeneration. We have all been born of the heavenly Father; therefore, we are one. This is a characteristic of the church. In the church there are no differences among colors or races, and neither is there any separation due to language or culture. We have all become one in Christ. We were all baptized into one Body, and we all have one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father (1 Cor. 12:13; Eph. 4:4-6). Now we must stand on the ground of oneness in each locality to be the unique testimony of the Body of Christ and live the practical church life.
