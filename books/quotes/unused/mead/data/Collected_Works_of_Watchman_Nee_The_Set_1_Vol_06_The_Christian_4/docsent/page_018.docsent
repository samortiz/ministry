   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>He was a sinner v.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His own conscience accused him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everything he did was against God's laws.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He could not keep God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His thoughts were filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His eyes beheld things that should not be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His mouth spoke things that should not be spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His hands did evil and his feet walked in wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was totally filled with lusts and all things of ungodliness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He only knew how to take advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was a miser; he only cared to fill his own bag.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not care for anything, much less righteousness or morality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He turned his ear away from the cries of orphans and widows.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as he accumulated thousands and tens of thousands for his wealth, he did not care whether others were sinking in the mire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His deeds, behavior, and motives were all against God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In brief, he was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Lord Jesus said that this tax collector was justified and that sinners can go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>O sinners of this world, you know that you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You think that you are incurable and not worthy to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you examine your own thoughts and behavior, your conscience condemns your sins and convinces you that you deserve to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Dear sinners, let me say that you do not have to be disappointed or worry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus said that the wicked can go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh, distressed ones, you do not have to be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though you are a sinner, sinners can obtain eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You cannot save yourself, but you can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way of salvation is in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Come and receive His salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Pharisee said he was "not like the rest of men extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector" v. 11 . From this statement, we can deduce that this tax collector was an extortioner, an unjust person, an adulterer, and one with all kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This tax collector usurped power to oppress and extort people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything he did was full of injustice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In his house there were articles which he owned illegally; he had used crafty methods to obtain them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He committed adultery, sinning against his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He got involved in all kinds of unclean things and committed all kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus judged and said that this tax collector could go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From a worldly point of view, this type of sinner deserves more than perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to worldly judgment, nice people should go to heaven and evil ones to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we made the decision, only good people would be saved and wicked people would perish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we made the decision, the Pharisee would certainly receive eternal life, and the tax collector would be sentenced to condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fortunately, there is no room for men to say anything regarding salvation and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fortunately, it is our Lord Jesus Christ who set the rule by saying that good people should go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since the evil ones can go to heaven, we have a chance to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are very few good people in the world; all are sinners Rom 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If only good people can be saved, then how many will be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Will not all perish?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fortunately, the Lord Jesus made the rule that sinners can go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we sinners have the hope of being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once I took the Lien Shien Steamer from Shanghai back to Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I shared the gospel with a well-known businessman from Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I told him the gospel of the Lord Jesus' vicarious death and His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He answered by saying, "What Confucius said was the best: One who sins against heaven shall not be forgiven.'</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>" I asked him, "Sir, according to what you have heard and seen, how many people have not sinned against heaven?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was silent for a while and answered, "I am afraid that there is not one!"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I asked, "Very well then, since all have sinned against heaven, can anyone be forgiven?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If this is so, what else can be said?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are all here waiting to be sentenced."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He could say nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yes, we all are sinners and should perish.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But God is full of grace; He has the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although everyone thinks that they have sinned against heaven and cannot be forgiven, God has bestowed grace upon everyone who has sinned against heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He has prepared a Savior to die for them to redeem them so all sinners can have a chance to be saved and go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, sinners, come quickly and receive God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The evil can go to heaven; this is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This tax collector was a most wicked person.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Does this mean that we should commit sins and become evildoers in order to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Does this mean that we can sin as we please in order to obtain salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No, absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord Jesus said that sinners can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He did not say that sinners would be saved because they commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By himself, a sinner will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If he relies on a third party, he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Now we want to see the reason why this tax collector, who had committed such sins, could actually be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this way we, who are sinners like him, can learn from him and obtain salvation, so that evildoers like us can also go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although he was sold to sin, he was not proud before God and did not presume that he had anything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord Jesus said that he humbled himself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Scriptures say that "God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble" James 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He knew his own deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He knew he had nothing to boast about.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He saw his many defects.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He knew he deserved to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>So he humbled himself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When he came to the temple of God, he stood "at a distance, and would not even lift up his eyes to heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He knew that God is most holy and most righteous and that a person like him was unworthy of coming close to God or looking to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He had no good works to report to God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He knew he could not save himself, so he came to God for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>"God...gives grace to the humble."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you are proud, thinking you have everything and are short of nothing, may the Spirit open the eyes of your heart so that you will see all your shortcomings and come to God for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you know your shortcomings, I hope you will not be proud and deceive yourself and end up perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Pride has misled many to not believe in the Savior, and therefore, they perished.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I hope that pride will not mislead you!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He prayed before God, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!" v. 13 . He was not like the Pharisee who despised "the rest," speaking about the sins of others.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He confessed that he himself was a sinner: "me, the sinner!"</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>How hard it is for men to utter these words!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Men are willing to admit that "all have sinned" Rom 3:23 , but are not willing to say "I have sinned."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Men are willing to admit and say that all are sinners Rom 3:10-12 , but they are not willing to say "me, the sinner!"</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Saying this is very shameful!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This tax collector put himself in the position of a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is the position that everyone who wants to go to heaven should and must put himself.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Let me say, if there is a saved person in this world, that person must be a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>No one who is not a sinner can go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you go to heaven and ask those who are already there about their past qualifications, they will unanimously answer and say that they all were sinners in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Everyone who is in heaven is a saved sinner who has received grace.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>They have nothing special.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Heaven is specifically prepared for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If one does not confess himself that he is a sinner, he has no qualification to enter into heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Heaven only welcomes tax collectors and harlots.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All the sinners who believe in the Lord Jesus may come!</S>
