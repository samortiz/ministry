Watchman Nee gave a series of studies on the characters of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the early part of 1940
These messages were published in Chinese in 1955 by the Taiwan Gospel Bookroom under the title, The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
He gave Isaac the experience of knowing the enjoyment of the Son, showing that everything the Son has is from the Father
He gave Jacob the experience of the discipline of the Holy Spirit to deal with his natural life and constitute Christ into him
In publishing this book, we hope that the readers will find spiritual meaning in the experience of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in God's Word
In this book we will consider the way God deals with His people; in other words, the way God edifies His people
Putting it another way, this book will show the kind of experience we must acquire before we can become the people of God
Abraham was a definite beginning for God's people, and the nation of Israel was also a definite beginning for God's people
He did something in Abraham first giving him some particular experiences and through him He conveyed these experiences to all of His people
The dealings which these three received before God and the experiences they went through culminated in a people of God
In other words, all the people of God should have the element of Abraham, the element of Isaac, and the element of Jacob in them
To say that Abraham is our ancestor is not enough, because Ishmael and his descendants can also say that their ancestor is Abraham
Neither is it enough to say that both Abraham and Isaac are our ancestors, because Esau and his descendents can say the same thing
If you know that God is the Father, you will not be so confident and will not say that you can do whatever you want
The history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in Genesis 11 through 50 shows us that Isaac was an ordinary and unexceptional man
We know that everything we have comes by receiving and that if we do not receive anything, we will be left with vanity and emptiness
The activity of the flesh is still present, the power of the soul is still present, and the natural life is still present
It does not mean that Jacob represents the Holy Spirit, but that his experiences represent the work of the Holy Spirit
He supplanted his brother with a pottage of lentils and usurped the birthright but he not his brother eventually had to run away from home
All these experiences were the discipline of the Holy Spirit; they were the trials that a clever man had to go through
The more a person deceives, the more he does not trust in others, because he judges others according to his own heart
You will acknowledge that you dare not serve God anymore and that you are not qualified to serve Him any longer!
One day the Lord will come to us, touch us, and twist the hollow of our thigh; He will deal with our natural life
God has to touch our natural life in a drastic way; He has to break apart our natural life and show us that we can do nothing by ourselves
Being lame does not mean that we cannot walk; rather, it means that every time we walk, we realize our weakness and our lameness
All those who are still resourceful, confident, and powerful have not experienced the discipline of the Holy Spirit
We have mentioned previously that God desires to gain a group of men who are called by His name and who are His people
The experiences of Abraham plus Isaac plus Jacob are the basic experiences of all who desire to be God's people
The basic experiences for being God's people are the experiences of Abraham, the experiences of Isaac, and the experiences of Jacob
May the Lord open our eyes to see that Abraham is the starting point in God's plan of redemption and in His work of recovery
Although these three men were good, they were good men as individuals only; they could not change the sinful situation
The tide of sin had been going on, and Abel, Enoch, and Noah were just three good rocks in the midst of this sinful torrent
We should carefully consider the items included in the calling of Abraham and the kind of things brought about through such a calling
God called Abraham with the purpose that he would get out of his country, and from his kindred, and from his father's house
God called Abraham to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house and go to a land that He would show him
God called Abraham so that he would go into Canaan, live there, express God, and carry out the authority of the heavens
Through him and his descendants, God intended to claim the land for Himself and to carry out His authority and express His glory in the land
Today the church should be the place where God's glory is expressed and the place where His authority and will are carried out
God wants to gain a way among men so that His authority and His will can be done on earth as they are done in heaven
Rabshakeh, a general of the king of Assyria, the enemy of the children of Israel, said, 'Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad?
From this man there was a family, and from that family a nation, and from that nation all the families of the earth are blessed
God fully deposited His grace, power, and authority into this one man, and then through this one man dispensed all these things to all men
He brought one man to the point of believing so that he would be a believer; from this believer many more believers were begotten
That kind of preaching will only make men understand doctrines, and the doctrines will pass from one mouth to another
What good will it do for a man to zealously preach the doctrine of salvation if he himself does not know God and is not begotten of God?
Stephen said, 'The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran'
The calling of Noah to enter the ark was a matter of salvation, but the calling of Abraham to enter Canaan was a matter of ministry
It was right for Noah to bring his whole family into the ark, but it was wrong for Abraham to bring his father's house into Canaan
If God has called us to be His minister and His vessel, we cannot bring along those who do not have the calling
We have to remember that a cheap vessel comes with a cheap price, while an expensive vessel comes with an expensive price
We have to remember that God trains every person in a special way because He wants to use that person in a special way
He wanted to leave his father's house, but it was too difficult for him, and he ended up taking it along with him
Terah was only a hindrance to Abraham while he was alive, but Lot became a burden to God's people even after his death
It is hard for us to forget our salvation story, but it is easy for us to forget the vision of our calling to the ministry
God appeared and spoke once more so that Abraham would have a clear and fresh impression of the things God had committed to him
Many times, when we have too much to do and the work becomes a little more hectic, we lose sight of our spiritual calling
The Bible shows us that God's power is not only a miraculous power, but the power of life; it is a power which satisfies man
With such a vessel, the first need is not to be taught doctrines; the first need is to be satisfied and to acquire the power of life
God is not after hundreds and thousands of strong but uncoordinated men like Samson and He is not after a pile of unorganized living stones
A few particularly gifted gospel preachers will not fulfill such a purpose, nor will a few capable revivalists do the job
God has not saved us only to be proper Christians, but to be God's house and one Body together with all His children
Unfortunately, many Christians love their personal liberty and are very good at preserving their personal liberty!
The problem is that many Christians consider the Body of Christ merely as a principle; they have not seen the life of the Body of Christ
If we do not know that the Body is a life, and if we merely act according to a principle, we are only imitating in an outward way
They have heard that they should not act independently and that they should cooperate with others, and they try to practice cooperation
In other words, unless a Christian is dealt with in his fleshly life, he cannot possibly know the Body of Christ
One begins his experience of the Body of Christ and enjoys and lives out the Body life by dealing with the life of the flesh
The only reason we cannot be joined to the other brothers and sisters is that the life of our old creation is too strong
For those Christians who have not passed through the judgment of the old creation, the old creation is a boast to them
Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord'
Only when they bear these three characteristics will they be able to offer up burnt offerings, and only then will God accept the sacrifice
It is easy for us to take the knowledge we have heard as our own and convey it to others, but this has no spiritual value
When we find out what power is before the Lord and acquire some spiritual experience, it is easy for us to become disobedient
If we truly see the life of the Body, we will see that there is restriction in the house of God, and we will not move freely
If God's children do not know the meaning of God's house, they will not be able to fellowship with God's other children
Whoever cannot honor the other brothers and cannot render them their due respect, praise, and position has not seen the house of God
What was terrible and wrong was not the meeting but the brother; he did not take his stand in the house of God
After Abraham arrived in Canaan, the Bible shows us that he was tested three times concerning the land of Canaan
Verse 10 says And there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land
After his failure in Egypt, Abraham learned one lesson: He realized the importance of Canaan and knew that it was wrong to lie or deceive
Genesis 13:1-3 says, 'And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south
He went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai'
After he learned the lesson of defeat in Egypt, he realized that Canaan was the only place of value, and he returned
The land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together
We must realize that those who have been called to be the ministers cannot bring along those who have not been called by God
On the other hand, God had to teach him the lesson that there is no need to use fleshly methods to hold on to God's promised land of Canaan
Genesis 13:10-12 says, 'And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where
Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other
Although the result of Abraham's faith in God put him on the hilly terrain, he was nevertheless in the land of Canaan
Our vindication comes from our trust in God; it does not depend on our holding on to anything with fleshly means
Verse 18 says Then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre which is in Hebron and built there an altar unto the Lord
While Lot was choosing the plain of Jordan, Abraham might have overcome outwardly, but might not have overcome inwardly
Inwardly he might have hoped that Lot would act according to his conscience and would not be so shrewd as to take the best portions
Genesis 14:11-12 says, 'And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way
When Abraham heard the news about his nephew's captivity, he did not say, 'I knew that he should not have gone to such a place
Lot was an ordinary man in Mesopotamia, he was an ordinary man when he reached Haran, and he was an ordinary man after he reached Canaan
Lot had no virtue except his sorrow over the licentious manner of life of the lawless ; he had no testimony other than this one
Only those who stand on the ground of Hebron, that is, the ground of fellowship, can engage in spiritual warfare
Even if our brother has wronged us, we should still consider him our brother, and we should still pray for him and help him unreservedly
When Abraham defeated the enemy and took back Lot from the hand of the enemy, it would have been very easy for him to become proud
It would have been very easy for him to have had an expression of contempt on his face, as if Lot owed him something for such a deliverance
After he slaughtered Chedorlaomer and the other kings, he met Melchizedek at the valley of Shaveh, which was the king's dale
After he won the victory, he did not meet others at the height of the city wall, but at the bottom of a humble valley
Because a man stood on earth for God, Melchizedek was able to proclaim God as the possessor of heaven and earth
It was very meaningful for God to reassure Abraham with such a word even though he had just come back from a victory
We have to realize that Abraham was only a man, and his victory was the victory of a man; it was not a superhuman victory
Abraham realized that none of his three hundred eighteen trained servants nor Eliezer of Damascus could solve this problem
God asked Abraham if he could count the stars in heaven and told him that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars
God then told him that only he who came forth out of his own bowels would be his heir, and that his seed would be as the stars in heaven
He took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not'
Verse 12 says, 'And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him'
Even if we can give a message on the cross, it will not produce any spiritual effect unless we are first dealt with by the cross
You have not failed because you cannot speak, you are not powerful enough, or you are not familiar enough with the Scripture
Consequently, we need the Lord to bring a smoking furnace to pass through the pieces in order to conduct a purifying work in us
Before there is the smoking furnace, there must first be the cross, and before there is the burning lamp, there must also be the cross
A person who has not passed through death may be very clever and knowledgeable; others may think that his words are very intelligent
It is easy to preach the doctrine of the cross, but these verses show us that only those who know and experience the cross can stand for God
Only by going through the way of the cross will we inherit the land and only then will we be able to live for God continuously on this earth
In Galatians 316 Paul said He does not say And to the seeds as concerning many but as concerning one And to your seed who is Christ
The glorious Christ will be brought in only when a group of people believe as Abraham believed; only then will God's work be accomplished
What is important is that the church brings in Christ and expresses Christ on earth for the recovery of all God's work on earth
In other words, the church must be tested and prepared before it can bring back the glorious Christ to the earth
Just before these events God promised him again, 'He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir'
Hebrews 4:10 says, 'For he who has entered into His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His own'
The most regrettable thing that we can do is to teach God's Word, preach God's truth, and exercise God's gift by ourselves
Whether or not our spiritual work is pure depends on how much of the work comes out of God and how much of it comes out of the self
Since Abraham wanted a son he should have realized that God is the Father and should have allowed Him to be the Father laying himself aside
In other words, if we want Christ to inherit the land and if we want to stand for God, we should not try to bring Him in by ourselves
Unfortunately, it is easy to exhort men to forsake sin, but it is not easy to exhort men to forsake self-effort
For as the heavens are higher than the earth,/So are My ways higher than your ways,/And My thoughts higher than your thoughts'
Although He has lowered Himself and is willing to use us we have to remember that we are merely servants whom He uses as vessels in His hand
Galatians 3:10 says, 'Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things written in the book of the law to do them'
Whether or not we please God depends on whether the cross has done its work in dealing with our flesh and the natural life
It is very interesting that God wanted him to be a father, yet at the same time, He wanted him to see that he was not the Father
The Lord cannot really use us and we cannot really manifest Christ or uphold God's testimony on earth until we are a hundred years old
If we are like Hagar, there is no need for us to wait, but if we would be like Sarah, there is a need for us to wait
In spiritual work it is not a matter of how much we do, but a matter of how much we have gained of the Lord's work
We can say that Ishmael includes two characteristics: the first is a wrong source, and the second is a premature timing
Even if we can say a few words or do a few things, and even if these things appear to be of God, He will not be pleased with them
At that time God spoke to Abraham in a vision: 'He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir'
God also brought Abraham forth abroad and asked him to look toward heaven and number the stars and said to him, 'So shall thy seed be'
Although he considered his own body as being already dead and his wife's womb as being deadened, he did not doubt in unbelief
There was a time lapse of over ten years, but God was still teaching Abraham the same lesson the lesson of faith
God promised Abraham a son, but Abraham did not wait on God for his son; he married a concubine and gave birth to a son Ishmael
Although chapter fifteen tells us that he believed, there does not seem to have been too much pursuing on his part
Although he backslid for thirteen years and although God did not speak to him during all that time, He was working all the time
God showed him that if he believed in God as the all-sufficient One, he had to walk before Him as a perfect man
Those who were eight days old, whether they were born in the house or bought with money of any stranger had to be circumcised
God told Abraham, 'The uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people'
If the flesh is not dealt with, one cannot be of God's people and cannot maintain His testimony or participate in His recovery work
Romans 7 shows us that the flesh exerts great effort to keep the law, to do good, to do God's will, and to please God
Such people do not realize that God is concerned not merely with changing their goals, but with terminating their flesh
We must see that circumcision is the cutting off of the flesh, the very flesh that begets Ishmael, the flesh that tries to please God
Although their person may remain, they have learned to fear God and no longer put their trust and confidence in themselves
God's people have a characteristic, a mark, which is the denial of the flesh, the rejection of confidence in the flesh
They brag again and again about this and that kind of experience that they had on certain days of certain months
They can talk about what God has told them to speak or pray at such and such a place and at such and such a time
We have to remember that Gods work may not be with us when we are victorious and Gods work may not be altogether absent from us when we fail
It is strange that in easy situations, it is hard to believe in God, while in hard situations, it is easy to believe in God
Now he was brought to the point where he considered his body as being already dead and his wife's womb as being deadened
His faith now was based on God alone because all his strength was gone, and there was nothing left in him; everything was finished
Abraham's circumcision was his acknowledgment that he was through, that his flesh absolutely could not make it
These three things are intimately related, and they are the special enjoyment of a Christian who has been following the Lord for many years
And he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him'
Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth
Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it
He took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat'
Genesis 20:1 says, 'And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar'
Yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife
In Mesopotamia he thought that he and Sarah could be separated, and that during times of peril the couple could become brother and sister
It is interesting that 'the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife'
Although his wife and the women in Abimelech's house were the same and could not bear children, he prayed for the women of Abimelech's house
Only one who did not think about himself and did not consider himself could have prayed for the women of Abimelech's house on that day
God is our Father, and His relationship with the believers is a father-son relationship; this is very intimate
When they hear about the flesh and what it means, they dare not do anything any longer, and they cease their work altogether
It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again'
Whenever we try to do something, we are 'entangled with a yoke of slavery again' and become sons of the maidservant
After Abraham cast out Ishmael, even Abimelech, who had rebuked him once, came to him and said, 'God is with thee in all that thou doest'
It was not just a matter of sacrificing Abraham's beloved son, but a matter of God's own promise, goal, and work
It is wrong to acquire something by the flesh, but it is equally wrong to hold on to what is acquired through the promise with fleshly hands
When our hands pick up the gift, we become satisfied with the gift in our hands, and we stop fellowshipping with God
We have to realize that we are related to God Himself; we are not related to the things which God is about to do
One day God will speak to us, and after He speaks again and again, we will find that we can no longer escape, and we will say, 'All right
We have to realize that God allows our work to fail miserably because He does not want us to have any direct relationship with the work
God wants us to realize that we can sacrifice Isaac but we cannot sacrifice God, because only God is the Father!
It is true that he did not kill Isaac and that Isaac did not die but Hebrews 1119 says that from which he also received him back in figure
He knew God as the Father, the Initiator of everything, who calls things not being as being and gives life to the dead
At this point everything with Abraham was directly related to God; he was not related to Isaac in any direct way
Everything that comes from resurrection is preserved by God, and we cannot hold on to it with our fleshly hands
We have to learn to thank the Lord for calling us to His work and also learn to thank Him for calling us to not work
Natural things are the things that we can grasp hold of, while we cannot grasp hold of the things in resurrection
We have to see that everything we have is of God and that anything that is of God cannot become our own private possession
God's vessels and ministers must be those who are before the Lord, who have passed through His dealings, and who have much experience
If a man is naturally clever and has a good memory, others will say that he is quite good and promising in God's service
By that time, he had become a vessel, and God was able to say, 'In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed'
Just as he had to go through these experiences, all those who are of faith must go through the same experiences
God wants us to be His vessels for the fulfillment of His own plan; He wants us to have a part in His recovery work
There was still the need of Isaac and Jacob to be added to Abraham before God could gain what He intended to gain in Abraham
In other words, we need the experience of Abraham, and we need the experience of Isaac and the experience of Jacob as well
In order to be a corporate vessel, one has to know God as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
As soon as God was called the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the nation of Israel appeared
Later he was called Abraham, which also means 'father,' but in a more superlative form; it means the father of many nations
As far as God's selection is concerned, he was the first to be chosen as one of God's people, and therefore, he was also the father
As far as his acts were concerned, he was the first one to cross the river, and therefore, he was also a father
Have we heard of anyone who communicated with God and who was so intimate with God that he was called a friend of God?
Have we heard of anyone who had a son when he was a hundred years old, and who later offered the son as a sacrifice?
Not only was the Lord Jesus born apart from the flesh, but He was an only begotten Son, One who was the beloved of His Father
The church is according to the Lord's will; it is begotten of God and belongs to the same household of the Lord Jesus
Unlike Abraham, who did many things which had never been done before, Isaac only did what others had already accomplished
In Genesis 21 Ishmael was mocking on the day Isaac was weaned, but we do not see any record of what Isaac did when he was young
God commanded Abraham to cast out the first son and put the second son on the altar, but He did not command Isaac to do this
Genesis 24:36 says, 'And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath'
If we stopped here, we would think that God had established a direct relationship with Isaac and had made a covenant with him
He did not realize that Christians are Christians by virtue of who they are; they do not act out the Christian life
The problem with God's children is that they realize God's demand on Abraham, but they do not see the way to meet this demand
They do not realize that the Christian life, the overcoming life of freedom and sanctification, is obtained and not attained
When Abraham was about to offer up Isaac to God, Isaac only asked one question: 'Where is the lamb for the burnt offering'?
The God of Isaac means that all of God's demands, expectations, and standards which He set forth in Abraham are fulfilled by God alone
In other words, in Isaac we see God supplying Christ to us, while in Jacob we see the Holy Spirit disciplining us
Isaac shows us the meaning of the enjoyment of the overcoming life, while Jacob shows us the meaning of the dealing of the natural life
Unfortunately, some Christians have been dealt with by God tens and even hundreds of times, yet they have not received a mortal blow
If we want to see everything that is in Christ being perfected in us, we must make sure that nothing in us comes from the natural life
We need a vision before God like Abraham had, we need a life like Isaac had, and we need the discipline of the Holy Spirit like Jacob had
If we know the God of Isaac, we will have the confidence to say, 'But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ'
As a result, they mistakenly regard things that pertain to the natural life as manifestations of the overcoming life
Just as God revealed Himself to Abraham and became the God of Abraham, He has to reveal Himself to us to become our God
Just as He revealed Himself to Isaac and became the God of Isaac, He has to reveal Himself to us to become our God
Just as He revealed Himself to Jacob and became the God of Jacob, He has to reveal Himself to us to become our God
On the other hand, the book of Galatians tells us that after a man is saved by grace, he should go on in grace
Romans tells us that a Christian begins by grace, while Galatians tells us that a Christian continues in grace
Our being in Christ has to do with the facts that are in Christ, while Christ being in us has to do with the life of Christ
If we only know that we are in Christ, but do not know that Christ is in us, we will be weak and empty, and everything will be theoretical
The first three chapters of Romans show us that our conduct is wrong, while chapters five through eight show us that our person is wrong
God transfers us out of the old position and puts us in a new position in heaven so that we can live before God
With death, resurrection, and ascension, everything we have in Adam is terminated and we can have a new beginning
Our codeath coresurrection and coascension with Christ are not something that we worked out but something that God accomplished in Christ
If we look at ourselves in Christ and believe in the word of 1 Corinthians 1:30, we will surely say, 'Thank and praise the Lord
In spite of their repeated efforts, they find that they are still not dead and that their hopes have still not come to pass
The self that we cannot change and the old man that we have tried to shake off have been crucified on the cross by the Lord already!
Thank the Lord that He has given us not only Christ and the power of Christ, but even more the experience of Christ
Not only do we partake of the divine nature but we partake of the nature of the Son of God and we share in the experience of the Son of God
If we want to live out the Christian life and satisfy God's heart, the way is for us to no longer live, but for Christ to live in us
The second part of the verse says, 'Who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
Sanctification was originally a condition, but the sanctification that God gives us is not a condition but a person
If we want to go on, we have to commit ourselves to the Almighty God and allow Him to reveal Himself to us as the Father at the proper time
We have to see that nothing from ourselves will satisfy His heart and that everything must be of Him, because only God is the Father
One day the Lord will open our eyes to see that everything is of Christ and from God and that everything has been accomplished by Christ
The knowledge of the God of Isaac gives us the confidence to know that everything is done by Christ and not by ourselves
The God of Jacob works in us to make room for the God of Isaac so that Christ will gain a place and occupy more and more ground in us
On the one hand, we are bold to testify and speak, but on the other hand, we are fearful of speaking anything and feel like dust before Him
Every careful reader of the Word of God cannot fail to find a great difference between the history of Isaac and the history of Jacob
On the other hand, the Holy Spirit continually works in us and disciplines us because of the presence of our natural life
Isaac shows that we are received by God's grace as sons, while Jacob shows that we are disciplined by Him as sons
On the one hand, God shows us that our life is like Isaac's; it is full and smooth, and everything that is in the Lord becomes ours
On the other hand, He leads us to partake of His holiness so that Christ may be formed in us and the Holy Spirit may bear fruit through us
When we read the history of Jacob in his old age, we see that his seventeen years in Egypt were his richest years
On the other hand, we have to observe the way that God wrought the nature of Christ into him through the Holy Spirit
It began from the time he left his fathersinlaw house in Padanaram journeying through Peniel Shechem and Bethel until he arrived in Hebron
God's Word shows that Jacob was not only wrong in the things he did; he was wrong in the kind of person he was
Not only did he dishonor God's name in the things that he did, but as a person he brought dishonor to God's name
At that time Esau was very tired and answered carelessly, 'I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me'?
Jacob, under his mother's guidance, took advantage of the weakness of his father's old age and feeble eyesight
He put on Esau's clothes, took skins of the kids of the goats, made savory meat, and received the blessing, thus deceiving his father
Through operating in Jacob's environment, God chipped off a corner here and a corner there; He carved a little here and a little there
An unconditional promise means that God would always have a way to deal with Jacob whether he was good or bad, honest or cunning
He saw that in trying to gain the blessing by guile, he ended up with no food and clothing, and he lost his father's house
Genesis 29 tells us that Jacob went to the land of the people of the east and saw the shepherds who came from Haran
When he arrived at his uncle Labans house his uncle said to him Surely thou art my bone and my flesh and Jacob abode with him for a month
A person who likes to take advantage of others may often come across another person who equally likes to take advantage of others
Laban was saying that Jacob should not eat his food for free, that he should work a little, and that he would be given a little money
He put Jacob in the house of Laban, a man who was as crafty, clever, and shrewd as he was, so that Jacob would be dealt with
Originally, Jacob was a merciless person, but after he was disciplined by God, he became a kind and loving person in his old age
May we see that all our experiences in our environments are measured one by one by the Holy Spirit according to our need
While we are passing through these disciplines and trials, we may not feel joyful or comfortable, but they are all part of God's work in us
Let us consider the third section of Jacob's history, which covers the way his natural life was broken through God's dealings
He had already had eleven sons, but this was the first time that God spoke to him since the time He spoke to him in the dream at Bethel
The night before he caught up with Jacob, God spoke to Laban in a dream: 'Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad'
God would not allow Laban to say anything, because He was leading Jacob out of the place of trial and was taking him home
When Jacob took hold of his brother's heel and coveted the birthright and blessing, he was not after God, but after the goodness from God
God opened his eyes to see that his company of people on earth was one camp while Gods army was another camp hence there were the two camps
Let us read verses 3 through 5: 'And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom
Those whose flesh is not dealt with can only trust in their own planning and scheming; they cannot trust in God or believe in Him
Originally, Jacob had one band on earth and God had one band in heaven, but now Jacob divided his band into two
He could not cast away his trust in God, because God had spoken to him, but he considered it very risky to trust in God completely
He commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou?
Thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us
So commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau when ye find him
He seemed to have forgotten God's promises, and at the same time, it appeared that he had not forgotten them completely
God wrestled with Jacob in order to subdue him, strip him of his strength, and pin him down so that he could not struggle any longer
Many brothers and sisters have believed in the Lord for many years, but they have to admit that God has never prevailed over them
It is unfortunate that many brothers and sisters have been under God's discipline repeatedly and still are not defeated
They think that they did not plan well enough the first time, and that they have to design a better plan the second or third time
Many people have repeatedly experienced God's discipline, but their natural life has never been dealt with in a thorough way
They think that by experiencing God's discipline frequently, they are accumulating a rich spiritual history for themselves
Brothers and sisters, perhaps God has been wrestling with you for five or ten years but has not yet prevailed over you
It is true that Jacob was very capable and that his fleshly life and natural energy were stronger than anyone else's
He was afraid that his wives and children would be killed by his brother, and therefore, he put on the best performance of his life
He prepared his gifts put some of each kind in each company and asked the servants to walk in front and separate the companies by a distance
Some Christians can say that they are wrong in this and that, but the wrongs they mention are actually not the crux of the problem
There may be deeper problems which are not yet manifested, and God has not yet been provided the opportunity to expose them
Some Christians have their natural strength lodged in their emotions, while others have their natural strength lodged within their self-love
Every aspect of his life is under the influence of this spot, and this spot can be considered as the hollow of his thigh
Their so-called 'testimonies' are actually not testimonies for the Lord, but a kind of self-boasting and self-manifestation
They always think and reason when others speak to them; they always judge whether or not something is rational or justifiable
God provides many opportunities in which this natural strength is exposed once, twice, ten times, or even a hundred times
One day, at the crossing at Jabbok, you will have exhausted your ability and the very seat of your natural life will be exposed
It is an uncomely sight for a child of God to pretend to be spiritual; it frustrates his natural life from being dealt with
With many Christians, it would be better for them to speak of worldly things because they would at least be somewhat genuine
Many Christians appear very meek but one cannot help but pray Lord forgive this mans meekness we do not know where this meekness comes from
We have to be thoroughly clear that there is a big difference between anything that comes from ourselves and anything that comes from God
Do not think that just because you are exuberant when you pray, your natural life has been dealt with by the Lord
One thing we do know: Whenever we are touched by the Lord, we are no longer free in our walk; we are no longer as convenient as before
Originally, we were so capable of speaking about this and that kind of thing; we had lofty words and high sounding phrases
Originally we were shrewd and resourceful; we knew what to do about this person and what to do about that person
After God has touched our natural life, we will feel that something within is gone when we try to supplant others; something within us wilts
We know that we will obtain a certain kind of result if we say a certain word, but we are afraid of reaping that result
If we go on according to our natural strength, we will feel cold inside, and something within us will refuse to go along
When we are weak, we become strong, and when we are crippled, we turn back to God and say, 'I will not let You go'
The story of Jacob shows us that when his natural life was touched, he was still not very clear about what had happened
Those who have passed through the experience of Peniel will not be able to tell others very clearly about the doctrine of it
They can only say that they are not as strong as they once were, and that they are not as confident as they once were
All we have to do is look to the Lord and believe that one day, subconsciously the sinew of our thigh hollow will be touched
Let us read Genesis 33:1-3: 'And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men
He put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost
Verse 4 says, 'And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept'
Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves
Every time we see their face we will be reminded of God, and every time we come across their way we will come across judgment
And Jacob came to Shalem a city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan when he came from Padanaram and pitched his tent before the city
He bought a parcel of a field spread his tent and erected an altar in Shechem and called it ElEloheIsrael which means God the God of Israel
In chapter thirtyfour Jacobs daughter was defiled in that land and two of his sons plotted and killed Shechem and all the males of the city
These three places carry the characteristics of Canaan; they are in fact a representation of the land of Canaan
After Peniel, God intended to take Jacob on the path of Abraham, first to Shechem, then to Bethel, and finally to Hebron
We have mentioned earlier that Bethel means the house of God; it signifies the authority of Christ, that Christ is ruling over His house
In other words, they had to leave behind everything that was related to the idols before they could go up to Bethel
In other words, Christ deals with our idols and our sins, and Christ deals with all the things which we cannot deal with
The oak of Shechem speaks of the riches of Isaac; it shows us that everything contrary to us is dealt with there
God demands not only that we have a clean living individually, but that we also have a clean living corporately
The Body of Christ is Christ, and only Christ can remain in His Body; everything else must be left behind in Shechem
After Jacob trusted in the power of the Lord and removed all the things that did not glorify Him, he set out on his journey
Verses 6 and 7 say, 'So Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him
He built there an altar, and called the place El-bethel; because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother'
Thank and praise the Lord that God is not heaping up piles of isolated stones; He is building a house that expresses Him
Let us read verses 9 and 10: 'And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him
God said unto him Thy name is Jacob thy name shall not be called any more Jacob but Israel shall be thy name and he called his name Israel
When Jacob met God previously, he erected a stone to be a pillar, poured oil on it, and called the name of the place the house of God
The taste of praise which comes after the flesh is dealt with is something which one can never experience prior to being dealt with
Verse 27 says, 'And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned'
The Scripture purposely records that 'she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth'
It came to pass, as her soul was in departing, that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin
In the third stage of his history, we saw that God not only disciplined him, but also dealt with his being and his natural life
Even after his natural life had been thoroughly dealt with, we see that the discipline of God was still upon him
The section from chapter thirty-seven to the end of Jacob's old age may be considered the fourth stage of Jacob's history
We may also say that this was the period of the maturing of Jacob, the brightest period in Jacob's entire life
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day'
During this period of almost forty years, Jacob did not do much, yet before God he was transformed fully into a man of grace and love
With the apostle John, who wrote his Gospel, his Epistles, and the book of Revelation during his old age, this shining is most apparent
Even though David sinned, his ending was better than his beginning; he ended by preparing for the building of the temple
If we compare Jacob with Isaac and Abraham we may say that Jacobs ending was better than that of Abraham and much better than that of Isaac
Beginning from chapter thirty-seven, he only occasionally came forward to speak a few words or to take care of something
The most outstanding characteristic of a person whose flesh has been dealt with by God is the cessation of fleshly activities
He never expected that Joseph would be sold or that his sons would deceive him by showing him Joseph's many-colored coat dipped in blood
Genesis 37:33 says, 'And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces'
The next verses say, 'And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days
His words, 'if it must be so now, do this,' indicate that Jacob was now softened and was able to listen to others
He agreed to let Benjamin go saying And God Almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin
Formerly he was a capable, cunning, and supplanting person, but now he had been transformed into a soft, tender, and loving person
If he had been the Jacob of twenty or forty years earlier, he probably would have severely scolded his sons under such circumstances
My father Isaac wanted to go down to Egypt when he met famine, but God appeared and warned him that he should not go down to Egypt
When he sent Benjamin to Joseph he said God Almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin
He became fearful; therefore, he rose up unto Beer-sheba 'and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac'
Genesis 47:7 says, 'And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh'
Although to the world, Pharaoh's position was high, Jacob knew that there was nothing lofty about it spiritually
Genesis 47:28-30 says, 'And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred forty and seven years
It is interesting to note that while Jacob was in the land of Egypt, he never told his son what kind of dwelling or living he wanted
He did not remember how he competed with his brother, how he gained the birthright, or how he took his brother's blessing, etc
Thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance
When he blessed Joseph's two sons, he laid his right hand on Ephraim's head and his left hand on Manasseh's head
It was not easy for him to speak this way because as he talked about their past, it reminded him of his own past
We only need to consider one thing to find out the great difference between this person and the Jacob of the past
Now he mentioned it in another way: 'Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations
He thought, 'What shall we do if the race of Shechem rises up and takes revenge on us for what you have done'?
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward'
His prophecy concerning Dan's future was not that good; Dan would be serpentine in every respect and much rebellion would come out of him
To be the vessel in God's recovery work, the church needs to know the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
If we want to know the God of Jacob, we have to know the constitution by the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit
The constitution of the Spirit means that the Spirit constitutes Christ into our being to the point that we and Christ become one
The constitution of the Spirit is the constituting of Christ into us to the extent that Christ's character becomes our character
The sanctification in 1 Corinthians 1 is a matter of Christ being our sanctification; Christ is made sanctification to us
Hebrews 12 speaks of the Father of spirits who takes us through disciplines and trials so that we may partake of His holiness
It is wrought out of discipline and produced by the Spirit through all the difficult and adverse environments we encounter
When they eventually become tired of their exhibition, they will spontaneously stop their bragging 'testimonies'
God has not only given Christ to us to be our life, but He is constituting Christ into our being to be our character
Christ being our life is the foundation, while the nature of Christ becoming our nature is the constitution of the Spirit
God uses all kinds of ways to discipline us so that we may partake of His holiness and bring forth the peaceable fruit of righteousness
Jacob not only knew that God is the beginning of everything and the strength behind everything; he also acquired a new character
Galatians 52223 says But the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering kindness goodness faithfulness meekness selfcontrol
God deals with our natural life so that Christ may be formed in us, that is, that Christ may be wrought into us and constituted in us
As a result, when others touched Peter, they realized that his being was changed and that he had become a new person
Not only do we have the Christ given to us by God, but we also need the Christ assimilated by us and then formed in us
The Spirit leads us through many difficulties and environments so that Christ may be constituted into our being
When Christ in us becomes not only the Christ given by God, but the Christ digested and assimilated into us, we become the precious stones
According to God's eternal plan, this signifies that everything comes out of Him and that the Holy Spirit constitutes Christ into us
God wants Christ to be constituted into us, that is, to be digested and assimilated by us and formed in us until we become precious stones
In the new heaven and new earth, God will reach His goal, and there will be only gold and precious stones, but no silver
May God open our eyes to see that in His holy way and according to His plan, He wants to gain some vessels to fulfill His goal
They must also know the God of Isaac; they must know that everything for our enjoyment and inheritance is given to us by Him
