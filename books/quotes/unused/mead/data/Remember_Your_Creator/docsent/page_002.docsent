   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WATCHMEN TREMBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 3 says, "In the day that the watchmen of the house tremble."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a parable, and the house is your body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here your body is compared to a house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This house has watchmen to protect it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These watchmen are your hands and your arms.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You have seen people raise their arms to protect themselves when someone tries to hit them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When people become old, their hands and their arms tremble, they shake.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>MIGHTY MEN STOOP</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the verse says, "And the mighty men stoop."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The watchmen are the hands, and the mighty men are the legs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Young people stand straight and tall, but old ones are bent over because their legs stoop.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have seen old men whose hands tremble and whose legs stoop.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE GRINDING ONES IDLE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"The grinding ones stand idle because they are few."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>People used to have the job of grinding wheat and other grains before they cooked them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the picture in these verses, the teeth are the grinding ones because they grind the food in your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the grinding ones stand idle because they are few.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Old people may lose so many teeth that they have only a few left, one here, one there, and another there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even the ones they have are not useful because they don't have the ones to match them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So the few teeth they have left become idle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that you have become old.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Don't forget God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have to remember Him in your youth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Don't wait until you lose all your teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>GROWING OLD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Those who look through windows grow dim."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your eyes are the windows of your house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As you grow older, your eyes grow dim and your vision is not so keen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The doors on the street are shut as the sound of the grinding mill is low."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because your teeth are missing and you cannot chew very well, you keep your mouth closed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"One will arise at the sound of the bird."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Young people have no trouble sleeping, and they can sleep through anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But old people wake up at the slightest noise, even at the sound of a bird, and they have trouble going back to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"All the daughters of song will sing softly."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Young people like to sing and to shout, but older ones are not able to sing so well or to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The daughters of song are your throat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>FEARS AND TERRORS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Furthermore, men are afraid of a high place."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Grandmothers may be afraid even to climb up to stand on a chair, but little boys often love to climb up on top of the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Boys like to climb on top of anything they can jump off of, but old people are afraid of high places.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Men are afraid of a high place and of terrors on the road."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Young people go anywhere they want without any thought of fear, but old people are frightened by every shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are easily startled, and even traffic on the streets bothers them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"The almond tree blossoms."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Almond blossoms are white, just like the white hair of old people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>REMEMBER YOUR CREATOR NOW</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Remember your Creator while you are young.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Don't wait until you are old.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your arms are not trembling, your legs are not stooping, and your teeth are still complete.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Your eyes are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your mouth can still give sound, and your throat allows you to sing so well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Your hair is still not gray.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You are young, so young.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The number one thing for you to do is to remember your Creator when you are so young.</S>
