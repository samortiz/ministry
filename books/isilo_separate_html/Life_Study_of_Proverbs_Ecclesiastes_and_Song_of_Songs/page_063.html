AND ENJOYMENT IN CHRIST</H2>

<P>The lover is satisfied with the rest and enjoyment in Christ (1:16b-17; 2:3b-7). Satisfaction requires two things&#151;rest and enjoyment. First, we need to rest and then, as we are at rest, we have some enjoyment. The issue of this rest and enjoyment is satisfaction.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. She Being Satisfied</H2>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. With Her Rest in His Feeding Life<br>
as the Resting Place in the Night<br>
in His Embracing and in His Death<br>
and His Resurrection as the Shelter</H2>

<P>She is satisfied with her rest in His feeding life (green) as the resting place in the night (couch) in His embracing (2:6) and in His death (cypresses) and His resurrection (cedars) as the shelter (beams and rafters&#151;1:16b-17). In typology, in figure, a cypress tree signifies Christ's death, and a cedar tree signifies Christ's resurrection, in which His humanity is high and uplifted. Christ's death and resurrection are a shelter with beams and rafters.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. With Her Delighting in Resting<br>
under Him as an Overshadowing Canopy in the Day<br>
and Her Tasting of Him as the Sweet, Timely Supply</H2>

<P>"In his shade I delighted and sat down,/And his fruit was sweet to my taste" (2:3b). This reveals that she is satisfied also with her delighting in resting under Him as an overshadowing canopy in the day (shade&#151;Isa. 4:5-6; 2 Cor. 12:9) and her tasting of Him as the sweet, timely supply (sweet fruit).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. With Triumphant Love Spread<br>
over Her in the Enjoyable Church Life</H2>

<P>"He brought me into the banqueting house,/And his banner over me was love./Sustain me with raisin cakes,/Refresh me with apples,/For I am sick with love" (S.S. 2:4-5). Here the lover is satisfied with triumphant love (banner of love) spread over her in the enjoyable church life (banqueting house), in which she is sustained with Him, Christ, as bread of life (John 6:35&#151;raisin cakes) and refreshed with Him as fruit of life (Rev. 2:7; 22:2&#151;apples) to heal her lovesickness. Christ sustains us with Himself as bread and refreshes us with Himself as fruit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> </body></html>
