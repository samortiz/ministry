But we became fallen from God, and we were lost in our position (standing) and in our nature (disposition), becoming common. Hence, in saving us, God sanctified us both in our position, in our standing before Him, outwardly and judicially, and in our fallen disposition inwardly and organically. We have covered God&rsquo;s positional and judicial sanctification on other occasions. What is covered in this message is God&rsquo;s dispositional and organic sanctification:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>By the Holy Spirit&mdash;Rom. 15:16:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In their disposition.</li>			<li>With the divine, holy nature of God (2 Pet. 1:4) that they may be holy unto God (Eph. 1:4).</li>			<li>With the element of the resurrection life of Christ, which they received through the feeding.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>From their spirit captivated by Christ, through their soul, and unto their body, so that their entire being can be wholly sanctified&mdash;1 Thes. 5:23.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Since all the believers will be the components of the holy city, New Jerusalem, all of them should be sanctified to be as holy as the HOLY CITY, the New Jerusalem.</li>	</ol></li></ol><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
