   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL AS PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thus far, after about nineteen centuries of church history, the Lord has not gained His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We know that He wants to have a group of people to be His organic members.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means we have to meet organically, serve organically, function organically, and preach the gospel organically.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not preach the gospel as mere preachers, but as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the preachers of the gospel of God should function as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Priests are not common people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are going to carry out God's ordained way of preaching the gospel by visiting people, we have to learn to do it as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A priest is a person who bears four particular characteristics: he bears God's image to express God; he has God's dominion to represent God; he exercises his spirit to contact and receive God; and he receives God as the tree of life to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A priest is a person who is so close to God and according to God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As priests, we are in God and God is in us, so we are one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can go to people with God, bringing God to people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The priestly preaching of the gospel brings God to people and brings people back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A priest is also a person who knows God's heart, God's will, God's plan, God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is one who can teach people and tell people about God, about what God wants, and about what a man should be before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a priest preaching the gospel, and this priesthood is not just our profession but our life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Old Testament, the serving by the priests was their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What they ate, how they dressed, and where they lived was part of their priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their living of the priesthood was their job, their business.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A priest serves God by bringing God to man and bringing man back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the priests' daily life and also their daily job.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today the New Testament believers are all New Testament priests.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As such priests, they should always live a life of being one with God to bring God to man and to bring man back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their living becomes their ministry, their work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why I was so deeply impressed when the Lord showed me Romans 15:16.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse shows that Paul preached the gospel as a laboring priest of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was God's priest to carry out God's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was not carrying out the priesthood in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was a laboring priest, a ministering priest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament, God wanted the types of Christ offered to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the priests daily offered all kinds of sacrifices typifying Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the New Testament, God wants the New Testament priests to offer saved sinners to Him as parts of the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the sinners that we bring to God become Christ's members, parts of the enlarged and corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Old Testament priests offered the types of Christ, but the New Testament priests offer the parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Colossians 1:28 and 29, Paul said that he announced Christ, warning and teaching every man in all wisdom to present every man to God full-grown in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows that Paul eventually offered the saved sinners to God full-grown in Christ, as parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what we should do as priests of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is revealed in the New Testament concerning the preaching of the gospel is not shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All those who preach the gospel must do so as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These priests bring God to people and bring people back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They offer these people to God as spiritual sacrifices, as parts of the enlarged, corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what Romans 15:16 reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Peter 2:5 and 9 show that Peter had the same thought as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Peter said here that we are living stones being built up into a spiritual house, and this built up spiritual house is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The priesthood in these verses refers not to the priestly service but to the priestly body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a group of priests built together to be a "hood," a body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This priesthood tells out the virtues of the One who called them out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To preach the gospel is to tell out God's virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By His virtues we have been called out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was our enjoyment of God Himself as our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some of His virtues are love, kindness, and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through God's virtues we were saved in a subjective way, being brought out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To tell out these virtues is to bring God to people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we merely tell people that we are bringing God to them, they may not realize what we are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why we must live a life of telling out God's love and mercy to us and of telling out His forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must live such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we go to people to bring such a God in all His virtues to them.</S>
