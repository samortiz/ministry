   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR CONCERNING THE GOSPEL IN SCHOOLS 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning preaching the gospel in schools, we still need to fellowship regarding the aspect of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING A PERSON OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As persons who serve the Lord, we first need to learn and exercise to be persons of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the beginning of the church life, the believers in Jerusalem practiced having all things common.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Acts 6 the Jewish believers who spoke Greek were murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They complained that their widows were overlooked in the daily dispensing v. 1 . Then the twelve apostles gathered all the disciples and said to them, It is not fitting for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But...look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that the apostles, who were exercised in the ministry of the word, prayed continually and steadfastly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the full-time serving ones need to pursue the truth and growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, there is still one matter that you must always learn and exercise in, that is, you must be a person of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether you are a younger or an older full-timer, since you have given yourself to the work of the Lord s recovery, you should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should pray for the work we are participating in, pray for ourselves, and pray for the move of the work and the target of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should also pray for the various details of our specific work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Exercising to Look to the Lord in Our Heart</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the propagation of the gospel in the schools, we need to visit the students in the dorms, distribute gospel tracts, and even lead small-group Bible studies with the students.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to cover these matters with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, we need to saturate our work with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The need in the schools is great.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not say that we are too busy or that we do not have time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we labor, we often discover that we do not have enough time to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if this is so, we still need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Prayer requires time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even when we are short of time, we still need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must exercise to look to the Lord in our heart and lean on Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Prayer Being to Tell the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That We Do Not Know What to Do</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>and That We Are Not Able</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Prayer is the expression of our attitude toward the Lord that we do not know what to do and that we are not able to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In principle, it is the poor who ask others for help; the wealthy do not ask for help.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not easy for a person who is capable, knowledgeable, and resourceful to ask for help, because he has everything he needs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>People in the world say that it is best not to ask for help.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As those who serve the Lord, we have nothing; therefore, we can only say, In everything ask God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should ask God concerning everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In serving God, we should never think that we should ask God only when our inability to do something is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is our ability to do something that is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a brother who is about to give a message prays only because he cannot speak well, he will not pray if he speaks well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such a brother must realize that even if he were eloquent, his speaking would be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever comes out of our natural ability is useless in our service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We encourage the saints to get a good education, but if we try to apply what we have learned in our education to God s work, it will not be profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We encourage the saints to study Greek and to learn many languages, but we should not rely on what we have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must regard both aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some people are highly educated and renowned for their research, which qualifies them to be college professors, but they may not be useful in God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Having a higher education is useful when we exercise in prayer to do God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Otherwise, the education that we have received can act as veils on our mind, just as layers of dust on a window can block the light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such veils can be removed only by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can God use a person with a hardened mind 2 Cor 3:14-16 ?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must learn to be a person of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be a person of prayer does not mean that we are constantly kneeling in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person of prayer exercises to always have an attitude of being nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He may pray, O Lord, I am useless.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Luke 17 the Lord Jesus said, Which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at table?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after that you will eat and drink?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were ordered, does he?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The slave had done many things for his master; however, when he went home, he still had to wait on his master, indicating that he was an unprofitable slave.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Such is the attitude we should have when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We will not pray if we feel that we can do something.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When our heart, our spirit, our attitude, our feeling, and our emotion are that we are useless and incapable of doing anything, we will pray and look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our problem is that we are short of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this matter not only the young serving ones need to practice, but also the older ones need to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should always have such an attitude toward the Lord of being unprofitable slaves.</S>
