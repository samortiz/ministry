Verse 13 proves that the coming of John the Baptist terminated the Old Testament dispensation.</p><p>In chapter eleven we see how the King deals with rejection and how we should face rejection. As the Lord was rebuking the unrepentant cities (vv. 20-24), He fellowshipped with the Father (v. 25). At such a time He could say, “I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth…” (see vv. 25-27). I recognize Your authority. If this were not of You, none of these cities would reject Me. Even their rejection is of You. Furthermore, the Lord called the burdened to rest and revealed the way to rest in verses 28 through 30. The way is by taking the heavenly King’s yoke and learning from Him. His yoke is the Father’s will. To learn from Him is to be meek and lowly in heart. To be meek means not to resist any opposition, and to be lowly means not to esteem oneself highly.</p><p>Matthew chapter twelve reveals the establishment of the King’s rejection. The reason for the rejection of the Lord was the breaking of the Sabbath (vv. 1-14). The Lord Jesus took the lead not to keep the Sabbath regulations by bringing His disciples out of a regulation-keeping situation into the grainfields where they all found something to eat. This environment afforded the Lord Jesus the opportunity to unveil Himself as the real David (vv. 3-4), the greater temple (vv. 5-6), and the Lord of the Sabbath (v. 8).</p><p>The establishment of the King’s rejection is continued in verses 9 through 14 with His kingly salvation to turn from the Jews to the Gentiles (12:15-21). While He was being rejected and opposed, He was still full of mercy. The Jews who were opposing Him were like bruised reeds and smoking flax. Likewise, today many of His followers have become bruised reeds that can no longer give a musical song and many no longer burn as a bright light. Christ would not break and throw away the bruised reeds nor quench the smoking flax. Rather, He would wait for you to receive His mercy and grace.</p><p>In order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there is the need of a spiritual battle. This fighting is implied in 12:22-37 where the Lord healed a demon possessed man. The Pharisees said that He cast out the demons by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons. If the Lord had done this, then Satan would be fighting against Satan, and his kingdom could not stand. Satan’s house is his kingdom, and in his house are many vessels, the many fallen persons. In order to take a fallen person out of Satan’s house, we must bind the strong man by prayer and fasting.</p><p>According to verse 36, “Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.” The Lord seemed to be telling the opposers, “Be careful with your speaking. There will be a day of judgment, and whatever you say will be judged at that time.” We must learn to control and restrict our speaking!</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p>
