<p>When we shepherd a new believer, we need to pay attention to several matters. First, we should not act like a teacher and give lessons or admonitions. We are not his teacher; we are only a saint who has led him to salvation and who is also helping him to live the Christian life, to experience Christ, and to experience the growth in life. We must have such an attitude and spirit. We should speak with an ordinary tone and not as a professor giving a lecture.</p>
<p>Second, we should speak clearly concerning regeneration and let the new believer know that through regeneration Christ lives in him to be his life. When we speak of Christ being life, we must stress the matter of regeneration, for it is only through regeneration that Christ can come into us.</p>
<p>Third, when we quote the Bible, we should avoid being complicated. The teaching concerning the experience of Christ as life is relatively deep and mysterious. If we are complicated, the new believer will be distracted and be in his mind.</p>
<p>Fourth, we should endeavor to help him touch his spirit. This requires practice. Experiencing Christ as life is a crucial point. As a rule, we should practice daily to experience Christ and take Him as life. This requires us to continually exercise until we become skillful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KERNEL OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY&mdash;<br />
WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT TO LIVE CHRIST</h2>
<p>One brother testified that when he was in the brothers&rsquo; house shepherding the high-school brothers, he exhorted them not only to study but also to be trained in their character and in their pursuit of spiritual matters. He told them to learn to be joined to the Lord in every matter and to live according to the inner sense of life by calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name. For instance, they should not use someone else&rsquo;s toothpaste to brush their teeth, nor should they take up too much space with their towels. Strictly speaking, however, in order for these practices to be proper, they must be the manifestation of experiencing Christ as life. When I was young, I met a group of people who were not Christians. They had a cultivation according to the Chinese ethical philosophers, and thus their conduct was very proper. After I was saved, I met some saints who loved the Lord, but their outward conduct could not match that of the ethical group. These Christians loved the Lord, but they did not walk or live according to the indwelling Spirit. If we do not walk and live according to the indwelling Spirit, all the outward teaching concerning our character becomes regulation. However, if we walk according to the Spirit and live Christ, what we live out will correspond to the teaching concerning character.</p>
<p>The cultivation of a person&rsquo;s character, at most, can develop the bright virtue, as taught by Chinese ethical philosophers. However, as saved ones, we should walk according to the Spirit and live Christ. If we truly walk according to the Spirit, the standard of our living will be higher than the standard of human morality. Human cultivation of character is merely according to dead regulations, whereas a life that is lived out according to the Spirit is the expression of Christ&rsquo;s life. Therefore, when we serve in the brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; houses, we should not make outward demands, such as allotting a specific space for their towels. Rather, we should lead them in life, teaching them how to touch their spirit and to do things according to their spirit, not according to convenience. We must realize that as saved ones, we have the Lord living in us, and He is leading us in every matter.</p>
<p>In the training center used by Brother Nee in Shanghai, there was a communal bathroom with water basins. The training required that we wash and wipe the basins clean after each use. Some brothers wiped the basins hastily and carelessly. They did not keep the regulation, because they did not walk according to the Spirit. If we walk according to the Spirit, even if there is no outward regulation, the Lord would lead us to keep the basins clean. When we walk according to the Spirit, we express something of life, something living, and not dead regulation. Others may think that we have a very high standard of cultivation, but we are walking according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>When I was young, older family members often taught us not to talk too much. They would say maxims, such as &ldquo;When eating, do not talk,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The mouth is the primary source of calamities.&rdquo; However, to live Christ is not to use maxims to restrict ourselves. To live Christ is to let Christ live in us. When He speaks, we speak, and when He does not speak, we do not speak. Our living and conduct are not according to the cultivation of ethical philosophers or maxims passed down from older generations. Rather, we live Christ entirely according to the Spirit. We can have a particular living by taking Christ as life; hence, it is altogether something living. The cultivation of character taught by ethical philosophers is dead in nature; it is merely an improvement in one&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>Our practice should not be aimed at merely being correct outwardly. Rather, we should ask whether our correct behavior comes from cultivation or from Christ. If we walk according to the Spirit, there will be a situation in our living that is superior to that of the cultivation by ethical philosophers. Furthermore, our situation will be living and bright. This is most precious, and it is the kernel of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. I hope that every brother and sister in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will live this kind of life. In the small group meetings we should speak more concerning taking Christ as life. We need to have more experience and more exercise in this matter.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
