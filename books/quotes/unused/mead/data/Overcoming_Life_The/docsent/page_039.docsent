   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO KINDS OF TEMPTATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I told you before of the brother who rode home on a bicycle after the meeting and was knocked over on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before he realized it, his temper came out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there had been both the time and the opportunity for him to consider it, he might have had a chance to put his temper away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the suddenness of the event did not allow him to think, and his temper burst out unexpectedly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, there are two kinds of temptation that we face in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One kind does not give us a chance to deal with it; it comes suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The other kind comes gradually; it comes in the way of gradual suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One temptation does not give us time to think about it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The other temptation gives us time to think about it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We think gradual temptation is easy to overcome, while sudden temptation is hard to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But brothers and sisters, after we have entered the experience of the overcoming life, we still have to say two prayers every morning when we rise up from our bed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we neglect these two prayers, we will surely fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first prayer is to say to the Lord, Deliver me from temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not let them come to me without me having a chance to think about them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not allow me to sin without having a chance to consider it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord can deliver us from any temptation which we do not have a chance to think about.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a very precious prayer, and it has saved many people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Tonight I do not have the time to read the whole chapter of Romans 5.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I can only mention it briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 5:12-19 teaches us a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This passage tells us that our union with Christ is the same as our union with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as we sinned through our union with Adam, we have righteousness through our union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, how many of us need to exercise our strength to lose our temper?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need to exercise our strength to lose our temper; our temper is aroused as soon as we are stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We spontaneously lose our temper because we are joined to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We sin without any determination on our part because we are joined to Adam; we do not have to exercise any strength to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the life in Christ that God has promised is the same in principle as our union with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should tell the Lord, Just as I was joined to Adam and I sinned without any forethought or determination, I am in Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I can be patient without any forethought or determination on my part.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I do not have to fight to become patient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lord, there is no chance for me to think about the many things that will come upon me today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But I thank and praise You because my union with You is as strong as my union with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When temptation comes to me today, You can express Your meekness, holiness, and victory through me even if the situation is too sudden for me to think about or withstand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we take this stand before the Lord, we will overcome the first kind of temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every day when we wake up, we should believe that God can deliver us from the temptations which we have no time to think about.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every morning we should believe in the life of Christ, and we will live out His victory spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as we lose our temper without thinking about it, we can dispel our temper without thinking about it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This all depends on our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as we have faith, all of God s facts will become our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second kind of temptation does not come suddenly; rather, it comes gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It lingers and repeatedly entices us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What should we do about this kind of temptation?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not pay attention to it or fight it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everything depends on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am still the same as before; I am still weak, and I am still incapable of withstanding temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lord, I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only can I not make it, but I also will not try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, I cannot be patient, and I will not try to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I could not make it in the past, and I cannot make it now.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I thank and praise You that I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I cannot make it!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have no way to deal with it!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the same time we should lift up our heads, look to the Lord, and say to Him, Lord, You can make it!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You are not weak in me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You are strong in me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lord, I thank and praise You because You are able!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You are able!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brothers and sisters, if we take this stand, the temptations will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we struggle and fight with temptations, it seems that they refuse to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But when we declare that we cannot make it and that God can make it, and when we boast in our weaknesses and glory in God s power, the temptations go away.</S>
