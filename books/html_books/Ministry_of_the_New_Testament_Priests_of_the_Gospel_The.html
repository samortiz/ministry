Many people know what the term priest means. In brief, a priest is one who devotes himself to the service of God. According to the record of the Bible, the matter concerning the priests is not a small one. Genesis 1 and 2 show us several special points in God&#8217;s creation of man. First, God created man in His image and after His likeness; this indicates that He wanted man to express Him (1:26a). Second, God gave the governing authority on earth to the man whom He had created; this shows that He wanted man to be His representative to rule over all things on earth (v. 26b). Third, God created man with a spirit (2:7), the organ by which man contacts and receives God. Fourth, after creating man, God placed man in front of the tree of life (vv. 8-9); this indicates that God wanted the man who was created in His image to have His life. Therefore, God&#8217;s intention in creating man was that the man whom He created would have His image to express Him and would be His representative to exercise authority for Him on earth. This God-created man had a spirit within him to contact God and receive God into him as his life and life supply. God made such an arrangement according to His intention for the man whom He had created so that man might serve Him, and to serve God is to be a priest to God.<h2 class=head1>THE TURN FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT PRIESTLY SERVICE TO THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTLY SERVICE</h2><p>The Old Testament shows us that a priest is one who serves God and draws near to God. He is a person who is very intimate with and close to God. God wants His priests to impart His word and His desire with Himself into His people and to bring them before Him to be united with Him. The priests, on the one hand, bring God to men, and on the other hand, bring men to God. This is the priestly service in the Old Testament.<h2 class=head2>Beginning with John the Baptist</h2><p>We know that the things mentioned in the Old Testament were mostly types and shadows, and these types and shadows have been fulfilled and realized in the New Testament. The matter of the priests is no exception. In the New Testament the type of the priests has been fulfilled, and the shadow of the priests has been realized. Concerning the priestly service, there was a great turn from the Old Testament to the New Testament, a turn which began with John the Baptist. John was born into a priestly family; he was the only son of Zachariah, who was a leading priest. Hence, according to God&#8217;s ordination, John was a priest by birth. According to the biblical record, he can be considered the last priest of the Old Testament, but he rejected that service and turned to another service. When he grew up to full age and was ready to fulfill his priestly ministry, he should have lived in the holy temple to learn how to be a priest, and he should have eaten the priestly food, put on the priestly garments, and carried out the priestly work. Instead, he lived in the wilderness, a deserted and wild place that is without culture and religion (Matt. 3:1-4). The life he lived was also in a wild condition; he wore camel&#8217;s hair and ate locusts and wild honey. The things he did were seemingly very wild. He cried aloud, preaching repentance unto God, and he buried the repentant ones, one by one, into water. From that time, with him there was a turn from the Old Testament priestly service to the New Testament priestly service, from something physical to something spiritual. This was unique.<h2 class=head2>Offering Repentant Sinners as Sacrifices</h2><p>In the Old Testament the priests offered mainly cattle, such as bulls and goats, as sacrifices, but what John the Baptist offered were repentant sinners. He turned to become the first God-ordained priest of the gospel of the New Testament, offering not sacrifices, such as bulls and goats, but sinners gained through his preaching of the baptism of repentance (Matt. 3:5-6). Hence, beginning with John the Baptist, the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel is primarily to offer saved sinners as sacrifices to God. Unlike the Old Testament priests who worked on bulls and goats, the New Testament priests work on sinners.<h2 class=head2>With the Gospel-preaching Apostles as a Pattern</h2><h2 class=head3>Preaching the Complete Gospel</h2><p>The work that is carried out by the New Testament priests of the gospel on sinners is complete with three major sections. The first section is to lead sinners to repent and believe in the Lord that their sins may be forgiven and that they may be regenerated in their spirit. This is also the first step of God&#8217;s salvation. The second section is to lead the repentant, regenerated ones to be gradually transformed in their soul. Romans 12:2 says, &#8220;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&#8221; Our mind is the leading part of our soul, so the renewing of our mind is the transformation of our soul. We are regenerated in our spirit in an instant, but afterward we need to be transformed for a long period of time. This process of transformation allows Christ to spread into every part of our inner being-into our mind, emotion, and will. As the Lord transforms us by spreading into every inward part, we grow in Him. The third section is that when we grow in the Lord unto maturity, eventually at the Lord&#8217;s coming back our body will be transfigured and fully redeemed (Phil. 3:21). Thus, our whole being-spirit, soul, and body-will be filled and saturated with the Lord and mingled with the Lord within and without. In this way, He becomes us and we become Him; He is in us as our life, and we are His outward expression. This is God&#8217;s salvation in its entirety, and this is also the complete gospel preached by the apostles. Hence, God&#8217;s New Testament gospel is for us to be regenerated in our spirit, transformed in our soul, and eventually redeemed in our body so that our whole being-spirit, soul, and body-is saved. These are the three steps which the New Testament priests of the gospel of God carry out in men.<h2 class=head3>Being the Priests of the Gospel of God</h2><p>The Epistle to the Romans, written by the apostle Paul, concerns the gospel of God, and it begins with sinners. Paul tells us how sinners can be saved and justified by believing in the Lord, how they advance in Christ by being sanctified and transformed, and how they present themselves to God as living sacrifices that they may become members of the Body of Christ to live the church life, expressing Christ corporately and awaiting the Lord&#8217;s coming. Paul did not only speak in this way concerning the gospel of God; he also served as such a priest of the gospel. He was sent by God from one place to another to preach the gospel, and he offered the saved ones as sacrifices to God (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:9). Then he continued to work on the saved ones by nourishing and cherishing them that he might lead them to present themselves to God as living sacrifices (Rom. 12:1). As such, Paul was a pattern of the priesthood of the gospel. He took care of the new believers in Christ that they might grow by the word of God and that thereby the fruits of the gospel would remain. Furthermore, he carried out the work of teaching and perfecting in the saints, working individually and directly on them daily, that they might be perfected in their gifts. Thus, like him, they could do the work of the building of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12), and they could all become the New Testament priests of the gospel.<h2 class=head3>The Believers Being Able to Do What the Apostles Do</h2><p>According to the revelation of the Bible, every believer in Christ is a priest of the gospel, and like the apostle Paul, every one should go out to preach the gospel for others to be saved, baptizing them into the Triune God and offering them to God as sacrifices. This is the beginning of the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel. After this, we should nourish the saved ones. Preaching the gospel to lead people to believe in the Lord is a spiritual begetting (1 Cor. 4:15); this is to regenerate people with the Lord&#8217;s word and life. Through baptism they become newborn babes in Christ. Then we have to nourish and cherish them properly that they may grow in life. Furthermore, as the apostle Paul did, we need to teach them, on the one hand, as a nursing mother, cherishing them as our own children (1 Thes. 2:7), and on the other hand, care for them as an exhorting father (v. 11).<p>The apostle Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years, during which time he taught the saints there from house to house and did not cease admonishing each one night and day with tears, not shrinking from declaring to them all the counsel of God (Acts 20:31, 20, 27). Likewise, today we should teach and perfect the brothers and sisters by following Paul&#8217;s example. Whatever he did, we also can do. Moreover, after we have learned, we should also teach and perfect others that they also may be able to do as we do. Thus, every saint can become a ministering priest of the gospel, and everyone can do the work of God&#8217;s complete salvation on sinners: preaching the gospel that people may be regenerated, nourishing the new believers that they may grow, teaching the saints that they may be perfected, and cultivating them to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, that they may arrive at the building up of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE INITIAL STEP FOR THE BELIEVERS TO MINISTER AS THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>As saved believers, we are all priests of the gospel. Paul was a priest of the gospel, and we all also are priests of the gospel. No one can be a priest for anyone else. As Paul preached the gospel and bore fruit, so should we preach the gospel and bear fruit. Since we are priests of the gospel, we should work on sinners. Perhaps someone may say, &#8220;I cannot do this; at least, I do it poorly.&#8221; He cannot do it or does it poorly because he will not do it or will not do it frequently and regularly. If we do the work of a priest frequently and regularly, we will surely be able to do it and will improve in the way we do it.<h2 class=head2>The Universal Priesthood</h2><p>Since we are priests of the gospel, we need to offer sacrifices to God, and what we offer to Him are saved sinners. According to the revelation of the Bible, this should be the ministry of the universal priesthood, not the priestly ministry of a few people (1 Pet. 2:5). All the believers constitute a kingdom of priests; they are a priesthood. It is not that only a few saved ones with special gifts are priests and that the others, the majority who are without gifts, cannot be priests. This is not scriptural. The Bible says that every believer is a priest of the gospel of God. According to our natural man, we cannot preach the gospel. However, when we were saved and regenerated, we received a new life, the life of God, which has its organic capacities that need to be cultivated and developed.<p>Nevertheless, this is not the condition in today&#8217;s Christianity, where the practices of the meetings and service do not help in the cultivation of the spiritual, organic capacities of the saints but allow only a few gifted ones, the &#8220;professionals,&#8221; to participate in the sacred work. Eventually, these few become the clergy who form the clerical class. They are responsible for everything pertaining to the service of God, and the rest of the believers are the laity, who can at most only help in practical affairs.<h2 class=head2>Visiting People to Preach the Gospel and Going Forth to Bear Fruit</h2><p>In the Lord&#8217;s recovery today what the Lord intends to recover in us is the universal priesthood, even the universal priesthood of the gospel. Among us, every saved one is a priest, a serving one. As such, everyone should preach the gospel directly to his family members, relatives, colleagues, schoolmates, and neighbors. This way of preaching the gospel is according to our appointment by the Lord to go forth and bear fruit (Luke 10:1-6; John 15:16). We are all branches of the Lord as the vine (John 15:5); as such, we need to bear fruit personally, not asking others to do it for us. We should visit people personally to preach the gospel and lead them to be saved and regenerated, and we should also nourish, teach, and perfect them.<p>A large church may have three thousand saints, but it may depend upon only a few co-workers and elders to call big meetings for the preaching of the gospel, while the rest, perhaps over two thousand nine hundred brothers and sisters, are merely helpers. If this is the case, the number of those who are brought in after a year will be very limited. However, if three thousand brothers and sisters, after hearing this message and seeing that they are priests of the gospel, are willing to go and work on sinners, I am convinced that after a year everyone will have one remaining fruit not only offered as a sacrifice to God but also brought into the church. As we have three thousand saints, so we have three thousand priests of the gospel. We all work on sinners to save, nourish, teach, and perfect them that they may be able to do what we do. As a result, the church will double its number yearly, and the saints also will be able to progress and serve by ministering as the priests of the gospel for the building up of the Body of Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>NOURISHING AND CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 21:15; 15:16; 1 Thes. 2:7; Rom. 9:5; 1 Tim. 2:5; Luke 2:11; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 4:24; Rom. 10:12; 1 Pet. 2:2; Rom. 12:1; Acts 5:42</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Feeding the Lord&#8217;s lambs-John 21:15:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>That our fruit may remain-John 15:16.</li>	<li>As a nursing mother cherishing her own children-1 Thes. 2:7.</li>	<li>Leading the new believers:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To know the Lord:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>As God-Rom. 9:5.</li>			<li>As man-1 Tim. 2:5.</li>			<li>As the Savior (including the Redeemer)-Luke 2:11.</li>			<li>As the life-giving Spirit-1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>To know that they have a regenerated spirit for worshipping God (the Lord)-John 4:24.</li>		<li>To call on the name of the Lord, to pray to Him, and to take in His riches-Rom. 10:12.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Leading them to grow in life that they may present themselves to God as living sacrifices-1 Pet. 2:2; Rom. 12:1.</li>	</ol></li><li>Needing to meet with the new believers in their homes in order to feed them-Acts 5:42:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>This being the pattern revealed in the New Testament.</li>	<li>This being also the second step needed for the New Testament believers to minister as priests of the gospel.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In the preceding message we have seen that in the New Testament God desires that every saved one should be not only a priest but a priest of the gospel. To be a priest of the gospel is to work on sinners with the gospel of God. Such a work consists mainly of three steps. The first step is to save sinners with the gospel of God and offer them to God as sacrifices. The second step is to minister to the saved ones the grace of God that they may grow and offer themselves to God as living sacrifices. The third step is to present these saints, in the wisdom of God, one by one, full-grown in Christ to God. These are the three steps clearly shown in the New Testament for the ministry of the priests of the gospel of God, and this is also the overall work of the gospel of God. Such an overall work is not carried out by only a few. Rather, it is a work which every one of us as saved believers should do because we all are the New Testament priests of the gospel. In the church there are not two classes of people-the clergy and the laity. Rather, there is only one group of people. Everyone is a saint and a priest of the gospel who should fulfill the priestly ministry of the gospel. I hope that we can hear this matter clearly and see it accurately.<h2 class=head1>AFTER BEGETTING, STILL NEEDING TO NOURISH</h2><p>We see from the Old Testament that a priest was one who had God&#8217;s image to express Him, who had God&#8217;s authority to represent Him, and who had God&#8217;s life to live Him out. A priest was also one who had fellowship with God, who drew near to God, and who was united with God. Furthermore, a priest was a prophet who spoke for God. As such a one, he could bring God to man and bring man to God. In the New Testament, such a priest is a person who has been saved and regenerated, who experiences Christ&#8217;s complete salvation, and who enjoys all the riches of Christ. He not only brings God&#8217;s salvation to others but, much more, imparts to people the Christ of God as a living person. In this way he helps sinners to be saved and offers them up to God as sacrifices; he leads them to grow in life and be transformed that they may present themselves to God as living sacrifices; and he teaches and perfects them in all wisdom and eventually presents them full-grown in Christ to God. This is what every one of us should do. Both the older ones and the younger ones, those who have been saved for many years and those who have been saved recently, should carry out this gospel work on sinners.<p>All of us as believers in Christ should beget spiritual children and feed them. Through the gospel we help sinners to be regenerated and become the children of God, and then we nourish them in the Lord that they may grow. Physically, to give birth to a child requires less than one year. This is very suitable for applying this matter spiritually: we beget one person per year. However, as Christians, we are often imbalanced in begetting spiritual children by the preaching of the gospel. When we are cold, we do not preach the gospel at all, not begetting one even in eight or ten years. When we are revived and become zealous, we are eager to beget a troop. Both are wrong. Of course, to be barren is not good, but to give birth to a troop and not be able to feed them is also not good. Therefore, we must follow the natural law of life by giving birth properly to one person every year. Our problem is that either we are barren or we give birth to many but do not feed them. It is no wonder that there are many who are saved but very few who are brought into the church.<h2 class=head1>FEEDING THE LORD&#8217;S LAMBS</h2><p>We need to preach the gospel to help people be saved that they may be regenerated, but much more, we need to nourish the newly saved ones. In John 21, after His resurrection, the Lord appeared to Peter and said, &#8220;Do you love Me more than these?&#8221; Peter said, &#8220;Yes, Lord, You know that I love You.&#8221; The Lord said to him, &#8220;Feed My lambs&#8221; (v. 15). To feed the lambs is to nourish the young or weak believers with the riches of the inner life. This requires that we love the Lord and enjoy the riches of His divine life. When we enjoy the Lord as our rich supply of life, we should and we can feed His lambs.<h2 class=head2>The Qualifications for Being a Priest of the Gospel of God</h2><p>Feeding the Lord&#8217;s lambs is also a part of the work of the priests of the gospel of God. There are ten qualifications for us to be priests of the gospel of God. We must: 1) have the image of God to express Him; 2) have the authority of God to represent Him; 3) have God&#8217;s life to live Him out; 4) be those who have fellowship with God and who draw near to God; 5) be those who are one spirit with God and who are joined to Him to be one with Him; 6) be the prophets of God who speak for God; 7) be able to bring God to man and bring man to God; 8) experience the complete salvation of Christ and enjoy all the riches of Christ; 9) be able to dispense Christ to others; and 10) be able to present others-those who are being nourished by us and who are under our care-full-grown in Christ to God. We must be such persons, and then we can feed the Lord&#8217;s lambs and take care of the new believers.<h2 class=head2>As a Nursing Mother Cherishing Her Own Children</h2><p>Feeding the Lord&#8217;s lambs equals being a nursing mother nourishing her children in the Lord with her own milk (1 Thes. 2:7). As a nursing mother in the Lord, everyone who nourishes others ministers to others with &#8220;her own milk,&#8221; that is, with what we are, what we have, and what we can do. Hence, we must be proper and rich persons. Even though we have brought people to be saved and regenerated, unless we are those who express God, represent God, live out God, fellowship with God, enjoy God, and bring God to man in our living, we cannot nourish the new believers. If this is the case, then when we visit people, we go by ourselves instead of going with God and therefore cannot speak forth words of light and life to minister to our spiritual children. The most we can do is to ask about their health or welfare and have a little fellowship, but we cannot truly minister life to them to satisfy their needs. Such visitation is hollow and ineffective.<p>We should be those who express God, represent God, live out God, fellowship with God, draw near to God, and become one with God. Thus, when we go to take care of the newly saved ones, the moment they see us they will spontaneously be moved. We express God in our countenance and in our demeanor; we represent God in our manner of speaking and in our deportment; and we bring God to them and dispense God into them. A jeweler does not promote the value of his gems with empty words. Instead, he brings the gems with him so that people can see them and know their worth. As the priests of the gospel of God, we are like such a jeweler with his gems. Christ is our gem, and God is our gem. We do not merely speak about Christ or God, but we express God, represent God, live out God, and bring God to others. As we experience Christ&#8217;s salvation day by day and enjoy Christ&#8217;s riches moment by moment, we are full of Christ within and without. When people see us, they see Christ, and when they touch us, they touch Christ. This is the proper preaching of the gospel, and this is the genuine nourishing of people that they may be made alive and be satisfied.<h2 class=head2>Leading the New Believers to Know the Lord, to Contact the Lord with Their Spirit, and to Grow</h2><p>In taking care of the new believers by nourishing them, first we need to lead them to know who the Lord is. He is God, who is over all and blessed forever (Rom. 9:5). Our Lord Jesus is the only, genuine God; besides Him, there is no God. Furthermore, the Lord is man (1 Tim. 2:5). He is God becoming man to be the wonderful God-man with both the divine nature and the human nature. He is the complete God and the perfect man. The Lord Jesus, who is both God and man, is our Savior and Redeemer (Luke 2:11). He was crucified and resurrected to redeem and save us. Furthermore, in His resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us, His believers (1 Cor. 15:45b).<p>After we have led the new believers to know the Lord as God, as man, as the Savior, and as the life-giving Spirit, we should help them to know that they have a regenerated spirit. We may tell them that when we believed in the Lord and were regenerated, the Spirit of God came into us to enliven our spirit and dwell in our spirit that we may worship God in spirit (John 4:24). We may also tell them that since the Lord Jesus as the Spirit of God lives in us, we can take in the riches of the Lord by calling on His name and praying to Him, because He is rich to all who call upon Him (Rom. 10:12). At this time, we should lead the new believers to call upon the Lord, crying, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; This is not only to confess with our mouth but also to call from deep within our spirit. By calling in this way, which can be compared to taking a deep breath, we receive the supply of life from the Lord. We may also lead the new believers to pray to the Lord: &#8220;O Lord Jesus, I need You. O Lord Jesus, You are my Savior. I open myself to You. O Lord Jesus, come into me to be my life supply.&#8221; When we help the new believers to have a basic knowledge concerning the Lord and to contact the Lord with their spirit, thereby taking in the Lord&#8217;s riches, they can receive the Lord&#8217;s supply constantly and grow in life (1 Pet. 2:2) to such an extent that they can present themselves to God as living sacrifices (Rom. 12:1).<h2 class=head1>MEETING WITH THE NEW BELIEVERS IN THEIR HOMES</h2><p>In order to nourish the new believers and lead them to grow in life that they may become remaining fruit, we need to go to their homes to meet with them by personally leading and nourishing them. Thus, over a period of time they will be perfected as we are. The condition of those whom we nourish and care for will be the same as our own condition. If we are those who love the Lord and have constant fellowship with Him so that we are very intimate with Him and are even joined with Him as one, then as we go, time after time, to nourish and take care of the new believers, eventually every one of them will become like us, not loving the world but only loving the Lord and always being filled with the Lord to such an extent that they present themselves to God as sacrifices. At the beginning, we help them to be saved through the gospel and offer them up to God as sacrifices. Then, having grown in life by being nourished and cared for, they also present themselves to God as living sacrifices. To nourish and take care of the new believers by meeting with them in their homes is the pattern revealed in the New Testament (Acts 5:42). This is also the second step needed for us to minister as the priests of the gospel of God. This is what every brother and sister can and should do. What a glorious matter this is!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>TEACHING AND PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:24-25; 1 Thes. 2:11; Acts 20:20, 27, 31; Col. 1:28-29; Eph. 4:11-12</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Meeting with the saints in small group meetings that are full of mutuality-Heb. 10:24-25:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Leading and cultivating the saints:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To open up and fellowship with one another.</li>		<li>To pray for one another.</li>		<li>To care for and shepherd one another.</li>		<li>To mutually ask questions for learning and teaching the truth.</li>		<li>To mutually ask questions for the pursuit and instruction in the growth in life.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Exhorting and consoling the saints as a father-1 Thes. 2:11:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Teaching the saints all the counsel of God-Acts 20:20, 27, 31.</li>		<li>Presenting the saints full-grown to God in all wisdom-Col. 1:28-29.</li>		<li>Equipping and supplying the saints that they may do the work of the New Testament ministry, which is to build up the organic Body of Christ-Eph. 4:11-12.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Appointing the saints to go forth:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To preach the gospel by visiting people.</li>		<li>To nourish and care for the new believers.</li>		<li>To lead the believers to attend the small group meetings.</li>		<li>To lead the believers to attend the bigger meetings of the church.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>This being the major part of the practice of the church life.</li><li>This being also the third step for the New Testament saints to minister as the priests of the gospel.</li></ol><p>In this message we want to see the third step in the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel-teaching and perfecting the saints. We need not only to nourish and take care of the new believers but also to teach and perfect them. After a child is born, he needs to be nourished and educated. If a child is born but not fed, he will die prematurely, but if a child is fed after birth but not educated, he is still not perfected. Therefore, after a child grows to a certain extent, he needs to be educated. As far as our physical, human life is concerned, we need begetting, nourishing, and teaching; as to our spiritual life, it is the same. As the New Testament priests of the gospel, we need to work on sinners that we may help them to be saved and bring them back to God through the gospel. We also need to go to meet in their homes that we may nourish and take care of them. Then we need to bring them to meet in small group meetings that are full of mutuality.<h2 class=head1>THE SMALL GROUPS BEING &#8220;OUR OWN&#8221; MEETINGS</h2><p>Hebrew 10:24-25 says, &#8220;Let us consider one another so as to incite one another to love and good works, not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another.&#8221; The assembling together here is what we call a small group meeting, a meeting that is full of the nature of mutuality. This is not a big meeting with one man speaking and the rest listening. Rather, it is an assembling together of ten to twenty people with mutual fellowship and mutual teaching. Actually, the small group meeting is the most important part of our Christian church life. Regrettably, although the church has been on earth for more than nineteen hundred years, this kind of meeting has gradually been neglected and lost. As a result, today&#8217;s Christianity in general is not strong. Due to the negligence in care and teaching, hundreds of thousands of believers have fallen into a desolate condition. To have mutual consideration, teaching, and inciting, we need the small group meetings.<p>These group meetings are the Christians&#8217; own meetings. If a Christian does not go to the group meeting, he abandons his own meeting. Strictly speaking, a big meeting is not our own meeting but the meeting of the minister; we attend his meeting to listen to his speaking. But when we have a group meeting of ten to twenty people coming together, with no one giving a message for us to listen to, no one being there to lead us, and with our doing everything ourselves, that is truly our own meeting.<p>Perhaps some may ask what they should do in such group meetings. First, we would say that the group meeting is not a worship service, and it does not have regulations or procedures. We, the saints, simply set a date and a time for all of us to come together to have our own meeting. We Christians are a meeting people. Even before we come together, we sing and pray in our homes. We pray daily and praise the Lord constantly. We sing and pray in our daily life, not only on the day of the group meeting but even on other days. Our life is a life of singing and praying; we are singing and praying Christians. Every morning when we rise, we begin to call on the name of the Lord, and then we sing and pray. In this way we overcome spontaneously. If we remain silent, neither singing nor praying, we are defeated, but whenever we open our mouth to call and whenever we sing and pray, immediately the devil flees and we are revived and overcoming. When we live such a life of praying and singing day by day, before it is time for the group meeting, we have already started it in our homes. Therefore, when we come together, spontaneously we have something to say, and our prayers and singing are full of the Lord&#8217;s presence.<h2 class=head1>HAVING SMALL GROUP MEETINGS THAT ARE FULL OF MUTUALITY</h2><p>The primary emphasis of the small group meetings is to lead and cultivate the saints that they may open up and fellowship with one another. If they have any need or problem, they can honestly tell it to one another for mutual intercession in fellowship. They can go further to care for and shepherd one another so that, whether in spiritual matters or in matters relating to their living, they may bear one another and minister to one another. Hence, every group meeting is very organic, having no fixed procedures or programs. They depend altogether upon the attendants who fellowship according to the practical situation by following the Spirit. Furthermore, in this kind of meeting, any question related to the Bible may be brought up for mutual answering that all may learn and teach the truth. A sister who has recently believed in the Lord may ask about the meaning of regeneration, and then the rest, after hearing the question, may answer according to what they know. Someone may say, &#8220;Regeneration is to have the life of God in addition to our natural, human life.&#8221; When he says this, others are taught, realizing that regeneration does not mean that all things in the past have died and all things henceforth are born, just as yesterday is over and today has begun. Then someone else may add another point, saying, &#8220;Yes, through regeneration we have received the divine life, which cannot be separated from the Holy Spirit. We have to walk according to the Spirit. Then we can live by the divine life.&#8221; In this way, everyone, whether older ones, younger ones, brothers, or sisters, can speak according to his own experience and realization. It takes only a few minutes for the brothers and sisters to receive a good teaching from a question like this.<p>In this kind of group meeting there is no need for a &#8220;preacher&#8221; who specializes in delivering sermons and answering question as in leading a Bible-study meeting. When we meet in groups, we practice mutuality. I can ask a question, and you can also ask a question; I can speak, and you can also speak. I can add a little, you can add a little, and someone else can also add a little. As a result, the meeting is living and rich. All the attendants can see something, hear something, and learn some truths. This is much better than having one preacher speaking on one subject from the beginning to the end. We should neither say that this kind of meeting is too difficult nor too easy. It all depends upon our exercise. In the group meetings we need to learn to open up to one another, to fellowship with one another, to pray for one another, to take care of and nourish one another, and to ask one another questions concerning truth or life. In this way we can all learn and teach together that we may pursue together and guide one another in the growth in life.<p>By this we can see that our group meetings have multiple functions. For this reason we should first have singing and praying in our homes in a normal way. Second, when we come together, we should simply open up and fellowship with one another for mutual intercession, care, and feeding. Third, we can ask one another questions and answer the questions together. We can bring up any question concerning truth or life, and everyone can answer according to what he knows. Those who know more can answer more, and those who know something deeper can answer something deeper. All the answers added together become the riches in the church. The more we all exercise in this way, the more able we are, and the more able we are, the richer we will be. Thus, everyone in the small group will be perfected.<h2 class=head1>THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS BEING MAINLY FOR TEACHING AND PERFECTING</h2><p>Ephesians 4:11 tells us that God has given to the church some who are particularly gifted, such as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints. These gifted ones do not use the gifts given to them by the Lord to directly develop the Lord&#8217;s enterprise. Rather, they are for the perfecting of the saints. The prophets perfect the saints to prophesy so that everyone can speak for God; the evangelists perfect the saints to preach the gospel so that everyone can be a priest of the gospel to save sinners; the shepherds and teachers perfect the saints so that everyone can nourish and teach others; and even the apostles perfect the saints to be apostles. Even if a person is nourished and cared for after being saved, this is not enough. He still does not know how to preach the gospel, prophesy for the Lord, and nourish others. Therefore, he needs to be perfected by the gifted ones. After being perfected, every saint can do the work of the ministry, that is, the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). Instead of building up the Body directly, the gifted ones perfect the saints to do the building.<p>For this reason, in the group meetings we need to exhort and console the saints, as a father does his own children (1 Thes. 2:11), and at the appropriate time teach them all the counsel of God as the apostle Paul did (Acts 20:20, 27, 31), admonishing and teaching every man in all wisdom until we can present every man to God full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28-29). At this point, the perfected saints are able to do what the gifted ones do. They can be appointed to visit people and preach the gospel to them, they can nourish and take care of the new believers, and they can lead the believers to attend the group meetings. Furthermore, they should lead the believers to attend the bigger meetings of the church so that they can care for and teach others and also prophesy for the Lord to minister Christ to others. This is the major part of the practice of the church life, and it is also the third step in the ministry of the New Testament saints as the priests of the gospel. This is something that we all can do and should do. May the Lord bless us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>PROPHESYING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:3-5, 12, 1, 31, 24, 26</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Being the consummation of the ministry of the New Testament priests of the gospel:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Prophesying being to speak for the Lord for the building up of the church-1 Cor. 14:3-5.</li>	<li>This being the excelling gift among all gifts in the New Testament-v. 12.</li>	<li>This being what must be earnestly desired especially by the believers who desire spiritual gifts-v. 1.</li>	<li>This being what every believer can and must do-vv. 31, 24.</li>	</ol></li><li>Being the goal of the ministry of the New Testament priests of the gospel:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The priests of the gospel preaching to gain sinners to be offered to God being for this one goal.</li>	<li>Their nourishing the new believers and leading them to grow in life and present themselves as living sacrifices to God being also for this one goal.</li>	<li>Their perfecting the saints by teaching them in all wisdom to present them full-grown in Christ to God being also for this one goal.</li>	<li>The saints who have been perfected to grow into maturity, to be edified in truth, and to have the experience in life being able to prophesy to minister Christ to His members for the organic building up of the church.</li>	<li>The New Testament believers as the priests of the gospel of God needing to pursue to reach this one goal for the carrying out of God&#8217;s New Testament economy.</li>	</ol></li><li>Needing to have meetings of the church that are full of mutual speaking and listening-1 Cor. 14:26:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>All attendants having something to minister to the meeting.</li>	<li>Everything being for the building up of the saints and the church.</li>	<li>Being full of the supply and exhibition of the riches of Christ.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In the previous messages we have seen the first three crucial steps of the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel. These are steps that every New Testament believer should do and can do. The New Testament believers are all priests of the gospel of God. As such, they all need to go and preach the gospel to save sinners and offer them as sacrifices to God. Moreover, they need to continue to nourish and take care of the new believers and also to teach and perfect them until they all can do the work which the gifted ones do for the building up of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>TO DO THE WORK OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL REQUIRING TRAINING AND PRACTICE</h2><p>According to the revelation in the New Testament, these three crucial steps of the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel are not to be carried out according to our natural way. According to our natural ability, it seems that every believer can preach the gospel to save sinners, nourish and take care of the new believers, and teach and perfect the saints. However, according to our spiritual faculty, this is not true. The work of the priests of the gospel is not something that we can do naturally; rather, it requires training. For this reason, I earnestly hope that from now on the churches will begin to train the saints so that they will know how to preach the gospel. Preaching the gospel is not simple; it involves a great deal. First, we need to know who the Lord Jesus is, what His salvation is, and how He, as God, passed through His processes to accomplish redemption and become the life-giving Spirit to be our salvation. We also need to know the three parts of man-spirit, soul, and body, how man fell and became flesh, how the flesh, which is related to the natural soul-life, became corrupted to the uttermost, and how there is a part within man, the human spirit, that has been preserved for God. The foregoing is only a small illustration by which we may understand that preaching the gospel requires training, not only in truth and knowledge but also in experience and skill.<p>Much consideration should be given as to how to open our speaking to others, how to present them with the gospel, and when to lead them to pray. When we preach the gospel to others, we should not ask them if they believe or whether or not they want to be saved. We must always be in spirit to lead them to believe, repent, and be saved, and we must lead them to call and pray with their spirit. Furthermore, we should not ask them whether they want to be baptized. We should simply help them to be baptized. Some people do not possess such skills, so when they speak the gospel to others, the more they speak, the more others do not believe. When we speak the gospel to someone, if we cannot lead him to believe in the Lord within half an hour, we should stop, leaving the rest for the next visit. Concerning these techniques, we also need practice.<p>Furthermore, to nourish the new believers also requires us to be trained. We need to be like a mother cherishing her own children, not demanding of them, but supplying them. When we go to visit someone, instead of giving him &#8220;a long face&#8221; we should be amiable and cheerful with a smiling face. We must be those who are released; our spirit is opened, our heart is rejoicing, and our mouth is full of praise. If we are worried, miserable, or burdened with sin when we go to nourish someone, we cannot be successful because we are still not released and are still under the bondage of Satan. Hence, when we go to visit and nourish others, we must first pray until we get through and clear all the obstructions. Then we will be those who are released, without any burden, without any bondage, and without any sadness, but joyful and satisfied. If our entire being is released while visiting others, they too will be released and rejoicing. This also is a small illustration to show us that we need to be trained in different aspects when we go to nourish the new believers.<p>Then, we also need to teach and perfect the saints, and this requires even more effort. It is one thing to beget, another thing to nourish, and still another thing to teach. To beget is not easy, to nourish is more difficult, and to teach is even more complicated. Therefore, we need training in order to be successful. In the previous message we saw that for attending a group meeting, the first thing to learn is to be open. We must be an open person, with our heart, our hands, our eyes, and our mouth open. We need to become so open. Someone may come to the group meeting with his mouth sealed and his heart shut, and he may sit there with his entire being closed. Then when others pray, he does not make a sound, and when others speak, he ignores them. His coming to the group meeting will only drag down others. If most of the attendants come in this way, there is no way to have a group meeting. Hence, before coming to the meeting, we need to begin to pray and praise from our home and on the way. Then when we come to the meeting, our entire being will be open.<p>In addition, we need to learn to fellowship. Sometimes we do not open our mouth to speak one word. At other times once we open our mouth, we begin to tell stories and speak endlessly; this is not right. In the matter of intercession we also need training. It is best for our prayers to be short, to the point, and not verbose. In the prayer which the Lord taught the disciples, every clause and sentence is genuine and relevant, neither long nor verbose (Matt. 6:9-13). In prayers of faith, the words are simple, hitting the point. Likewise, in the group meetings we should learn to ask relevant questions. After someone asks a question that is related either to truth or to life, everyone should try to answer mutually according to what each one knows. There is some amount of spiritual deposit in the brothers and sisters. Having loved the Lord and experienced much of Him for many years, we should all have some accumulated riches. Whenever someone brings up a question, everyone should speak from what he knows. You speak, I speak, and everyone speaks. In this way, not only do we give an answer to the one who asks the question, but we also render help to every attendant in the meeting. The result is that everyone is taught, and at the same time everyone enjoys the riches of the Body of Christ. Therefore, the best way to learn the truth and to grow in life is through everyone speaking, everyone teaching, and everyone learning in the group meetings. With fifty-two weeks in a year and attending at least one such group meeting per week, how much perfection in truth and in life we will receive year after year! The spiritual riches accumulated in the brothers and sisters can then be passed on from generation to generation, and the riches that remain in the churches will be boundless. This is absolutely something that cannot be substituted by any individual. We need to have such a beginning among us, to lay down a foundation, and to receive much training.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PROPHESYING IN THE BIBLE</h2><p>Now we come to the highest point of the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel-prophesying for the building up of the church. According to the Bible, this point is very high and very important. For two thousand years, the church of the Lord on the earth has nearly forsaken this matter. According to the meaning in the original language, to prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God&#8217;s word. Therefore, in the Bible those who speak for God are called prophets. These are not the same as those known commonly as seers or foretellers. A foreteller mainly refers to one who has foresight and is able to make predictions. However, this is not the original meaning of the word prophet in the Bible. Prophet refers to one who speaks for God and speaks forth God. Of course, what the prophets speak may contain predictions, but most of what they speak are not predictions; rather, they simply speak God&#8217;s word to God&#8217;s people. Among the sixty-six chapters of Isaiah in the Old Testament, there are elements of prediction, but this book is not mainly predictions. Most of its contents are the prophet&#8217;s speaking for God to meet the needs of God&#8217;s people. As the New Testament priests of the gospel, we first work on sinners to save them back to God that they may be regenerated, and then we nourish and care for them that they may grow in life. Eventually we perfect them through teaching that they may also preach the gospel, nourish others, and teach others. At this stage, they have the experience of life and the edification in truth, and they are those who are in constant fellowship with the Lord and who always receive revelation from the Lord. Spontaneously, when the situation demands, they will be able to speak for the Lord. This is the meaning of prophesying.<h2 class=head1>PROPHESYING TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH BEING THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MINISTRY OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>In the New Testament, 1 Corinthians 14 is a chapter that especially speaks concerning prophesying. Because prophesying is the excelling gift, this chapter of forty verses begins with this word: &#8220;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy&#8221; (v. 1). Verse 12 says, &#8220;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&#8221; The word excel in Greek denotes to become full, to abound, to overflow, hence to excel. According to the context of this verse, the word here does not denote to abound or to increase, but to excel and be extraordinary. The apostle Paul clearly indicates here that speaking in tongues is inferior to prophesying. Speaking in tongues edifies the speaker himself, whereas prophesying builds up the church (vv. 4-5). We should pursue the Lord to such an extent that we can prophesy, speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others, that we may minister Christ for the building up of the church. Therefore, prophesying excels and is the high peak of one&#8217;s spiritual pursuit.<p>It is not easy for us to attain to this excelling gift. Nevertheless, Paul says, &#8220;For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged&#8221; (v. 31). In verse 3 he also says, &#8220;But he who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men.&#8221; Moreover, in verse 24 he says that prophesying causes people to be examined and convicted. These verses all describe how our prophesying is to speak forth God and His heart&#8217;s desire toward man that others may be edified and the church, as the organic Body of Christ, may be built up. By this it is obvious that prophesying excels. Even though it is somewhat difficult, we may all attain to it, but for two thousand years the matter of prophesying has been ignored by the church because of the difficulty in practicing it. As a result, today in Christianity we cannot see the meeting as described in 1 Corinthians 14.<h2 class=head1>PROPHESYING TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH BEING THE GOAL OF THE MINISTRY OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>First Corinthians 14 shows us what a proper meeting of the church is. When the whole church is gathered together, each one can speak something; one speaks a hymn, another speaks a teaching, and still another speaks a revelation. Hence, this is mutual speaking with everyone speaking. According to our practice, this is not easy to work out, but it can be done. In Christianity it is easy to have a meeting with one man speaking and all the rest listening, but this is not according to God&#8217;s heart&#8217;s desire. In order that every believer may prophesy, we should set up meetings with about fifty attendants each in a number of places so that all the brothers and sisters may have equal opportunity to speak for the Lord and everyone can also receive some training. Again I say, the way the Bible shows us is that each one of us should go to preach the gospel that others may be regenerated, made alive, and then be nourished, taught, and perfected to know the truth and to have the experience of life. Gradually they also will be able to testify and prophesy for the Lord, ministering Christ to others that the church may be built up organically.<p>Thus, we see that prophesying to build up the church is the consummation, as well as the goal, of the ministry of the New Testament priests of the gospel. If only we had the willingness to practice, I believe we all could do it. Each time when we meet, we practice to speak with everyone speaking, and the more we speak, the more we are able to speak. The word is rich among us and even in each of us, but it has been buried in the past. By this word I am digging it out again. I wish that we would earnestly pursue toward this goal. I truly regard this matter highly, just as Paul does in 1 Corinthians 14. Therefore, I also encourage us all to earnestly desire prophesying and even that we all can prophesy. In this way the function of every member can be manifested, and the riches of the Body of Christ can be released from every member. Eventually, the Body of Christ will be built up for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Prov. 4:18; 2 Cor. 4:16; Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4; Phil. 2:14; Gal. 5:26; 1 Cor. 1:10; Eph. 4:14; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; Matt. 26:41; Rom. 12:11; Col. 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:58; Phil. 3:20; 2 Cor. 5:10</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Being revived every morning-Prov. 4:18.</li><li>Overcoming every day-2 Cor. 4:16.</li><li>Living in the Spirit every moment-Gal. 5:25.</li><li>Walking according to the spirit in everything-Rom. 8:4:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Without murmurings and reasonings-Phil. 2:14.</li>	<li>Without selfish intentions and greedy ambitions-Gal. 5:26.</li>	</ol></li><li>Being in one accord and in harmony with the saints-1 Cor. 1:10.</li><li>Not being blown by the winds of teaching-Eph. 4:14.</li><li>Not teaching anything different from the truth concerning the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God-1 Tim. 1:3-4.</li><li>Watching prayerfully, laboring diligently, and struggling earnestly to carry out each step of the duties of the New Testament priests of the gospel of God-Matt. 26:41; Rom. 12:11; Col. 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:58.</li><li>Awaiting the Lord&#8217;s coming by living and working in the light of His judgment seat-Phil. 3:20; 2 Cor. 5:10.</li></ol><p>In the past few messages we have seen that the New Testament priests of the gospel of God should do the following four main things: first, go out to preach the gospel to save sinners; second, nourish and care for the new believers; third, teach and perfect the saints; and fourth, prophesy for the building up of the church. These matters, especially the last two, are very much involved with the aspect of practice. How should we ask and answer questions in the group meetings? How should we learn? How should we teach? Furthermore, prophesying in the meetings is a particularly new matter. How can we change our meetings from one person speaking and everyone else listening to all speaking and listening mutually? We all want to learn these matters.<h2 class=head1>A FEW GIFTS PERFECTING ALL THE SAINTS</h2><p>Ephesians 4 speaks of the perfecting of the saints, whereas 1 Corinthians 14 speaks of prophesying by all the saints. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers should not only carry out their respective works. Instead, they should perfect the saints to be able also to do what they do. The evangelists should not go out by themselves to preach the gospel; rather, they should perfect others to be able to preach the gospel like them. If we rely only on a few gifted evangelists to preach the gospel, then there will be too few who are able to preach. The result will be that a small number of people will become the evangelistic clergy, while the majority will become the laity. This kind of distinction is unscriptural. The intention of the New Testament is that all of us, the saved believers, would be the &#8220;clergy.&#8221; It does not allow anyone to be a layman. All of us who are saved have been called by God to be the &#8220;clergy.&#8221;<p>It is the same with prophesying. We have a wrong concept, thinking that speaking for God and speaking forth God are such great matters that not every saint is able to do them. On the contrary, the New Testament tells us that every believer can prophesy without any distinction between clergy and laity. If only a group of clergy prophesies while all the others are the laity, then a religious hierarchy will be formed. In the Catholic Church, there is a strong hierarchy. They even say that the only ones who can understand the Bible are the clergy under the leadership of the pope; the laity not only cannot speak for God but also are not qualified even to understand the word of God. This is a grave error. Then, what is the situation in the Protestant churches? The Bible was released from the chains of the Catholic Church in the 1500s and has been translated into many languages over the centuries. Today, it is possible to obtain a copy of the Bible in almost every place in the world. Nevertheless, there are still many in the Protestant churches who cannot find the way to enter into the Bible when they read it.<p>The Bible, which is a divine book of God&#8217;s revelation, contains many special terms that are beyond the comprehension of ordinary people. Therefore, God has raised up a group of teachers among His children to explain and define His holy words in the Bible. In Acts 8 the Ethiopian eunuch sat in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah without understanding what it meant. At that moment, Philip, who was sent by the Spirit, approached his chariot and asked him, &#8220;Do you really know the things that you are reading?&#8221; The eunuch answered, &#8220;How could I unless someone guides me?&#8221; Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he announced Jesus as the gospel to him (vv. 26-35). In Luke 24:44-45 the Lord appeared to His disciples after His resurrection and opened their minds to understand the Scriptures. What the Lord Jesus and Philip did is what today&#8217;s teachers should do. Their particular function is to explain God&#8217;s scriptural revelation to His children and teach the holy word to every saint. The result should be that every saint is able to teach the Bible to others.<h2 class=head1>PERFECTING THE SAINTS UNTIL THEY ALL CAN DO THE WORK OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY</h2><p>Ephesians 4 shows us that in His ascension Christ as the ascended Head has given gifts to the church, His Body, for the perfecting of the saints. In the original language, perfecting means equipping, supplying the functions. These gifted persons equip, teach, and supply the saints until they each can do what the gifted ones do. The apostles perfect the saints to be apostles, to go out everywhere preaching the gospel and establishing churches. However, we do not see this situation among Christians today. Instead, we see the apostles, prophets, and evangelists going out everywhere to do the work which they can do, while others are unable to do anything. This situation is abnormal because it sets aside Ephesians 4. Strictly speaking, Christians have neglected this chapter in the Bible for nineteen centuries. In general we have the concept that the establishing of churches is the work of the apostles and that ordinary people cannot do it, but Ephesians 4 says that the apostles perfect the saints so that they can do what the apostles do.<p>What the apostles do is the work of the New Testament ministry. The first main step of this work is to preach the gospel. After His resurrection, the Lord Himself appeared to the disciples who followed Him and charged them to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19) that the discipled ones could have an organic union with the Triune God. The early disciples were able to carry out this work because the Lord Himself led them for three and a half years, teaching them how to do it. In Acts we see the apostles announcing in Jerusalem the gospel of Jesus as the Christ and leading many people to the Lord. Furthermore, they taught the saints how to preach the gospel. Hence, in Acts 8 the disciples were able to spread the gospel abroad when they were scattered throughout the land due to the great persecution that occurred against the church in Jerusalem.<p>The second step is to feed the Lord&#8217;s lambs. In John 21, the Lord wanted His disciple Peter to feed His lambs. Peter later fed the Lord&#8217;s lambs among the saints. The lambs are the younger, weaker believers. Furthermore, he taught and exhorted others to nourish and care for the Lord&#8217;s flock (1 Pet. 5:1-4). The third step is to perfect, equip, and supply every believer according to Ephesians 4. The fourth step is for all the saints to arrive at the point where everyone can prophesy, speaking for the Lord. When these four steps-preaching the gospel, feeding the lambs, perfecting the saints, and prophesying for the Lord-are added together, there is the building up of the Body of Christ. It is not the building up of an organization but the building up of an organism.<p>If eight couples move to a city without a church, how should they establish a church? Since they are New Testament priests of the gospel, their first step should be to preach the gospel to save sinners. The sixteen of them can divide into groups to go out to people, not to invite them to come and hear the gospel but, as fishers of men, to preach the gospel to them. I can guarantee that if they will go out to preach the gospel in this way, they will definitely gain some. Then they should nourish and care for these newly saved ones and also perfect them step by step until they too can do the work of the priests of the gospel. In this way a church will be raised up. However, they still must go on further to be built up together as the organic Body of Christ. Therefore, we must be perfected before we go out. We need the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers to come and perfect us that we may all be able to do the work of the ministry.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING TO PROPHESY</h2><p>The Lord also wants to recover among us the matter of prophesying, speaking for the Lord, for the building up of the church as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. A meeting in which one person speaks and all the rest listen is not without some benefits, but it is harmful because those who only listen reach a point at which they can only listen and cannot speak. The members of our body all need exercise. If instead of exercising our legs by walking, we only lay in bed, then after a year we may not be able even to stand, much less walk. In the same way, all of us who are saved are members of the Body of Christ, and we all have our organic capacity to function. We can all preach the gospel, feed the lambs, perfect the saints, and prophesy. However, if we only listen and do not speak for a long period of time, then our organic function to speak for the Lord will not be developed; on the contrary, it will be annulled. Therefore, our meetings from now on should not be only for listening but also for practicing to speak. If we have both listening and speaking, gradually even the ones who do not speak will begin to speak. In the end, all will be able to speak, and everyone will be able to prophesy.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO PROPHESY FOR THE LORD</h2><p>Prophesying is constituted with three matters. First, we must have the knowledge of the Bible and be familiar with the Bible. Second, we must have the experience in the Lord, not only entering into the truth in depth but also having the experience of life. Third, we must draw near to the Lord to have fellowship and union with Him. It is best if we draw near to the Lord in the morning by reading His word and fellowshipping with Him. We do not need to read too many verses each morning, perhaps only seven or eight. Then we should choose two of the most meaningful of these verses to pray-read. If we spend fifteen to twenty minutes doing this, we certainly will have some inspiration, which we should then write down. If we enjoy the Lord in this way every morning for all seven mornings of the week and receive inspiration from His word, then on the Lord&#8217;s Day we can put together all the inspirations from the seven days as a written prophecy, and in the meeting we can prophesy according to what we have written. This is a good way, especially when we are still beginning to practice prophesying, and everyone can do it very easily. As long as we read the Lord&#8217;s word and fellowship with Him every day, we will receive light from Him. Eventually, when we combine our knowledge of the Bible, our experience of life, and our spiritual light, we can prophesy for the Lord.<p>I hope the elders and co-workers would take the lead in practicing this way. Then they should train all the brothers and sisters to practice in this way. It is best if the brothers and sisters write out their prophecies and show them to some trainers for reviewing and correcting. Then after the prophesying on the Lord&#8217;s Day, there should be a time of evaluation. Although the saints have something written as a draft when they are prophesying, they should not merely read it in a stiff way but should try to speak normally. If they have some instant inspiration while they are speaking, then they can add a sentence or two. This will make their prophesying more living and more full of light. If we are willing to be trained in this way, I believe that we will all be able to prophesy after one month of practice. Then we can change our meetings from having one person speaking with the rest listening to having everyone speaking and listening to one another. There will be times when mutual speaking and mutual listening will not be enough to ensure that the meetings are rich and enjoyable and that each one has something to say. Therefore, the leading brothers will still need to be prepared. If the brothers and sisters are able to prophesy richly enough so that all the attendants are satisfied and fed, then that is sufficient. Otherwise, the leading brothers will still need to speak a word for eight to ten minutes at the end of the meeting. It should be a strong, rich, living message based upon the sharing of the brothers and sisters, and it should supply and satisfy everyone. Such a preparation is to fill up the lack in order to maintain and strengthen the prophesying meetings of the church.<p>If we practice this for a few years, the prophesying in the church will be rich and will have a solid base. Furthermore, everyone will be revived daily, get into the Lord&#8217;s word, and have a rich enjoyment of the Lord. Thus, the entire church will be revived. All will become the New Testament priests of the gospel, and all will do the work of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. No one will be lazy and barren. Everyone will be a member of the &#8220;clergy,&#8221; and no one will be a part of the laity. If we have three thousand believers who are like this-everyone being able to beget, nourish, and teach-and if each one can bring in only one new one each year, then we will double our number in one year; three thousand will become six thousand. If we can do this year after year, the church will truly flourish. Every believer is a New Testament priest of the gospel, with everyone preaching the gospel, everyone feeding the Lord&#8217;s lambs, everyone perfecting the saints, and everyone prophesying for the Lord. In this way the church will be built up.<h2 class=head1>THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>For such a glorious goal and result, there are requirements for the ministry of the New Testament priests of the gospel. These requirements concern what kind of person we are and what kind of life we live. If we are persons who love the world instead of the Lord and who live in sin, we have not sufficiently fulfilled the requirements to be New Testament priests of the gospel. In the outline of this message we have listed nine major points concerning the New Testament priests of the gospel and their living. First, we must be revived every morning. Every morning we must go to the Lord to have a revival in order that our living will be like the light of dawn shining brighter and brighter (Prov. 4:18). Second, we must overcome every day. To be renewed, as mentioned in 2 Corinthians 4:16, is to overcome. If we remain in our oldness, we are defeated, but if we are renewed day by day, we overcome day by day. Third, we must live in the Spirit moment by moment. We do not live by our flesh, our soul-life, or the old &#8220;I&#8221;; rather, we live by the Spirit (Gal. 5:25). Fourth, we walk according to the spirit in everything. Instead of walking according to our opinions and reasonings, we walk according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4), doing whatever the Spirit leads us to do. A person who walks according to the spirit will not have murmurings and reasonings (Phil. 2:14); also, he will not have selfish intentions and greedy ambitions (Gal. 5:26). Fifth, we must be in one accord and in harmony with the saints (1 Cor. 1:10). We need to have the same mind and to speak the same thing in the Lord.<p>Sixth, we are not blown by the winds of teaching (Eph. 4:14). When Christians pay too much attention to doctrines, they have opinions and thereby create divisions. However, we should only care and live for Christ and His Body. Seventh, we do not teach anything different from the truth concerning the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God (1 Tim. 1:3-4). We have clearly seen God&#8217;s ordained way in the New Testament. This way is that everyone is a priest of the gospel to minister to God. We should not speak or receive any doctrine that is different from this truth. Eighth, we pray watchfully, labor diligently, and struggle earnestly to carry out each step of the duties of the New Testament priests of the gospel of God (Matt. 26:41; Rom. 12:11; Col. 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:58). Ninth, we are those who await the Lord&#8217;s coming by living and working in the light of His judgment seat (Phil. 3:20; 2 Cor. 5:10). These nine major points are an abstract of the entire New Testament. The whole New Testament requires us to be such persons with such a living. Then we will fulfill the requirements to be the New Testament priests of the gospel.<p>Prayer: Lord, we truly praise You for showing us Your ordained way in these days. We praise You for opening the scriptural revelation to us. Thank You for giving us a clear, open heaven in these past days. Thank You that so many saints can receive Your word. May all their paths be the paths of the righteous which are like the light of dawn shining brighter and brighter until the full day. May those who love You be like the sun when it rises in its might. O Lord, bless the Republic of Korea, bless this people, and bless this land for the sake of Your churches here. Even the more, bless all those who are called by Your name that they may all be living believers and become the New Testament priests of the gospel, with everyone preaching the gospel, feeding Your lambs, perfecting the saints, and prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ. May Your economy be accomplished and Your plan be fulfilled. May You be glorified, may Your enemy be put to shame, and may all the saints be blessed. Glory be to Your name. Amen.</body></html>
