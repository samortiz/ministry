<h2 class="head2">The Redeemed Saints<br />
from the Time of the Rapture to Eternity</h2>
<p>The insertion between the sixth and seventh seals shows us how God will be mindful of His people, both of Israel and of the church. Before the damage brought in by the seven trumpets, God will take care of His people, desiring, if possible, to save them from these calamities. After the one hundred forty-four thousand among the Jews are sealed, Revelation 7:9-17 shows the general state of the redeemed ones from the time of their rapture into the presence of God to eternity. If we compare the scene in verses 9 to 17 with chapters twenty-one and twenty-two, we can see that it corresponds with the condition in eternity. Therefore, it transpires after the rapture of the saints.</p>
<p>Through many years of careful study, we have seen that even before the sixth seal some overcomers will be raptured. We say this because it is from the beginning of the sixth seal that God&rsquo;s judgment on this earth changes. Before the sixth seal, all the calamities brought in by the four horses are natural; due to war, there is the shortage of food and there is pestilence, resulting in death. Beginning from the sixth seal, however, the calamities are supernatural. The sun, the moon, and the stars are changed, and the earth suffers an extraordinary earthquake. Some of the overcomers will be raptured before these supernatural calamities begin. In this way, the insertion of chapter seven indicates that before the damage of the supernatural calamities, God will take care of His people who fear Him, both among the Jewish people and within the church.</p>
<p>Here I cannot go into much detail. I can only give you a hint about these matters. In order to see these things clearly, please refer to the chart mentioned above and read Revelation again, many times if possible. In my Bible, the book of Revelation is nearly worn out. This book is a big jigsaw puzzle, and we must be familiar with each piece in order to put it together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SCENE IN HEAVEN BEFORE THE SEVEN TRUMPETS</h2>
<p>Revelation 8:1-5 describes the scene in heaven before the trumpeting of the seven trumpets. In this scene the prayers of the saints are brought to God by Christ. These prayers of the saints are symbolized by the golden censer, not the incense that is added to the censer. The incense added to the censer signifies the resurrected Christ, who is added to the prayers of the saints. In this way, the prayers of the saints are very effective and affect the throne of God in heaven. As a result, the fire of the altar is cast to the earth. On the one hand, the casting of fire to the earth is the answer to the saints&rsquo; prayers, which are made effective by Christ as the incense. On the other hand, the fire is the judgment of the subsequent trumpets. Therefore, the judgment of the trumpets is the answer to the prayers of the saints with Christ added to them. Because God hears the saints&rsquo; prayers, which are made effective by Christ as the incense, the answer to those prayers is poured out from the throne in heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEVENTH SEAL</h2>
<p>The content of the seventh seal is the seven trumpets. The seven trumpets added together equal the seventh and last seal, which extends into eternity. The seven trumpets comprise the seventh seal, and within the seventh trumpet are the seven bowls. As we have seen, the number seven in Revelation is composed of four plus three. The first four seals comprise one group, and the last three are another. Seven is also composed of six plus one. Revelation 6 speaks of the first six seals, while chapter eight begins to speak of the seventh seal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Four Trumpets&mdash;Judgment on the Earth, the Sea, the Rivers, and the Heavens</h2>
<p>At the first trumpet, hail and fire mingled with blood are cast to the earth, burning up the third part of the earth, the third part of the trees, and all green grass (v. 7). When the second angel trumpets, the third part of the sea becomes blood, and the third part of the creatures in the sea and the third part of the ships are destroyed (vv. 8-9). At the third trumpet, the third part of the rivers and fresh waters are damaged (vv. 10-11). When the fourth trumpet sounds, the third part of the sun, the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars are smitten (v. 12). One-third of the earth with the trees, one-third of the sea with all the things in it, one-third of the fresh waters, and one-third of the things in the heavens are damaged by the first four trumpets.</p>
<p>Today people say that whatever happens to the earth is natural, but at that time they will realize that what is happening is supernatural. That only one-third of everything is damaged will indicate that there must be a sovereign One who is arranging these things. Moreover, as the fourth seal, Death and Hades damage only the fourth part of the earth (6:8), but the four trumpets damage the third part, indicating that the damage is intensified.</p>
