   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR UNIQUE NEED BEING TO WALK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WHICH IS OUR REGENERATED HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>INDWELT BY AND MINGLED WITH THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans presents a sketch of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter 8, which is the heart of Romans, verse 4 charges us to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The spirit in this verse is our regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows that these two spirits are one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Triune God in Christ has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, Christ has attained to the throne and has obtained the kingdom, the highest name, the lordship, and the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Triune God in Christ has been processed through all these steps and accomplishments and has become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 8 shows us that the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 2 mentions the Spirit of life, which is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verses 9 and 11 refer to the Spirit as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the life-giving Spirit is the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Spirit is one with our spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God created us with a spirit so that we could contact and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, because of the fall, our spirit was deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the time of our salvation, our spirit was made alive as the Spirit came into our spirit and regenerated it with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now our spirit is indwelt by and mingled with the Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since we have such a wonderful mingled spirit within us, our unique need is to walk according to this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>TO ABIDE IN THE VINE BY WALKING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE WAY TO LIVE THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The vine is Christ, who has become the life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, to abide in the vine is to walk according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our experience tells us that as long as we walk according to the spirit, all the other experiences of the normal Christian life, such as bearing the cross and participating in the power of the resurrection life, will spontaneously issue forth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not need to endeavor or exercise our human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need only to walk according to the mingled spirit, which is the practical way to live God and to allow God to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 8:9 says that the Spirit dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we walk according to the spirit, we allow the Triune God to make His home in, settle down in, take possession of, and occupy our entire inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we allow the Triune God to indwell us in this way, we will spontaneously and continually experience the killing of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not asceticism, for it is joyful and kills only the negative, natural elements in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The focus of the Bible and of the Christian life is not to experience the subjective death of Christ; the unique focus is to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to my fifty years of experience, I can testify that if we are not living God, no other practices work, for they are matters of our own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may point out that walking according to the spirit also requires effort.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is true, but it is a small effort, and it is effective, for all the other experiences of the normal Christian life will result.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, the effort of walking according to the spirit may be compared to the effort of turning on a light switch in order to light a large room, which is more effective than lighting many separate lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God made us with a mind to understand and a will to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to use these faculties to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even our initial believing in the Lord for our eternal salvation requires our effort to understand the gospel and choose to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, this does not mean that we save ourselves by our own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not need to exert much effort to produce the experiences of the normal Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, we need only to walk according to the spirit the other experiences will spontaneously follow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a sense, it is difficult to know when we are walking according to the spirit, but it is easy to know when we are not walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When our body functions normally, we do not have much feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not sense that our stomach is digesting normally.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we feel our stomach, this means that something is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Similarly, as long as we are walking according to the spirit, we will live a normal Christian life without much feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, we have a clear negative feeling when we are not walking according to the spirit so that we know to stop and turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The focus of the Bible is that the processed Triune God lives in us so that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our need is simply to live Him by walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have a mingled spirit, which is composed of our regenerated spirit and the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we walk according to this wonderful mingled spirit, every other experience of the normal Christian life will spontaneously come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the saints today need this kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to take the lead to pursue a daily life of walking according to the mingled spirit so that we can minister such a life to others.</S>
