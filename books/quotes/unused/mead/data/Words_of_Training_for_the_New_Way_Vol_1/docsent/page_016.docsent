   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONTACTING GOD THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today God is still a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is difficult to understand and apprehend God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Bible says clearly that this God who is incomprehensible and mysterious is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word for word means the expression of the thoughts formed in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, what is God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man cannot utter what God is; yet God expresses Himself through the Word, and He uses the Word to represent Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God said that He is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence the Bible says, The Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the original Greek, this sentence was, God was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both of these expressions are correct, because in Greek both the Word and God are subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is the Word, and the Word is God; these two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there is only God without the Word, then man has no way to understand; if there is the Word, then God can be described and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But how could this expressed God enter into us?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is indeed wonderful that the word is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once the word enters into us, it becomes spirit, and it is life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, God is the Word, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We contact God first through the Word, and second, through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The result is life, and life is simply the grace and reality we have enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is my main point.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you want to contact God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You need to know the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you know the Word, the Word will become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once the Word in you has become the Spirit, you have life within.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This life within us is the grace and reality we have enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NEEDING TO DEAL WITH THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The most important thing for the young people who came here to be trained is to deal with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Where is the word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the universe there is a book called God, having spoken see Heb 1:1-2 , which is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible is not merely the word of God; it is even the more God s speaking, that is, God s breathing 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s speaking is God s breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, whenever you read the Bible, you need to breathe in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the beginning was the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is to breathe in. What God breathes out is the breath, and what you breathe in is also the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once this breath enters into you, it is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christianity is too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some Christians there actually do not deal with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some deal with the Spirit, but in a nonsensical way by speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible, however, shows us that the proper way is to read and pray the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first emphasis in reading the Bible should not be to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I was newly saved at the age of nineteen, I had a strong desire to obtain knowledge, and I loved to read the Bible very much.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was resolved to understand every verse, and even every word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But when I came to the Gospel of John, to the verse, In the beginning was the Word, I was stumped by this sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is the beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I searched many reference books, but still did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, did the Chinese character for Word in that verse refer to the same Chinese character used for doctrine, or for morality, or for pathway?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I studied, but at the end, I still did not get anything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I thought I could study the Bible the way I studied Chinese classical writings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually I discovered that man can understand Chinese classical writings, but he has no way to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then what shall you do?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you do not understand, do not try to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Pray-read one portion In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you pray-read in this way, after only ten minutes, you will be satisfied within.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the best way to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Bible is God s breathing out, so that you can breathe it in. This Word is God, and it is the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When you breathe this breath into you, it becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once it becomes the Spirit, it is life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This life becomes the grace and reality in your daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the Lord s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not religion.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Religion s way can be compared to teaching a child not to tell lies.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Soon after such a lesson, the child will commit some wrongdoing and then immediately fabricate a story to tell you another lie.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, such teaching is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Rather, we need to lead the little children to pray-read the Lord s word and let this word become the breath to enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This breath entering into them is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Spirit becomes life, and this life within them is the grace and the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then when such a child wants to do something wrong, within him something will not allow him to do it, rather, will require him to abide in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As a result, what he lives out will be God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is altogether different from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I hope that you would practice dealing with the word and the Spirit every day.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To deal with the word is to read the Bible; to deal with the Spirit is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You may say that you do not have many words to pray with.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Actually, the entire Bible is your prayer book.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You can turn to any page and use it to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When you read the Bible, you are dealing with the word; when you pray, you are dealing with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Eventually, the word and the Spirit become life, which is your enjoyment and your gain.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This enjoyment and gain are grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on August 20, 1987.</S>
