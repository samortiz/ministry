for the Preaching of the Gospel&mdash;<br />
Being One with the Lord, Fearing No Difficulties</h2>
<p>When we visit people for the preaching of the gospel, we will encounter all kinds of difficulties. Second Timothy 1:8 says, &ldquo;Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God.&rdquo; The gospel here is personified (see Rev. 6:2, note 2). Since the gospel is persecuted and put under a hard trial, we the gospel preachers, as the companions of the gospel, must suffer evil and be persecuted along with the gospel.</p>
<p>This is why, when the Lord sent us out to preach the gospel, He gave us first Himself. The word &ldquo;go&rdquo; in Matthew 28:19 was spoken by the Lord in His resurrection. He said, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo; Every one of us who has believed into Him is resurrected with Him. In resurrection He has entered into us. First we received the Lord Himself. Then He gave us His power. In addition, He gave to us all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). For this reason, when we preach the gospel today, we do not do so by our two lips only. Rather, we command people to believe in Jesus by the Lord Himself, by His power, His authority, and His word. We must have this kind of faith, realizing that we are one with the Lord, that we are joined with Him as one spirit, that our going is His going, and that He is going with us. When we speak, the Lord speaks. Those who receive us, receive the Lord, and those who reject us, reject the Lord.</p>
<p>In addition to this, when we preach the gospel, we must not be afraid of difficulties. Although the Lord is with you, although His power is your power and His authority is your authority, and you can even heal sickness, cast out demons, and work wonders and miracles, all of this does not mean that you will not encounter difficulties.</p>
<p>When Paul preached the gospel, he also performed many miracles. However, sometimes he was also arrested and imprisoned. At such times, the Lord did not always release him or rescue him. As a result, some co-workers were tried and began to doubt. Some even left Paul. Hence, in preaching the gospel, there are times when we will encounter difficulties. We have to be prepared. We must persevere and must not be discouraged by any means or stopped by any frustrations. We need to realize that to take this new way and to preach the Lord Jesus in death and resurrection is a life-long task; it is not a matter of being stirred up by a moment of interest and of continuing for only a month or two. We have to take this new way all the days of our life. For this reason, Paul exhorted us not to be ashamed of the gospel, but to suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God. This is the secret of preaching the gospel in the new way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Home Meetings&mdash;<br />
Nourishing the New Ones as Mothers<br />
Cherishing Their Children</h2>
<p>According to our experience, if three or four brothers and sisters go out to preach the gospel by knocking on doors twice a week, spending two hours each time, they will gain three or four. If they continue to do this for three weeks, they will have over ten new ones to care for. We have to care for these ones continually for about half a year. Only by this will they gradually grow up.</p>
<p>In caring for the new ones, after we baptize them, we should not leave immediately. After they have changed their clothes, we should talk with them for at least an hour. This is to feed them with milk for the first time. Thereafter, we need to feed them by going back to them once every three days. During the first month, we should go to them as often as possible. Only by this way will they have the full care.</p>
<p>Paul said to the Thessalonian believers that he was one who &ldquo;as a nurse would cherish her own children&rdquo; (1 Thes. 2:7). Paul was a brother. But in treating the Thessalonians, he was like a nursing mother cherishing her own children. The word &ldquo;cherish&rdquo; is difficult to translate. In the original language, it is used to describe a mother soothing her child. Sometimes the child feels cold, or he is bitten by mosquitoes. He would feel uncomfortable and would cry. The mother would then soothe the child by covering him with a warm blanket or applying some ointment to him. In addition, the mother would embrace him affectionately and would rock him back and forth, up and down in her arms. When the child is comforted, the mother is at peace. This is the meaning of cherishing.</p>
<p>We are a failure if we go to the home meetings today in a way that is like the preachers or pastors going to a worship service; we should not wait for an appointed time and then go to the brothers and sisters&rsquo; home in that way to lead them in singing the songs and reading the Scriptures. Paul was a pattern to us. When he nourished the new ones, he cherished them like a nursing mother. We have to comfort and soothe the brothers and sisters. Perhaps they have difficulties. We should then give them some answers or some consolations. After they are more stable, we can bring them to the small group meetings. When they see the other brothers and sisters fellowshipping with one another, praying and caring for one another, and mutually asking and answering questions, they will be shepherded and cared for.</p>
<p>If the three or four brothers and sisters that we gain through door knocking during the current period are no longer able to meet with us after they have met with us in their homes for two months, we have to ask our companions to help us to knock on more doors and take on more new ones to care for. In short, we need to have three to four new ones under our care and guidance all the time throughout the whole year.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
