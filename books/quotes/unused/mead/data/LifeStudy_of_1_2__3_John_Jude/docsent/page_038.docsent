   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S FAITHFULNESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to admit that after regeneration we still have sin; that is, we still have indwelling sin in our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because we still have sin within us, there is the possibility that we may sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we sin, we need to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then God will be faithful in the word of His new covenant to forgive us our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the gospel, which is the new covenant, God promises that He will forgive us our sins because of the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, if we confess our sins, God must be faithful to keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If God would not forgive us, this would mean that He contradicts His own word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In such a case, God would not be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, we may have the assurance that as long as we confess our sins through the redemption of Christ, God must forgive us, for He must be faithful in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 9 John also tells us that God is righteous to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why must God be righteous to cleanse us in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God must be righteous to cleanse us from unrighteousness because He judged the Lord Jesus on the cross as our Substitute, putting all our sins upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because God has judged Christ for us, His blood is efficacious to cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, when we confess our sins through His blood, God has no choice but to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, suppose you owe an amount of money to a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A friend of yours pays this debt for you, and the other party receives the payment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now that party cannot righteously claim the payment from you, for the debt has already been paid.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a similar way, God has received payment for our sins through the death of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now whenever we confess our sins to God through the blood of the redemption of Christ on the cross, God must forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this matter He has no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He must be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is faithful in His word, and He is righteous in His acts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His word God must be faithful, and in His acts He must be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see the difference between faithfulness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>FORGIVENESS AND CLEANSING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the difference between forgiving and cleansing?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to know this difference, we need to know the difference between sins and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sins refer to offenses, and unrighteousness is the mark, the stain, on our behavior caused by the committing of an offense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we sin, we commit an offense.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This offense then becomes a stain on our behavior, and this stain is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For instance, suppose you buy two items, but you are charged only for one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you pay for just one item, that will be an act of sinning against the store.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With respect to the person who sold you the items, that is an offense.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But with respect to your character, that is a mark of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this reason, others would not say that you are sinful, but would say that you are unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In a similar way, when we commit sins before God, with respect to God those sins are offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But with respect to us, they are stains of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, on the one hand, God forgives our sins, our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, God washes away the mark, the stain, of our unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the reason John in 1:9 speaks both of the forgiveness of sins and the cleansing from unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The forgiveness of sins is actually the cleansing, the washing away, of the stain of our unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE RESTORATION OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The writing of the apostle John in these verses is tender and delicate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In verse 6 he says, If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then in verse 8 he goes on to say, If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 10 he says, If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But in verse 9 John tells us, If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is faithful in His word to forgive our offenses, and He is righteous in His acts to cleanse away the stain of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through God s forgiveness and cleansing, the offense is forgiven, and the mark is cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result is that our fellowship with God is fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Fellowship with God is broken by sin and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But when sin is forgiven and the stain of unrighteousness is cleansed, our fellowship with God is restored.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once again we have the enjoyment of the divine life through our fellowship with the Father and the Son.</S>
