If I remember it correctly, this is the gist of it: Mr. Taylor was in St. Louis, U.S.A., and was due in Springfield for meetings. The carriage taking him to the station was delayed, with the result that when he arrived there the train had already left, and there seemed no possible way for him to keep his appointment. But, turning to Dr. J. H. Brookes, he said, \u201cMy Father runs the trains; I\u2019ll be there in time.\u201d Upon inquiry of the [155] agent, they found a train leaving St. Louis in another direction, which crossed the line going to Springfield; but the train on the other line always left ten minutes before this train arrived, as they were opposing roads. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, Mr. Taylor said he would go that way, in spite of the fact that the agent told him they never made connections there. While they waited, a gentleman came to the station and handed Mr. Taylor some money. He turned to Dr. Brookes with the remark, \u201cDo you not see that my Father has just sent me my train fare!\u201d meaning that, even had he arrived in time for the other train, he could not have taken it. Dr. Brookes was amazed. He knew Mr. Taylor had quite a good sum of money in hand, which had been given him for his work in China, so he asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by saying you had no money for your fare?\u201d Mr. Taylor replied, \u201cI never use anything for personal expenses that is specified for the work. The money earmarked for my own use has just come in!\u201d For almost the first time in the history of that road the St. Louis train arrived ahead of the other, and Mr. Taylor was able to keep his appointment at Springfield!

Regarding the rapture, although there are three different views, our attitude must be fair and proper, because among these three groups there are persons who are very good in Bible knowledge and are very spiritual. They all have their arguments. For example, among those who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation are J. N. Darby, William Kelly, R. A. Torrey, D. L. Moody, J. H. Brookes, J. M. Gray, A. C. Gaebelein, J. A. Seiss, C. I. Scofield, and others. "}]}
