   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Confession Saving Much Trouble</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is great profit when one confesses with his mouth after he has believed in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It saves him much trouble in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose you do not open your mouth and say, "I have decided to follow the Lord Jesus; I am His now."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Others will still consider you the same as they.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they sin or indulge in lustful things, they will consider you to be one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In your heart you realize that you are a Christian and that it is wrong for you to be among them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But you cannot reject them, because you want to please them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may come up with an excuse to turn them down.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the next time they will still drag you along, and you will have to think of another excuse to refuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may come up with excuses once or twice, but the pressure will always come back.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So why not put the signboard out from the very first day and confess that you are a believer?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You only need to confess once or twice, and others will give up trying to persuade you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you do not confess with your mouth, that is, if you are a Christian secretly, you will experience much more difficulty than those who are Christians openly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your temptation will be many times greater than the temptation of those who openly confess the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You will be bound by human affections and past relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You cannot excuse yourself from others every time by saying that you have a headache or that you are busy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You cannot use excuses every time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why you must declare from the first day, "I have believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have accepted Him."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once you put out this signboard, your colleagues, classmates, relatives, and family will know the kind of person you are.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will save you much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, you will have all kinds of frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a person confesses the Lord with his mouth, he will be saved from much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>D. Not Confessing the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Leading to Accusations in the Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is another serious problem for a person who does not confess the Lord with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of the Lord's believers experienced this when the Lord was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus was rejected by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They vehemently opposed and rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 9 the Jews made a decision: Whoever confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue v. 22 . In chapter twelve the Bible says that many Jewish rulers believed in the Lord Jesus secretly, but they dared not confess Him because they were afraid of being put out of the synagogue v. 42 . Do you think that these people had peace in their hearts? Perhaps they felt uneasy about confessing the Lord, but they felt even more uneasy about not confessing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What kind of place was the synagogue?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was a place where people opposed the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They plotted, conspired, and discussed plans to trap the Lord there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such were the dark things that went on in the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What should a genuine believer do among such people?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How much strength would he need to keep his mouth shut?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Under such circumstances it would be difficult for anyone to confess the Lord with his mouth, but it would be even harder for him to not confess the Lord with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Jewish synagogue is a picture of the world's opposition to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The world always criticizes the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It always considers Jesus of Nazareth a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It has all kinds of things to say against our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a place like this, can you listen to the people and pretend to be like one of them?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To pretend is painful; to pretend is also difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You have to muster enough strength to control and repress yourself before you can pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Under such circumstances, is it not true that something within you will want to cry out, "This man is the Son of God; I believe in Him"?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is there not something within you that wants to proclaim, "This man is my Savior, and I have already believed in Him," or, "This man can deliver me from my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may not believe in Him, but I do"?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is there not something within you that wants to make such a declaration?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are you going to force yourself to be quiet just because you want man's respect and position?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It seems to me it would have been easier for the Jewish rulers in John 12 to simply be put out of the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They would have felt much better if they had confessed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you are a false believer, it probably will make no difference whether or not you confess.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But as a genuine believer, you will surely offend your conscience if you pretend and sympathize with the Lord's opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When others oppose the Lord, you have no peace in your heart, yet you must force yourself to say, "What you are saying is interesting."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is this not the most painful thing to do as a human being?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is nothing more painful than not confessing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The greatest suffering is to refuse to confess the Lord before men.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I would not want to trade places with those rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Their suffering was too great!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you are not a believer, there is nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if you have believed, the easier and more joyful and happy thing to do is come out of the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You may feel that there are many obstacles, but past experience indicates that the obstacles will be greater and your heart will suffer more if you do not go this way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose you hear someone maliciously slander your parents, saying this and that about them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Suppose that you try to sit still and listen to them or, worse still, pretend to sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you do this, I would wonder what kind of a person you were.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our Lord has given His life to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we do not say something for the very Lord whom we worship and serve, how much more timid are we?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must be bold to stand up and proclaim for the Lord, "I belong to Him!"</S>
