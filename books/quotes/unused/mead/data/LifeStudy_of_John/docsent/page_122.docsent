   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE VINE AND THE BRANCHES BEING AN ORGANISM TO GLORIFY THE FATHER BY EXPRESSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RICHES OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 15:1-11 we see that the vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father by expressing the riches of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some readers of this message might be bothered by the word organism; it may sound quite strange to their understanding to hear of the organism of the Triune God in the divine dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we are used to saying that the church, the Body of Christ, is not an organization but an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the difference between an organization and an organism?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A table, for example, is an organization, for many pieces of wood are assembled to form one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why is a table an organization and not an organism?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because in the table as a unit there is not one organ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are no organs in a table because there is no life in a table.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apparently, our body is also an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, it is much more than an organization because we have both organs and life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since our body has both organs and life, it is an organism, not merely an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In like manner, the church, the Body of Christ, is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is exactly what we have said in Message Thirty-two the mutual abode, the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we have seen, there is such a mingling in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This mingling is the mutual abode of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This mutual abode, this mingling of divinity with humanity, being full of organs and life, is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 15 this organism is likened to a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The grapevine is used as a figure of this wonderful organism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Within this vine tree we have the tree itself and all of its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus said that the vine tree is just Himself v. 1 . He is the tree, and we are the branches of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By this clear picture we can see that we are the branching out of the tree, for the branches are the branching out of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you were to cut off the branches, you would have just a bare tree without branches, and there would be no branching out of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But today this universal vine tree has many branches, and these branches are simply His branching out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was just a small man living in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But look at His branching out today: He has parts in Washington, D.C., New York, Los Angeles, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Manila, Taipei, Hong Kong, and throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise the Lord that throughout the whole earth we see the branching out of this vine tree!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not an organization; it is an organism that has life with many organic elements, organs, and organic systems growing in it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the meaning of the word glorify here?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It means to have the intent, the content, the inner life, and the inner riches released from within and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father, to have the intent, the content, the inner life, and the inner riches released and expressed from within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As an organism to glorify the Father, the vine and the branches express the riches of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the vine tree bears clusters of grapes, that is the time when the riches of the divine life are expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This expression is the glorification of the Father because the Father is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Father is the source and the substance of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the fruit, the essence, substance, and life of the vine tree would be concealed, hidden, and confined.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the riches of the inner life of the vine are expressed in the clusters of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I say again that to express the inner life in this way is to release the divine substance from within the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the glorification of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A. The Divine Dispensation 1.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s Economy</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To have the vine and the branches as an organism to glorify the Father is the divine dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here the word dispensation does not mean an age or a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It means dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This word has the same meaning as the word economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Oikonomia, the Greek word for dispensation or administration, has been anglicized as the word economy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is this oikonomia, this economy?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a governmental administration, that is, a divine dispensation into mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This divine dispensation is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the Greek this word is used clearly in 1 Timothy 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the King James Version rendered it godly edifying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It should be translated God s economy or God s dispensation.</S>
