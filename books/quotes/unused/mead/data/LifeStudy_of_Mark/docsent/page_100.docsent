   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By means of these twenty-nine matters, the Lord Jesus prepared His disciples to be brought into His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>BROUGHT INTO THE LORD S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why was it necessary for a number of the Lord s disciples to be brought into His death and resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The answer to this question is that the disciples could not participate in the enjoyment of the Lord otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, if they did not enjoy the Lord by being brought into His death and resurrection, they would not be able to enter into the kingdom of God or have anything to do with the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We enter into the kingdom through the enjoyment of the Lord, through the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the universal replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to enjoy Him in this way, we need to pass through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the Lord worked on the disciples to make them ready to be brought into the process of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that the Lord was proceeding onward to Jerusalem in order to die there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we also need to realize that the Lord was not going to Jerusalem alone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, He was bringing with Him a number of His faithful followers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These followers were not clear about what was happening.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They may have felt only that the Lord was very lovable and that they wanted to go wherever He went.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, the Lord s purpose was to bring all of them into His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once the Lord s followers were brought into His death and resurrection, they could participate in the enjoyment of Him in an actual and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is through death and resurrection that the Lord becomes our portion and our replacement.</S>
