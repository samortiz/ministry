   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SIXTY LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MARRIAGE OF ISAAC</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A PRACTICAL LIVING IN ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible reveals that God's eternal purpose is to express Himself through a corporate Body and that this purpose is fulfilled by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we would probe into the depths of the book of Genesis, we must see these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Genesis 1:26 we see that man was made in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The man here is not an individual man but a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may say that it is mankind, a corporate Body that can express God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Genesis 2 we see that for the fulfillment of God's purpose we must have the divine life signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In these two chapters we have two crucial words image and life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Image reveals God's eternal purpose, and life unfolds God's way of fulfilling His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Never consider Genesis as merely the record of God's creation and the history of some patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This view is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we plunge into the depths of this book, we see that it is not merely a record of creation and history, but that it is a revelation of God's eternal purpose and His way of fulfilling it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>10 The Marriage of Isaac</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With these two points in mind, let us now come to Genesis 24.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone who reads Genesis thinks of this chapter as the record of a marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the important thing here is not the marriage but what the marriage indicates, implies, and typifies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we were on Genesis 1 and 2, we saw that those chapters are not only a record of God's creation but a record of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything found in those chapters is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Anything that is not related to life is excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you read those chapters carefully, you will see that many aspects of God's creation are omitted because they are not related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same principle, only those aspects of Abraham's history which are related to life are recorded in chapters twenty-one through twenty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire book of Genesis, a book of only fifty chapters, covers over twenty-three hundred years, the first twenty-three centuries of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Genesis were a record of history, it would need hundreds of chapters to cover this span of time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fact that such a long period is covered in just fifty chapters proves that Genesis is not a record of history.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I say again that although Genesis apparently is a record of history, it actually is a record showing God's eternal purpose and the way of fulfilling it by life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Anything which is not related to God's purpose and its fulfillment by life is not recorded in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Chapters twenty-one through twenty-four, covering forty years 25:20 , mention five main things: the birth of Isaac, the growth of Isaac, the offering of Isaac, the death and burial of Sarah, and the marriage of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although this record is brief, it is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we see a proper birth and the proper growth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This birth and growth produced a burnt offering for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the birth and growth in chapter twenty-one, we have the burnt offering in chapter twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then, as we have seen, in chapter twenty-three we have the death of Sarah and a detailed account of her burial.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Following this, in chapter twenty-four, we see a wonderful marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this chapter is not merely the record of a marriage; it is a story which has a deep meaning and significance in life.</S>
