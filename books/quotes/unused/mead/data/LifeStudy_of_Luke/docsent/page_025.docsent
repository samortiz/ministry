   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Representative of Mankind</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Lord Jesus came out to minister at the age of thirty, He was the representative of mankind in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, He represented the God-created man; on the other hand, in appearance He represented fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Have you ever realized that when the Lord Jesus came to be baptized by John, He represented the God-created man and, in outward appearance, the fallen man?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We would emphasize the fact that the Lord Jesus did not have the actual nature of fallen man, but He did have the appearance of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in actual nature He represented the God-created man, and in appearance, likeness, but not in nature, He also represented fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In His actual human nature He represented the man created by God; in appearance He represented the man who had become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that fallen man certainly needs to be judged, terminated, and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have also seen that even the God-created man must be set aside in order to live a life in which the human virtues express the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this, even a good, complete, and perfect God-created man must be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the reason that the Lord Jesus as the God-man said in the Gospel of John that He did not do anything by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 5:19 He said, The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 5:30 He said again, I can do nothing from Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In John 8:28 the Lord declared, I do nothing from Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order that He might express God in His human living, at the beginning of His ministry the Lord put Himself aside through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was a perfect and complete Man, but He would not live by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, He lived by God the Father who was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This matter is crucial, and we all need to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our Need to Be Terminated and Buried</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first aspect of the Lord s inauguration was for Him to be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This principle applies to all of us in our service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would enter into a particular service to God, we need to be set aside; that is, we need to be terminated and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both as a God-created man and as a fallen man, we need to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first aspect of the Man-Savior s inauguration into His ministry for God was for Him to be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also need to be terminated and buried in the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE ANOINTING OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Immediately after the Lord Jesus was baptized, He was anointed by God: The Holy Spirit descended in bodily form as a dove upon Him; and a voice came out of heaven, You are My beloved Son, in You I delight v. 22 . After John the Baptist had baptized the Lord Jesus, God the Father sent His Holy Spirit upon this baptized Man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the Spirit of God descended upon a terminated and buried Man to inaugurate Him into His living ministry for God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit in Essence and in Power</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Holy Spirit s conceiving of Jesus in 1:35 is essential, related to the divine Being, the divine Person, of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The essence of the Holy Spirit s divine element in the conception of Jesus is unchangeable and cannot be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the Holy Spirit s descending upon Jesus here is economical, related to the ministry, the work, of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The power of the Holy Spirit for the ministry of Jesus 4:1, 14, 18; Matt 12:28 is removable according to the condition of need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was in this economical way that God forsook Jesus and left Him when He was carrying the sinners sin in dying for them on the cross Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before the Holy Spirit in power descended upon Him, He already had the Holy Spirit in essence from His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, while the Holy Spirit in power was descending upon Him, He was existing with the Holy Spirit in essence.</S>
