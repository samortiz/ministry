   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE TWO A WORD CONCERNING THE WRITINGS OF JOHN 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to give an introductory word concerning the writings of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we saw that John s writings are a revelation of divine things and that these writings are supplementary to the revelations of the other holy writings and complementary to the entire divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we go on, we shall see that John s writings are mysterious to human understanding and all-inclusive concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>MYSTERIOUS TO HUMAN UNDERSTANDING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The writings of John are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matters such as the divine life and the divine fellowship 1:2-3 , the anointing 2:27 , and the divine birth 3:9 certainly are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such things are mysterious because they are divine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Have you ever realized that from the day you received the Lord Jesus, you have been a mysterious person?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a person is not mysterious, I doubt whether that one has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead of asking others if they have been saved, we may want to check to see if they are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We Christians are mysterious because we have the mysterious divine life with the mysterious divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The divine life with the divine nature makes us mysterious beings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you know what a Christian is?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Christian is a person who is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we are mysterious, others should not be able to understand us so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, because we are mysterious, sometimes we shall be misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the church life and in our family life, there should also be an element of mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are mysterious persons with the mysterious life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>ALL-INCLUSIVE CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE PERSON OF CHRIST Unveiling the Divinity of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Manifested in His Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Toward the end of the first century, when the apostle John was writing his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation, there were already heresies concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One heretical teaching was that Christ was God but not man, and another heresy was that Christ was man but not God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Other heretics denied that Jesus was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of such a situation, John was burdened to write concerning the Person of Christ in an all-inclusive way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John s writings we see that Jesus is the Christ and that the Lord Jesus Christ is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we shall see, in chapter two of 1 John, the apostle John deals with the heresy of the Cerinthians, those who separate Christ from Jesus and thus deny that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we come to chapter four, we shall see that John deals with the heresy of the Docetists, those who deny that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The writings of John reveal that Christ is all-inclusive, that Jesus is the Christ, and that He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Polemical against Heresies</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In his writings the apostle John was polemical, not against the law, circumcision, or Judaism, but against the heresies of the Gnostics, Cerinthians, and Docetists.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word polemical or polemic refers to the fighting for the truth by debating or disputing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A person who is polemical will debate strongly and sharply on behalf of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He will fight for the truth and wage war for it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to follow John to be polemical against heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have pointed out that John was polemical against the heresies of the Gnostics, Cerinthians, and the Docetists.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One source of these heresies was Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As Paul was polemical in his writings against such matters as the law, circumcision, and Judaism, John was polemical against philosophical concepts that led to heresy.</S>
