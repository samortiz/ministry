   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BROTHER NEE'S TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may find this hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me try to state it another way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 5 contains many precious teachings, but how many Christians in the church are practicing them?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was young, I was once a class-leader at school.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was good at my studies, and none of my classmates were my equal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After I became a Christian, six classmates came to test me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They wanted to find out whether I practiced the teaching of Matthew 5.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was relatively easy not to retaliate when I was slapped.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But it was difficult to turn my left cheek after the right cheek was slapped.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I was slapped that day, I could not maintain my Christian composure any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I wished in my heart that the great white throne would come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After they left, I was happy that I had not hit back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when I went to the Lord in my prayer, I could only confess my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I realized that there was bitterness within me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The outward suffering may be the same, but whether or not there is bitterness within makes a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE STORY OF GOILS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There once was a brother in the Middle Ages by the name of Goils.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was a good brother, and he worked as a cook in a monastery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every time there was a conference in the monastery, men would come from many places, and he would prepare beef, lamb, chicken, duck, and vegetables for them for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The monastery was situated on a mountain, and it was not an easy task to prepare so much food and carry all the foodstuffs to the monastery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He wanted to listen in on the conference, and he was unwilling to lose the opportunity to listen to the sermons and just cook for the others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more he considered, the more he could not sleep at night.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, the Lord shone His light on him and showed him that the cross is a matter of giving and not receiving and that everything was under God's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He realized his own mistake and repented.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After he repented, he realized that the abbott's voice had become hoarse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He felt sorry for the abbott and prepared some special porridge for him when he came back from his work at midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here is a man who was bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He turned his left cheek to the others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, he became a blessing to many people through his knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THERE BEING NO HATRED, MURMURING,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AND SELF-PITYING WITH THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If turning the left cheek to others was merely a matter of performance, even unbelievers could do it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The issue is not about being slapped on the cheek, going the extra mile, or yielding the cloak; rather, it is about the ability to love from within and to be free from hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The cross is the place where hatred disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There can only be love, not hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why there is no murmuring with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ prayed for those who persecuted Him because there was no hatred in Him; there was only love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why He refused the wine mingled with gall.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do we see many Christians suffering today?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Surely we do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have seen many suffering wives, suffering fathers, suffering sons, etc. But I have also noticed the difference in their expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some do not say anything at the time of suffering this is the most common case , yet behind one's back they murmur a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we find ourselves murmuring after something is over, it means that there is a feeling of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The only reason we would need wine mingled with gall would be because we do not know what the cross is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Another group of people do not murmur or make any noise, yet they weep.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There may be blood on the cross, but there should be no tears on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A person weeps because he pities himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There was no self-pitying on the Lord's cross; there was only pity toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Francis Havergal was a person plagued with sickness, but he often said, "Everyone pities me because of my sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet I never pity myself, because Christ has borne all my sicknesses."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>ON THE CROSS AND BENEATH THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only those who are beneath the cross weep.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who are on the cross do not weep.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a man feels that he is wounded, he is not on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As soon as some people suffer a little, they feel that they are being martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But this is not the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord said, "If I be lifted up from the earth..."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>John 12:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every one who is crucified is one who is lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A crucified person is one who is on top.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you feel that you have been taken advantage of, that you have been slighted, you are a downtrodden one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you are truly crucified on the cross, you will not feel wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The minute you feel wounded, you are not on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The genuine cross only leads to silent prayers in the heart; there is no murmuring and no self-pitying.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as there is the feeling of suffering, there is the need of wine mingled with gall.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first thing we notice about Christ on the cross is that there was no murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If one encounters certain circumstances and feels pain, it proves that he does not have the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Wherever there is the feeling of pain, there is wine mingled with gall.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do not think that a smiling face indicates that people are bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Of course, neither does this mean that a weeping face indicates that people are not bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A person who is genuinely bearing the cross has no feeling of suffering whatsoever.</S>
