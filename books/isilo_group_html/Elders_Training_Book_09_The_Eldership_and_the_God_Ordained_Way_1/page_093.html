Criticism and gossip obviously are absolutely not from the Spirit. Whether a brother or sister takes this way or not, they are still in the hand of the Lord. Whether a church takes this way or not should be left to the Lord. All of the churches and all of the saints are members of the Body of Christ in the recovery. Whether someone takes this way or not should not concern us. But since we have seen something, we should be faithful to practice what we have seen.</P><P>We must also realize that the gifted persons have to perfect the saints. The best way and the best place to perfect the saints is in the group meetings. If you are a gifted person, you should go to a group meeting to perfect the saints in that group. When you are with them, you can observe them and get to know everyone's condition. Then you can not only perfect them in the meetings but also perfect them outside the meetings by going to be with them. Paul said in Acts 20 that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house (v. 20) and that he admonished each one with tears (v. 31). He taught the saints not only in the big meetings but also in the homes and one by one. This is a detailed, fine work. It takes much labor and time. If I am a person who has the portion, the capacity, and the gift to perfect the saints, I should attend a group meeting all the time. As everyone speaks in the group meeting, I will get to know their real situation. Then I can go to their homes to spend personal time with them. Perhaps I could visit one person each week to have a direct talk with each one of them. This is for the purpose of promoting each one's gifts, to develop his capacity, and to enrich his speaking. We can render much tutoring by this one-on-one contact. In this way the saints will be perfected face to face by some of the gifted persons. This labor will not be in vain because some saints will be perfected. Eventually, the saints will be perfected to do what the gifted persons do. Furthermore, the gifted persons will produce gifted persons.</P><P>In the old way, there was not such a result because the way was wrong. In this producing way, we all learn to do something and to share something, and we will fully use our capacity to function. Then the riches of Christ will come out of every member of His Body. We will perfect one another, and everyone will be perfected. It may be that in a five-year period, we will perfect someone. But after this, he will perfect us because he has learned more. By this God-ordained way, everyone will be perfected, everyone will be useful, and everyone will have the development of his capacity in the divine life. Every saint will be occupied, and no time, energy, or persons will be wasted. The numbers will increase, and the life and spiritual knowledge will grow. We need to cooperate with our Lord to take His ordained way to organically build up the Body of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_092.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 09: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (1) &nbsp; pg 93</div><br></body></html>
