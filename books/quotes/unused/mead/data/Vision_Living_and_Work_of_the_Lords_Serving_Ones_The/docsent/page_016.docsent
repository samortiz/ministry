   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SEVERAL MATTERS REQUIRING OUR ATTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we shepherd a new believer, we need to pay attention to several matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we should not act like a teacher and give lessons or admonitions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not his teacher; we are only a saint who has led him to salvation and who is also helping him to live the Christian life, to experience Christ, and to experience the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must have such an attitude and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should speak with an ordinary tone and not as a professor giving a lecture.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, we should speak clearly concerning regeneration and let the new believer know that through regeneration Christ lives in him to be his life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we speak of Christ being life, we must stress the matter of regeneration, for it is only through regeneration that Christ can come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Third, when we quote the Bible, we should avoid being complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The teaching concerning the experience of Christ as life is relatively deep and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are complicated, the new believer will be distracted and be in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fourth, we should endeavor to help him touch his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This requires practice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Experiencing Christ as life is a crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a rule, we should practice daily to experience Christ and take Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This requires us to continually exercise until we become skillful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE KERNEL OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One brother testified that when he was in the brothers house shepherding the high-school brothers, he exhorted them not only to study but also to be trained in their character and in their pursuit of spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He told them to learn to be joined to the Lord in every matter and to live according to the inner sense of life by calling on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For instance, they should not use someone else s toothpaste to brush their teeth, nor should they take up too much space with their towels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Strictly speaking, however, in order for these practices to be proper, they must be the manifestation of experiencing Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was young, I met a group of people who were not Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They had a cultivation according to the Chinese ethical philosophers, and thus their conduct was very proper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After I was saved, I met some saints who loved the Lord, but their outward conduct could not match that of the ethical group.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These Christians loved the Lord, but they did not walk or live according to the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not walk and live according to the indwelling Spirit, all the outward teaching concerning our character becomes regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if we walk according to the Spirit and live Christ, what we live out will correspond to the teaching concerning character.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The cultivation of a person s character, at most, can develop the bright virtue, as taught by Chinese ethical philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, as saved ones, we should walk according to the Spirit and live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we truly walk according to the Spirit, the standard of our living will be higher than the standard of human morality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Human cultivation of character is merely according to dead regulations, whereas a life that is lived out according to the Spirit is the expression of Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, when we serve in the brothers or sisters houses, we should not make outward demands, such as allotting a specific space for their towels.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, we should lead them in life, teaching them how to touch their spirit and to do things according to their spirit, not according to convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must realize that as saved ones, we have the Lord living in us, and He is leading us in every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the training center used by Brother Nee in Shanghai, there was a communal bathroom with water basins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The training required that we wash and wipe the basins clean after each use.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some brothers wiped the basins hastily and carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They did not keep the regulation, because they did not walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we walk according to the Spirit, even if there is no outward regulation, the Lord would lead us to keep the basins clean.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we walk according to the Spirit, we express something of life, something living, and not dead regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Others may think that we have a very high standard of cultivation, but we are walking according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I was young, older family members often taught us not to talk too much.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They would say maxims, such as When eating, do not talk, and The mouth is the primary source of calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, to live Christ is not to use maxims to restrict ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To live Christ is to let Christ live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When He speaks, we speak, and when He does not speak, we do not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our living and conduct are not according to the cultivation of ethical philosophers or maxims passed down from older generations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, we live Christ entirely according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can have a particular living by taking Christ as life; hence, it is altogether something living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The cultivation of character taught by ethical philosophers is dead in nature; it is merely an improvement in one s behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our practice should not be aimed at merely being correct outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, we should ask whether our correct behavior comes from cultivation or from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we walk according to the Spirit, there will be a situation in our living that is superior to that of the cultivation by ethical philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, our situation will be living and bright.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is most precious, and it is the kernel of the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I hope that every brother and sister in the Lord s recovery will live this kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the small group meetings we should speak more concerning taking Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to have more experience and more exercise in this matter.</S>
