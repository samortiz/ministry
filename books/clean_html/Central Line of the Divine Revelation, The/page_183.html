<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. A River of Water of Life</H2><P>The river of water of life flows from the throne of God and of the Lamb in the midst of the street to the twelve gates of the city to water the entire city (Rev. 22:1a). Where there is the street, there is the flow of life. Where there is the flow of life, there is the street. Our street, our way, is the flow of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Tree of Life</H2><P>The tree of life grows on the two sides of the river of water of life and produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month, to supply the entire city (Rev. 22:2a). The tree of life grows on the two sides of the river, and the river is in the midst of the street. Thus, the street, the river, and the tree are mingled together. These three items are spiraling from the throne through the entire city to reach the twelve gates. The entire city is supplied with the water of life and the fruit of life. This is the life supply of the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Uncreated Light,<br>the River of Water of Life, and<br>the Tree of Life Being<br>All for the Divine Dispensing</H2><P>The uncreated light, the river of water of life, and the tree of life are all for the divine dispensing to maintain the New Jerusalem, to supply the necessities of the holy city, and to sustain the divine building for eternity. The light shines to dispense, the river flows to dispense, and the tree grows to dispense. The light, the river, and the tree are for dispensing the very substance, element, and essence of the Triune God into our being. This dispensing mingles the Divine Trinity with the tripartite man. This mingling is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man.</P><P>This mingling is not easily carried out or completed. It is not so simple or direct. On God's side there was the need for Him to pass through many processes. On our side, we have to pass through five "-tions": redemption, regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Every "-tion" is a process. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of God's new creation work. This consummation is a mingling of the processed, consummated Triune God with the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite man. The mingling of divinity with humanity is the church. This is the intrinsic view of the church as the Body of Christ which consummates in the New Jerusalem, and this is the consummation of the entire Bible. The entire Bible consummates in this mingling, which is signified by the New Jerusalem.</P>
