   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S PRESENCE BEING LIFE TO ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of Babel, God was forced to give up the created race and to initiate another action His selection of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The record in Genesis concerning Abraham does not use the words life or light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, in reality the matters of life and light have much to do with God's selection of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's presence was with Abraham, and His presence was life to him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Abraham was called by God, he did not know where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not have a map or any detailed directions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's presence was his map, his guidance, and his supply.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's presence was life and everything to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apart from God's presence, Abraham had nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was surely a person who enjoyed the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the record in the book of Genesis, God appeared to Abraham a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, when God appeared to him, He spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, God's speaking was not as important to Abraham as God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Acts 7:2 indicates that Abraham was called by the appearing of the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GOD'S SPEAKING AND THE GROUND OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Abraham's descendants, the children of Israel, made their exodus from Egypt and were brought into the wilderness, they built a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God took up residence in this tabernacle, and, as a result, it became the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The books of Leviticus and Numbers are filled with God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Leviticus 1:1 indicates that the Lord spoke to Moses out of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, became the center of God's oracle, of God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Almost the entire book of Leviticus is a record of the Lord's speaking out of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If Moses and the children of Israel had departed from the tent of meeting, they could not have heard the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps some of the children of Israel said, "God is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What right do you have to claim that He speaks only out of the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are too narrow and too exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is great, and He is not limited to a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You cannot say that God speaks only in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You simply cannot limit the unlimited God to your little tent of meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yes, God is great, and He is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But according to the Old Testament, He was happy to reside in the tabernacle built for Him in the wilderness by His people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although heaven is spacious, God is not satisfied to remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, He did not speak to His people from heaven; He spoke to them out of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps you are wondering what this has to do with the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does God's speaking, you may ask, have to do with the church ground?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's speaking is intimately related to the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are on this ground, which is the proper ground, we shall have God's speaking day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we do not have the speaking of God, then we probably do not have the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the book of Leviticus, God spoke from the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The book of Leviticus is the result of this kind of divine speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, God spoke from oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When this oneness is lost, God's oracle is lost also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's speaking brings in light, and light issues in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we do not have God's speaking, we have death and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Death and darkness damage the Body and cause the members to become detached.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today's Christianity is filled with death and darkness because the genuine oneness in life is lacking.</S>
