   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS AND SPEAKING THE LORD S WORD IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have a kind of slogan that says, Heaven may fade, and earth may flee, but small group meetings must never be missed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, based on my observation, the taste of our small group meetings is not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the big meetings there are people who release messages to us, and once a message is given, the taste is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when we gather in the homes, we are accustomed to not speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, you do not speak, I do not speak, nor do the other brothers speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the end we can only look at each other, eat some dessert, and drink some water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is not much taste to our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is a co-worker serving in the United States in the city of San Francisco whose father is in a denomination where they have also adopted the way of small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This co-worker s father was assigned to lead a small group, and he told his son that when they came together, none of them spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, everyone left and felt that they did not need this kind of meeting because no one spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For a small group meeting to be enjoyable and rich, we must have the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are some saints among us who never speak, but if they were to open their mouths, the meeting would be enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The truths among us are pure, all-inclusive, and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have the truths concerning the cross, resurrection, the Spirit, life, the church, the essence of the church, the testimony of the church, and the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may say that we are a literate family.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now we have to grasp the opportunity to exercise to speak the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have the riches, and we also have the utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I believe that as long as we all exercise properly, we will all be able to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now I would like to have some fellowship with you and to make a request of you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, I hope that all of us would change our concept to pay more attention to the small groups than to the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not mean that we should not have big meetings but that we should put more emphasis on the small group meetings than on the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, from now on all the elderly saints must renew their youth and learn to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They all have the word in them and are rich inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now they simply need to learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that all the elderly saints would go to the small group meetings to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Pray-reading was brought in among us in Tainan in 1965.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The year after, in 1966, we began to call on the Lord in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later, in 1968 we developed the practice of speaking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This encouraged everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I remember one time in a meeting on the Lord s Day morning in Los Angeles when I asked everyone, Do you know what to say after you are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then I continued, At least you know how to say four words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first word is O, the second word is Lord, the third word is Amen, and the fourth word is Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From that day on, the words O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah became a short hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever we sang that hymn, the meeting was enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you come to the meeting, you may try to stand up to speak a few phrases such as, O Lord, thank You that You are so good!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then you may try to say something a little deeper such as, O Lord, thank You that You are so good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you had an experience, you may speak your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, perhaps you were not happy in the morning and felt that things were not going smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Usually in such a case you would grumble.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But that morning when you were about to grumble, you began to call inwardly, saying, O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then your grumbling disappeared, and your temper was gone because the Lord came in. This is a good and short experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If ten people were meeting together, and everyone spoke briefly like this, the meeting would surely be fresh and living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the secret to a rich meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A FEW PRACTICES CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>SPEAKING FOR THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all can do this because none of us are newly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if we were newly saved, we still would have the essential characteristic in us of being able to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, when we speak, we should not tell long stories.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some saints either do not speak or once they begin speaking do not stop.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They start with the first three generations of their ancestors and continue until everyone is bored.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So remember that when speaking for the Lord, do not talk about your history.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead, simply give a brief testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, you may say, This morning I was not that happy, but once I thought about the Lord Jesus and called on Him, my inner being was soothed, and I began to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, this whole day I have been very joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a good speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moreover, it is also good to speak about our experience of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, you may say, Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I had been worshipping idols for forty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One day the brothers and sisters from the church came to knock on my door and spoke to me from The Mystery of Human Life for five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then I was enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I felt that the Lord Jesus was very good, so I was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the past after telling a lie I could still live peacefully, but now if I tell a lie I feel sorrowful inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a very good testimony of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You do not need to tell the story from your birth or describe many unrelated processes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we give a testimony, we are often afraid that people may not understand what we are saying, so we try to say more.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we speak for the Lord, we often think that people may not understand, so we want to teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, this is not needed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we speak in the meetings, we should not speak long.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not shut our mouths, but neither should we speak without end.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have all heard the story about D. L. Moody.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He was very powerful in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some saints who met with him often prayed without end. One time Brother Moody was leading a meeting in which a sister was praying in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Finally, he felt that he had waited too long and said to everyone, Saints, while our dear sister is still praying, let us sing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We encounter similar situations all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Such situations are hard to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, in the meetings we have to avoid being silent while at the same time avoid speaking too long, telling stories, or giving our history.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All these practices should be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should only speak the Lord Jesus and our experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Besides speaking for the Lord, we all have to be responsible to bring people to the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should not bring unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Rather, we should bring those who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Today in Taiwan it is convenient to make phone calls to invite people.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We do not need to wait until tomorrow to make a phone call.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Today after the meeting we can call a saint who was not present.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We may share with him the content of our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We may tell him that the brothers and sisters care for him and that we hope he can come to our small group meeting in two days.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then two days later, we may call him again to remind him in the morning in case he forgot.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then in the evening we may give him a third call, asking if he needs a ride to go to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This kind of care is very much needed.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have to realize that nothing we do will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the noblest and the most valuable thing we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Preaching the gospel is the most glorious matter in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We are bringing blessing, love, grace, and God s salvation to people s homes.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Although we are knocking at people s doors, troubling and bothering them, we are actually giving them grace and the best book among the human race the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>What we are doing is the best.</S>
