   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN THAT DAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us read verses 19 and 20: "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here the Lord tells us about the purpose behind His putting off the flesh and coming as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The goal of this is that the believers may know that "I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you," that a full and perfect union may be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This fact would come about only "in that day," the day that Christ in the Spirit came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only in that day would we know the oneness of having Christ in the Father, us in Christ, and Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This union moreover transmits to us everything that God did in Christ and everything that God is through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All of His becomes all of ours.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God and man, man and God, become fully mingled into one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>ONE SPIRIT WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ died and rose for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if He had not come to us in the Holy Spirit, salvation could not be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ could not be joined to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He would be like the old tutor of mine, only wishing that somehow He could get inside of me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But now Christ has taken on a spiritual form.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He can come freely into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have the possibility of receiving Him because He is now in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible also says that "he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit" 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of us also have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When our spirit receives this Christ who is in the Spirit into us, the two become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the gem of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without this, our belief is a common religion with no relevance to our life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without this, there cannot be an inward salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A CLOSER CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Read again John 16:7: "But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here the Lord is telling us the truth of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as He was in His flesh, the Comforter could not come.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When there was the Christ in the flesh, there could never be the Christ in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why His death was expedient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was in Shanghai, a friend said, "It is too bad that Christ ascended up to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If He were still on earth today, I would definitely go and seek after Him no matter how far He was from me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How I wish I could be like the disciples of His day, who had the privilege of walking, living, and eating together with the Master."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As I was listening, I looked intently into his eyes and said, "I would never wish to be like Peter and John and those others!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He asked, "What do you mean?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Do you know," I said, "that the Christ whom I know is far closer to me than the One that Peter knew on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone who has received Christ should be able to say that our Christ is not merely the Christ in the flesh whom Peter touched; our Christ is the Christ in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their Christ was One who could be separated from them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He could be with them one day and be gone the next.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our Christ, however, abides with us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wherever we are, there He is also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am not afraid even of going to hell, for if I go, God in me will go with me."</S>
