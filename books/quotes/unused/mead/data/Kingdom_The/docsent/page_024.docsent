   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BAPTISM OF THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Lord Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit came down upon Him in the form of a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was conceived of the Holy Spirit Luke 1:31, 35; Matt 1:20 , and the Holy Spirit was mingled with His human nature within.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord Jesus came to be baptized, He was already a man whose human element was mingled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since He was mingled with the Spirit already, how could the Spirit as a complete unit descend upon Him?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Are there two Holy Spirits?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Did not the Lord Jesus have the Holy Spirit already?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although He had been conceived of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit nevertheless came down from the heavens as a complete unit and descended upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was already mingled with the Holy Spirit, yet the Holy Spirit still came down upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John said, "He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit" Matt 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This raises a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How does He baptize us?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When does He baptize us?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we could gather together all the Christian teachers from the first century to the present, they would fight until eternity about this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No one can systematize it; no one can make it clear.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, I do know that the Lord Jesus baptized Peter, I know He baptized me, and I know He baptized you into the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How He did it no one can adequately explain.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Psalm 139 indicates that we do not even know how we were formed and created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet we do know that God created us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is hard for you to tell me how God created you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although you may not know how you were created, you do know that you were created because you are here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, I do not really know how the Lord Jesus baptized me, but I do know that I have been baptized by Him because I am so excited about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I had never been baptized by Christ, I could not be so excited about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How we do not know, but He has baptized us into the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Don't try to analyze.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Analysis only damages.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Bible there is no such thing as systematic theology.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do know that we have been baptized into the Spirit and that we are here with the seed inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus has been sown into us in a way that is without culture and without religion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE VICTORIOUS SEED</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we come to chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus is the seed of the kingdom to be sown into us, but before He could be sown into us He first had to pass the test.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He had to defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So He went to the wilderness to meet the enemy and was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The leader of the demons was defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Devil was defeated, not by God, but by a man, Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The enemy tempted the Lord Jesus not to stand on the position of a man, saying, "If You are the Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread" Matt 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He answered, "Man shall not live on bread alone" Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He stood as a man and defeated the enemy.</S>
