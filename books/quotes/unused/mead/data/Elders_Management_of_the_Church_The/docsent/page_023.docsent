   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING HONEST IN THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Honesty here does not refer to the absence of lying and cheating.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It refers to truthfulness and genuineness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It means to neither speak with twisting words nor exercise any tactfulness or manipulating.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If things can be done, you simply do them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they cannot be done, you simply do not do them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no maneuvering of tactfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In these years, I have seen many dishonest things among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes, even when a brother gives you a piece of clothing, he is not being honest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you understand what I am saying?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He gives you that piece of clothing, not because he loves you and feels that you need some clothing, but because he wants you to do something for him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is afraid that you may not fulfill his request.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is why he gives you the piece of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please remember that this is something that comes from a dishonest heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among the Gentiles it would not be considered deceitful, but in the church this is dishonesty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times those who are elders are too seasoned.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Forgive me for saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are far too seasoned, to the point that they have become crafty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Inwardly, such a one may not be at all satisfied with you, but outwardly, he is smiling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is right for him not to lose his temper with others even when he is not satisfied with them, but neither should he pretend outwardly to be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such a one should have a sober attitude before others; he should make the others realize that he is not pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is right for you not to lose your temper, but it is not right for you to pretend with a smiling face.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must behave yourself from an honest heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In any social organization, people may pretend, and may exercise politics, and use manipulating.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the brothers and sisters, especially those who are elders, should only be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must learn to have an honest heart before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our words, our expression, our attitude, and our contacts with the brothers and sisters must all be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers, whenever you are not genuine, it means that you have a motive, and to have a motive means that you are being political.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In typology this is the leprosy on the garment as mentioned in Leviticus 13.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I give something to a brother, it should be because I have such a burden, feeling, and love from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What I do outwardly comes from what I have within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is very beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if I never had such a burden, guidance, or love, it is leprosy to give a brother something in order to obligate him to do something for me in return.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This must never be done.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It may be done in society, but not in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I must repeat this again and again: it is true that we cannot lose our temper whenever we like, and we cannot speak carelessly, but at the same time we must not try to manipulate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our outward attitude should manifest the inward condition of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Never consider this matter lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you want to be a genuine elder, you will find this lesson quite difficult to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To refrain from being political yet at the same time not lose your discipline before God is not an easy thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers, you have to forgive me for saying this: sometimes when you become too seasoned in handling matters, you have in reality become a two-faced person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One of the faces is light, while the other is dark.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, one face is black and the other is white.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No elder can behave himself this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is equivalent to an elder having a double tongue and speaking two different kinds of words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>An elder can only have one expression and one manifestation inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope all the brothers would learn this lesson.</S>
