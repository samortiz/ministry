   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE EPISTLES 100 115.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our Abiding Place</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 John 2:5-29; 3:5-8, 24; and 4:9-15, we see that we may enjoy Christ, who is a living person, as our abiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>a. God Sending His Son into the World</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>as a Propitiation for Our Sins That We Might Live through Him, and as the Savior of the World That Whosoever Confesses That Jesus Is the Son of God,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God Abiding in Him and He in God 1 A Propitiation for Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First John 4:9 says, In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this verse we see God s intention and goal in sending the Son: God sent the Son so that we might live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Living through the Son implies having the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we did not have life through Him, we could not live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, living through the Son implies that we have received Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God sent His Son, and we have received Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God came to be a man so that we could have His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If He had never been a man, He could not come into us and we could not have Him as our divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Incarnation was for the impartation of the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 9 John says that God sent His Son, the only begotten, into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As in 1 Timothy 1:15, the world here refers to fallen mankind, whom God so loved that, by making them alive through His Son with His own life John 3:16 , they may become His children 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen that in 1 John 4:9 John tells us that God sent His Son into the world that we might live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We, the fallen people, are not only sinful in nature and conduct Rom 7:17-18; 1:28-32 but also dead in our spirit Eph 2:1, 5; Col 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God sent His Son into the world not only to be a propitiation for our sins that we might be forgiven 1 John 4:10 but also to be life to us that we might have life and live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the love of God, the Son of God saves us not only from our sins by His blood Eph 1:7; Rev 1:5 but also from our death by His life 1 John 3:14-15; John 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is not only the Lamb of God who takes away our sin 1:29 ; He is also the Son of God who gives us eternal life 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He died for our sins 1 Cor 15:3 that we might have eternal life in Him John 3:14-16 and live through Him 6:57; 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this the love of God, which is God s essence, has been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1 John 4:10, John goes on to say, Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word herein refers to the following fact: not that we have loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this fact is the higher and nobler love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word propitiation indicates that the Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins Heb 9:28 , not only for our redemption but also for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through His vicarious death and in Him as our Substitute, God is satisfied and appeased.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, He is the propitiation between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We had a problem in our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, God sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins in order to restore our relationship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did this because of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although sin caused a problem in our relationship with God, we had no thought of dealing with our sin in order to restore our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if we desired to restore this relationship, we would have had no ability or way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, God s love caused Him to send His Son to accomplish this matter for us before we even had such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since our sins brought us under the requirements of God s righteousness and holiness, God could not receive us or abide with us peaceably.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, God s love caused Him to send His Son as a propitiation for our sins so that He could receive us and abide with us peaceably according to the requirements of His righteousness and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s love fulfilled all the demands of God s righteousness and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1 John 4:9 we see that God sent His Son in order that we might live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 10 we see that God sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we consider these verses together, we will see that God s sending His Son as a propitiation for our sins is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, this is a procedure for arriving at the goal, and the goal is that we may have life and live through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, God sent His Son as a propitiation for us with the intention that through His Son we may have life and live.</S>
