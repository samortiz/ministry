With the Love, the Grace, and the Fellowship<br />of the Divine Trinity as Factors</h2><p>The grace in God&rsquo;s economy in the believers&rsquo; experience is the processed Triune God with the love, the grace, and the fellowship of the Divine Trinity as factors (2 Cor. 13:14).</p><h2 class="head3">1. With the Love of God the Father, Who Is<br />over All and through All and in All, as the Source</h2><p>In the love, the grace, and the fellowship of the Divine Trinity, the love of God the Father, who is over all and through all and in all, is the source (Eph. 4:6; 2 Cor. 13:14b). We say that the Triune God is mingled with us, but some do not receive this word. On the contrary, they say that God can be united with us but not mingled with us. I would ask, then, why it says here that God the Father is over us, through us, and in us? Is this merely a union? This is not merely a union; it is mingling.</p><h2 class="head3">2. With the Grace of God the Son, Who Abides in<br />the Believers and Makes His Home<br />in Their Hearts, as the Element</h2><p>In the love, the grace, and the fellowship of the Divine Trinity, the grace of God the Son, who abides in the believers and makes His home in their hearts, is the element (John 15:5; Eph. 3:17; 2 Cor. 13:14a). The love of the Father is the source, whereas the grace of the Son is the element.</p><h2 class="head3">3. With the Fellowship of God the Spirit,<br />Who Dwells in the Believers and Is Mingled with Their Spirit as One Spirit, as the Distribution</h2><p>In the love, the grace, and the fellowship of the Divine Trinity, the fellowship of God the Spirit, who dwells in the believers and is mingled with their spirit as one spirit, is the distribution (Rom. 8:11, 16; 2 Cor. 13:14b). The Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit distributes the Triune God into us that we may take Him as our life and our person to live out His image and express Him.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS&rsquo; LIVING<br />UNDER THE GRACE IN GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />BEING A TOTAL LIVING OF EXPERIENCING<br />THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD AS GRACE</h2><p>The New Testament believers&rsquo; living under the grace in God&rsquo;s economy is a total living of experiencing the processed Triune God as grace. It is not a matter of what to do; that is not a total living. A total living means that my entire living is a living of the Triune God processed to be grace in me. It is not a matter of whether or not to judge others; that is not a total living but a fragmented living. A total living means that twenty-four hours a day, whether I am awake or asleep, I take the Triune God as my life and my person. I follow His move; I move with Him. Two spirits become one spirit, two lives live together, and two natures are mingled together. This is the total living of experiencing the Triune God as grace. A total living is not the living concerning right and wrong, good and evil, or anything else, but the living of a living person. The living of this living person is the mingled living of the processed Triune God with the tripartite transformed man. Thus, God becomes our grace, and we live in this grace. This is the grace referred to in the New Testament. Our experience of the grace in God&rsquo;s economy is the mutual living of the processed Triune God and us joined together, taking Him as our life and person. He initiates, and we follow; He and we move together to live out a certain condition, which is called an organism, to express God Himself. Here, there is no concept of right and wrong or good and evil. The law is a photo of God for the old covenant, whereas grace is God Himself. We do not care for the photo; we care for the living person.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Law and Grace of God in His Economy &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
