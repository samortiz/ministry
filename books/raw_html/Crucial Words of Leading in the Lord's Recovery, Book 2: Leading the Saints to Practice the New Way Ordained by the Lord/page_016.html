 <h2 class="head3">Speaking for the Lord<br />
and Speaking forth the Lord</h2>
<p>When we practice prophesying, we must bear in mind that to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Prophesying for the Building Up<br />
of the Church&mdash;the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>We all need to see that prophesying is for the building up of the church, the building up of the Body of Christ (vv. 4-5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING IN LIFE UNTO MATURITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Having the Experiences of Life Themselves</h2>
<p>The first thing the elders need to pursue is that they may advance and abound in the knowledge of the truth. The second thing they need to pursue is the growth in life unto maturity; they must first have the experiences of life themselves.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ministering to Others</h2>
<p>The elders not only need to pursue the growth in life; they also need to be able to minister to others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">For the Building Up of the Church<br />
and the Producing of<br />
Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones as Materials</h2>
<p>Our former condition was that not much gold, silver, and precious stones were produced. If all the churches in every locality want to produce gold, silver, and precious stones, the elders must be the first in whom gold, silver, and precious stones are produced. These materials will be produced from the knowledge of the truth and the growth in life; these are the basic factors. Only these two factors&mdash;the knowledge of the truth and the growth in life&mdash;are able to produce gold, silver, and precious stones (3:10, 12). Both are indispensable. In order to produce gold, silver, and precious stones, both truth and life are needed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE REVIVED EVERY MORNING<br />
AND TO LIVE AN OVERCOMING LIFE EVERY DAY</h2>
<p>Throughout history, the revivals brought in by the Pentecostal movement were all short-lived because of the shortage of life. Fifty years ago we too promoted this kind of revival, but because of the experience we have gained in the past fifty years, in addition to seeing the lack of influence left from those revivals, we now have a greater realization of the importance of life. We truly need a revival, but this revival must be lasting. If a person lives on the earth for only twenty years, his existence is not that significant, but if a person lives up to eighty years, his existence is more significant. In other words, only something that lasts is significant. What we ask of God is a lasting revival, that is, one that follows God&rsquo;s law of creation, in which there is a new beginning every morning like that of the dawning of the day. Only this kind of revival is meaningful. We need to be revived every morning.</p>
<p>Moreover, we need to confess our sins every day, not only once but many times. This may be compared to washing our hands. We wash our hands every day, not once but many times. A brother who is a medical doctor said that he washes his hands over twenty times a day because he contacts at least ten patients a day. He washes his hands before and after he contacts each patient. If a doctor does not want to get sick, he needs to wash his hands frequently.</p>
<p>No matter how perfect a person may think himself to be, if he does not confess his sins, his living is a failure. If he lives an overcoming life, there will be the confession of sins every day. We have failures, shortcomings, and are negligent throughout the day; we are not that upright and righteous. There are many sins that we need to confess. Experience tells us that after our hands have been washed, they become contaminated within five minutes. This contamination is not from without but secreted from within. This contamination requires our cleansing. For example, when someone picks up a clean cup, he will find that after a while the handle of the cup becomes oily; this is due to the oil secreted from his hand. We need to realize that we are filthy. When we live for an hour, there is an hour of filth. Our source is unclean. As long as we live, we are unclean. Hence, we need to confess and constantly ask for the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing. The degree to which we confess our sins is the degree to which we are forgiven, cleansed, and able to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
