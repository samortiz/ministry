TO BE DELIVERED FROM METHODS</h2>
<p>Although we may study doctrines, methods, and formulas that are proper and even biblical, they can touch only our mind, not our spirit. Even prayer can be a work that is based on mental comprehension rather than on the exercise of our spirit in order to live one with the Lord. The same can be said concerning the giving of a message. No matter how much of our content comes from the Bible, our speaking can fall into a set formula. We should not do this any longer; our messages should come out of our living in spirit, our living and walking with the Lord.</p>
<p>It is not easy for us to stop relying upon methods. For example, we have picked up the practices of Brother Lawrence and Madame Guyon. This is not bad, but it is rather superficial; there is even a sense that we are borrowing someone else&rsquo;s spiritual experiences. Even though we can accomplish something by working according to methods, this is not what the Lord wants today. The Lord wants to live in us. We must let Him live in us, and we must live by Him and with Him. We really need the Lord to save us from relying upon methods and formulas.</p>
<p>In giving a message, we should not repeat the words from reference materials in a rote manner. We must absorb the content in our spirit and release it from our spirit. Only this will provide a living supply. Furthermore, we must reject the concept that we should not repeat what others have spoken, as if it is a shame to repeat the speaking of others. This is a wrong concept. If we have such a concept, it shows that we have a lack of appreciation for what we have received. If our messages are like gold and diamonds, we should not be afraid to &ldquo;display&rdquo; them a thousand times. The American brothers regard the repetition of the ministry messages as an honor. They often imitate one another and practice giving the same messages. They do not have the thought that a message that has been released elsewhere does not need to be released to their locality. It is altogether fleshly to have the thought that following others is a shame.</p>
<p>Some young brothers are in a precarious position before the Lord because they have a different spirit, even though they have some revelation. A different spirit gives opportunity to the enemy. If we let a different spirit develop, there will be serious divisions. The young people need to advance but not be rash. Whoever goes to an extreme will lose the Lord&rsquo;s presence. May the Lord give us the discernment.</p>
<p>May God have mercy on us so that we learn to have a proper spirit. Outward mistakes do not matter so much, but our spirit must be right. It is wrong to see a revelation and then condemn others based on this revelation. Although I may rebuke, I do not condemn. Rebuking without condemning is different from rebuking and condemning. It is better to know how to listen than how to speak. I have heard a different spirit in the words of some brothers. Even though they do not mean to dispute, something is not quite right in their words. Satan is quite deceitful; we must guard against him. If we have a different spirit and allow it to develop, we will get into trouble. This will result in a loss to ourselves and also to the church. If we have a different spirit, we need to be purified by the Lord.</p>
<p>We are not controlled by any method or by any person; instead, we are controlled by the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s present way, the Lord&rsquo;s present flow. Because we have seen this vision, we are burdened to supply this word to every place. Some places follow quickly, whereas others follow slowly, but this is not a problem. The only thing that matters is being in the flow. We should endeavor in spirit to practice the things that we have heard step by step and little by little.</p>
<p>We should not think that these words apply only to others; before the Lord we should apply them to ourselves. It is also dangerous to try to adjust others based on the things that we have recently seen and experienced. Satan can hide behind our &ldquo;adjustment&rdquo; and do a destroying work. The Holy Spirit is never rash; the brothers who have a rash disposition should pray in order to be clear concerning what to say and what not to say. The main cause of car accidents is excessive speed. When drivers lower their speed, the number of car accidents is reduced.</p>
<p>I have learned many lessons over the years in serving the Lord. Those who charge forward too quickly fall more easily into the hands of the devil. We should never charge forward too quickly, because our sense of urgency is often misplaced. Even if we are greatly burdened about a matter, we do not need to act hastily. If something is of the Lord, the Lord will make the best arrangement for it. Anything that is too impulsive will become unhealthy. This tendency can be seen in the Pentecostal movement. We have studied the Pentecostal movement for many years, and we have considered it in relation to the Scriptures. In our study we have found that many of the impulsive and rash elements of the Pentecostal movement are unscriptural. From reading Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, we can see that he did not speak in an impulsive or rash manner; he considered what he wrote in the light of the Lord (1 Cor. 7:25, 40).</p>
<p>Even if we have a specific burden, we should not be impulsive when we contact others. Even if others are not where we are, impulsive and rash efforts will yield only opposite results. We must learn to let the Lord work, and we should simply move forward, walking according to the spirit without a condemning tone. We should avoid being impulsive or rash even in our own movement forward. We should be balanced and avoid being too impulsive. When we sense that we have received some leading from the Lord, we should examine whether it is of the spirit or of the self. This kind of examination applies more to speaking a word of rebuke than it does to speaking a word of supply. We must be careful not to be impulsive or rash when it comes to speaking a word that touches someone&rsquo;s shortcomings. Even if we feel that we must say something, it is best to bring it to the Lord first. After waiting half a day, we may feel that we should not speak in such a way, and after another half a day, we may have a sense to speak of the matter in a different way. In this way we will avoid much trouble.</p>
<p>It seems as if some brothers are bearing the burden of their local church, the burden of churches elsewhere, and even the burden of the whole world. This is too much. They should be quiet in spirit and bring the church in their locality on in spirit until it becomes living and enjoys the Lord richly. There is no need for them to promote their way or to condemn others for not following them. For example, the brothers in the church in Tainan should not touch the problems of the brothers in the church in Taipei. They should just stand on the ground of the church in Tainan and advance steadily to supply the saints in spirit and to cause the young people to grow. Even when there is a conference or a training for all of Taiwan, we should speak positively without any tone of rebuke or condemnation.</p>
<p>It is proper to be burdened but not to the point that we condemn others. Condemnation does not help, and those who condemn are the ones who are hurt the most. It is easy to be short of maturity and to be lacking in the riches to supply the churches. Even if we have seen a little, Satan can hide behind our condition and seduce us to measure others according to what we have seen, while forgetting our own condition. We should never measure others according to a &ldquo;ruler.&rdquo; Instead, we should remain in what we have seen, advance steadily and quietly in our local church in a lowly spirit, experience the Lord, and grow, mature, and be filled with life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Serving in the Flow of the Age &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
