   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONFORMED TO HIS IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is by this experience of gaining Christ that we also know the fellowship of His suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By this fellowship of His suffering we are conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is even higher than transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Transformation is something within; it is a matter of essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But conformity is something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ has a form, and we need to be conformed to His form.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is only possible by the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not a kind of suffering because of our sins or mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a suffering for the life of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the life of the Body, we need a kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the Body of Christ will be increased in life through our suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>REJOICE IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter four, Paul tells us to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God Phil 4:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To rejoice is a little different from being joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just to be joyful is not to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To rejoice means to be joyful with some kind of praising and thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is impossible to rejoice and remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes we have to shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jesus is so wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To rejoice means to let your joy be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have noticed that some saints, according to their disposition, can never rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I never saw their face beaming and their mouth rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The most they can do is smile a little.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But this is not rejoicing!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I don t mean to teach you to do this, but we have to be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christians must be rejoicing people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if we are alone in our home, we still must rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No one may be visible, but there are many invisible ones watching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are rejoicing and praising the Lord, all the demons are cringing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why the victorious life is a rejoicing life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then Paul tells us to be careful for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to today s meaning, some might think that this means to be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the real meaning is not to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some versions say that we should be anxious for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are rejoicing, it is certain that we are not worrying.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the more we try not to worry, the more we will worry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>LEARNING THE SECRET</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How can we not worry but rejoice?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In ourselves it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if we have learned the secret of taking Christ as our person through His indwelling, it is so spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the last part of this chapter, Paul tells us that he had learned the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: everywhere and in all things I have learned the secret both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I can do all things in Christ who empowers me Phil 4:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul was not always so abounding, rich, and full.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many times he was abased.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was even hungry and had nothing to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet he had learned the secret both to be abased and to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Almost all of us have a kind of religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a brother becomes poor, we say that either he does not know how to manage himself, or he must be wrong with the Lord in some area.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But how about the Apostle Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Was God punishing him?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He did suffer poverty, but not because he was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather that afforded him an opportunity to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To him riches or poverty were of the same color.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whether the circumstances were good or not so good, he had learned the secret to rejoice in the Lord always.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many times when I am worrying about something, the Lord rebukes me: Why don t you enjoy Me as the One that takes care of you?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why not let Me worry for you?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we learn the secret of taking Christ as our person, we learn to cast all our care upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Philippians, a book that speaks about Paul s circumstances, we see the secret for the Christian life and the practical way for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That is, we must learn to take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must let Him replace us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We cannot rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot be anxious for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our life is full of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>CASTING ALL OUR CARE ON HIM</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are many verses in the Bible which are precious promises of God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In Matthew 6 the Lord promises us that we don t need to be anxious for food, drink, or clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Father knows what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then 1 Peter 5:7 says, Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He indwells us and bears all our cares.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He not only bears our burdens, He even bears us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, why should we worry?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We cannot add one inch to our height by worrying.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must fully give ourselves over to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I realize that to say this is easy, but to put it into practice is much more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we try to rejoice, after we shout three times, we start worrying.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We hardly have any faith at all.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must forget about ourselves and turn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Let the Lord live for you.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Let Him bear all the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Cast all your cares upon Him, for He cares for you.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Since He cares for us, we don t need to care.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I realize that regardless of what I say, you will still care very much.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But you have a Person within you.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Turn to Him and let Him bear all your burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When we are in good circumstances, it is easy to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But when we are in bad circumstances, we can never praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Today the sun is shining, but yesterday it was cloudy.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Some days are full of sunshine, and some days are cloudy.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But when we read Paul s life, we see that he had learned the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The secret is the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Whether it is sunny or cloudy, whether the circumstances are good or bad, we have a wonderful Person living within us, bearing all our burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We must only learn to turn to Him and let Him be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>THE SECRET OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Now we see from this book the practical way to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is simply to realize all the time that the indwelling Christ is our secret.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is not a matter of how to face the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>That is politics.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Only the politicians must learn how to face the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We simply let the situations turn to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All of our circumstances teach us to learn the secret to live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is the main lesson of this whole book.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>All the circumstances force us to give up ourselves and take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Of course, there is not this kind of terminology, but there is the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Philippians is not a book of teachings or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Paul simply tells us something of his own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>And through his experience we learn of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We learn to let Christ be magnified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We learn that we can do all things in Christ who empowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Whether we are rich or poor, high or low, we have learned the secret that Christ lives in us to be our person, bearing all of our burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Therefore, all we have to do is rejoice evermore.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>This is the key to the Christian life, and this is the practical way of the church life.</S>
