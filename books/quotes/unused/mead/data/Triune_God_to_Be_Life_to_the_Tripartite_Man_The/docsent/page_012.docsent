   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through death He accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We needed redemption because we could not meet the threefold requirement of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as God's requirements are unsatisfied, God has no way to enter into us.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the negative side of Christ's death, signified by the shedding of His blood John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through His Resurrection,</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the positive side of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His divine life could be released from within the shell of His humanity John 12:24 only by death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is ready to enter into our spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our spirit is the destination of His journey.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ has taken several steps in His journey through incarnation to be man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His first step was to enter into the womb of a virgin Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His second step was to come out of that womb to be a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His third step was to walk on the earth in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The goal of such a walk is the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in order to enter into the spirit of man, Christ had to die on the cross to redeem man, and He had to rise from among the dead to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the Spirit, He can enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When man calls upon the name of the Lord, He arrives at His destination.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ's becoming the life-giving, life-dispensing Spirit is the last step of His coming to man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now only one thing is needed: we must believe into Him in order to have eternal life John 3:16, 36a; 20:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way to believe into Him is to call upon His name Rom 10:9, 13 .</S>
