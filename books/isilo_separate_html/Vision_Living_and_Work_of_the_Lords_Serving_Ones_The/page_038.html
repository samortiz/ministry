<h1 class="title">THE LIVING AND CONDUCT<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES</h1>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A GOAL</h2>
<p>Beginning with this chapter, we will cover some important matters that serving ones should pay attention to. We first will consider the living and conduct of the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones. One who serves the Lord should have a vision, which we may call a goal. Our goal can be high or basic. An example of a basic goal is to preach the gospel to save souls, that is, to bring people to the Lord Jesus for the salvation of their souls. Although this is a basic goal, it is nevertheless a goal. We should regard preaching the gospel as an important thing in our life. We should never give it up. Furthermore, our entire being should be captured by it. As those who serve the Lord, we should have a clear goal.</p>
<p>I was called by the Lord on the day that I was saved. At that time I did not understand what it means to be called. Later, I realized that I was called on that day. While I was walking home, I had a feeling within, so I lifted up my head, looked up toward heaven, and said that I no longer wanted anything that the world could offer me, not even to be an emperor; I simply wanted to preach the gospel from village to village. That was the extent of my understanding. I never thought that one day the Lord would open His New Testament economy to me. This is an extremely high goal. However, whether a matter is high or basic, it must serve as a goal.</p>
<p>As the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones, we each should have a clear goal. This goal will be the compass in our living. This is similar to setting sail in the dark night or in the fog; a person must have a compass to set the direction. A young man in his twenties should have a goal. This is not a matter of blessing or curse; it is not a matter of having a future or not having a future; neither is it a matter of comfort or suffering. We must have a goal in our life, in other words, a purpose in our life.</p>
<p>I have been serving the Lord for almost sixty years, and I have never regretted this. On the contrary, the more I serve, the more I am inwardly assured that this is the best choice. However, this was not up to me; it was the Lord&rsquo;s choice, His calling, and His leading. Every serving one should have a clear goal. Whether or not we are married, serve full time, are poor or rich, live in a small village or a big city, preach the gospel to fishermen, or preach the truth to scholars, we should have a clear goal. Marriage, occupation, blessings, or sufferings will not change us. The entire revelation in the Bible shows that for the accomplishing of His will, the Lord desires to gain a group of people who know and take His intention as their goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING TO MAKE PROGRESS</h2>
<p>A person who serves the Lord must always pursue to make progress. Those who serve the Lord are people of the highest class. They might not be doctors of philosophy or scholars, but they must continuously progress in their learning and pursuit; they must not come to a standstill. Not only should we have general knowledge; we should also understand the tendencies in human life. We do not need to become experts or to obtain an advanced degree, but we need to learn and make progress every day.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning Both the Chinese and English Languages</h2>
<p>Most of our young people in Taiwan are college graduates. They need to improve their Chinese so that they are able to express their ideas orally and in writing. Those who serve the Lord should be very particular about their writing and speech. Those who are Chinese should at least be fluent and skilled in the Chinese language. I also encourage the Chinese students to diligently study English. English has become the world language. Since those who do not serve the Lord are learning English, we, as the Lord&rsquo;s workers, have a greater need to know English. If we know English, we will be able to go to any place in the world without hindrance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the World Situation</h2>
<p>In addition to learning languages, we need to know the world situation. I began paying attention to the world situation when World War I ended in 1918. At that time the magazine that helped me the most was <em>Eastern Miscellany</em> published in Shanghai by The Commercial Press. This magazine was authoritative and highly regarded internationally. Its discussions on international treaties and the various issues among the nations rendered much knowledge on international affairs. From that time onward, I have not stopped the habit of reading the newspapers. My interest, however, is limited to understanding the international situation; I am not interested in other matters.</p>
<p>I was born in Chefoo in northern China and attended an English college; hence, I know English and have common knowledge concerning international matters. In 1958 I went abroad for the first time and had no difficulties visiting many countries in Europe and America. When I ran into problems, I was able to assert my position using English. I was even invited to give messages when I was in London, England. However, many Chinese people are at a disadvantage when they go abroad because they lack language abilities and an international perspective. Do not think that it is superfluous to learn another language, especially English. Not only should we know how to speak Chinese, but we should also learn English; otherwise, we will not be able to travel in many places of the world. Even if we do not go abroad, we can use English to read reference books. Hence, I encourage you to learn English.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
