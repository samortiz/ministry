We can take some time in the regular meetings of the church to speak to the saints, making the God-ordained way clear to them
The leading ones and some of the leading seeking ones should take the lead to practice, in a definite way, each step of the God-ordained way
The amount of time we spend with the new ones in home meetings depends upon our discernment of their situation
We need to get into the printed ministry that has been released on the group meetings so that we can carry them out in an organic way
If a new one says that she does not know why she has to be baptized, all of the attendants can say something to answer her question
In this way all can be perfected to do the work of the building up of the Body of Christ, that is, to prophesy
When we function and are expecting to function, the meeting becomes an enjoyment to us, and we desire to come to the meeting
We need to pray definitely for the purpose of carrying out the God-ordained way in all the churches with much patience and learning
The leading ones will have to contact the others to fellowship with them so that they can gradually enter into the new way
In this way all of us will receive the mutual help in carrying out God's ordained way to organically build up the Body of Christ
In principle, we should not let anything frustrate us from keeping this time set apart for the Lord's interests
