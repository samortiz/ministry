   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some can only teach people to follow orders, but they can never submit to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One should realize that the person who can best give orders is the person who can best receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Submission is an element of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who possess this life do not consider it shameful but proper to submit and to take orders.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only by taking a lowly position can one help others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No matter how respected and highly esteemed a person may be, he should take a lowly position.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not to pretend to be humble but rather to genuinely confess from the heart that one has nothing of which to boast.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Peter 5:5 says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Poor</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, one should not make himself poor by being lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such poverty is worthless and futile.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A willingness to be poor for the Lord s sake when one has the ability and even the opportunity to be rich, or a practice of spending all one s money for the Lord, are both rare and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The life of Christ is a life that chooses to be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consider how He left His throne to be born in a manger and to live in Nazareth, tasting all the privation of human life.</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A person of character must be able to bear pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Anything that is solid and strong must first be pressed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A diamond is formed through intense pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That which grows without restriction usually is not beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, do not invite others to put pressure on you; rather, you should put yourself under pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The combination of the five preceding character traits suffering, lowly, poor, steadfast, and enduring gives a person the ability to bear pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>THE TENTH GROUP CLEAR, MAGNANIMOUS, GRAVE 1.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Clear</S>

   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Magnanimous</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Being magnanimous is similar to being broad.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To be broad is to be tolerant of others, and to be magnanimous is to be not cruel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In dealing with others, one must supplement affection, ardor, and accommodation with magnanimity.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is difficult to have an enemy-loving life without a magnanimous character.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A cruel person is always jealous, while a magnanimous person is able to forgive.</S>

   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Whether a matter is great or small, its importance and weight depend on whose hands it is in. In the hands of a grave person, even a small matter will be taken seriously by others.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Conversely, in the hands of a light person, a significant matter will be considered by others as inconsequential.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In learning to be grave, first, one should not express his opinions lightly; second, one should not judge or criticize flippantly; and third, one should speak slowly and accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is not that one should be silent but that one should speak with discretion.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He who is grave is protected, for evil temptations do not come to him easily.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Especially in the case of a young woman, gravity brings protection, while lightness invites harm.</S>
