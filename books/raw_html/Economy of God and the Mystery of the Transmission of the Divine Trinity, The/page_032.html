<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE TRINITY BEING FOR US TO EAT</h2><p>The above illustration helps us to see that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God—the Triune God—to be our food. This is not man’s word but the word of the Bible. John 6 tells us about a little boy who had five barley loaves and who came to the place where Jesus and a great crowd gathered. Eventually, the five barley loaves went into the five thousand people who ate them. Later the Lord said, “I am the bread of life” (v. 35). This means that the barley loaves signify the Lord Himself. Then in chapter twelve the Lord said that He is the grain of wheat (v. 24). He is the wheat, and He is also the bread, for the wheat has to be ground into flour before it can be made into bread. He is the wheat, He is also the flour, and He is even more the bread for us to eat. Therefore, when He is the wheat, He is still the bread, and when He is the bread, He is still the wheat.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BREAKING THE BREAD</h2><p>Eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord are basic truths in the Bible. When the Lord Jesus established His supper, He took the bread and said, “Take, eat; this is My body” (Matt. 26:26). He also said, “This is My body which is being given for you” (Luke 22:19). The Lord’s body, signified by the bread, is the Lord Himself. What the Lord meant was that He would go to the cross and give His body for us to eat. He had not yet gone, but in a short while, at dawn, He would go. Therefore, He gave the bread to the disciples, saying that it was His body and that they should take and eat it. This meant that He wanted them to eat Himself.<p>However, today many Christians make the breaking of bread a religious ritual. The Catholic Church calls it a “Mass” while the Protestant churches call it “Holy Communion.” They do not understand that the real spiritual significance of bread-breaking is that Jesus as the embodiment of God is the bread. He was a grain of wheat which went through a process to become flour and a further process to be made into bread for us to eat. Today when we believe in the Lord Jesus, we eat Him. The One in whom we believe is the processed Triune God, and the One of whom we eat is the processed grain of wheat. The Lord as the processed grain of wheat is the bread, and the processed Triune God is the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE BELIEVERS BECOMING ONE BREAD, ONE BODY, THROUGH EATING</h2><p>Today the truth of Christ being the Spirit is crystal clear, but I am afraid that you still do not have a complete comprehension of this matter. Please bear in mind that God’s economy, God’s dispensing, God’s union with us, and God’s corporate expression are all included in this truth. Regarding the bread in the Lord’s table meeting, we are all clear that the wheat has to be ground into flour, and the flour has to be made into bread before it is ready for us to eat. Christ, who is the Triune God, said that He Himself is the bread of life for us to eat. Our partaking of the bread indicates that we participate in Christ, and as a result, we are all made one, to be His one Body. Therefore, the Bible tells us that although we are many, we are one bread, because we all eat Him (1 Cor. 10:17). this bread is the Body of Christ, which is the church, His one corporate expression.<p>Therefore, in the story of the Divine Trinity we see God’s economy, God’s dispensing, and God’s union with us. ultimately, we see that we all become one bread, expressing Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. This bread, which was originally the individual Christ, has now become the corporate Christ. Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, the fullness of God, and we all are the expression of the fullness of the Triune God. He is the embodiment and the fullness; we are the expression.
