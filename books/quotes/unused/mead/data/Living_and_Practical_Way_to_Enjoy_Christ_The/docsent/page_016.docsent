   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE TRANSFORMATION FOR BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2, 5; 1 Cor 3:2a, 6, 9b, 10, 12a; Col 2:19; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2a, 4-5; Eph 2:21-22 TRANSFORMATION BEING THE ISSUE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF OUR GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The best way to take the Lord in is to eat Him John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eating brings in growth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the babes grow up by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more they eat, the more they grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why we stress again and again that the church needs the eating.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Teaching can never cause people to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You cannot have your children grow by teaching them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The best, simplest, and easiest way to help your children grow is to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter, however, the basic point is not on growth but on transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you have the growth, surely you have the issue of growth, which is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TRANSFORMATION BEING A METABOLIC CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Transformation is not a kind of outward change or outward correction.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Transformation, in the New Testament sense, is a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Metabolism causes a change in life from within.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Something new added into your being carries away the old element and replaces it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then you have transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not an outward change, but an organic change, a change in life, a metabolic change, through the supply of a new element to replace the old element.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A person who puts makeup on his face has some outward change, but this is not transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is like the work of a mortician.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The face of a dead body is very pale, but its appearance is changed when a mortician covers it with makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Much of the work today in Christianity is like the work of a mortician.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The morticians in a mortuary change the appearance of corpses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a change with these corpses, but not an organic change.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not be concerned about whether or not the young brothers have long or short hair.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should be concerned about their having an inward transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we want someone to be transformed, we have to feed him with rich nourishment day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then after a while, he will be shining and living because of the transformation from within.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a kind of metabolic change with something organic, with something growing, with some new element replacing and discharging the old element.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Transformation is a metabolic change from within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jesus is not a corrector.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is not a mortician, and we are not dead bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not in a mortuary but in a living home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are living persons in the church, the house of the living God 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jesus is not only a good Feeder but also the rich food.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we call upon Him, He comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is living, nourishing, and transforming.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He supplies us and replaces the old element with Himself as the new element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we have an organic change from within.</S>
