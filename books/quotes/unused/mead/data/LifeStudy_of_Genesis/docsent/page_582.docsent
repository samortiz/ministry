   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Like the children of Israel, all Christians should be one, and the worship of God should have only one center.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But the Danites could use the convenient location of their worship center to persuade their neighbors to meet with them for the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose you were a neighbor of the Danites and one of them said to you, "Brother, why are you so foolish as to travel all the way to Shiloh?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are worshipping God right here in Dan Why don't you meet with us?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is competition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today there is much competition in Christian salesmanship, with every Christian group trying to sell its cargo.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What a shame to see this competition among today's Christians!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some argue with us, asking, "Why are you separate from others?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certainly Shiloh is separate from all other places.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Shiloh is only one with Shiloh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today some say, "Why do you call yourselves the church and say that the others are not the church?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We would answer, "Shiloh is Shiloh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No other place is Shiloh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On this earth, there is just one Shiloh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These other groups do not call themselves the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, they have taken other names.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as they keep these names, this is an indication that they are not Shiloh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, they are divisive places of worship."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Judges 18:31 says, "And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The words, "all the time the house of God was in Shiloh," indicate competition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After Dan had set up a divisive center in competition with Shiloh, it was never taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the whole time the tabernacle was in Shiloh the graven image was in Dan This indicates that there was competition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, the temple was built in Jerusalem as the continuation of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the temple had been built by Solomon, Jeroboam, in the next generation, set up a more solidly established idol in Dan to compete with the temple in Jerusalem 1 Kings 12:26-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jeroboam feared that if the people went to worship at Jerusalem, they would return to Rehoboam, the king of Judah 1 Kings 12:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan" 1 Kings 12:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jeroboam seemed to be telling the people, "You don't need to go to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have a worship center right here."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But what he did came out of the fear that his kingdom would be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the competition between Dan and Jerusalem was intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Firstly Dan competed with the tabernacle at Shiloh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later he competed with the temple in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Old Testament we firstly see the competition of the graven image in Dan with the tabernacle at Shiloh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we see the competition of the golden calf in Dan with the temple in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the temple of God was solidly built, the idol in Dan also became more solid.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both the tabernacle in Shiloh and the divisive worship center in Dan were set up by the common people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the temple in Jerusalem was built by a king, Solomon, and the divisive center was also strengthened by a king, Jeroboam.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a very clear picture of the competition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The situation is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the church is solidly built, the denominations will also become more solid.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The strengthening of the denominations comes from their competition with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sooner or later, other groups will compete with the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They may oppose and criticize us at first, but later they will imitate us and compete with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Fifteen years ago terms such as the life-giving Spirit and the human spirit could not be heard among Christians in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But recently even a paper put out by some Catholic charismatics used many of the terms of the Lord's recovery.</S>
