The New Jerusalem, the most mysterious and puzzling matter in the Bible, is first mentioned not in Revelation 21 but in Galatians 4
Galatians 4:26 speaks of 'the Jerusalem above,' that is, the heavenly Jerusalem in contrast to the earthly Jerusalem
In these verses two women, who correspond to the earthly Jerusalem and the heavenly Jerusalem, symbolize two covenants
Which things are an allegory; for these are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto slavery, which is Hagar
Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the Jerusalem which now is, for she is in slavery with her children
According to Revelation 21, the New Jerusalem will be the wife of Christ and also the tabernacle of God, His habitation
On the one hand, we have been born of this mother; on the other hand, this mother is composed of us as the sons
If the New Jerusalem, the Jerusalem above, were a physical entity, how could this city produce us as her children?
We should not understand the New Jerusalem in a physical, material sense, for it is altogether a spiritual entity
Only the natural, uneducated mind, a mind that lacks adequate biblical knowledge, understands the New Jerusalem in this way
Rather, we shall realize that the New Jerusalem as the wife of Christ and the mother of the New Testament believers is a spiritual entity
Adam was the head of the created race, which was given up by God, and Abraham was the head of the new race, which was chosen by God
God's choosing Abraham to be the father of the new race is related to the New Jerusalem and to our understanding of it
In choosing Abraham it was not God's intention simply to restore fallen man to his original, God-created condition
God's intention in choosing Abraham was not to restore man to man's original condition in God's creation but to bring forth many sons
Taken together, these verses indicate that grace is Christ Himself as the embodiment of the processed Triune God
In the very next chapter because Abraham did not have a child by Sarah he followed Sarahs suggestion to have a child by Hagar her handmaid
Abraham's having a child by Hagar was displeasing to God, and He did not appear again to Abraham for thirteen years
When the Lord appeared to Abraham again, He said to him, 'I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect
Isaac as the unique son of Abraham was brought forth through God's grace, not through the natural ability of either Abraham or Sarah
The producing of Isaac was altogether a matter of God's grace, that is, of God Himself given to His chosen people to produce His many sons
In this covenant there is not the need for man's ability or effort but the need for God's grace to produce the many sons
All of Abrahams genuine descendants such as Isaac Jacob Moses and David were under this covenant which is the covenant we are under today
In Genesis 37:9 Joseph in his dream saw the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars, signifying his father, his mother, and his eleven brothers
There the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars plus Joseph himself signified the total composition of God's people on earth
On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is the new covenant; on the other hand, the new covenant produces the New Jerusalem
In this message we will consider some further matters regarding the Jerusalem above being the mother of the believers
The New Jerusalem, the heavenly Jerusalem, the Jerusalem above, is our mother, and this mother is the new covenant of grace
The new covenant of grace brings forth children of freedom by God as grace to enjoy the Triune God, not by human effort to keep the law
The children of the Jerusalem above, that is, the children produced by the new covenant, become the components of their mother
Finally, the Triune God is the center, substance, element, and essence of the ultimate consummation of the Scriptures-the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God passing through the long process of His new covenant
The Triune God in His new covenant is dispensing Himself into us, making us the components of His ultimate consummation
Ishmael signifies the produce of the covenant of the law, and Isaac signifies the produce of the covenant of grace
Concerning the Jerusalem from above, there are six vital matters: the Father, the grace, the mother, the sons, the city, and the covenant
The Father is the grace, and the grace becomes the mother, who produces the sons, and the sons are the components of the mother
Eventually, the Father, the grace, the mother, the sons, the city, and the covenant will become one entity-the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is a composition of God, of God's grace, of God's covenant, of the mother, and of all her sons
The New Jerusalem is produced by the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us as grace to bring us forth as God's many sons
Verse 14 says, 'The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb'
Since the New Jerusalem is such a composition, we have a strong basis for saying that we are parts, components, of the New Jerusalem
The record concerning this wonderful entity in Revelation 21 and 22 could not have been written by anyone other than the Triune God Himself
The vision of the New Jerusalem was given to the apostle John, but this vision has a source, and the source is the Triune God
We may have full assurance regarding the truth, the reality, of the heavenly Jerusalem presented in Revelation 21 and 22
These foundations, which are solid and unshakable, are composed of twelve kinds of precious stones represented by the twelve apostles
In Hebrews 11:10 we see that the city has the foundations, and in Revelation 21:19 and 20 we see the twelve foundations of the city
Since poetry expresses the writer's wisdom and since the church is God's poem, God's multifarious wisdom is made known through the church
To say that the New Jerusalem is a material city is to depreciate God's wisdom and to belittle Him as the eternal, wise Architect
God is a wise designer and artificer who has designed the New Jerusalem to be the full manifestation of His multifarious wisdom
Isaac and Jacob followed him in the same steps living on earth as strangers and sojourners and waiting for the Godbuilt city of foundations
In eternity past the Triune God made a plan, and throughout the centuries He has been carrying out His economy
The Son came through incarnation, lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, was resurrected, and then ascended
Some believers still insist that the New Jerusalem is a material city built of actual gold, pearl, and precious stones
In the coming age, silver becomes pearl, and the materials in the New Jerusalem become gold, pearl, and precious stones
These are not physical materials; they are signs signifying various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God
All these materials, therefore, are the products of our experience and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit
As signs, these materials signify the divine work of the Divine Trinity who is wrought into our being through His divine work
We are now building the church with God the Father's nature, with God the Son's redemption, and with God the Spirit's transforming work
The principle is the same with the New Jerusalem, which is the consummation of the building in 1 Corinthians 3
In 12:22, however, the writer tells us that we have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem
Many Christians are waiting to go to the New Jerusalem, but we need to realize that we have come to the New Jerusalem already
In the foregoing messages we have seen that the New Jerusalem is the Jerusalem above and the city of the living God
In the book of Revelation, which is the conclusion of the New Testament and even of the entire Bible, there are two great signs
God has been working throughout the ages, first creating the universe and man and then coming to earth to redeem man
The New Jerusalem is a great sign of the totality of all God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people
Just as the church as God's house is not an actual physical house, so the New Jerusalem is not an actual physical city
The New Jerusalem is the last and greatest sign in the Bible, and we all need the proper interpretation and understanding of this sign
The New Jerusalem is a sign of the aggregate of the result of Gods work of the new creation in all the dispensations within the old creation
In this dispensation God first put the created man under His direct government that man might receive Him as life
Eventually, because man became repeatedly fallen, God made fallen man subject to the authority which He gave to man
God's original intention was to do the work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation according to His promised grace
By doing this, He initiated another dispensation, the dispensation of law, which extended from Moses to the coming of Christ
God's intention in setting up the dispensation of the law according to His economy was to accomplish certain things through the law
The dispensation of grace is from Christ's first coming to His second coming, which will mark the beginning of the millennial kingdom
He was made both Lord and Christ to be a Leader and Savior , that He might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God's chosen people
God then constitutes them to be the churches in different localities that the Body of Christ may be fully built up
God, therefore, will use the last dispensation in the old creation to complete His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation
The people of the new race will be the constituents of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth in eternity
In the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God has been processed and consummated to be one with men, His chosen people
The New Testament reveals that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God and also the wife of the redeeming Christ
Whereas the ark typifies the individual Christ the tabernacle typifies both the individual Christ the Head and the corporate Christ the Body
The New Testament reveals clearly that the individual Christ is the Head, but this Christ must have a Body, which is the church
In Exodus we have not only the ark-Christ but also the tabernacle-Christ, not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ
In the time of the New Testament, Christ in the flesh was the tabernacle that brought God to man so that man might enjoy Him
The fullness of the Godheadthe Father the Son and the Spiritis embodied in the tabernacle and this embodiment is Gods dwelling among men
Revelation 21:3 and 24 indicate that the New Jerusalem will be the dwelling place among men-the nations-in eternity
The tabernacle was God's dwelling place, but at the same time it was the priests' dwelling place, the place in which they served God
Revelation 21:22 tells us that in the New Jerusalem there is no temple, 'for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb'
The New Jerusalem is God's dwelling place, and the New Jerusalem as the temple is God Himself as our dwelling place
The New Jerusalem is a mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people, and this mingling is a mutual dwelling for God and His redeemed
We see that the New Jerusalem cannot be a material city, for a physical city cannot be one with Christ in nature and in life
The church is actually a part of Christ for the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ just as Eve came out of Adam and was unto Adam
The fact that Christ and the church are one spirit , as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, is the great mystery
In the new heaven and new earth Christ will have a wife, but in the millennium He will have a bride , consisting of the overcoming believers
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be completed at the end of this age
The readiness of the bride depends on both the overcomers' maturity in life and on their being built up together as a corporate entity
After the millennium all the saints will have been perfected and constituted together to be the wonderful entity of the New Jerusalem
The consummation of the church as the counterpart of Christ will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity
Revelation 21:2 says, 'I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband'
The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints redeemed and perfected by God throughout all generations
Revelation 22:17 indicates that Christ and the New Jerusalem as His wife will be a universal couple for eternity
The Spirit, who is the totality of the processed Triune God, becomes one with the believers, who are now fully matured to be the bride
The designation holy city signifies that the New Jerusalem is a city sanctified and separated unto God for the fulfilling of His purpose
The New Jerusalem is both sanctified and separated unto God positionally and sanctified and saturated with God dispositionally
It is an entity, entirely and thoroughly holy, that fits in with God's holy nature for His expression to fulfill the desire of His heart
There is no saturation of God in the Old Testament, and the holiness, or sanctification, there is only positional, not dispositional
In the New Testament, however, we see both objective, positional sanctification and subjective, dispositional sanctification
The New Jerusalem as the holy city is holy not merely in the sense of the Old Testament but also in the sense of the New Testament
The New Jerusalem is a city composed of living persons who have been separated unto God and saturated with Him
The New Jerusalem as the holy city is built with all the redeemed and perfected saints of both the Old Testament and the New Testament
All the saints of both the Old Testament and the New Testament are the components the constituents of the New Jerusalem for Gods expression
At the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel'
The word Israel here indicates that the New Jerusalem is composed of all the redeemed saints of the Old Testament
Revelation 21:14 says, 'The wall of the city had twelvefoundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb'
The processed Triune God is mingled with His creature, man, in His eternal administration in the New Jerusalem
On top of the mountain is a throne, from which the street spirals down to the bottom to reach the twelve gates
The street, therefore, must be a spiral street, spiraling down the mountain until it circles around to all twelve gates
According to Revelation 11:1, 'a reed like a rod' is used to 'measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it'
There is no implication of judgment, discipline, or chastisement, for in every respect the New Jerusalem is complete and perfect
The whole city with its gates and wall can pass the measuring and testing of the nature of God hence it is qualified to be possessed by God
Revelation 2116b says He measured the city with the reed at twelve thousand stadia the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal
The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, both in the tabernacle and in the temple, were equal in length, breadth, and height
Since twelve signifies absolute and eternal completion in God's eternal administration, twelve thousand signifies a thousand times this
The last two chapters of the Bible, Revelation 21 and 22, present the ultimate consummation of God's eternal economy
Redemption, regeneration, transformation, glorification, conformation, and many other matters are symbolized in these chapters
Revelation 21:14 says, 'The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb'
Since in eternity there will be no more need of the prophets, the foundations of the holy city will consist only of the apostles
In the New Jerusalem, the holy city, as the ultimate consummation, the foundation is the grace God covenanted to Abraham
In Greek an expression such as 'the grace of Christ' is an expression of apposition, with 'Christ' in apposition to 'grace'
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
To say 'the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit' actually means 'Christ as grace be with your spirit'
The Word that became flesh and tabernacled among us is a person, and this person is Christ as the embodiment of grace
According to Ephesians 2:20 the apostles, along with the prophets, are the foundation for the building up of the church
All the apostles were created pieces of clay, but they were transformed into precious stones for God's eternal building
It was through the transforming work of the Lord the Spirit that Peter and then the other apostles were transformed into precious stones
Gradually, Peter and the others were transformed by the Lord the Spirit into the embodiment of God's all-inclusive grace
The Lord the Spirit may be considered a compound title like Jehovah God, Father God, Lord Jesus, Jesus Christ, and Lord Christ
If we have not seen that today the Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit as the Lord the Spirit, we will not experience His transforming work
If we know that our Lord Jesus Christ is the life-giving Spirit and call on Him, saying 'O Lord Spirit,' we will enjoy His transforming work
Enjoying Christ as the bread of life is also a subjective matter, for this involves eating the Lord, and eating is surely subjective
Even though our experience may be limited, we can testify from experience to the reality of the transforming work of the Lord Spirit
Revelation 21:11b says that the light of the New Jerusalem is like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal
Whatever the holy city expresses is the shining of Christ's divine attributes expressed in our human virtues for the glory of the Triune God
The twelve precious stones are for the completion of God's eternal administration signified by the number twelve
The New Jerusalem as the holy city will be absolutely separated unto God and will fully protect the interests of God
It is with the riches of Christ that the Holy Spirit transforms the believers, whose natural element is of clay
The wall of the holy city is the expression of the jasper God, and the jasper God is expressed in the jasper city through the jasper wall
Revelation 21:17 says, 'He measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, a measure of a man, that is, of an angel'
a measure of a man, that is, of an angel' signifies that the wall of the city is not natural but in resurrection
The wall of the city is not only measured according to the divine nature but is also according to resurrection
The designation 'the holy city' means the separated city, a city that is separated from anything other than God
Although the wall of the holy city is mainly for expression, spontaneously it becomes a separation and a protection
Israel here represents the law of the Old Testament, indicating that the law is represented at the gates of the New Jerusalem
The law is not useful in producing sons, but it is useful in proving whether or not we are genuine sons of God
Even our repentance was according to the law for we repented because we had violated the law and we confessed our sins according to the law
Our entrance into the holy city did not break the law; rather, it was according to the law and even a fulfillment of the law
The angels will be the gatekeepers of our possession, while we will be the ones enjoying the rich inheritance in God's eternal economy
The twelve angels keep the gates according to the grace which has fulfilled all the righteous requirements of the law
These parables concern the shepherd and the lost sheep, the woman and the lost coin, and the father and the returned prodigal son
The shepherd refers to the Son; the father, of course, refers to the Father; and the woman signifies the Spirit
The three gates are not on three sides respectively; instead, there are three gates on each of the four sides repeatedly
Three gates on each of the four sides, constituting the number twelve, implies the mingling of the Triune God with man, God's creature
Revelation 21:21 says, 'The twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl'
When an oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, the oyster secretes its life-juice around the sand and makes it a precious pearl
The Greek word for temple in verse 22 naos does not denote the whole temple in a common way including the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place
The three equal dimensions of the city also indicate that the whole city is the Holy of Holies, the inner temple
The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb'
The glory of God, with God as its substance, essence, and element, is the light of the New Jerusalem which shines in the Lamb as its lamp
The appearance of God rich in life goes with the shining for God's expression in His final and consummated manifestation
The pure gold of the unique street in the New Jerusalem is 'as transparent glass,' signifying without any opaqueness
The New Jerusalem also has a center, which is the throne of our redeeming God, the throne of God and of the Lamb
God is the One who had a purpose and who made a plan in eternity past and who created all things for the fulfillment of His plan
The throne of God and of the Lamb denotes that this throne is to carry out God's plan through Christ's redemption
The throne is the source from which the river of water of life flows, and the river flows with the tree of life growing in it
In the New Jerusalem the throne of the redeeming God is the center of the city, and His expression extends to its circumference
It is one river, flowing through the four directions of the holy city like the four heads of the one river in Genesis 2:10-14
The river in the New Jerusalem flows from the throne of the redeeming God, from the redeeming God in His administration
The dispensing of the life supply and of God's all-sufficient grace issues from the throne of God's administration
In verse 38 the Lord Jesus says He who believes in Me as the Scripture said out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water
These rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of the divine life, which is God's Spirit of life
He is the Triune God reaching us and flowing within us to saturate and satisfy the entire city of New Jerusalem
We need to differentiate between Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God and the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God
Whereas Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the tree of life the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is the water of life
The tree of life was closed to man due to his fall , but was opened to the believers by the redemption of Christ
Since the tree of life grows on the two sides of the river of life, it does not grow upward but spreads like a vine
The mention of 'each month' indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the moon will still be there to divide the twelve months
The rest will be transferred to the new earth as the nations and will live around the New Jerusalem and walk by its light
In the new heaven and new earth for eternity, all the redeemed and perfected saints will participate in the service of God
The pronoun Him here refers to God and the Lamb, that is, to the redeeming God, the One whom we will serve for eternity in the New Jerusalem
As Revelation 21:27 tells us, only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life have the right to enter into the holy city
The holy city in which we will participate and which we will enjoy is the processed and consummated Triune God mingled with all His saints
In this one entity, the holy city, we will enjoy not only the Triune God but will also enjoy the Triune God in all the saints
Revelation 22:14a says, 'Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life'
We praise the Lord that for eternity in the New Jerusalem we will have food, the tree of life, and drink, the life-giving Spirit
In the New Jerusalem God's redeemed will live in the divine light of the divine life embodied in the redeeming Lamb
In the coming eternity, the holy city will be the tabernacle as God's eternal dwelling and the temple as our eternal dwelling
Verse 1 says, 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more'
The word peoples in verse 3 indicates that these verses apply not to the saints but to the restored nations on the new earth
The word inherit in verse 7 is important, for it indicates that in eternity the sons of God will have an inheritance
The New Testament reveals that God's intention is to produce sons and that the New Jerusalem is the totality of the divine sonship
In Revelation 21:7 we have the concluding word of the revelation in the New Testament concerning the divine sonship
Satan, the demons, and all rebellious human beings will be swept into the lake of fire, the universal 'trash can'
In the new heaven and new earth, we see the New Jerusalem composed of God's sons, the restored nations as the peoples, and the lake of fire
The lake of fire will, in a negative way, show forth God's righteousness, for all who are in it will suffer God's righteous judgment
