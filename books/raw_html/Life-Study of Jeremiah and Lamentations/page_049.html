<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Trusting in the House<br>Called by Jehovah's Name, Which Had Become<br>a Den of Robbers in Their Eyes</H2><P>Israel trusted in the house called by Jehovah's name, which had become a den of robbers in their eyes (vv. 11, 14; Matt. 21:13; Mark 11:17; Luke 19:46). This indicates that their worship to God had altogether become a falsehood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Worship in Vanity</H2><P>Israel's worship to Jehovah was also a worship in vanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Trusting in Words of Falsehood</H2><P>In their worship in vanity, Israel trusted in words of falsehood that did not benefit them (v. 8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah Charging the Prophet Jeremiah<br>Not to Pray for Them</H2><P>Jehovah charged the prophet Jeremiah not to pray for them and not to intercede with Him, for He would not hear him (v. 16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Jehovah Their God Not Caring<br>for Their Burnt Offerings and Sacrifices</H2><P>Israel offered to Jehovah many burnt offerings and sacrifices. But since they did not hear Jehovah's voice and walk in all the way that He commanded them, He did not care for their burnt offerings and sacrifices (vv. 21-23).</P>
