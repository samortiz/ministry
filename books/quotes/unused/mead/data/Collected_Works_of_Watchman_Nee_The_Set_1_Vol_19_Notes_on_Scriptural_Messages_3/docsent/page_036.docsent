   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RAPTURE AND THE TRIBULATION 3 Issue No. 50</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The previous two times I spoke about those who advocated that the whole church would be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I mentioned how unsound their reasoning was and how excessive their assertions were.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Tonight I am going to speak on another matter: does the Bible ever say that the saints will pass through the tribulation?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE PROOF THAT THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>WILL PASS THROUGH THE TRIBULATION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible there are many proofs that the saints will pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today I will only mention three.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can read the following verses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. The First Proof</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Thessalonians 2:1-3 says, "Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, that you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let no one deceive you in any way, because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must read this passage of the Bible carefully, because this passage has a great deal to do with the subject we are studying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the subject of this passage?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It not only speaks of the coming of Christ, nor does it only speak of our gathering together to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, it speaks of the coming of Christ and our gathering together to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This passage of the Bible puts the coming of Christ and the rapture of the saints together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is neither His coming to the earth, nor our going to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, He is coming while we are going.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since this passage talks about the coming of Christ and the rapture of the saints, are there any clues that show us whether the rapture of the saints is before or after the tribulation?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I claim that in this passage there are clues.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 2 says, "That you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a big question here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What does "the day of the Lord" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our friends say that the day of the Lord refers to the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why do they say that?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have their reason.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is how their reasoning goes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How could there be the great tribulation if we have not been raptured?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is true that in the Old Testament there are places where the phrase "the day of the Lord" includes the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, not all of the references to "the day of the Lord" in the Bible refer to the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Old Testament speaks of the day of the Lord, for the most part it refers to the special judgment of God at the end of the great tribulation Joel .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, it is definitely wrong to say that "the day of the Lord" always refers to the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us read 2 Peter 3:10: "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, burning with intense heat, will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burned up."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What does this refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It refers to the destruction of the old heavens and the old earth by God after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such a day is also referred to as the day of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In most cases in the Old Testament, "the day of the Lord" refers to the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we cannot say that in every case it refers to the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second Peter 3:10 is such an example.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only does 2 Peter 3:10 prove this, but also the whole context of 2 Thessalonians 2:1-3 proves this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There, in the first verse, the subject is "with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 2 mentions "the day of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The day of the Lord mentioned there must naturally refer to the day of the coming of Christ and our gathering together to Him, which was described in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time, the Thessalonians had a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some were saying that the day of the Lord had already come.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul's intention was to persuade them not to be shaken by this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He wanted them to realize that the intent of those who spoke to them in this way was to tempt them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can one know if the day of the Lord has come?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let us see verse 3: "Because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"The day" here is just the day in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to know whether or not the day of the Lord has come, you only need to consider two things: there must be an apostasy, and the man of lawlessness must be revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If these have happened, Christ will come soon.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There must first be the apostasy and the revelation of the man of lawlessness before the rapture of the saints will occur.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to hold fast to the fact that before the rapture of the saints, there must be first the revelation of the man of lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is what Paul tells us in 2 Thessalonians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The rapture of the saints occurs after the revelation of the man of lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Who is this man of lawlessness?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is none other than Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The rapture of the saints takes place after Antichrist has been revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When is Antichrist revealed?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everyone who studies the Bible knows that it occurs in the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is commonly acknowledged by all the Bible students in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This proves that the rapture occurs after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>From 2 Thessalonians 2:1-3, we can see that the rapture follows after the revelation of the Antichrist, or the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Here we see that there is at least a group, or at the very least an individual, who is raptured after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who advocate the pre-tribulation rapture of the whole church say that the day of the Lord mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2 is equivalent to the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is their proof?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In reading the Scriptures, we cannot ignore the whole context.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Here "the day of the Lord" clearly refers to the day of the Lord's coming and our rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If they want to refer to the Old Testament, they also must not discard 2 Peter 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There it proves that the day of the Lord is not the great tribulation.</S>
