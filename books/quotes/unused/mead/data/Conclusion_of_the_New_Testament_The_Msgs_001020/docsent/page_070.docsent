   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Forsaking Christ Economically When He Was Judging Christ as Our Substitute Made Sin for Us and Bearing Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When God was judging Christ as our Substitute made sin for us and bearing our sins, God forsook Christ economically.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regarding this, Matthew 27:45 and 46 say, "Now from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sixth hour is our twelve o'clock noon, and the ninth is our three o'clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus was crucified at the third hour, at our nine o'clock in the morning Mark 15:25 , and He suffered on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God's will; in the last three hours He was judged by God for the accomplishment of our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During that time God counted Him as our suffering Substitute for sin Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, darkness came over all the land because our sin and sins and all negative things were dealt with there, and God forsook Him because of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners 1 Pet 3:18 , bearing our sins 1 Pet 2:24; Isa 53:6 and being made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that God judged Him as our Substitute for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the sight of God Christ became a great sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Christ was our Substitute and was even sin in the sight of God, God judged Him and even forsook Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the first three hours, men did many unrighteous things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They persecuted and mocked Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, in the first three hours the Lord suffered man's unrighteous treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But at the sixth hour, twelve noon, God came in, and there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour, until three o'clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The coming of darkness was God's doing, and in the midst of it the Lord cried out the words quoted in Matthew 27:46.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord was suffering the persecution of man, God was with Him, and He enjoyed the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But at the end of the first three hours, God forsook Him, and darkness came.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Unable to tolerate this, the Lord shouted loudly, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have pointed out, God forsook Him because He was our Substitute bearing our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Isaiah 53 reveals that this was the time God put our sins on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the three hours from twelve noon to three o'clock in the afternoon, the righteous God put all our sins upon this Substitute and judged Him righteously for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God forsook Him because during these hours He was a sinner there on the cross; He was even made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, the Lord bore our sins; on the other hand, He was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, according to His righteousness, God judged Him and forsook Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord was born of the begetting Spirit, who is God reaching man, as the divine essence, who never left Him essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even when He was on the cross crying out, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He still had the begetting Spirit God in the essential sense as the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then who left Him?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was the anointing Spirit God in the economical sense , through whom He presented Himself as the God-man to be the all-inclusive sacrifice to God Heb 9:14 , who left Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After God accepted Christ as the all-inclusive offering, the anointing Spirit left Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But although the anointing Spirit left Him economically, the Lord still had the begetting Spirit essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross under God's judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, He was forsaken by the righteous and judging God economically.</S>
