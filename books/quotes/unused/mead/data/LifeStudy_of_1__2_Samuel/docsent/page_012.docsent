   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OBSERVING THE DETERIORATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE DEGRADED AARONIC PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While Samuel was learning he observed the deterioration of the degraded Aaronic priesthood 2:12-17, 22-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This did not weaken Samuel in his future priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it became a constant warning to him throughout his priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. The Two Sons of Eli</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Despising the Offerings of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The two sons of Eli despised the offerings of Jehovah and took the best flesh of the people's offerings by force vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that when Samuel saw this, he must have had a deep impression as a warning to him concerning his future as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. The Sons of Eli Committing</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fornication with the Serving Women</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sons of Eli also committed fornication with the serving women v. 22 . How terrible! History tells us that this kind of thing has happened repeatedly among God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In serving the Lord we cannot avoid having contact with the other sex, but we must learn the lesson to always keep a distance between us and the other sex.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should never stay in a private room with a member of the other sex with the windows covered and the doors closed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That gives the evil one the opportunity to tempt us to fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The two sons of Eli were caught by this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning this, we should learn from Joseph, who fled from temptation Gen 39:7-12 , and from Boaz, who was highly appraised for his high standard of morality in his contact with Ruth Ruth 3:1-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. The Sons of Eli Not Listening</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>to the Exhortation of Their Father</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sons of Eli would not listen to the exhortation of their father 1 Sam 2:22-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eli attempted to say something to his sons, but it seems that he was somewhat loose and that his exhortation was not very strong, faithful, desperate, and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>D. Eli Honoring His Sons More than Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to verse 29 a man of God spoke to Eli, saying, "Why then do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering, which I have commanded in My habitation, and honor your sons more than Me by making yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 3:13 we see that Eli's sons brought the curse upon themselves, and Eli did not restrain them.</S>
