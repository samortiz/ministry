   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Being Superior to All These Items</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gentiles never had such leaders as Moses and Joshua and such a person as Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Neither did the heathen religions have such a covenant from God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, Judaism is altogether good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How then could the Hebrew believers as people of God forsake this religion?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This bothered the Hebrews, because they had inherited all the things of Judaism, but then they believed in Christ and became Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, they had received Judaism, while on the other hand they had received Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They realized that they needed Christ, but they could not give up Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This became a bothering to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was under such a situation that Paul wrote this book to clarify the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He told them that Christ is altogether better than all of those five items.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Judaism there is God, but Paul told the Hebrews that Christ is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not have Christ, we have God in terminology and name only, not in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reality of this God is Christ, so in order to have God, we need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is better than Judaism because Judaism gives us God in name but not in reality, while Christ is the very embodiment and reality of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have Christ as our reality, there is no need to hold on to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since we have the reality, there is no need to keep the mere terms.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Sections of Hebrews</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the first two chapters of Hebrews, Paul tells us that Christ is better than the angels 1:4 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then chapters three and four tell us that Christ is better than the Jewish leaders 3:1 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is better than Moses and better than Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From Hebrews 4:14 through 7:28, Paul tells us that Christ is also superior to Aaron and all the priests of the order of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then from 8:1 through 10:18, Paul tells us that Christ's new covenant is superior to the old.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Chapters eleven through thirteen are a final section of this book, speaking of faith as the unique pathway to follow Christ, among other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should keep these sections of Hebrews in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, this book is hard to understand, but on the other hand, no other book is so clearly divided as Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first four sections tell us that Christ is superior to everything else, and the last section shows us the way to go on and follow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In addition, each of the five sections contains a particular exhortation or warning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to understand this book, we must take care of these five warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The warnings appear either at the end of a section or midway through it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hebrews 2:1-4, for example, is the first exhortation and warning, found in the middle of the first section of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOD SPEAKING IN THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first three verses of Hebrews are the introduction of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This book begins by telling us that God is speaking in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Old Testament time God spoke through many prophets, but now in the New Testament age God speaks in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Son is the Word of God, the explanation and expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>CHRIST SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first section of Hebrews, from 1:4 to the end of chapter two, reveals to us that Christ is superior to the angels because of two things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, since Christ is God Himself and God is certainly superior to the angels, Christ is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, because Christ is also a man, as a man He is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should give up wanting to be like an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many times I have thanked the Lord that I was created as a man, not as an angel, because man is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only is God superior to the angels, but man is also superior to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, in the first two chapters Christ is superior to the angels because according to chapter one He is God, and according to chapter two He is man.</S>
