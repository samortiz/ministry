CONCERNING MAN&rsquo;S RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Details to the Ten Commandments</h2><h2 class="head3">1. To the Sixth</h2><p>In 21:12-14, 18-32 we have details related to the commandment forbidding murder. As we read these verses, we should observe the principle of noting the sweet spirit in which they were written. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.&rdquo; However, according to verse 13, if a man kills another accidentally, he may flee to a place of refuge: &ldquo;And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.&rdquo; This provision is for one who killed another by mistake, without having any intention of killing him. Verse 13 even indicates that the slain one was delivered to the other person by God. The person was killed because of God&rsquo;s hand, not because a fellow Israelite intended to slay him. Therefore, God would not blame one who killed another accidentally. Rather, we know from Numbers 35 that there were cities of refuge at strategically located places in the land of Canaan to which a person could flee. In the provision made for refuge in verse 13, we surely see the sweetness of the divine law.</p><p>Verse 14 goes on to say, &ldquo;But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.&rdquo; This means that if an Israelite slew a person by guile, he could not find safety even if he ran to the altar and laid hold of the horns of the altar. Such a person was to be taken away from God&rsquo;s altar and put to death.</p><p>The ordinances in these chapters all have a spiritual significance. For instance, the city of refuge typifies Christ. In His humanity Christ became a city of refuge for us. We may flee into Him as our refuge because, in God&rsquo;s sight, the things we have done may be regarded as mistakes. Therefore, we have the right to flee into Christ as our city of refuge.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To the Fifth</h2><p>In 21:15 and 17 we have details related to the fifth commandment, the commandment to honor father and mother. Verse 15 says, &ldquo;He that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.&rdquo; Verse 17 continues, &ldquo;And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.&rdquo; We may not have smitten our parents or cursed them; however, some may have cursed their parents inwardly, within their hearts.</p><h2 class="head3">3. To the Eighth</h2><p>In 22:1-6 there are many details related to the eighth commandment, the commandment forbidding stealing. All these details are sweet. These verses also reveal that although God is great, He cares very much for details.</p><h2 class="head3">4. To the Tenth</h2><p>The details to the tenth commandment, the commandment which forbids coveting, in 22:7-15 indicate that coveting is a matter of greed. It is not easy to be pure concerning valuables belonging to another which are committed to our care for a period of time. I know of a case of a person who was entrusted with the care of a diamond. He exchanged the real diamond for a synthetic diamond, kept the real diamond for himself, and gave the synthetic diamond to the owner of the real diamond. The motive for this unlawful exchange was greed. Out of greed children may switch textbooks with another at school or switch pieces of cake at home. They desire a newer book or a larger piece of cake and make the exchange without the other person knowing it. This is not only coveting; it is also stealing. Theft is motivated by greed. If there were no coveting, there would not be any stealing. In these verses stealing and coveting are mentioned together, for it is difficult to separate them. However, even in the ordinances related to theft and covetousness the spirit and taste are sweet.</p><h2 class="head3">5. To the Seventh</h2><p>In 22:16-17, 19 we have details related to the seventh commandment, which forbids adultery.</p><h2 class="head3">6. To the Ninth</h2><p>In 23:1-3, 6-8, we find details related to the ninth commandment, the commandment dealing with false witness. Without these details, this commandment may not be adequately clear to us. Exodus 23:1 clearly says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_228.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_230.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Exodus &nbsp; pg 229</div><br></body></html>
