   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Living with the Son</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also need to be those living with the Son as the embodiment of God Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you have the Father, you have the Son, and when you have the Son, you have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Son as the embodiment of God is life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We live with the Father as the source of life, but we live with the Son as life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament does not tell us that the Father is life, but it always says that the Son is life Col 3:4; John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The life comes out of the source, of course, just as the flow comes out of the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We live with the Father as the fountain and we live with the Son as life and as the life supply, the tree of life Rev 22:2; 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even today in the church life, as indicated by Revelation 2:7, we can eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus is our daily life supply and every day we must call upon His name to enjoy this supply Rom 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Day after day we need to be those who call upon the name of the Lord again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we call, O Lord, this is very good, but it is not as sweet as when we call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our experience, our calling becomes sweeter when we add the name Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we call by saying, O Lord Jesus Christ, this makes our calling richer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At times our praying for many things frustrates us from the enjoyment of the Son as our life and as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would come to the Lord and call upon His dear name, praising and worshipping Him for who He is and for what He has done, our enjoyment and fellowship with Him would be quite rich.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all have to learn how to take our Lord individually and extensively as our enjoyment for His magnification Phil 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we enjoy the Lord in such a way, we magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes our prayer to the Lord is in a pitiful way, where we complain about our negative situation or environment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this is the case, we are not magnifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Despite our environment or negative situation, we need to learn to enjoy Christ to a great extent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will be able to say, like Paul did, that our expectation and hope is that Christ will be magnified in our bodies, whether through life or through death Phil 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul enjoyed Christ even in prison because he was enjoying the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ for his daily salvation Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through this all-inclusive bountiful supply, Paul was saved to magnify Christ in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was living in prison with Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, as the life, and as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that he was eating Jesus as the tree of life all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Living with the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also need to be those living triunely with the Spirit as the realization of Christ the Son John 14:17a; 15:26; 16:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you call, O Lord Jesus Christ, you enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you enjoy the Lord, immediately the Lord within you is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more you call on the Lord, the more you have the Spirit within you as the realization of Christ, the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The reality mainly denotes the very Being in the divine essence of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit is the reality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Spirit is also the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Father is the source of life, the Son is life, and the Spirit is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The power plant is the source of electricity, and the electricity itself is electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But in order for the electricity to be applied to us there is the need of the flow or the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The electrical current is actually the electricity itself, but if the electricity is not moving it cannot be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Electricity can only be applied by its current.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The current is the flowing of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may say that the Father is the power plant, the Son is the electricity, and the Spirit is the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit of life simply means the current of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When life moves, it is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This corresponds to 2 Corinthians 13:14 which refers to the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fellowship of the Spirit is the flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we live with the Spirit, we enjoy the flow of life, and this life becomes our real supply.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit of life is also the water of life Rev 22:17b , and we live with the Spirit as the water of life for the bountiful supply of the Triune God Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>OUR LIVING TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our living should be a triune living, in which we live with the Father in the fellowship of His divine life, live with the Son for His magnification, and live with the Spirit for the bountiful supply of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The entire New Jerusalem lives by the Father on the throne, by the Spirit flowing as the river of water of life, and by the Son growing as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Son growing is the life supply and the Spirit flowing is the bountiful supply of the Triune God to support the entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This should not be something merely in the future, but this must be our living today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are living with the Father as the source, as love and as light, in His fellowship of the divine life; we are living with the Son as the embodiment of the Triune God as life and as life supply for His magnification; and we are living with the Spirit as the realization of this enjoyable Christ as the Spirit of life and as the water of life for the bountiful supply of the Triune God to nourish the entire church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This should be our triune living.</S>
