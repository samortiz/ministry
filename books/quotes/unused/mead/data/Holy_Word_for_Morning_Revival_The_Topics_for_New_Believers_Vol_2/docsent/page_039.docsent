   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 13 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rev 2:4 But I have one thing against you, that you have left your first love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matt 13:24-25 ...The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Three Aspects of the Kingdom of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the Gospel of Matthew, the kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God has three aspects: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>239 First, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>240 This reality is the living of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>241 In chapters five through seven of Matthew, the Lord Jesus...unveiled to His disciples that the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the victorious living of the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we rise early in the morning to have a morning revival in the holy Word with the Lord, while we are there enjoying and praising the Lord, we are a part of the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is an aspect of our victorious living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If, on the other hand, we sleep late and do not rise up early to be with the Lord, that should be considered a defeated living, a living that is not part of the kingdom of the heavens....</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is a living by the divine life expressed in the human life Matt 5:45 ....Only the divine life can live a life that matches the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The marvelous thing is that the living of the divine life is expressed through the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the living of a mingled life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is proven by Matthew 5:45, which says, ...that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can live the divine life because we are children of the divine Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We could never live such a life as children of our human father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a much greater capacity in the divine life than in the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens by the capacity of the divine life, we need to exercise our spirit to praise Him, to fellowship with Him, and even to remain in Him and to abide in Him all day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>242 If we are poor in spirit v. 3 , the kingdom of the heavens is ours: we are in its reality now in the church age, and we will share in its manifestation in the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>243</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens...is comprised of the overcomers, the victorious Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>244 An overcomer is someone who overcomes in every area of his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus is moving within us to live through us even in the way that we comb and cut our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not follow Him in this matter, we will be defeated in having a worldly hair style.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord says, Don t comb your hair that way, we should respond, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever You want, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what it means to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that we love Him more than our self, more than our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An overcomer knows and loves only Christ....We need to consider our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Is Christ the first in everything with us?...To recover the first love Rev 2:4 is to give Him the preeminence in great things as well as in small things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>245</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second, the kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God in this age has its appearance, in addition to its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Its appearance is its outward state in name, as revealed by the Lord on the seashore in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>246 We must realize that as the reality of the kingdom comes into being, the enemy, Satan, will also come in to do some distracting, frustrating, and damaging work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This working of the enemy produces the outward appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>247 In Matthew 13, there are three parables which indicate the outward appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>248 The first of these is the tares, signifying the nominal Christians false believers , growing together with the wheat, the real believers Matt 13:24, 30 ....The tares were...sown...by the Lord s enemy, Satan Matt 13:25, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Tares bear the appearance of wheat but do not have the life of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Similarly, the nominal Christians do not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>249</S>
