<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEGINNING AND ENDING<br />
WITH GOD BEING FOOD TO MAN</h2>
<p>The Bible begins and ends in the same way. The vision of eating and drinking God begins with the tree of life in Genesis and ends with the tree of life at the end of Revelation. In the beginning of the Bible God is food to man, and at the end of the Bible God is still food to man. At the end of Revelation is the New Jerusalem. In the middle of the street in the city is a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. On both sides of the river is the tree of life (22:1-2). In the city there is no work and no zeal; rather, we take God as the fruit of the tree of life and as the water of life. The issue of enjoying God and letting Him flow through us is the expression of God.</p>
<p>The last two lines of <em>Hymns,</em> #255 in Chinese read, &ldquo;Breath by breath I live upon Thee, / May Thou be expressed through me.&rdquo; God expressed through us is the New Jerusalem. There is no need for us to do anything for God. We only need to enjoy God. We need to be filled and saturated with God so that He can flow out of us and be expressed through us. This is what is manifested at the end of the Bible, and this is what God wants to accomplish.</p>
<p>In the New Jerusalem the believers are not zealously working, nor do they resolve to do good and endeavor to improve themselves. In the center of the New Jerusalem God is on the throne. Within the believers a river of life is flowing continuously. They also have the fruit of the tree of life. The glorious God is continuously flowing within and supplying His people. As a result, the glory of God is expressed through them. In the New Jerusalem there is no work and no zeal. This is what God desires.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MESSAGES WITHOUT GOD BEING WINDS OF TEACHING</h2>
<p>Have we truly seen this vision? Are all our activities controlled by this vision? I am afraid that we have not yet seen the vision of the garden of Eden and the New Jerusalem. Instead, we speak as though we are on Mount Sinai and say that we should do this and that. May the Lord have mercy on us and show us this vision. Everything we do and all our labor should be the outflow of life. Christians who live according to the concept of revering, serving, and working for God do not live as genuine Christians. If we want to live as genuine Christians, we must see that God does not want us to do anything for Him. God wants us to eat Him as food and to digest and assimilate Him into us so that He can transform us, be mingled with us, and eventually be expressed through us. Such believers are genuine.</p>
<p>If we see the vision in Genesis 2, we will drop our methods of studying the Bible and the reference books, because they do not supply us; they do not fill our hunger and quench our thirst. The methods and the books do not give us God. If we see this vision, whenever we give a message, we will not speak about anything else. This is the only light that we will see when we read the Bible. We will want to touch God in every chapter, every verse, and every word in the Bible.</p>
<p>Many preachers like to speak from Psalm 23, but few see that everything in this psalm is God. The green pastures signify God, the waters of rest signify God, the paths of righteousness signify God, the rod and the staff signify God, and even the valley of the shadow of death signifies God. Some may wonder how we can say that the valley of the shadow of death signifies God. Nevertheless, our experience confirms this word. May God open our eyes to see that the whole Bible points to God. Sadly, many people today speak about the Bible, but they do not speak about God. Even the messages that we give do not contain much God. Therefore, the saints do not receive much supply. They listen to the messages and receive teaching, but they do not gain much God. Messages of this nature are what Ephesians calls &ldquo;every wind of teaching&rdquo; (4:14).</p>
<p>Winds of teaching refer to teachings that do not cause people to be mingled with God, to gain Christ, to be joined to Christ, or to grow with the growth of God. Such teachings are winds of teaching. For the past five years, from 1953 until now, I have listened to the messages that the brothers gave from the podium. Most of the messages were teachings that did not give God. We need to see the vision in Genesis 2. May the Lord have mercy on us in these days that we may see this vision. Then we will receive much grace.</p>
