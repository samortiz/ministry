   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us compare the parable of the talents with the parable of the ten virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The parable of the talents indicates the importance of using the gifts of the Holy Spirit, whereas the parable of the ten virgins shows the importance of being full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Oil is for ourselves, and talents are for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who have talents should use them to serve God in building up the church; they should not use them for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God will never give you a gift just for your own benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the one who buries his gift will cause the Lord to suffer a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The oil is for life, and the talent is for work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having the oil means to be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You can make the best use of your gift only when you are full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ability alone is of no use, because one who has ability cannot trade without capital.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, believers need only God's gift, not theology or the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The gifted one needs to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is most dangerous to have only talents but no oil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the parable of the ten virgins is mentioned first.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Corinthians had many talents but no oil, and this led to much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is only oil but no talents, there will be a proper living but not an effective work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Similarly, if there are only talents but no oil, there will be an effective work but not a proper living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, we need to have both the oil and the talent, so that we can have an effective work as well as a proper living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The parable of the ten virgins refers to the rapture, whereas the parable of the talents refers to the judgment seat of Christ and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for the virgins to be raptured, they were required to be full of oil, the living of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order for the slaves to share in the joy of the kingdom, they were required to work, which is to serve the Lord faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These two parables are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be filled with the Holy Spirit is similar to a balloon rising up yet being held by a rope.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day the rope will break, and then the balloon will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we serve faithfully, we will receive the reward in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today's work is to prepare us for our position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Comparatively, we are now working in a kindergarten.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will be much busier in our future work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All that we learn today will be applied in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord did not specifically tell his servants that they had to trade.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, they knew the desire of the Lord and therefore invested their talents.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unfortunately, our tendency is to expect someone to ask us, plead with us, pay us, or lay hands on us to ordain us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Otherwise, we prefer to bury our talents rather than invest them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 19:"Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being tried takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"A long time" refers to the duration of the church age, which has been about two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very easy to forget the Lord's commission as the period of time is prolonged.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is easy to be zealous in the beginning, but as time goes by, we may gradually grow cold and lose our first love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet "after a long time" comes the time of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This judgment will soon take place when we become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"The master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord's second coming is a certainty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One can say that the Lord delayed His coming, but he cannot say that He will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although the slave in Matthew 24:48 was evil, the most he could say was, "My master delays."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The failure of today's churches is that they do not realize that the Lord will come and reckon with them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the time we have believed in the Lord, whatever we have done or whatever we have not done will be reckoned with.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, this reckoning is not concerning our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our works 1 Cor 3:10-15 , our conversation, and our thoughts will all be displayed before the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is different from the great white throne of judgment, at which the scrolls will be read.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the judgment seat of Christ we ourselves will have to give the account Rom 14:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can pass through this judgment if our trespasses have been judged under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose we do not repent and our trespasses are not covered by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then these will be counted against us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May we learn to judge ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are not judged by the blood today, we, the believers, will have to give account of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God will reckon with us concerning everything we do in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God is full of grace and love, as manifested in the redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the other hand, He is also holy and righteous, as will be manifested before the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He cannot overlook our unholiness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before the judgment seat of Christ not only the things we have done, but also the things we have not done, will be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The things done in a blind way, as well as our quenching of the Holy Spirit, will be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And he who had received the five talents came" Matt 25:19-20a .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Both the Lord and the slaves came.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The two met in the air, indicating the time when the believers will be raptured after the great tribulation 1 Thes 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The "came" in verse 19 refers to the Lord's descending from the heavens, and the "came" in verse 20 refers to the believers' being raptured into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Verse 20:"And he who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He who brought another five talents came first.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The "another five talents" indicates five other talents besides the five originally received in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At that time one will begin to sense the preciousness of gaining an extra "five talents" and will become anxious about not having brought another five talents.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, we do not need to wait until we are before the judgment seat to know if we will be receiving a reward or not.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The reward is being decided right now.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It all depends on how we deal with the gift that God delivers to us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, believers should not look down on the gift of the Holy Spirit, no matter how small the gift is.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do not gain our extra portion when we go before the judgment seat; we gain it while we are on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have heard the Holy Spirit's speaking, so we must not harden our hearts Heb 3:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to bring the original five talents together with the other five talents to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This shows that our work is for the Lord and not for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He who steals his master's possessions is certainly not a good slave.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should give glory only to God Himself.</S>
