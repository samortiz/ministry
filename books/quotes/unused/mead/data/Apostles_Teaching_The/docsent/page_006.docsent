   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE BAPTIZING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF ALL THE BELIEVERS INTO ONE BODY 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:1-4, 17a, 18a, 33; 1:5b, 8a; 10:44-46; 11:15-16; 1 Cor 12:13; Acts 10:47-48; 2:38, 41; 16:33; 19:5; Matt 28:19; Gal 3:27-28; Eph 1:23; 5:23b; Rev 19:7, 9; John 3:29-30; Gen 2:20b-23; Eph 5:24-25, 31-32; Rev 21:2, 9-10; Eph 2:15-16; 4:22-24; Col 3:9-11</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the past twenty centuries, there have been many disputes and divisions in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These have been the result of a lack of the proper knowledge concerning the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament is a very clear book, and its entire contents are the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may argue that there are many other things in the New Testament, such as baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Over the centuries Christians have disputed over the kind of water hot, cold, fresh, or salt water in which people should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some Christians have become preoccupied with many small details concerning baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, the Greek word for baptism indicates that baptism should be by immersion, but some Christians have argued over whether a person should be immersed in the forward or backward direction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christians have also argued over such matters as the number of times a person may be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of preoccupation shows that these believers do not know what the apostles teaching covers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the United States there is a constitution, yet not everyone is qualified to interpret it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this country there are nine very skilled Supreme Court justices who have the responsibility of interpreting the Constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our laws acknowledge that they are qualified to be the ones who interpret the Constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regarding the apostles teaching, it seems that everyone feels qualified to interpret it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A recent publication was put out by some opposing ones indicating that God s economy is in opposition to deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a writing is a sign that there is division among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A few brothers and sisters have caused a division in the Lord s recovery, and they are speaking and writing quite freely.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we must have a clear view of the apostles teaching in order to counter them with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have studied the history of the Brethren, especially of those who were with John Nelson Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If something had happened among them like the situation we are encountering today, they would have promptly excommunicated the instigators.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From our very beginning, more than sixty years ago, we realized that this was not the proper approach.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although through the years we have suffered from the dissenting and opposing ones, we would not pursue the practice of excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Romans 16:17 Paul begged us to keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Titus 3:10 says, A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A factious person is a sectarian person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should warn such a person once, then a second time; if after that he does not repent, we should reject him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rejecting any kind of division is similar to the medical practice of quarantining.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To keep oneself away from anything divisive is to exercise to quarantine the divisive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a family member becomes very sick with a contagious disease, the family will not excommunicate that member.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, that member needs to be quarantined in order that others in the family would not become infected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The quarantining does not mean that the family no longer loves the ill member.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, this is a means of expressing love toward that member and toward all the other family members.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The quarantine is exercised to keep that member safe and to keep the whole family from being contaminated with the illness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of the present situation among us, I felt burdened to speak to the saints at the end of the 1989 winter training regarding the apostles teaching and the New Testament leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As I was speaking, I realized that those meetings were not adequate to cover these two matters; thus, we will spend time during this term of the full-time training to cover them in a more thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE ENTIRE SPEAKING OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The apostles teaching is the entire speaking of God in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The entire speaking of God in the New Testament concerns God s New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s New Testament economy has been unveiled to us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
