<p>We must be clear about what grace means:<p>(1) Grace is not a matter of giving man what he deserves. Romans 4:4 says, “Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due.” In other words, grace means receiving what one does not deserve. If grace involved receiving what one deserves, the very meaning of grace would be completely nullified. Grace is called grace simply because there is no element of merit in it. Ephesians 2:8 says, “For by grace you have been saved.” The fact that you were saved even though you did not deserve it shows that it is grace. Romans 3:24 says, “Being justified freely by His grace.” What does “freely” mean? Freely in the original text is the same word as “without a cause” in John 15:25, where the Lord said, “They hated Me without cause.” Saying God’s grace justifies a person freely simply means that God justifies a person without any cause. “The Scripture has shut up all under sin” (Gal. 3:22). “For God has shut up all in disobedience” (Rom. 11:32). God has put all men in the same position so that none can be saved by doing good. Each and every one must be saved by grace. If you asked Paul how he was saved, he would surely answer that he was saved by God’s grace. If you asked all the saints how they were saved, they would surely answer that they were saved by God’s grace. Grace is God saving people without a cause.<p>(2) Grace is not a matter of supplementing what man deserves. Ephesians 2:9 says, “Not of works that no one should boast.” This does not mean that man should not have good works after he is saved. Rather, it means that man is not saved by works. If man were saved by good works, he would be able to boast. If thirty percent of man’s salvation was by works, man could boast of that thirty percent, while God would lose thirty percent of the glory. If ten percent of man’s salvation was by works, man could boast of that ten percent, while God would lose ten percent of the glory. It is not possible for God to share His glory with man. God hates man’s self-boasting. God’s intention is that He Himself would gain the glory. Therefore, God’s grace does not supplement what man deserves.<p>Grace is neither giving man what he deserves, nor is it giving man more than what he deserves. Grace is neither a fair compensation nor an extra compensation. The questions of whether or not God should give and whether man is worthy cannot be placed side by side with grace. If man wants to receive grace, then the question of his worthiness cannot exist at all, neither can the question of being more or less worthy be established. In the matter of salvation, man cannot use any of his work to obtain God’s grace.<p>Many have thought, “I will try my best to do good and keep the law; then I will rely on God’s grace for the things that I cannot do.” This means that they rely partially on work and partially on grace. A man once said, “We must keep the Ten Commandments; otherwise, we cannot be saved.” Then someone asked him, “Have you violated any of the commandments?” He answered, “Yes, I have.” He was then asked, “What do you do when you violate a commandment?” He responded, “I rely on God’s grace for the things that I cannot do well.” This kind of thought is a misconception of grace.<p>In Matthew 19 a young man asked the Lord Jesus, “What good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?” (v. 16). The Lord said, “But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments” (v. 17). The young man said he had kept them all. But when the Lord said, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor” (v. 21), the young man was not able. If man wants to be saved by keeping the law, he must keep it with “all.” Not only does he have to love God with all his heart, all his will, and all his strength, but he also has to give all he has in his house, without holding back any item. But if man relies on God’s grace, he has to rely on it completely. Man cannot work for one-half and leave it up to God to work for the other half. God’s grace does not supplement man’s inabilities. If it is by God’s grace, it is all by God’s grace; if it is by man’s work, it is all by man’s work. One cannot rely partially on his own work and partially on God’s grace.<p>Why is this? It is because the Lord Jesus has already died. God puts all sinners in an equal position. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, God “caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him” (Isa. 53:6). The problem of sin was solved once and for all. Therefore, man cannot rely on his own merit before God; it would overthrow the Lord’s work, as though He had died in vain.<p>(3) Grace is not a withholding from him who does not deserve it. (This is similar to the first point except that the question is turned around.) Rather, grace is given because man does not deserve it. When man realizes that he is altogether helpless and has no way out, he will call out for grace. When God sees man as helpless and having no way out, He will dispense grace. If man is capable, he will not realize he needs grace, and God will not need to bestow grace. Man’s “unworthiness” is not a hindrance to God bestowing grace. Rather, it is the one and only condition for God to bestow grace.<p>A brother once said, “Grace is boundless kindness expressed in boundless goodness.” What is grace? Grace flows down from above. What is love? Love is treating one another equally. What is respect? Respect is honoring those who are above you. Grace flows down from above. Grace has only one direction; it flows downward. If you want to obtain God’s grace, you must acknowledge that you are a helpless sinner. Being a helpless sinner qualifies you to obtain God’s grace.<p>Many people dislike grace because grace is a truth that utterly humbles people. Grace requires you to acknowledge that you are an evil person. No cup turned upside-down can contain water. Likewise, no one who is proud is willing to receive salvation. You must admit that you are useless, before you can receive God’s grace.
