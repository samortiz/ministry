   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the nineteenth century, there was a famous literary writer who was an antagonist against Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He was the chief editor of a very famous newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day he heard Mr. Moody's preaching, and he repented and believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once he became saved, many people reported the story of his salvation in the newspapers of America.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One day Mr. Chapman went into a town and stayed in the same hotel, in the room next to this man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mr. Chapman knew him and asked if it were true that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said, "I repented and believed in the Lord through hearing Mr. Moody's preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, I knew about God's love when I was eighteen years old.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I was young I was a prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I left home at the age of twelve or thirteen for several years because I did not like being confined at home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time in my youth, I became very ill and ran out of money.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I had to return home in disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My father treated me very well, but I regretted going home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My father was old; his hair was white, and he was sick.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet every day he forced himself to work to get a little bread for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was never enough for three people to eat because the income was so low.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I felt that I had made a mistake by coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I could no longer eat the bread which my father earned through his hard work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After my strength had increased some, I told him that I still wanted to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In my whole life I never saw him so sorrowful as on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said, You are not healed yet; why do you want to leave?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If there is a piece of bread in this house, you will always have a share.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is a piece of roof, you will always have a share.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why do you want to leave?'</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But I was determined to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then he said, My son, let me tell you: in my whole life, I have never desired to be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But today I wish I had a fortune because of you; I wish I could have more money saved for you so that you would not have to wander outside.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps someone will help us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why do you want to go out?'</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, I had to go.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I could not bear to eat my father's hard-earned bread anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually he said, My son, may God bless you!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After today I will not see you again; but perhaps I will see you again in heaven!'</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He escorted me out of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We walked for half a mile, during which neither he nor I said a word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We walked like this for one mile.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was tired and could not go forward anymore and had to bid farewell.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Until that day I did not know how hard it is to leave home!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He had not walked back more than two steps when he turned back and called me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With tears in his eyes, he took out a half-dollar from his pocket and gave it to me, saying, This is for you.'</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I knew what this half-dollar meant.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I knew all that my father had on earth was that half-dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I knew what was in that half-dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That was the first time in my life that I realized my father loved me!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The weather was rainy and cold as I saw my father going home, but my heart was very warm.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I was singing, My father loves me!'</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From that day on I was not a prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I decided that the first thing that I would do was reduce my father's burden.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If I earned a dollar, I would mail it to him because he loved me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From that day forward, I became another person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This does not mean that before that time my father did not love me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But at the time of my destitution, I realized that he loved me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One day I heard Mr. Moody preach the following words: Everyone talks about the father's prodigal son, but today I want to talk about the prodigal son's father.' When I heard that the Father was the same as my father, I believed and received the Lord Jesus as my Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>O brothers and sisters, I have known this God for at least eleven years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although this is not very long, I know the kind of heart that He has.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not suppose that you can do something to turn God's heart or please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He loves you and wants you to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He does not need you to turn His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many people say, "God does not tell me that He loves me."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But please take a look at the cross, and you will know that He has already loved you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You should have received the punishment of the cross, but He made the Lord Jesus suffer it for you because He loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What is love?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Love is not words.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The deepest kind of love cannot be expressed in words.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The prodigal son was prepared to say to his father, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants" Luke 15:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But when he was yet a great way off, his father had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A father's heart shortens the distance of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When his father kissed him, he knew his father's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His father did not say, "I love you," but as soon as he kissed him, the prodigal son knew his father's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He could not say the words, "Make me like one of your hired servants."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He could only say in his heart, "My father loves me."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Please do not misunderstand God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Please come to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Jesus has already died for you; this should show you what is in God's heart already.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When you see the blood of the Lord Jesus, you will know how much God loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table...As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons" 2 Sam 9:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>How marvelous that there is not one condition, not one commandment; there are only promises.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It does not say how much one should work.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Everything was given.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we understand God's heart, we cannot but believe in Him.</S>
