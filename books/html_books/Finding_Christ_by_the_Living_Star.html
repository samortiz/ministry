The second matter, or we may say the second case, is that of finding Christ&#151;the wise men were guided by the heavenly star to find the living Christ. It is with this case that we will be occupied in this little booklet. We must remember that the first mentioning of any matter in the Bible has tremendous significance: it establishes the principle and sets the course. Therefore, we need to consider carefully the account in Matthew 2 of the wise men finding Christ that we too in this present day may be numbered among those who truly find the living Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BIBLE&#151;A BOOK OF LIFE</H2><P>But before we come to the case in point, let me mention a few pertinent things. Many of us when we were young attended Christian Sunday Schools and in that setting took the Bible as a book of stories. Undoubtedly, there is not such a good story book as the Bible. I can still remember sitting at home and listening to my mother recount the story of Joseph. We all loved to hear the story of Joseph. The Sunday Schools and many Christians make the Bible a story book. There are other Christians, however, especially the great teachers and speakers, who make the Bible a book of teachings. For instance, while the Sunday Schools make the Gospel of Matthew a book of stories, the great teachers make it a book of teachings, dispensations, and doctrine concerning the kingdom. But what about us? How do we take the Bible? Let me tell you how we must take it. The entire Bible is a book of life; on every page of this book there is life. Therefore, we must take it as life and as the life supply.</P><P>Let me illustrate. You remember, when the Sadducees attempted to debate with the Lord Jesus concerning resurrection, they took a portion of the Old Testament saying, "Master, Moses said, if a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother" (Matt. 22:24). Then they proceeded to tell how seven brothers had the same wife and eventually all died. Those foolish Sadducees thought they were clever. They asked the Lord Jesus, "Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?" The Lord Jesus also chose a portion of Scripture and answered, "Have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living." Therefore, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob will all be resurrected. You see, just in the title of God, the Lord Jesus pointed out the life&#151;not the story, not the teaching, but the life.</P><P>Let me point out to you as another example the first chapter of the Bible, Genesis 1. In that chapter we have a story of God's creation&#151;but really that is not a story. Indeed, some great teachers have set forth some doctrines from this chapter. But we must forget both the story and the teachings; we must concentrate on the life. In Genesis 1, what we need to see is life. The same applies to Matthew chapter 1. In that chapter regarding the genealogy and conceiving of Christ we do have a story and a certain amount of teaching. But we should not care for the story or the teaching, but the life. Some Christians may take the Gospel of John as a book of life, but we must also take the Gospel of Matthew, and in fact every book in the Bible, as life and as the life supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING REVELATION</H2><P>Now we come to the case in Matthew chapter 2, the matter of finding Christ. How can we find Christ? To find Christ is a living matter; it is not by Bible knowledge. Now do not be offended; be patient and you will see what I mean.</P><P>Jesus was born in Bethlehem. There is no doubt about this&#151;it is an historical fact. The strange thing, however, is this: far away from the so-called Holy Land, far away from the genuine religion, far away from the temple, far away from the Jewish religious center, far away from the priests, the scribes, the Pharisees, and all the religious people, was a star showing something of Christ in a heathen land. It did not appear to the Jews, but to the Gentiles, the heathen. In all Christianity, all the preachers, ministers, and pastors tell people that they must find Christ and know Christ by the Bible. But the first case of finding Christ in the Scriptures was not by the Bible. The wise men did not have any Bible knowledge&#151;they did not even have a Bible.</P><P>Merely to hold the Bible in your hand and read Micah 5:2, saying that Christ will be born in Bethlehem, does not work. You may say after you have read it that you have got it, but you have not seen it. You have got it, but nothing has happened to you. Those chief priests and scribes knew the Bible so well, but the Lord did not go to them. He went far away to a heathen land to reveal this matter to some heathen, not through the Scriptures, but through something which human hands can never touch&#151;a heavenly star. You may have the Bible, yet you may miss the star. To hold the Book in your hand is easy, but to wait and look unto the star is rather difficult. You simply don't know when and where the star will appear. You may study the Scriptures and obtain a degree in that, and you may learn all that the Bible has to say about Christ, but you simply cannot determine when the star will come. The Book was with the Jewish people, the religious people, but the star appeared to the heathen. Have you seen this? We may think that the star should have appeared to those priests praying in the temple, but it appeared to some pagans far away from the temple.</P><P>Oh, we all must see this star. It is not a matter of seeing the Bible, but absolutely of seeing the star. What is the star? The star is the living revelation, the living vision, not the old and dead knowledge of the Scriptures, not the dead knowledge of Micah 5:2. What we need today is not merely Bible knowledge, but the heavenly vision, the instant vision, the living vision, the vision that human concept can never teach.</P><P>Let me check with you. What do you have? Do you have the Scripture verses, or do you have the star? Do you have the scriptural knowledge, or do you have the heavenly star? Do you have the old teachings, or do you have the up-to-date, instant vision? Today so many Christian teachers just have the Bible in their hands&#151;they have not seen the star. Merely to have the Bible in our hand is a deadly thing, but to see the star is a living experience. To find Christ according to the principle shown us in Matthew chapter 2 is not according to the Bible. To know Christ today is something living, not according to dead Bible knowledge, but the living, heavenly star.</P><P>The Lord always goes away from religion, even the Christian religion. Wherever and whenever we set up a religion, the Lord will certainly go elsewhere. We cannot circumscribe, confine, or restrict the Lord with our religion. We must learn in the church life never to set up a religion. Never say that this method or that way is right. If you say that, the Lord will say: "It is right for you, but I don't care for it. If you were not so right, I would be with you; but just because you are so right, I will go to those who are wrong." Whenever we say that we are right and others are wrong, be sure the Lord will leave us and go to the wrong ones. The Pharisees claimed to be so fundamental, so sound, and so scriptural. Yet the Lord Jesus said, "All right, you are so sound, but I will have nothing to do with you; I will go to the publicans and sinners; I will not only go to see them, but feast with them."</P><P>Numbers 24:17 says, "There shall come a star out of Jacob." But this star did not appear to any of the people of Jacob. The star of Jacob appeared to the pagans.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WISE MEN'S MISTAKE</H2><P>Now consider what the wise men did: they saw the heavenly star and they followed it, but they made a great mistake. They received the vision, but they soon turned to their human concept and exercised their natural understanding. They realized that this star signified the King of the Jews; therefore, they reasoned that they should go to Jerusalem and inquire of those who would be familiar with such matters. And their going, as we know, caused much trouble. I do believe that if they had not turned to their natural concept, but continually looked away to the star in the sky, the star would have gone before them all the time, leading them directly to the place where Jesus was. They need not have gone to Jerusalem. They were thoroughly wrong and caused many young and innocent lives to be taken. The Jewish religious leaders had the knowledge and the wise men had the vision, but those who received the vision made a great mistake and, apart from divine intervention, would have caused the loss of the little child Jesus.</P><P>When they arrived in Jerusalem, we read that Herod was troubled and all Jerusalem with him. Herod, yes, but why Jerusalem? Were they not for Christ? Why was all Jerusalem troubled at the birth of the One for whom they were waiting? This is religion. I'm afraid that many Christian teachers will be troubled by the Lord's return.</P><P>Then Herod called the chief priests and scribes of the people together and asked of them where Christ should be born. The scribes were those among the people who had doctors' degrees in theology. Immediately they answered, "Bethlehem!" And they gave him the right book, the right chapter, and the right verse! They quoted Micah 5:2. But did any one of them go to Bethlehem? Not one! They were troubled by the news, but no one cared to go and see what happened.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING GUIDANCE</H2><P>Then the wise men left Jerusalem, and we read, "Lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them....When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy." When you get into religion, you miss the star, but when you leave religion, the star appears to you. You cannot get living guidance in Jerusalem; you cannot receive the heavenly vision in religion; you have to leave. When they departed from Jerusalem, lo, the star went before them.</P><P>Micah 5:2 was the holy writing, the Holy Scripture, prophesying that Jesus would be born in Bethlehem. But just by that verse you could not find Jesus: you would know in what city Jesus was to be born, but you would not know on what street or in what house. I do not believe that the postman today could deliver a letter addressed to John Smith, Los Angeles, California. You see, even if you have the knowledge of the Scriptures, you still need the instant, up-to-date, living star to lead you to the very street and the very house where Jesus is. You may have the Bible knowledge, but you still need the living guidance. The Scriptures can never replace that. It is easy to accumulate scriptural knowledge, but if we would have living guidance, we must live in an intimate relationship with the Lord; we must be one with Him. The Word says that the star "went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was." The heavenly star led them to the very spot. This is all we need. I do believe that if they had no knowledge whatever of Micah 5:2, but just followed the star, they still could arrive at that place. How can we find Christ? Not merely by Bible knowledge, but by the living star. Not one merely with Bible knowledge found Christ, only those who followed the heavenly star.</P><P>Do we need the knowledge of the Scriptures? Of course, we do. It helps; but there is a big BUT. BUT the living, instant guidance, the guidance of this very moment to lead us to the very spot where Jesus is, is indispensable. I may know the Bible, but never be able to arrive where Jesus is. It is the living guidance that brings me to Jesus that I may worship Him and offer my gifts to Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANOTHER WAY</H2><P>They saw Christ and they worshipped Him; then we read in the Bible some significant words&#151;they were warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, so they departed into their own country "another way." I like this term "another way." After you have seen the living Christ, you will always take another way; you will never go the same way as you came. In fact, you should have come this way in the first place. You came the wrong way; now the Lord has adjusted you so that you will go on by the right way. Don't go back through Jerusalem. Forget about Jerusalem. Don't go back to religion&#151;take another way. By your former way you can never meet Jesus. But, hallelujah, there is another way! In Los Angeles there is another way! In San Francisco there is another way! In the United States there is another way! Praise the Lord! If you have not seen Christ, go back to religion, go back to Christianity. But if you have seen Christ, be warned&#151;you must take another way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PHILIP AND NATHANAEL</H2><P>Based upon the same principle, let us look at the case of Nathanael in John 1. Philip found Jesus and came to Nathanael and said, "Oh, I have found Christ! I have found the one of whom Moses and the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." You may say that Philip gave the right information, and you may also say that it was wrong. Philip called Him the "son of Joseph"&#151;is this right? If you say that Jesus is the son of Joseph, I will say that He is absolutely not the son of Joseph&#151;He was born of Mary. But if you say He is not the son of Joseph, I will say that He is. What would you say? Thank the Lord for Philip. Philip was really good and so simple. He did not argue. He just answered, "Come and see!" In other words, "I don't know if I gave you the right information or not&#151;just come and see! I don't know what to say, I don't know what is right or wrong. Just come and see!"</P><P>Nathanael was a godly person. He asked, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" In a sense, Nathanael was right. He learned from the Bible that Christ should not come out of Nazareth, but from Bethlehem. May the Lord allow me to use a word which is not inherently good. God told His people in His holy writings that Christ would be born in Bethlehem; so all His people received this knowledge. But God did something in a "sneaky" way. Christ was conceived not in Bethlehem, but in Nazareth. And during Mary's pregnancy He was brought to Bethlehem just for a short time, not in an ordinary way, but in a very extraordinary way. God sovereignly worked: He used Caesar Augustus of the Roman Empire to issue an order for a census, forcing Mary and Joseph to travel to Bethlehem. Immediately upon arriving in Bethlehem, Jesus was born. But just a short time later, He was brought away from Bethlehem to Egypt, and then from Egypt to settle and grow in Nazareth. So you see, Jesus really fulfilled the Scripture by being born in Bethlehem, but we may say that it was in a "sneaky" way. If you just knew the letter of the Word, you would miss it altogether. God has a way of circumventing clever people. Jesus was truly born in Bethlehem, but He was also Jesus of Nazareth.</P><P>Do not simply trust in the letter of the Word. If you do, you will miss something. You need the Word, but you still need God's presence. God is not so simple. There not only was the prophecy in the Old Testament, but also the sovereignty of God, and the sovereignty of God in a sense is rather "sneaky." God is not so open, so public, so greatly advertised. The little child Jesus just "sneaked" in. If you are so legal, so scripturally legal, God in your case is rather "sneaky." You must be on the watch. You should not say, "I know the Bible; the Bible says such and such." If you do, you will be fooled by your knowledge. The scribes knew the Scriptures backwards and forwards, but it profited them nothing. You need to be in the presence of God all the time. I do not despise the Scriptures; I honor and respect them. But be careful, the Scripture is the Scripture, but it is not God Himself. The Scripture is God's holy writings, but you still need God's holy presence. If we have His presence, we will really know when He is in Bethlehem, when He goes away, when He comes back, and where He is raised up. We have to follow the Lord in this way.</P><P>What the Lord has been doing through history, towards the worldly and religious people, is always hidden and "sneaky." It is really difficult to explain it to people. If you ask who Jesus is, outwardly speaking, He is just a man; He is Jesus of Nazareth. "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" It is really so. There is no glory, no boast, no display. Philip really gave Nathanael the best answer: "Come and see!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NICODEMUS AND THE PHARISEES</H2><P>In John chapter 7 there is another case of finding Christ. Christ was doing some marvelous things, and the people were saying, "Of a truth this is the prophet." Others said, "This is the Christ." Then some said, "Shall Christ come out of Galilee? Hath not the Scripture said, that Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem?" Yes, the Scripture does say that; they were one hundred percent right. But they missed the mark just by being right. If they did not know the Bible so well, I believe it would be easy for them to grasp the Christ. They were frustrated by their Bible knowledge. Yes, He was born in Bethlehem, but He was raised in Nazareth. This really bothers people. If you only hold the Bible in your hand, you will miss Christ. You must follow the living Christ.</P><P>Then Nicodemus, who had come to know Christ somewhat, began to argue with them. But they protested, "Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet!" They were absolutely right; not even the least prophet came out of Galilee. What would you say? We should not say, "Search and look," but, "Come and see!" If you search and look, you will miss the mark, you will miss Christ. Christ was right there; yet they said, "Search and look." This is today's situation. So many Christians are missing Christ. They keep themselves to the Scriptures: they say, "Have not the Scriptures said?" But they miss Christ. Here is the Bible, and here is Christ. They care for the Bible, but they would not care for Christ.</P><P>Oh, it is possible to be so right, but wrongly right! You may be right, but you are just partly right; eventually you are not right, for you have missed the mark. The Lord always acts in a "sneaky" way to those who feel they are so right. He does it purposely; He does not want us just to know the knowledge and go to sleep. He wants us to be alert at all times lest by knowing the Bible we lose His presence. Oh, it is possible to lose the presence of the Lord just by knowing the Bible. I would rather lose the knowledge of the Bible and keep the presence of the Lord. Do not say that as long as you are scriptural, you are all right. Regardless of how scriptural you are, if you lose the presence of the Lord, you are absolutely wrong. The Lord be merciful to us. Knowledge alone does not work. It did not work with the scribes, the chief priests, and the Pharisees, and it will not work for us.</P><P>What is the New Testament way to find and follow the Lord? It is continually to keep His presence, His hidden presence. He prophesied that he would come out of Bethlehem, but He came out of Nazareth. Give up your searching. God can never be understood by searching. I am not searching; I am seeing, I am enjoying. I do not understand and I do not care to understand, but I enjoy. His presence is really hidden. Isaiah 45:15 tells us that He is a hidden God. He is a God that hides Himself. Learn to praise Him, learn to see Him, learn to trace Him, learn to find Him, but never try to understand Him. We are not qualified to understand Him; we are only qualified to enjoy Him. So "come and see."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AFTER THE SPIRIT</H2><P>And when you come and see, do not see Him after the flesh. When Jesus came into His own country, the people said, "Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? And His sisters, are they not all with us?" (Matt. 13:55-56). They knew everything, but this was the knowledge of Jesus according to the flesh. In Matthew 22:43 we read that David in spirit called Him Lord. Do not follow those people in the flesh, but follow David in the spirit.</P><P>Now let us apply this practically to the present situation. If you would come to see the local church&#151;for example, the church in Los Angeles&#151;that is good. But do not see it after the flesh. If you see it according to the flesh, you will say that there are many peculiar people. We should not know any man after the flesh, but after the spirit. Once we knew Christ after the flesh and considered Him the little man of Nazareth, but now we know Him no longer in this way (2 Cor. 5:16). We know Him after the spirit; in spirit we call Him "Lord." Forget about the outward things, forget about the flesh; try to see the church not after the flesh, but after the spirit. If you beheld the tabernacle in the Old Testament outwardly, you could only see the outer badger skins (Exo. 36:19). There is no beauty with the badger skin; it is quite mean and common. But what was within the tabernacle? Oh, there was the gold, the silver, the precious stones&#151;the beauty of precious things. Would you rather see the church outwardly or inwardly? Outwardly speaking, the church is clothed with badger skin&#151;there is no beauty, just the toughness and even the wildness. But, hallelujah, within there is something of glory. Within, there is Jesus; within, we have Christ.</P><P>How can we find Christ? By the Bible? Yes, we need the Bible, but we must see the living star.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE STAR THROUGH THE BIBLE</H2><P>This matter of the star is not just in the Book of Matthew. All the main things of the Bible, as a rule, begin in the Old Testament and go right through the New Testament to the end of the Bible. With this matter of the star there is no exception. It is mentioned and revealed first in Numbers 24:17, "There shall come a star out of Jacob." According to the context of that verse, this star that comes out of Jacob is Christ. Christ comes as the star. Then immediately in the very opening of the New Testament, we have the star again. The wise men said: "We have seen His star in the east" (Matt. 2:2). They did not say, "We have seen a star," or "We have seen the star," but, "We have seen His star." No doubt this is the fulfillment of the prophecy in Numbers 24. The star prophesied in the Old Testament now has come and was shown to these wise men. We have seen clearly that the revealing of this star was absolutely outside of religion. The Lord God never cares for religion; anything that becomes religious, He will pass by.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE STAR IN THE CHURCHES</H2><P>The star in Matthew 2 is just the beginning of this matter in the New Testament. If we go to the last book, the Book of Revelation, we see two things: the first is that the Lord Jesus is the star, not the evening star but the morning star; secondly, we see that all the angels of the churches are stars. Here we must realize that the angels are not those heavenly beings, but the spiritual people who take the spiritual responsibility in the church&#151;they are the stars. In this book we have Christ as the morning star and those faithful followers of Christ in the churches as the stars. Now where is the star? It is so clear, the star today is in the church. At the beginning of the New Testament the star was outside of religion, but at the end of the New Testament the star is within the church. Have you seen these two ends of the New Testament? If you would see the star today, there is no need for you to look to the sky, there is no need for you to do as those wise men. Today the star is in the church and among the churches. The root and offspring of David, the Son of God as well as the Son of man, Jesus Christ as the morning star, is walking today among the local churches. Where then must you come to see the star? To the local churches.</P><P>If we are for religion, we are through as far as the star is concerned. But if we are in the genuine local church, praise the Lord, the star is here. So many of us have proved this by our experience: when we were in religion we simply had the sense of being in darkness, but when the Lord brought us into the local churches, Hallelujah, we saw the star, the brightness of the star. The heavenly star today is in the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST'S FOLLOWERS ARE STARS</H2><P>Not only is Christ Himself the star, but also His followers, the shining ones in the churches. In the Acts and the Epistles the leading ones were called elders or bishops, but in the last book of the Bible they are the stars. Now it is not a matter of title or position, but a matter of shining. All the living ones of the local churches must be shining stars.</P><P>What does it mean to be a star? Daniel 12:3 gives the answer: "And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever." The stars are those who shine in darkness and turn people from the wrong way to the right way. Now, during the church age, is the time of night; so we need the shining of the stars. All the leading ones in the local churches should never claim their position: they should never say, "I am one of the elders; you must recognize me." If they say this, they are in darkness. We need the brothers and sisters who shine; we need the shining stars. It is by the shining in today's darkness that people receive the guidance and are turned from the wrong way to the right way. Anything that is wrong is unrighteousness; anything that is right is righteousness. Those who turn many to righteousness are the stars which shine forever and ever.</P><P>In the beginning of the New Testament there was only one star in the heavens, but in the end of the New Testament there are seven stars in seven local churches. In every local church there is a star; in every local church there is something shining, leading people to the right way. About forty years ago, I was turned from the wrong way to the right way by this star in the local church. So many dear ones today can also testify to this fact; they can say, "Hallelujah, I have seen the star in the local church. It was the star in the church that turned me to the right way." Today we are not in the age of Matthew 1 and 2, but in the age of the Book of Revelation, in the local churches. Today the star is in the local churches. The Bible ends with this word: "And I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the Bride say, come" (Rev. 22:16-17). Today the star is with the Spirit and with the Bride. Where the Spirit is, there is the star; where the Bride, the church, is, there is the star.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO BECOME STARS</H2><P>In the Bible we not only see how we may follow the star, but even become one of the stars. There are two ways: first, by the Bible; second, by the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. By the Sure Word</H2><P>II Peter 1:19 gives us the first secret: "We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the daystar arise in your hearts." We have the sure Word, the Bible. But the sure Word is not the star; the Bible is not the star. Then what must we do? This verse says that since we have the sure Word, we must take heed to it, we must pay full attention to it, until the day dawn and the daystar arise in our hearts. All the Bible teachers agree that this daystar is really the morning star. But another word is used for star here: it can be translated into English as phosphorous. This star is something as phosphorous, bringing light in the darkness. The darker the situation is, the brighter the phosphorous shines. The Bible should not simply be words in black and white; it should not be dead letters. We must take heed to the words of the Bible till something as phosphorous rises within us&#151;that is, Christ as the daystar. If we deal with the Word livingly and properly, it surely will turn into the living Christ. This is the turning point&#151;the Word must be turned into Christ; the written Word must be turned into the living Word. We can never separate Christ from the living Word. We must take heed to the sure Word until it rises within us as Christ, as the phosphorous, as the day breaking through the darkness.</P><P>To have the Bible in your hands is one thing; to take heed to the Word until the daystar rises in your heart is another. To have the knowledge of the Bible is one thing, but to have a shining star rising in your spirit is another. Just to go to the seminary to study the Bible means nothing. What we need today is to take the Word into us, to take heed to the living Word until something within rises and shines in our heart. Then we will have the star, and then we will be a star. This is not just the knowledge about Christ, but Christ Himself as the living star.</P><P>People say that we do not care for the Bible, but we do not admit this. If there are believers on this earth who love the divine Word, I believe we must be numbered among them. We love the Word, but not in the dead way of letters. We love the Word by taking heed to it until something within is dawning and arising in our heart&#151;not the knowledge, not the written code, but the breaking through of day, the rising of the shining star.</P><P>What does this mean in practical experience? Sometimes we may take the Bible, read it, and get nothing. But sometimes when we open our heart and take heed to this sure Word, something within is shining, rising, dawning, breaking through. While we are pray-reading the verses of the Bible, there is a sense deep within of enlightening, of shining. And this shining creates a kind of love toward the Lord Jesus. We feel that He is so lovable. We could say, "O Lord Jesus, I love You; I do not have words to express how lovely You are!" Many times by this shining we are just beside ourselves with love to the Lord Jesus. That is Jesus coming to us as the dawning day, as the daystar rising in our hearts. I am not speaking of something I've learned from others, and I am not boasting; this is my actual experience. Many times when I was with this Holy Word, something has risen within me like the daybreak. Oh, it is wonderful! The situation may be extremely dull, the surrounding full of darkness, but something within is enlightening, shining, filling with glory.</P><P>In the days of the wise men, the seeing of the star was a miraculous occurrence, but today to see the daystar is only normal and should be our regular experience. Day by day we need to have the daystar arising within our hearts. Do not just read the Bible, and do not just pray-read the Bible; you must take heed to the sure Word until the day dawns and the daystar arises in your heart. Go on until you reach this point.</P><P>So, you see, the star today comes from the living Word. I am so happy that in this verse we have the Word and the daystar together. Firstly, we have the Word; secondly, by taking heed to the sure Word, we have the daystar rising in our heart. If we will just go along continually with this inner, rising star, we will constantly be in the Spirit and be a good follower of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. By the Spirit</H2><P>In II Peter we have the sure Word, but in Revelation we have the seven Spirits. Revelation 3:1 says, "These things saith He that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars." The hand of Jesus not only holds the seven stars, but also the seven Spirits. This means that the seven Spirits are one with the seven stars, and the seven stars are one with the seven Spirits. If we have the living Word as the daystar rising within us and we are one with the seven Spirits, eventually we will become the stars. We not only have the star shining within us, but by looking to the star and following in the Spirit we become the stars.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EVERYONE A SHINING STAR</H2><P>The Lord said unto Abraham, "I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore" (Gen. 22:17). We Christians, the genuine believers, are the real children of Abraham. We are the stars of the heaven. The Jewish people, the physical descendants, are as the sand upon the seashore. We all must be the stars&#151;not only the leaders in the local churches, but everyone. Read Revelation chapters 2 and 3 again and you will realize that eventually all in the local churches should be the stars. What the Lord wrote to the seven angels was what He wrote to the whole church. It is not a matter of teaching, knowledge, title, or position; it is absolutely a matter of shining. We need to be the shining stars that people may find Christ through us. Where is Christ? Come and see! Just follow the star! And where is the star? Hallelujah, the star is in the local churches. Brothers and sisters, are we really shining? We must shine in our homes, on our jobs, in our neighborhoods, in the schools, on the campus. Don't teach people. Just shine! Don't preach so much. Just shine! Shine! Shine! Shine! The local churches should be full of shining stars.</P><P>Let me illustrate a little more and apply what we have been saying. Many times when you go to a believer or great teacher, you sense that they are so lacking in clarity and transparency. You sense that with them there is no window, there is no light, they are opaque. That person may have all the knowledge of the Bible, but the more he talks with you, the more you feel imprisoned. Sometimes, however, perhaps not frequently, you come to a little brother, and when he speaks with you he simply says, "Hallelujah, praise the Lord!" But by those few words, something gets into you. The more he speaks with you, the more you sense that all the clouds have vanished and something is shining. Why? Because this dear little brother is a shining star. There is no tag attached to him saying, "I am a heavenly star." But when you meet him, you simply have the sense of shining.</P><P>I believe that many of you have become acquainted with Brother Watchman Nee. When he was young, he received the greatest help from a sister by the name of Miss M. E. Barber. She was so devoted to the Lord. Brother Nee told me several times, "When I went to see Miss Barber, many times while I was waiting in her living room, I had the sense that I was in the presence of the Lord." What is this? This is the star of the church. Perhaps when you come to such a person, he could not say anything, he could not answer your question. He may say, "I am not clear." But though he says he is not clear, you have the sense that you are under the shining. It is not a matter of teaching or instruction. His word may not be clear, but he himself is transparent, and when you are in his presence, you have the sense not only that he is transparent, but that you are made clear.</P><P>Let me give you another example. Suppose you come to a brother seeking counsel and advice regarding the matter of marriage. This brother may give you a number of points concerning conditions, requirements, considerations, and instructions. But the more he speaks, the more you sense that though he has much knowledge, he is opaque. The more he speaks, the more you are in darkness. Another brother, however, may answer that he simply does not know the answer, but while he is speaking, you sense that he is crystal clear. No word can express it, but while you are with him, you begin to be clear, and you know what to do about your marriage. Though this brother tells you nothing, you are enlightened. What is this? This is the presence of the morning star in this brother, making him also a shining star.</P><P>I hope that we all could be such stars. Though we know little of the teachings, though we cannot give people so many instructions, yet when they come to us, they will be enlightened. There is no need to argue with others: be sure that when you argue, you will keep people away. The enlightening does not depend on how much you can say or reason, but upon what you are. If you are a shining star, who can escape your shining? This is entirely beyond human expression and explanation. It is absolutely a matter of the presence of the Lord. If we take heed to the sure Word, we will have the star rising within us; then if we are faithful simply to follow the inner, rising star, we will be fully in the Spirit and eventually we will be the stars in the local church, not in an objective way, but in a very subjective way. Praise the Lord that by His grace we all can be the stars.</P><P>Matthew 13:43 tells us, "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father." Today, during the time of the night, we need to function as the star; but in the coming age of the kingdom those who shine now as the stars will shine forth as the sun. Now we are the shining stars, but in that day we will be as the sun.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WANDERING STARS</H2><P>There is also a negative aspect to the stars&#151;the wandering stars. Jude 12 and 13 tell us, "These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots...wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever." We should be the stars, but not the wandering stars. These are the false leading ones. So many Christians today are not stars; some, however, are stars, but they are wandering stars. There are leaders and teachers in today's Christianity who are in this category.</P><P>Do you know what a wandering star is? I do not know astronomy, but I can tell you a little. A proper star has a certain position and fixed orbit. It continues in its course steadfastly. But there are some stars with no fixed position or orbit: they are wandering stars. It seems that some Christians are stars, it seems that they are shining, but their shining is a deception. They are stars, but they are not the steadfast stars. If you follow them, you will be misled; eventually you will not know where to go. They themselves are wandering: they have no ground, they have no standing, they have no certain way to go on with the Lord. Today they say this, and tomorrow they will say that; they are wandering. Be careful! You can never find Jesus by following a wandering star.</P><P>How may we know the wandering stars? There are some signs. They are trees without fruit, they are the clouds without rain. You must look for the fruit. The Lord Jesus said that we may know a tree by its fruit (Matt. 7:16-20). If we follow the wandering stars, eventually our portion will be the same as theirs&#151;the blackness of darkness forever.</P><P>We must follow the shining stars, those with a definite standing and a certain course. These are the stable stars, the steadfast ones. If anyone comes to you without a definite standing and certain course, avoid him. The proper standing is the local church, and the right course is to go on in the Spirit in the local church. Never be a wandering star, and never follow a wandering star. Take the proper standing, and get yourself in the right course. If you are wandering, you are wasting your time. If you would go to a certain place, get out your map, get on the right road and in the right lane; and as you drive, you will reach your destination.</P><P>I am not speaking these things lightly. You are aware of today's confusion. Oh, the dead things! Oh, the frustrations, the distractions of the wandering ones! Anyone who keeps us from the genuine local church and from meeting on the ground of unity with the Lord's people is a wandering star. The true stars are those who turn many to righteousness, those who do not lead people astray, but turn them to the right way. Today the only way for you and me and for anyone to find Christ is to see the living star. Hallelujah! Today the star is not far from us&#151;it is with the local churches. Among all the local churches there are some living stars. You just have to contact them; you just have to keep company with them. They will lead you to the place where Jesus is.</P><P>The Lord be merciful to us that we may always be kept in the right way to meet the Lord, to worship Him, and to offer our love to Him. May the Lord make us all like those wise men, following the star to find Christ. Today the living star and the living stars are in the local churches. Let us follow them and let us be one of them.</P></body></html>
