 <h2 class="head3">7. In the Coming Great Tribulation</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Setting Up an Idol in the Temple of the Elect<br />
through Antichrist&rsquo;s Opposition to God</h2>
<p>According to the prophecy of the Bible, the Israelites will restore their nation and rebuild the temple. At that time Antichrist will be raised up, and Satan will rise up to oppose God through him, setting up an idol in the temple, the idol being the image of Antichrist. This is revealed in Daniel 8:11-12, 25, 9:27, 11:36-37, 12:11, and 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Destroying and Afflicting Israel, God&rsquo;s Elect</h2>
<p>According to Daniel 7:21-25, 8:23-25, and Revelation 12:15-17 Satan will particularly destroy and afflict Israel, God&rsquo;s elect, at this time. At this point Satan&rsquo;s damaging work on the chosen people will end temporarily.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Satan&rsquo;s Attack on the Lord Jesus</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Trying to Destroy the Lord<br />
Immediately after His Birth</h2>
<p>When Herod heard the report of the birth of the Lord Jesus, he murdered all the boys in Bethlehem and within its borders who were two years old and younger. However, in His wisdom God took the Lord Jesus to Egypt; after He was brought back He fled again to dwell in Galilee. This is revealed in Matthew 2:1-8, 13-16, and 19-22.</p>
 <h2 class="head3">2. Spending Forty Days<br />
to Tempt the Lord in Every Way<br />
When He Began His Ministry</h2>
<p>See Luke 4:1-13.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Spying on the Lord Jesus Constantly</h2>
<p>Even though Satan left the Lord Jesus after the forty days of temptation, he followed Him constantly, spying on Him, and waiting for any opportunity to attack Him. This is seen in Luke 4:13.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Troubling the Lord<br />
through the Unclean Demons under Him</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was troubled by demons wherever He went. This work of Satan is revealed in Luke 4:33-34, 41, and 8:28-29.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Betraying and Killing the Lord<br />
through One of the Lord&rsquo;s Disciples</h2>
<p>Satan entered into Judas, and Judas became the embodiment of Satan to betray and kill the Lord. This is revealed in John 6:70-71, 13:2, 27, and Luke 22:3-6.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Bruising the Lord through the Cross</h2>
<p>In the end, Satan bruised the Lord Jesus through the cross. Genesis 3:15 says that the serpent would bruise the seed of the woman on the heel. We all know that a bruise on the heel is very painful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Defeat of Satan by the Lord Jesus</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Coming That He Might Destroy<br />
the Works of the Devil</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus came into the world through incarnation so that He might destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Casting out Unclean Demons under Satan<br />
in Every Place</h2>
<p>Wherever the Lord went, He cast out demons; this is the Lord&rsquo;s victory over Satan (Matt. 8:31-32; 9:32-33; 12:22-28; Mark 1:25-26; 9:20-29).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Binding Satan</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus&rsquo; work on the earth was to bind Satan. Matthew 12:29 says that the Lord first bound the strong man before plundering his goods. The strong man is Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Giving Authority to the Disciples<br />
to Deal with Satan and the Demons under Him</h2>
<p>Luke 10:17-20 says that the demons were not only subject to the Lord Jesus; they were also subject to the disciples because the Lord Jesus gave this authority to the disciples.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Causing Satan to Have Nothing in Him</h2>
<p>Satan was always spying on the Lord Jesus, working with all his heart and might; however, the Lord Jesus did not give Satan the slightest opportunity (John 14:30).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Destroying Satan<br />
through His Death on the Cross</h2>
<p>See Hebrews 2:14.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Stripping Off All the Angels under Satan<br />
and Triumphing over Them</h2>
<p>The Lord stripped off the rulers and authorities in the air, including all the angels under Satan, triumphing over them (Col. 2:15).</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Capturing the Capturing Power of Satan</h2>
<p>Satan, who captures people, has capturing power. But when the Lord Jesus gained the victory through death and resurrection, He captured the capturing power of Satan. Using today&rsquo;s terminology, we can say that He disarmed Satan. This is the meaning of Ephesians 4:8.</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. Being Far above All the Angels under Satan</h2>
<p>In His ascension, the Lord not only overcame all rule and authority, He was far above them (Eph. 1:20-21).</p>
