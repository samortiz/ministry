<h1 class="title">LIVING IN ASCENSION<br />
BY DISCERNING THE SPIRIT FROM THE SOUL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 4:7-15; Heb. 4:12; 1 Thes. 5:23; 2 Cor. 4:16</h1>
<p>In this message I would like to give a word about living in ascension by discerning the spirit from the soul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CALL TO LIVE IN ASCENSION</h2>
<p>In Song of Songs 4:7-8 the Lord calls His lover to live in ascension as a new creation in resurrection. The new creation is only that which is in ascension in resurrection. Without resurrection, there cannot be a new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Expressing His Appreciation<br />
of His Lover</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You are altogether beautiful, my love, / And there is no blemish in you&rdquo; (v. 7). Here the Lord expresses His appreciation of His lover to prepare her to receive His call to live in ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Call to Come with Him<br />
from Lebanon</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; / With me from Lebanon come&rdquo; (v. 8a). Lebanon is a high mountain, signifying resurrection. In 2:9 the lover was in &ldquo;our wall&rdquo; of the introspective self. The wall is down in the self. Her introspection had built a wall which separated her from the Lord. Now He calls her to come with Him to a high mountain, which is the top of resurrection&mdash;ascension. Christ died, rose, and then ascended. First we experience resurrection, then ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Looking from the Top of Amana,<br />
from the Top of Senir and Hermon</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions&rsquo; dens, / From the leopards&rsquo; mountains&rdquo; (v. 8b). We have pointed out that <em>Amana</em> means &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; Hence, this is the peak of revelation. <em>Senir</em> means &ldquo;soft armor.&rdquo; Soft armor indicates that the fighting is over and the victory has been gained. <em>Hermon</em> means &ldquo;destruction.&rdquo; The enemy has been destroyed. In Christ&rsquo;s ascension is His victory. There is no more fighting, for the enemy has been destroyed and the armor has become soft. Furthermore, the truth is here. The truth refers to the reality of the Triune God&mdash;all that God is, all that Christ is, and all that the Spirit is. This is ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Looking from the Lions&rsquo; Dens<br />
and from the Leopards&rsquo; Mountains</h2>
<p>Verse 8 speaks of looking from the lions&rsquo; dens and from the leopards&rsquo; mountains. The victory has been gained, but the lions and the leopards, which signify Satan and his evil forces, are still there. These evil powers are also in the heavenlies (Eph. 6:12). Christ calls His lover to look from this, indicating that we must have our living in ascension.</p>
<p>In our daily lives we should not live in our &ldquo;wall,&rdquo; down on the earth, nor should we live in our &ldquo;den.&rdquo; We should not live in seclusion. We have been resurrected and are now in ascension; the war is over, and victory has been gained. However, all the enemies are still there, and thus we need to be watchful.</p>
