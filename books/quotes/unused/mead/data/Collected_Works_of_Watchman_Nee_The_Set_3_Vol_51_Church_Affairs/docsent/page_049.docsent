   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THINGS HANDLED IN THE SERVICE OFFICE For Contacting One Another</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this office the main work is to do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One is to meet the need of the brothers and sisters who wish to discuss matters face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a local church there is not much problem if there are not many brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a church is in a large city or the number of brothers and sisters is more than several hundred, it is not easy to find someone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If someone comes from out of town, he would not know whom to look for.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the deacons in the church should come to the business office to work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There must be a place, and there must be someone available so that when people come, you have a way to make arrangements to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You should distribute to each, as anyone has need.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You should have a place to keep records, knowing what the needs are, how many people there are, how many family units there are, and how many children there are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There should always be someone supervising and arranging.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words there must be a place for making arrangements and for contacting one another in order to take care of matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the first use of the service office: mutual contact of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, if some brother or sister comes to that church to look for other brothers and sisters, he would not know where to go to look for them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There must be a place where he can find them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not know if you have seen this principle or not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such contact with one another requires a business office, or we might call it the service office.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For Keeping Many Records</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second use of the service office is for keeping many records.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are a considerable number of affairs in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every week there are quite a few letters of recommendation written and sent out, quite a few announcements to be made, quite a few things to pray for, quite a few people to be received, and quite a few people baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these things need to be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There may be brothers and sisters who have moved; there may be some who are sick and some who have family problems.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It will not work to have one or two persons trying to remember all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if you could remember all this, when anyone needed to check the information, he would have to look for you, but even so, he could not look into your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>People need something that they can open up and look into.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not mean that these things need to be kept forever.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that when the spiritual aspects are gone, these things will be gone too.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When there are blessings, these things and these methods are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the blessing is gone, there will be no need for these methods to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, as long as there is blessing, before God we need to seek a way for an arrangement to be made to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is a need for a place, for someone to serve, and for the records to be available.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This place is our business office.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both the place and the personnel must be available; then it will be possible for all the affairs to be handled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Someone needs to be there to receive people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The records need to be readily available.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There should be no need to ask a certain brother for information, for man's memory is not reliable, and man's life is not reliable either.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Having records available is more stable and more reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I want the brothers and sisters to understand why we need to have the service office.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For what purpose have we had a service office in Shanghai since 1938?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The service office meets the local needs and is able to take good care of the affairs of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do not intend to take good care of the affairs of the saints, then you do not need an office.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you remember, you remember; if you do not remember, you just let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If, however, you want everything to be well taken care of, you must have the service office.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE NEED FOR THE SERVICE OFFICE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason we need a training; we need some knowledge concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, I hope that in all the places, although we do not need to be in absolute uniformity, our procedures would be somewhat similar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe that the needs among us are similar.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Bear in mind that what we should do will be according to the principle of Acts 2 through 6, according to the principle of the record book.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We ask God to give us a method which will match our need.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Bible there is a method to take care of things, but the Bible does not pass it on.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>So we also do not expect to pass on our method.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those in the beginning had a need; therefore, they sought out a method.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Presently, a few of our brothers have found a suitable method.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps there will be a new method, another method, after five or ten years to meet the need of that time.</S>
