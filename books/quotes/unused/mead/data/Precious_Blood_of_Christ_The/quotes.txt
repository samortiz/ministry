[1]  / But your iniquities have become a separation / Between you and your God, / And your sins have hidden His face / From you so that He does not hear Isa 59:1-2 .
[2]  First, you have broken God s law; that is, you have done something that offends God.
[3]  Whenever you sin and sense guilt within, you may simply open to God and pray something like this: O God, forgive me for what I did today.
[4]  However, sometimes after you confess and apply the blood you may continue to have some bad feeling within.
[5]  Satan, God s enemy, spends most of his time day and night accusing God s people.
[6]  Satan claimed that God bribed Job and that if God took away all Job s riches, Job would curse God.
[7]  But when you search your conscience, you find no specific sin that would cause you to be separated from God.
[8]  If you confess your sin and claim the precious blood, yet some uneasiness continues to tug at you within, you should stop praying immediately.
[9]  The word of your testimony is just your declaration that the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed you from every sin and that this blood has defeated Satan.
[10]  Whenever any little sin would come to frustrate your fellowship with God, you may instantly confess and claim the Lord s prevailing blood.
