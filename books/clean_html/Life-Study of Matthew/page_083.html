<h2 class="head3">3. Not to Repeat Empty Words</h2><p>As we pray, we are not to repeat empty words. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;And in praying do not repeat empty words as the nations do; for they suppose that they will be heard through their much speaking.&rdquo; This does not mean, however, that we should not repeat our prayer. The Lord repeated His prayer in Gethsemane (26:44), the Apostle Paul prayed the same prayer three times (2 Cor. 12:8), and the great multitude in heaven praised God with hallelujahs repeatedly (Rev. 19:1-6). It means that we should not repeat with empty words, words in vain.</p><p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Therefore do not be like them, for God your Father knows what things you have need of before you ask Him.&rdquo; Although God our Father knows our need, we still need to ask Him, because he who asks receives (7:8).</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Pattern of Prayer</h2><p>In verses 9 through 13 we find the pattern of prayer. However, it is not the pattern for all prayers. The prayer presented here in Matthew 6 is absolutely different from the prayer taught in John. In Matthew 6 we are not told to pray in the Lord&rsquo;s name, but in John chapters fourteen through seventeen the Lord Jesus tells us repeatedly to pray in His name. The reason for this difference is that the prayer here in Matthew is not related to life; it is related to the kingdom. In this short pattern of prayer the kingdom is mentioned at least twice. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Let Your kingdom come,&rdquo; and verse 13 says, &ldquo;For Yours is the kingdom.&rdquo; The prayer in John, on the contrary, is related to life. Praying in the Lord&rsquo;s name is not a matter of the kingdom, but a matter of life. To pray in the Lord&rsquo;s name means that we are one with the Lord. In praying to the Father, we are one with the Lord. Hence, we are praying in His name. To pray in the Lord&rsquo;s name is actually to pray in the Person of the Lord. We are praying with Him in one name and in one life. Therefore, we are one with Him in life, praying to God the Father. But as we have seen, the prayer in Matthew 6 is absolutely different, for it is a prayer of the kingdom.</p><p>If you would have some prayer in life, you must go to John. You must abide in the Lord and be one with Him. You must remain in your spirit and pray in oneness with Him. This is what it means to pray in His name. But the prayer in Matthew 6 concerns the kingdom. In other words, it is a fighting prayer, a prayer of warfare against God&rsquo;s enemy for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p><p>Verse 9 begins with the words, &ldquo;Pray, then, like this.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;like this&rdquo; do not mean to recite. In the Acts and the Epistles there is no example of such reciting. However, in certain Christian denominations today this prayer is recited during every Sunday morning service. I recited this prayer very often as a youth in a denomination. This is not to say that those who recite this prayer are not sincere in doing so. No doubt there have been a good number who were very sincere in their repeating of this prayer.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Praying That God&rsquo;s Name May Be Sanctified</h2><p>In the example of prayer patterned by the Lord, the first three petitions imply the Trinity of the Godhead. &ldquo;Let Your name be sanctified&rdquo; is mainly related to the Father, &ldquo;let Your kingdom come&rdquo; to the Son, and &ldquo;let Your will be done&rdquo; to the Spirit. This is being fulfilled in this age, and it will be fulfilled in the coming kingdom age, when the name of God will be excellent in all the earth (Psa. 8:1), the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ (Rev. 11:15), and the will of God will be accomplished.</p><p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Our Father Who is in the heavens, let Your name be sanctified.&rdquo; Today God&rsquo;s name is not sanctified; rather, it is profaned and made common. Unbelievers may ask, &ldquo;What is God? Who is God?&rdquo; People speak about Jesus Christ in the same way that they speak about Plato or Hitler. They make the name of the Lord Jesus common. But we know that the day will come, in the millennium, when the name of God will be sanctified. But, prior to that time, our Father&rsquo;s name is wholly sanctified in the church life today. We do not call upon the Father or speak the name of the Lord in a common way. Rather, when we say &ldquo;Father&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; we sanctify these holy names. Thus, we need to pray, &ldquo;O Father, let Your name be sanctified.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head4">b. Praying That God&rsquo;s Kingdom May Come</h2><p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Let Your kingdom come.&rdquo; Although the kingdom is here in the church life today, the manifestation of the kingdom is yet to come. Thus, we must pray for the coming of the kingdom. This matter of the kingdom is clearly related to God the Son.</p>
