   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VISITING PEOPLE WITH THE HIGH GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is new for us to go out to visit people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The way that we knock on people's doors in the community is new.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Mormons knock on doors, but they bring their heresy with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What can they give people?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They have no truth, no life, and no light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we visit people with truth, life, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The booklet entitled The Mystery of Human Life is full of truth, life, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The high gospel in this booklet can reach the thoughtful people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most of the Chinese people are very logical and philosophical.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have found that the truth in the The Mystery of Human Life can reach these people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Confucius taught about human life, but he did not give the answer to the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Human life is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The answer to the meaning of human life is not in any philosophical book; it is in the Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One of the first things The Mystery of Human Life speaks of is that man was created by God according to God's image to receive God and contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The three circles representing the spirit, soul, and body are also in this booklet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It says that God desires to come into man's spirit and that man's spirit is for him to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thousands have been brought to the Lord through this small booklet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Immediately after the new ones are baptized, home meetings should be set up in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Following the preaching of the gospel to lead them to believe and be baptized, we must teach them the truth and help them to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today in the local churches, by the Lord's mercy, we have the high gospel and much truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regretfully, however, we have been limited by our unscriptural practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have much cargo of truth and life, but we do not have the adequate way to spread it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is because in the past we took the wrong way, the easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In some respects we have been drifting back to the practice of Christianity, leaving our cargo in storage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since 1974 we have published many books, but these books mostly remain on our bookshelves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not use them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By October of 1984, I was clear that our practice had to be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord has given us many truths and much life, but not many would go out to spread these truths and to minister the very Christ as life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to take the way which is on the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must follow Him.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He charged His disciples to go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation Mark 16:15 .</S>
