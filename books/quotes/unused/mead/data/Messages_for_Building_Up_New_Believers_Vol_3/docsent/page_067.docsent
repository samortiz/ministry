   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITHSTANDING SATAN BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 5:8-9 says, Be sober; watch.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Him withstand, being firm in your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s Word shows us clearly that the way to withstand Satan is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no other way to withstand him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What should our faith rest on?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How should we exercise our faith to withstand him?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us consider what the Word of God says concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A. Believing That the Lord s Manifestation</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is to Destroy the Works of the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, we must believe that the Lord was manifested for the purpose of destroying the works of the devil 1 John 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Son of God has come to the earth; He was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When He was on earth, He destroyed the work of the devil wherever He went.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Often Satan s work was not obvious; he hid behind natural phenomena.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the Lord rebuked him every time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is clear that He was rebuking Satan when He rebuked Peter s speaking Matt 16:22-23 , when He rebuked the fever of Peter s mother-in-law Luke 4:39 , and when He rebuked the winds and the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the devil hid behind many natural phenomena, the Lord Jesus rebuked him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wherever the Lord went, the power of the devil was shattered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why He said, But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you Matt 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, wherever the Lord went, Satan was cast out, and the kingdom of God was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan could not remain where the Lord was.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why He said that He was manifested to destroy the works of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should also believe that in manifesting Himself on the earth, the Lord not only destroyed the works of the devil, but also gave authority to His disciples to cast out demons in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord said, Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy Luke 10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He gave His name to the church so that His church might continue His work on earth after His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord used His authority on earth to cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He also gave this authority to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must distinguish between what the devil has and what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What the devil has is power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What we have is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All that Satan has is power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the Lord Jesus has given us authority, which can overcome all the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Power cannot prevail over authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has given us authority, and Satan will surely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Consider an illustration of how authority overcomes power: A traffic light on a road controls traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a policeman turns on the red light, all pedestrians and cars have to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No one is allowed to dash through a red light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The pedestrians and cars are much more powerful than the red light in terms of power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, no pedestrian or driver will dare dash through the red light because of the presence of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is an example of authority prevailing over power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Authority prevails over power; this is God s established policy in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No matter how strong Satan s power is, one fact remains sure the Lord Jesus has given His name to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This name stands for authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church can cast out demons in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can invoke the Lord s name to deal with Satan s power.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thank God that no matter how great Satan s power is, the Lord s name is immeasurably greater.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The authority behind the Lord s name is strong enough to overcome all the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The disciples went out in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They were surprised when they returned.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They told the Lord, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord s name spells authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His giving of His name to us means that He has given His authority to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord said, Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you v. 19 . Whoever desires to withstand Satan must learn to know the difference between the Lord s authority and Satan s power.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No matter how great Satan s power is, the Lord s authority is able to overcome him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must believe that God has given this authority to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church can cast out demons and withstand the devil in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
