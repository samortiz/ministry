   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the objective aspect of the truth there are four main factors: Christ 1 Cor 2:2; Col 2:2 , the Spirit 2 Cor 3:8 , life John 1:4 , and the church Eph 1:22b-23; 3:4; 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These four factors in the truth have been my subjects in the ministry for years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Each one of these factors is a great topic, and all of them are included in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason we have to change our practice to the new way is to carry out these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We want to carry out Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our purpose, our goal, and our destiny is not merely to preach the gospel to save souls.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Preaching the gospel for others salvation is a means to accomplish the purpose that can fulfill God s economy concerning Christ and the Spirit through the divine life for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To accomplish such a goal we need the way to save sinners, to make sinners sons of God so they can be brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Otherwise, we will not have the new materials to accomplish such a great universal building, the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To visit people, to have home meetings, and to group people together into group meetings are not our goal; they are simply the means to reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our goal is to have the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the very goal, the destiny, according to God s eternal economy, which He purposed in Christ according to His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This building has to be of Christ, of the Spirit, by the divine life, and through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From 1962 to 1984 in the United States we concentrated our ministry on Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we pick up the matter of visiting people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, this does not mean that we drop these four major items.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In practicing the new way, we have never dropped these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since I returned to Taipei in 1984 to begin the practice of the new way, I never departed from Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I spoke to the trainees in Taipei, I spoke on these four subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first few messages I gave to the full-time trainees in Taipei were on the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I believe that the four factors of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church cannot leave those of us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if we wanted to drop them, we could not because they have been deeply rooted in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IN THE SUBJECTIVE ASPECT OF PRACTICE Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The other four factors of the new way are in the subjective aspect of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first item of practice is to visit people by knocking on their doors for the preaching of the gospel Matt 22:9-14; Luke 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our experiment on this item was completely successful based on the fact that thirty-eight thousand people in Taipei believed and were baptized in less than two years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To get thirty-eight thousand people to receive the Lord and be baptized required a lot of labor, yet this was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, I have received hundreds of encouraging letters from the six continents testifying that this new way to preach the gospel works so well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The practice of visiting people to preach the gospel is the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God visited Adam Gen 3:8-9 and preached the gospel to him 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus visited people Luke 19:1-10; John 4:3-15 , and He sent the twelve disciples to visit people Matt 10:5-8, 11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, He sent the seventy to go to every city and place to seek the sons of peace Luke 10:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After His resurrection, He charged all of His disciples to go to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Can the nations be discipled if we do not visit people?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To go is to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The early missionaries opened up the old and conservative China because they paid the price to visit people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of their visiting, the Lord opened up the Chinese race to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We owe much to this first group of missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They did not have the light that we do, but in this matter of living to God s gospel, these devoted God-men were incomparable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through their marvelous and even legendary mission work of visiting people s homes and knocking on their doors, the Lord had a way to spread the gospel throughout China.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to take this biblical way of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the subjective aspect of the practice of the scriptural way, we stress the preaching of the gospel by visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to go to visit people to bring God, Christ, the Spirit, the gospel, the holy Word, salvation, and God s presence to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we visit people, we bring all these heavenly and divine things to their homes, to their families.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not need to invite people to our place to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to go with all these wonderful, heavenly, and divine things as gifts to impart into people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to take the way of visiting people to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not mean that we should never invite people to hear the gospel or that inviting people is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But there are different ways of doing anything, and we must choose and take the top way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are going to travel somewhere today, we will not take a mule wagon.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I travel long distances, I like to take a 747, which is the fastest and most efficient way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To knock on people s doors for the preaching of the gospel is the best way to take.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When it comes to preaching the gospel, visiting people by knocking on their doors is higher and better than any other way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only by taking this way could we have baptized thirty-eight thousand people in less than two years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not the only way of preaching the gospel, but this is the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If I were to travel from Los Angeles across the Pacific Ocean to Taiwan on a junk, it would take me at least six months.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I would not be wise if I took that way when I can fly to Taiwan on a 747 from Los Angeles and be there within twelve hours.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a wonderful age with wonderful modern means of transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not need to preach the gospel by the poor way of a mule wagon or a junk.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, we can take the best way to preach the gospel by visiting people, knocking on their doors to find the sons of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Luke 10 the Lord said that He sent the seventy as lambs in the midst of wolves to find the sons of peace vv.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We found thirty-eight thousand sons of peace in Taipei within less than two years, not by setting up a love feast and inviting them to come but by knocking on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I say again that visiting people by knocking on their doors is not the only way to preach the gospel, but it is the top way, the best way.</S>
