(See Acts 1:9-11.)<p>Up through the realm of the defeated enemy-Satan, the usurper-the God-Man passed in triumph, having shaken off from Himself the hostile princes and rulers whom He &#8220;boldly displayed as His conquests, when by the Cross He triumphed over them&#8221; (Col. 2:15, Weymouth).<p>Up to &#8220;heaven itself,&#8221; the third heaven, went the God-Man, and having fully executed God&#8217;s Plan of Redemption, &#8220;He sat down at the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting, till His enemies be made His footstool&#8221; (Heb. 10:12-13).<p>God has corroborated the statement of Jesus upon the Cross- &#8220;It is finished,&#8221; by the display of His Resurrection and Ascension Power. God&#8217;s Plan of Redemption for the human race has been fully executed. Not a single thing remains to be done. Eternal Life and everlasting sonship are ready for any human being who chooses to accept the same.<p class=hbody>There is not a being that&#8217;s under the sun,<br> Nor above it, nor anywhere in the wide earth<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor in the whole heaven<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not God nor Christ even;<br> Not all these combined can do aught, for &#8217;tis Done!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Done thoroughly, gloriously,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superbly, victoriously<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As God&#8217;s Self would have it,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Done! there we may leave it;<br>Christ&#8217;s work on the Cross is of infinite worth<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting sin in its root<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through all its fruit;<br>And God rests; and Christ rests; and the man who believes<br>May rest as secure and established as They<br>And as happy, though heaven and earth pass away;<br>May rejoice to the full in the Life he receives.</p><p style="font-style:italic">Malachi Taylor</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
