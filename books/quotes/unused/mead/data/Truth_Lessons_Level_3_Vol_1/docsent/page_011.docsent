   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the bride of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ, her Husband, and becomes His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, and became his counterpart.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor 11:2; Eph 5:31-32 for His satisfaction in love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, the saints throughout the generations, who have been chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified by God, will constitute the New Jerusalem to be the universal bride of the unique male in the universe Christ that He may have the full satisfaction in love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Wife of the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Revelation 21:9 shows us that this universal bride is also the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A bride is mainly for the wedding day, whereas a wife is for the entire married life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennial kingdom for one thousand years, which is like one day 2 Pet 3:8 , and will be the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, to the ages of the ages without end.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She has gold, signifying the divine nature of God, as her city proper Rev 21:18 ; she has pearls, signifying Christ s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, as her gates v. 21 ; she has precious stones, signifying the Spirit s work of transformation, as the wall and the foundation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>18, 14, 19 ; she has the Triune God as her temple and her light vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>22-23 ; she has the throne of the Triune God as her center 22:1 ; and she has the flow of the Triune God as her supply v. 1 . Thus, ultimately, the New Jerusalem, typified by Eve, is the full expression of the Triune God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Bible Adam as the first man is a type of the Christ who was to come.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He typifies Christ: as the center of God s creation, in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created; as the Head of all God s creation, the One who has the preeminence in all creation; as the One who bears God s image and likeness to express what God is; as God s representative, anointed and commissioned by God to carry out God s purpose; as the Head of all men, appointed by God in the divine administration to rule over all men; and as God who became the unique male in the universe to be the universal Bridegroom to marry His redeemed people as His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Among God s creation, none could match Christ as His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, Christ slept in death and His side was opened to flow out the water of life, which produced the church as His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the sinner whom God created and who became fallen, after having been redeemed and transformed by Christ s death and resurrection, becomes the woman in the universe to be married to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as Adam is a type of Christ, Eve is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eve typifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church came out of Christ, has the same character, life, and nature as Christ, and is joined to Christ to be one spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is also the Body of Christ to be His counterpart as His reproduction, multiplication, increase, fullness, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eve as the counterpart of Adam ultimately typifies the New Jerusalem, the universal bride, constituted with the saints throughout the generations, who have been chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified by God, to be the bride of Christ in the millennium and the wife of the Lamb for His satisfaction in eternity, to the ages of the ages without end. The New Jerusalem takes the Triune God as her center, substance, element, and essence to be the full expression of the Triune God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>QUESTIONS Briefly state the different aspects in which Adam serves as a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the significance of the type in which Adam s side was opened and a rib was taken out to build a woman?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is typified in Eve s coming out of Adam and being joined to Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Explain how Eve is a type of the church which becomes the Body and the counterpart of Christ and which ultimately will become the New Jerusalem.</S>
