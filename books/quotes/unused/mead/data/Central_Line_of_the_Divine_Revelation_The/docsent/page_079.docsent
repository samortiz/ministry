   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE AGGREGATE OF THE ALL-EMBRACING BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE FULL GOSPEL OF GOD IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FOR THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ACCORDING TO THE DIVINE ECONOMY 4 Scripture Reading: Gal 1:16a; 3:2; 4:29b, 6; 3:27; 2:20</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prayer: Lord, we look to You for Your teaching, Your instruction, Your guidance, even Your interpretation of Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need You to teach us, to guide us into Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, do cleanse us and anoint us and render us much help that we may know You through Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This message concerns the way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is Galatians that tells us that the blessing of the full gospel of God is the promised Spirit 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This promised Spirit, when He comes to us in His consummation, is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Paul's interpretation, the promise God gave to Abraham was the blessing of this life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to spend some time to see the logic by which Paul said this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul was very logical doctrinally, spiritually, and economically according to God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The book of Galatians presents to us the very Christ who is the threefold seed in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was the complete God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then He came in to promise something to the fallen race, beginning with the first couple, Adam and Eve Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I believe that He directed this promise particularly to the wife, Eve, because Eve very much regretted what she had done.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She was the one who spoke to the serpent, and as a result the serpent damaged her and also her husband through her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, she was fully responsible for that mistake, which led to man's fall 2 Cor 11:3; 1 Tim 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the fall, the complete God as Jehovah came from heaven down to the earth to the garden of Eden, seeking the fallen sinner: "And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gen 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That was the first visit for the purpose of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then God gave them the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That promise was the first preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In that promise, in that first preaching of the gospel, the complete God made a promise to the couple, especially to Eve, by cursing the serpent v. 14 . The first preaching of the gospel was the pronouncing of a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God was cursing the damaging serpent, He promised the damaged persons that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent's head v. 15 . In the entire Bible of sixty-six books there is such a reality as the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Galatians 4:4 Paul purposely said that the Coming One, Christ, was born of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that Paul knew what God had promised in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul knew the Bible, the Old Testament; therefore he said, "God sent forth His Son, born of a woman."</S>
