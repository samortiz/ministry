   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE THREE POSITIVE ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE SPIRITUAL BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 3 Paul continues, For we are the circumcision, who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are absolutely different from the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They serve as priests by the Spirit of God, not by the ordinances of law; they boast in Christ, not in the law; and they have no confidence in the flesh, but have their confidence in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verses 2 and 3 there is a threefold contrast: believers who serve by the Spirit of God in contrast to the dogs; believers who boast in Christ in contrast to evil workers; and believers who have no confidence in the flesh in contrast to the concision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Judaizers lived by their fallen nature, whereas the believers in Christ serve by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the Spirit of God is in contrast to the nature of the dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Judaizers did evil things and even boasted in them, whereas the true believers boast in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They glory and rejoice in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As used here, the word boast implies not only boasting, but also rejoicing and glorying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our boasting, glorying, and rejoicing are not in our outward deeds, not in our behavior or conduct, but in Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Judaizers had confidence in the flesh, whereas the true believers in Christ have no confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The flesh in 3:3 comprises all that we are and have in our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fact that the Judaizers had confidence in their circumcision was a sign that their confidence was in their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They trusted in their natural qualities and qualifications, not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their confidence was in what they were by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They trusted in the fact that they were Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By contrast Paul says strongly that we who believe in Christ do not have any confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our confidence is wholly in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a contrast we see in verses 2 and 3!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We serve by the Spirit of God, we boast in Christ, and we have confidence not in the flesh, but only in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we deny our old nature, we are the true circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The denial of the flesh is the real circumcision, the true cutting off of the flesh as revealed in Colossians 2:11.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>SAUL OF TARSUS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>AS A MODEL OF THE JUDAIZERS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to verses 4 through 6, Paul had been a model of the Judaizers: Though I myself could have confidence also in the flesh; if any other man thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I more: circumcised the eighth day; of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Paul used to be among the Judaizers, he had been very active and had many outstanding qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A. Having More Confidence in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A former leading one among the Judaizers, Paul had more reason than others to have confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Galatians 1:14 he tells us that he advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a very real sense, Paul had been a top dog among the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. Circumcised the Eighth Day</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 5 Paul says that he was circumcised the eighth day, the day for a genuine Israelite to be circumcised Gen 17:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This day distinguished him from the Ishmaelites and proselytes, who were circumcised later.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul was a typical Jew, not a proselyte.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This gave him ground to boast when he was a Judaizer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. Of the Race of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul was also of the race of Israel, God s called race, the genuine seed of Abraham Rom 11:1; 2 Cor 11:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was not a descendant of the proselytes grafted into the race of God s covenant.</S>
