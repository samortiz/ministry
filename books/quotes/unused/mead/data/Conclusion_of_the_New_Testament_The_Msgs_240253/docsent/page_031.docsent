   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ITS REALITY, ITS NATURE, ITS EXPRESSION,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ITS RELATION TO GOD S GLORY,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND ITS UNSHAKABLENESS 3</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall consider further the expression of the kingdom with human virtues, covering the matter of the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Highest Standard of Morality</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we speak of the highest standard of morality, we are not using the word morality in a traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By morality we mean the standard of life God requires.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The highest standard of morality is the living of the One the Lord Jesus Christ whose life was a composition of God with the divine attributes and man with the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus, the God-man, was a composition of the divine essence with all the divine attributes and the human essence with all the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He was on earth, He lived a life that was a composition of the divine attributes, especially the attributes of love, light, righteousness, and holiness, and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s intention in His New Testament economy is that all the believers become a reproduction of Christ, the God-man, who lived a life in which the attributes of God were expressed in the virtues of man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to become a reproduction of Christ, we need to be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit John 3:6 , and then we need to be transformed gradually by the pneumatic Christ in our soul 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then spontaneously we shall live Christ Phil 1:21 , the God-man, by the bountiful supply of His Spirit Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We shall also be found in Christ Phil 3:9 as our surpassing righteousness in the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we shall express Him in all the human virtues created by God for man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With the divine attributes of the God-man, these virtues will be strengthened, enriched, uplifted, and filled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what it means to say that the expression of the kingdom is with human virtues in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>a. In Keeping the Principles of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The highest standard of morality involves keeping the principles of the law Matt 5:17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Matthew 5:17 the Lord Jesus says, Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To fulfill the law here means three things: that Christ kept the law on the positive side; that through His substitutionary death on the cross Christ fulfilled the requirement of the law on the negative side; and that Christ complemented the old law by His new law, as continually expressed by the word, But I say to you vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus came to keep the law on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He lived on earth, He kept every aspect of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one else has ever kept the Ten Commandments; the Lord Jesus kept them completely.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the Lord Jesus kept the law, He became the perfect One.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His perfection qualified Him to die on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all have broken, transgressed, the law, but our transgressions have been dealt with through the Lord s substitutionary death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the cross He was our substitute, dying for us to fulfill the law s requirement on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ s fulfilling the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The old law, with its keeping demand and punishing requirement, is over.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now, as children of the Father, we only need to fulfill the new, higher law by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ s substitutionary death brought in the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When this resurrection life comes into us, it is able to do the wonderful work of completing the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It enables us to fulfill the higher law of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This resurrection life is much higher than our natural life, for it is actually the divine life, the eternal life, the life on the highest plane.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This highest life within us can fulfill the requirements of the highest law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this way we keep the principles of the law to have the highest standard of morality for the expression of the kingdom in the divine attributes with human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Matthew 5:20 says, Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This surpassing righteousness is the condition for entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By keeping the highest law to the highest standard, we fulfill the condition for entering into the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
