   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S MOVE IN TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PAVING THE WAY FOR THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past, people in the West received different impressions concerning the Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They mainly knew that China has a large population.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They also considered the Chinese to be unskilled workers, because the Chinese who immigrated to America were mostly illiterate country people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many of these immigrants worked in the gold mines in America, and some of them opened Chinese restaurants.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition, the Western missionaries, who brought the gospel and the Bible to China, took pictures and gave reports on the negative aspect of Chinese culture, such as opium smoking and foot binding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, most of the pictures in a book written by Hudson Taylor show people shooting morphine, smoking opium, and binding women s feet.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result of these pictures that were published more than one hundred years ago, some people in America still have a bad impression of Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>More than twenty years ago, when I first began the work in America, I spent the first three or four years traveling from the East Coast to the West Coast and from the South to the North.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I often stayed with typical American families who lived in small towns.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These believers always commented that they had never seen a Chinese person like me, and I always responded that there are many Chinese people like me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time not many students from Taiwan were studying in America, but now there are students from Taiwan all over America, and the Americans know that the Chinese have excellent minds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Americans are now open to the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, the exports and foreign currency reserves of Taiwan have surprised everyone, and the rapid development of Taiwan s economy has caused all the countries in the world to change their concept of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is for the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we need to train and send out thousands of young people to Africa, Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and other parts of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The young people must also equip themselves; they should not only study English but also learn a third language such as Spanish, German, French, Japanese, or Korean.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, they should learn enough Greek to be able to use reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some people consider Greek to be a difficult language, but anything that is honorable and worthwhile is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Any young person who has a heart to consecrate himself to the Lord must study languages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s move today is accelerated, and we must cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord is advancing in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have never had a city in which more than one hundred full-time serving ones preached the word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the first time the church in Taipei has six hundred full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, we had our first meeting with more than fifteen thousand young people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>About two weeks ago we invited all the young people in the churches in Taiwan to attend a summer young people s conference.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>More than twenty buses carrying over one thousand people came from one locality in central Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The smaller towns and villages sent four or five hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the Lord s move, and it proves that the churches on the island of Taiwan have potential.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This potential has not been released in more than twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Three or five full-time preachers or serving ones cannot do that much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even three to five hundred full-time serving ones cannot meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord s move must be accelerated because the Jews have regained their country; the fig tree that was cursed and withered has become tender and put forth its leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, Matthew 24:14 says that the gospel of the kingdom must be preached in the whole inhabited earth before the end comes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Who will go out to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many college students are willing to answer the Lord s call and preach the gospel on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The campuses are their Jerusalem Acts 1:8 ; hence, they must begin with the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The working saints and the elderly saints have their Jerusalem in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we must strengthen the visitation service so that the gospel can be spread to every home.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE EARLY CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are clearer today concerning the proper church life than we were in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the revelation we received from the Lord, God desires to gain a group of redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people to be the Body of Christ, the church, as His expression and testimony on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are that group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are different from traditional Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we must forget and discard everything that we learned from Christianity along with its methods, because these things are not according to the revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the Bible three thousand people were baptized on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was the work of the Holy Spirit; it was not the result of human methods.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, we should not consider it strange for three thousand people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even though three thousand and then five thousand people were baptized in the early church 2:41; 4:4 , the believers did not spread.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, God allowed an environment that forced the believers to scatter from Jerusalem to other regions for the preaching of the gospel 8:1, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Acts 8:4 says, Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing the word as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These believers preached the word of God as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The young people need to hear this word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not know how many believers were scattered, nor do we know what they ate or where they lived.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, we do know that wherever they went, people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even the Samaritans, who were a mixture of Gentile and Jewish blood, were greatly blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A group of believers, not a group of preachers, went out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They were disciples, and they did not go to places with chapels, gospel halls, or large cathedrals.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Wherever they went, they could rely only on the opening of their mouths to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The disciples had meetings in the homes of the people who believed in the Lord; they had home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We believe that later some homes joined together to have a small group meeting and that the group meetings joined together to form a district meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every city had home meetings, small group meetings, and district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The people who were saved loved the Lord, and they gave everything that they had for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They were the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, Acts shows us another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Acts 20:7 the whole church met together to break bread and to hear a word from the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead of going from house to house to speak a word of light, revelation, and vision, the apostle spoke in this gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This meeting is what we call a big meeting.</S>
