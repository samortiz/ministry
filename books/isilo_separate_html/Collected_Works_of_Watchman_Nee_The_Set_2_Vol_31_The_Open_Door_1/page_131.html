The meetings continue as usual. We have moved the evening meetings to five o'clock, so they have not been hindered. Brother Witness is still working in Chefoo. The meetings have been really blessed recently. There are many people in every meeting. There was a baptism meeting last Lord's Day. Sixteen people were baptized, five of whom were brothers; the rest were sisters. There are still many who want to be baptized, but we feel that they are still not clear and have asked them to wait awhile. May the Lord be with us always so that we may live for Him. May the Lord protect you in peace! Greet all the brothers and sisters in Hankow.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chao Jing-hwai<br />April 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tientsin</h2><p>X in the Lord:</p><p>Brother Wang (Jian-tang) has not found a job yet. Sister Feng Chang Xiu-feng entered the Hsieh-Ho Hospital in Peking a few days ago. Her illness will probably require surgery. We still must pray for her. Brother Liu Heng-teh is still in Tientsin with his original job. He comes to the meetings often. Mrs. Tang has moved to Yao-Hua-Li. The house number is 416. Mrs. Po has returned to Tientsin. Sister Dong is in Chefoo. She is engaged to Brother Chiao Fu-ya. Brother Chui Tze-fang has not recovered from his illness. Sometimes he is well, and sometimes it flares up. We still do not know what kind of sickness it is. Every week there is a fellowship meeting for the brothers and sisters. We hope to have a baptism meeting soon and hope Brother Witness Lee can come. We have invited him several times, but he does not have a clear leading before the Lord, so he has not agreed to come yet. Please remember the brothers and sisters here in your prayer. May God cause us to pick up the responsibility for the assembly before Him in a good way. May we further the gospel in one accord. May we stand in the position that the overcomers should stand in on the earth today. Thank God for showing us that everything of ourselves is foolish and unclean. If it were not for the Lord's love, when could we ever be counted worthy to come before God? May the Lord have pity on us and grace us to learn the proper lessons. We do not want to remain in the same "grade" again and again. Please greet all the brothers and sisters that I know. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Lin Chang Pin-jeng<br />April 4<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Shensi Province</h2><p>Brother You-sheng:</p><p>Thank God for always leading me. Although I have passed through dangers, I have not been harmed. Since God cares for me every minute, I am always at peace, and my affairs prosper. I am very concerned about the news concerning Brother Tang and the other brothers and sisters. I really hope to learn about their news and situation! I have been in Shensi for almost three months. I was not busy for the first two months. There is a denomination here. Its beliefs are very pure, so I go there often to meet and talk with the people. When I first came to this hospital, I was the only believer. God gave me the boldness several times to testify among the people. There are now more than ten believers. There is a meeting every Lord's Day in my office. There is also a gospel meeting every Thursday for the patients. God has blessed His work in this hospital. I really thank Him! I only have the first issue of The Open Door. I did not receive any of the rest. May we remember each other in prayer. I hope we can see one another soon. May God lead us. Please greet the brothers and sisters in Hankow for me.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Ching-hua<br />February 8<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_130.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_132.html">Next</a> </body></html>
