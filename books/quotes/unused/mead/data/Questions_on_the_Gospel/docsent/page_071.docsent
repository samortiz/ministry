   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION FORTY-NINE CONCERNING DIFFERENT KINDS OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How many kinds of salvation are mentioned in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How are they explained?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are at least six kinds of salvation mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eternal Salvation before God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first kind of salvation is eternal salvation before God, which we obtained the moment we believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This salvation involves our being delivered out of the judgment of sins, the curse of the law, the threat of death, the punishment of hell, and the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our trespasses have been forgiven, and we have been cleansed of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are justified, sanctified, and reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This salvation also includes regeneration, receiving the eternal life of the Lord, the quickening of our spirit, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We receive this salvation entirely by the grace of God; it has nothing to do with our works.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 2:8 and 9 say, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second Timothy 1:9 says, "Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Titus 3:5 says, "Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Acts 15:11 says, "But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we are saved in the same way also as they are."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This eternal salvation was accomplished by our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is our Savior who came to die for us on the cross and bore our sins 1 Pet 2:24 , redeemed us out of the curse of the law Gal 3:13 , and delivers us from the wrath which is coming 1 Thes 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By His death He destroyed the devil, who held the might of death Heb 2:14 , and delivered us out of the authority of darkness Col 1:13 that we should not come into judgment, but pass out of death into life John 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By the resurrection of the Lord Jesus from the dead, we are born again, given eternal life, and become the children of God 1 Pet 1:3; John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By the ascension of the Lord Jesus, we are brought near to God the Father so that we and the Father can have fellowship in the Holy of Holies Heb 9:12; 10:19-22 , far above all the powers of darkness Eph 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord has accomplished all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our part is simply to believe and receive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name" John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek" Rom 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household" Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This kind of salvation is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once a person is saved, he is saved forever.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"And having been perfected, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation" Heb 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since the salvation that the Lord has accomplished for us is eternal, our salvation is also eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can find at least twelve aspects in the Bible which confirm the security of our salvation and the fact that we shall not perish once we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A. According to God's Will</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have been made children of God and have received sonship not according to our condition but according to the predetermined will of God Eph 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose 2 Tim 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our condition may change, but God's will never changes Heb 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In eternity past, God determined that He would save us and not lose any of us John 6:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How then could we be saved and later unsaved?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our salvation is eternally secure in God's unchangeable purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>B. According to God's Election</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our election by God is neither accidental nor temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God chose us according to His purpose, not according to our works Rom 9:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, we did not chose the Lord, but He chose us John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's calling is irrevocable Rom 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, our salvation is eternally secure and will never be changed.</S>
