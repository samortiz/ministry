   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Striving Phil 1:27.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Struggling Col 1:28-29.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Prayer: Lord, we humble ourselves before You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We confess our weaknesses, corruption, defilement, and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need Your forgiveness in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need the cleansing of Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, cleanse us from the inside to the outside, from top to bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need You, and we need the anointing of Your ointment to anoint us in a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even more, we need Your presence and Your speaking to us here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are here listening quietly to Your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When You speak, we are enlightened, supplied, and rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We present ourselves naked before Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Shine on us that we may know You and may know ourselves in Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>O Lord Jesus, may the vision that Isaiah saw that day be seen by us today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We want to see our Lord seated high on the throne of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, send us, and give us Your command.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Speak to us also words of love that would touch our depths.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we are touched by You, the more we will bow before You and will vow to You to offer ourselves completely to You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord, lead us on step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During these two meetings, speak to us point by point the words in Your heart, that is, the words that You want us to practice and to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Be sympathetic toward our slowness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, we need Your support moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Bring us into Your light and into Your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, we worship You, and we offer up our praise and thanksgiving to You again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thank the Lord that we can have this meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is due to the Lord's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We know that from October 1984, we began to speak of the "new way" here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That was exactly six years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During these six years we have passed through quite a process.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the beginning, the response was mute.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, there was some progress.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After this, there was the opposition, and finally, the attack.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Up to the present, the great majority of the churches on the earth have accepted the Lord's leading joyfully and are willing to take this God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first thing I would like to mention to the brothers and sisters is that in this God-ordained way, on the one hand, I myself have been learning, and on the other hand, I have been leading others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the same time, I have made many observations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If anyone has ever placed a question mark on this way, I have been the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one hand, I have been studying and learning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the other hand, I have also adopted a skeptical attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I tried to find out if this way can stand the test of the biblical measure and standard.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today I can tell you that the answer I have received is yes, and that this way is fully according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have studied the Bible for sixty-five and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have studied many topics.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I can say that this is the only topic in which all the contents are positive and nothing is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, every point contained in it is according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moreover, I have found out at least three things that have not been practiced by the Lord's church on earth for the last two thousand years, which can be put into practice point by point in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is true that because of our weakness, our slowness, and our evil heart of unbelief, we have not been strong, intense, fresh, and clear enough in our practice; yet as far as the practices themselves are concerned, these three points, which the Lord has never seen carried out by the saints except at the time of the apostles, are all being carried out through the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first point is the prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There it says, "Whenever you come together, each one has..." v. 26 . "If therefore the whole church comes together in one place...if all prophesy..." vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Again, "For you can all prophesy one by one" v. 31 . This point is now being put into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to my observation, whether in America or in Taiwan, this practice has obviously succeeded, though not in full, at least in part.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is an undeniable fact.</S>
