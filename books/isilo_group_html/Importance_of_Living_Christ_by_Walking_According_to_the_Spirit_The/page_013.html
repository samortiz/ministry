THAT THE SAINTS WALK ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>What is needed in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is a daily living of walking according to the spirit. In the New Testament there is a certain order in the church with apostles, elders, and deacons. Nevertheless, this arrangement and these titles would not be necessary if all the saints walked according to the spirit. Such arrangements are necessary because life is lacking. In the New Jerusalem there will be no apostles, elders, or deacons but only precious stones (Rev. 21:19; cf. 1 Pet. 2:5). No position or title will enter with us into the New Jerusalem. The twelve apostles will be in the New Jerusalem, but they will be there as stones for the building (Rev. 21:14, 19). We need to have a foretaste of the New Jerusalem today. Because we are all members of the Body of Christ and have Christ as our Head, it is a shame if we need elders to regulate us. Every city has police, but it is a shame if the citizens need the police to control them directly. It is not an honor to have police come to our home. If all the citizens conducted themselves properly, the police would not be needed. If a local church is a miniature of the New Jerusalem with all the saints walking according to the spirit, the elders would not have much to do. Perhaps they would only need to announce the meeting times. Our need is not to be ruled outwardly but to be transformed to become precious stones for God&rsquo;s building. The elders need to minister life to the saints for their transformation.</p>
<p>It was a lack of life that caused titles, positions, and arrangements to come into the church. However, we know that these things are not God&rsquo;s intention, for the positions of apostles, elders, and deacons are gone in the book of Revelation. Even the writer of Revelation, the apostle John, did not identify himself as an apostle but only as a brother who was in spirit (1:9-10). When the seven Spirits are present, all the titles and positions are gone (v. 4). In Revelation we do not see apostles, elders, and deacons but the seven Spirits, enlightening the churches as the lampstands (3:1; 4:5; 1:20). Every local church should be a shining lampstand enlightened by the seven Spirits, not ruled by elders.</p>
<p>As leading ones, we should not trust in our outward doing or controlling. Instead, we need to pray much, take the lead to walk according to the spirit, and minister life to the saints. Our primary concern should not be to make arrangements. Several years ago I saw many files and paper forms in the deacons&rsquo; office of the church in Taipei, and all the serving ones were busy with routine work. I strongly advised the leading ones to forget about their arrangements and organizational, routine work and come back to spirit and life. When we are short of the Spirit, we tend to pick up routine works and become like a secular corporation. The leading ones should not trust in their work and arrangements but in the Spirit. Christianity today is mainly a matter of religious work, routine, and organization. However, the church is a living organism. Therefore, our service should not be routine but organic. Routine, organizational work in the churches is like the man-made bricks used to build the tower of Babel. As elders, we need to take the lead to forsake any such human work and instead help the saints to walk according to the spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is entirely a matter of spirit and life. The content and reality of the recovery is spirit and life. The boundary of the recovery is also spirit and life. Whether someone is in the recovery does not depend on outward appearances but on the inward reality of spirit and life. The enlightening and searching of the seven Spirits is the true test and measure of whether anything is of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Any rank or hierarchy in the local churches is absolutely abominable in the eyes of the Lord. An elder should not consider himself as an authority over others. Only spirit and life are acceptable to God.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we need to see what the Body of Christ is. If we see the Body, we will see what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is and what Christianity is. Religion is mainly a matter of hierarchy. The elders should not seek to have a position from which they can control the church. We need to humble ourselves and pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am nothing, I have nothing, and I can do nothing. Lord, everything must be done by You. Only You, as the Spirit, can minister life to people. I am only a slave to serve the saints.&rdquo; The root of the church&rsquo;s degradation and the source of religious, organized Christianity is man&rsquo;s attempt to rule over and control things. If we do not see this, such corruption and darkness may creep in and greatly damage the church in our locality. We will reap what we sow. I say this in love. We need to be exposed in order to receive the help through the light. Love always speaks the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTION AND ANSWER</h2>
<p><em>Question: Can you say something further about forsaking arrangements and organizational work and helping the saints to walk according to the spirit?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Some arrangements are necessary, but nothing should be our personal possession. Because the church is not a secular business, we should not spend most of our time on business affairs. As elders, most of our concern and labor should be to pray for the saints, visit them, shepherd them, and help them to grow.</p>
<p>Concerning the necessary arrangements, there should always be at least two capable, trustworthy brothers to take care of matters such as the church&rsquo;s bank account. Two gives us a testimony and is also practical for the continuation of the matter if one brother leaves. This kind of arrangement is necessary, but we should not put our trust in organization. Our trust is in the Spirit and life. We need to minister the Spirit and life to others so that they may grow.</p>
<p>Our tendency is to arrange things organizationally. Accordingly, the elders sometimes arrange groups to take care of different practical services. In making such arrangements, they consider which saints are best to serve in and lead the various groups. We should avoid this kind of organizational arrangement because it does not involve life. Some arrangements are necessary, but our main concern should be to contact the saints, fellowship with them, minister life to them, and stir up their interest and burden to serve. This way involves life. When the saints come to serve, certain things will be spontaneously manifested, such as who should take the lead in the groups. At that time, it will be necessary to make a few arrangements to appoint two or three to take the lead so that the service can go on in a good way.</p>
<p>The leading ones need to have much contact with the saints. The Lord may lead the elders to give a message in order to encourage the saints to serve. Such a message should minister a spirit of service and life for service. In addition, the leading ones also need to visit the saints individually as much as possible. Our way should be to minister life, not to organize. The way of life is to minister life to the saints by speaking and visiting. When the saints receive life, they will be stirred up and have a heart to participate in the church service. Nevertheless, the elders should oversee the service in order to balance, adjust, and arrange when necessary. They may see that it would be better for someone to serve in a different group. This oversight should still involve life. The elders should not give the saints the impression that their oversight is a matter of organization. Every service group should be open to anyone who feels to participate in that area of service. Legality and regulation kill the saints. We need to remember that the boundary line is not organization but the spirit and the life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Importance of Living Christ by Walking According to the Spirit &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
