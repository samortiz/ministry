<h2 class="head1">THE PROTESTANTS</h2>
<p>The eleventh and twelfth centuries were the darkest period in the history of Christianity. The power of the Roman Catholic Church had grown to the uttermost. The Eastern Greek Orthodox Church was also powerful, but it was not as strong as the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic popes were more powerful than at any other time in their history; they established almost all the kings and emperors of Europe. In such a situation a fifth group was produced in the sixteenth century, the Reformation, or Protestant, sect. Protestantism began with Martin Luther. This group gained strength rapidly and included many people. The Protestants were not confined to one country; rather, many people all over Europe took action simultaneously to produce Protestantism.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century Christianity was divided into five main groups. The Nestorians, however, were by that time only a scattered remnant. Thus, the remaining four groups were the Roman Catholic Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Protestant churches, and those with pure hearts. Within these four main groups, there were many smaller groups. The Roman Catholic Church is not truly universal; there are many sects of Catholicism. Although they recognize and take their orders from one pope, in practice they are very different and constantly criticize and attack one another. They wear different clothes and pray different prayers. Some nuns let their hair grow, and others shave their heads; their veils and the color of their habits vary as well. The Catholic sects separate themselves rigidly from one another; some emphasize scholarship, and others are interested only in works. There are hundreds of variations, so it is difficult to enumerate all of them.</p>
<p>The Greek Orthodox Church is also divided into sects, but there are fewer Orthodox sects than Catholic sects. The strongest Catholic sect is the Jesuits. In Protestantism there are more than two thousand sects today, although some conservatively estimate that there are only several hundred sects. In Baguio in the Philippines, we met an American missionary who said he was from the Church of the Nazarene; we had not heard of that group. This shows that we do not know the number of sects in Protestantism.</p>
<p>The pure-hearted believers are also divided into numerous scattered sects. Thus, even they are no longer pure-hearted. This is like the time of the Judges when there was no king in Israel and everyone did what was right in his own eyes; it is almost to the point where the situation of the church is so confused that anyone can establish his own group. It is proper to oppose organization, but it is wrong to be so loose and free.</p>
<p>Not long after we came to Taiwan, we saw a sign that read &ldquo;Christian Family Meeting.&rdquo; After a few days we saw that someone had established a &ldquo;church&rdquo; in another place. When we spoke with these groups, they both declared that they did not want organized Christianity and only desired to serve God according to the Bible.</p>
<p>Some scholars of church history would classify such groups with the pure-hearted believers; some have even been called Puritans. However, these groups are scattered. Some believers are &ldquo;pure&rdquo; to such an extent that they reject everything. They do not set up churches or join any church; rather, they stay at home reading the Bible, praying, and worshipping God. There are many such ones in Taipei and Tokyo. They have a clean, pious living, and read the Bible, pray, and preach the gospel. It is difficult to speak about the church with them because they think that all Christian groups are wrong and have problems; therefore, they do not want any church. Today the church is in a very divided condition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER STANDING</h2>
<p>As Christians, with which group should we stand? We must belong to a group, unless we are not Christians. If we are Christians, we must be in a group.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church today is powerful in terms of money, scholarship, position, and influence; Catholics study every area of knowledge, including education, science, and politics. They have a grasp of modern human society&rsquo;s psychology of education. Modern man wants to be educated; even the poor want an education. It seems that the future of human life is based on education, and those who are not educated have no future. The Catholics run excellent schools, from elementary through secondary school to the university level. Their principals, vice-principals, teachers, and professors are all specialists. Thus, people are willing to be educated by them. Once young people are among them, the Catholics use every available method to entice and encourage them to join the Roman Catholic Church. If a student converts to Catholicism, his education will be more convenient in terms of his grades and the treatment he receives.</p>
<p>In the Philippines some brothers and sisters among us graduated from Catholic schools. It was very difficult for them to graduate because they were not Catholics. Almost all the people who study in the Catholic schools eventually become Catholics; the Roman Catholic Church gains students as they study at their schools. This has continued from generation to generation. The graduates of Catholic schools are usually Catholic. To the Roman Catholic Church, it does not matter whether they are true or false believers as long as they are Catholic in name.</p>
<p>In addition to their schools, the Roman Catholic Church also has a specially trained group of people who work to gain talented students and rich families. Those in their schools who are good students or come from rich families are unable to escape once they are noticed. The priests and lay brothers have received special training to gain such young people through particular care. Their love, care, and sympathy toward these young people are for the purpose of gaining their heart so that they also might become priests. In order to gain young girls, the nuns love and care for the female students to such an extent that they even trim the girls&rsquo; fingernails. They love and care for them to such an extent that almost all the young girls consecrate themselves.</p>
<p>This is not loose speaking; there are many cases in which these things happened. Everyone has emotions, and the Catholics&rsquo; heart to care for and sympathize with people is much better than ours. It is not surprising that people cannot escape them, and many young people become priests and nuns. On the other hand, they care for gaining only the rich. Statistically, after World War I a third of the world&rsquo;s wealth was in Rome; thus, a third of the world&rsquo;s wealth was in the Roman Catholic Church. Another third was in the hands of the Jews. The concentration of wealth in the Roman Catholic Church has only increased. Revelation 17 through 19 speaks of &ldquo;MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT&rdquo;; God calls, &ldquo;Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins&rdquo; (18:4). This shows that she is very great. Of course, we should not neglect the fact that in the Roman Catholic Church there are a small number of saved, godly people.</p>
<p>Where should Christians serve the Lord today? In the Roman Catholic Church? In the Greek Orthodox Church? In Nestorianism or Protestantism? With those who have a pure heart for the Lord? No one can escape the issue of sects, because Christianity is divided and has no way to unite. There are genuine believers and godly people in every major sect. We must consider where we should be. The scholarly writers of church history would undoubtedly rank us among the pure in heart. Although we are not a sect, they would classify us as a sect. This is the situation, and we cannot avoid it. The only way to escape classification is to not be a Christian; as Christians, we must fall into one of the five major classifications.</p>
<p>Many years ago in Nanking, a member of the Uigur tribe from the Sinkiang Province heard the gospel and received the Lord. Later, he told us that his mother and aunts were Christians. His aunt met in a church without a name or a pastor; when they came together to meet and sing hymns, it seemed as if no one was leading. The only way he could describe their meetings was to say, &ldquo;It is almost like your meetings here.&rdquo; This shows that in faraway Sinkiang Province a group of people who love the Lord with a pure heart has been raised up.</p>
<p>We may think that we go to remote areas to preach the gospel because the people in those areas have not heard the name of Jesus. However, this is not correct. The people there have not only heard the name of Jesus, but there are some among them who have a pure heart to worship God according to the Bible. God has many hidden works that are not publicized and are unknown to us. I deeply feel that these hidden, pure-hearted believers are taking the right way before the Lord. The responsible brothers in each locality should be in fear and trembling before the Lord, because being hidden is always better than being exposed.</p>
<p>Although we cannot avoid the matter of sects, we must absolutely keep ourselves from being sectarian. We are different from the sects, but we should not argue with people about who is a sect and who is not. It is foolish to do such a thing. We must seriously ask the Lord where we should be in light of the degraded condition of the church in this age. We should be among the hidden believers who are pure in heart. We should not hope for a universal church; the Lord is not looking for this. A universal church is not our commission. Our only responsibility is to learn to be pure-hearted believers before the Lord, not making a display of ourselves and not becoming involved with any movement but, instead, simply serving the Lord in a hidden way.</p>
