   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE TWELVE A MAN OF GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 6:11-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:4 we read of God's dispensation, and in 6:11 Paul uses the expression "man of God."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, this book begins with God's dispensation and concludes with the charge to a man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's desire is to produce men of God by dispensing Himself into those who believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A man of God is one who partakes of God's life and nature John 1:13; 2 Pet 1:4 and thus becomes one with Him in His life and nature 1 Cor 6:17 and thereby expresses Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This corresponds to the mystery of godliness, which is God manifest in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>FLEEING AND PURSUING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Timothy 6:11 says, "But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, Paul charges Timothy to flee certain things and, on the other hand, to pursue certain other things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Timothy must flee the negative things previously mentioned in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He should pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is significant that Paul does not tell Timothy to pursue power, gifts, miracles, and theological training.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, as we shall see, in verse 12 Paul does not charge him to fight for his theology or to lay hold on the doctrinal knowledge he has accumulated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, many Christians today pursue power, fight for doctrines, and lay hold on theological knowledge, and they charge the younger generation to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They also promote natural gifts, talents, and abilities.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in 1 Timothy very little is said of man's ability.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Concerning the eldership, Paul tells Timothy that an elder should be apt to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This refers to the ability to instruct others like a parent helping a child with homework.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul's emphasis in 1 Timothy definitely is not on power, gifts, or natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul charges Timothy to pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Righteousness is a matter of being right with people before God according to God's righteous and strict requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would be those who carry out God's dispensation for the building up of local churches as the expression of Christ, we must pursue righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must seek to be right with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the second place, we should pursue godliness, the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 4:7 Paul told Timothy to exercise himself unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A man of God should not pursue power or miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, he should pursue righteousness and godliness; he should seek to be right with God and man in order to be a living expression of God in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is to live a daily life which manifests God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 11 Paul lists faith after godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Faith is to believe in God and His word and to trust in Him and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we have pointed out, faith involves an organic union by contacting God through the Word and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Faith, therefore, denotes a living union.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of pursuing a great work, we should pursue the organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 6:11 Paul goes on to mention love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should be those who love others by the love of God 1 John 4:7-8, 19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul also speaks of endurance and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should pursue endurance, the ability to bear sufferings and persecutions, and also meekness, which is a proper attitude in facing opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is certain that if we live a godly life, we shall suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The world opposes God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we live God and also live out God, expressing Him, we shall be opposed and attacked by the godless world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, we should pursue endurance, and we should also pursue meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT OF THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 12 Paul continues his charge: "Fight the good fight of the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To fight for the faith means to fight for God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In particular, it is to fight for Christ as the embodiment of God and for the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
