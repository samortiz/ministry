There has been an increase in number. The place is calm, and there is no lack of food, except the prices are somewhat expensive. Brother James Chen is still here. Two Bible studies were held recently. First, we studied the Song of Songs when Brother Wu Ren-jieh passed by. Second, Brother James Chen conducted a study on the subject of salvation and the kingdom. The number was quite large. Last week we had a baptismal meeting. A few who were once deep in Buddhism were released. Glory to His name. The number of refuge centers has been reduced, but we still have much opportunity for work. The meeting in Amoy has resumed, but the number is not large. Communication with inland provinces has not fully been restored, and traveling is inconvenient. Sister Yien-tse's health has improved, but Sister Yuen-yee is still bedridden.</p><p>Sister Chan Wan-chin, November 29</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Liao Ong Yu-bing, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Sister Lee in the Lord:</p><p>I hope that you have arrived in Shanghai by now. A few days ago Sister Bao Hsu-min wrote and expressed her desire to go to Shanghai for some edification. This stirred up my desire to go to Shanghai. In looking back, I think we were fed too well; now we are too hungry. By myself, I am unable to undertake any of the work here. But thank the Lord that everything is of Him. I can only follow Him and consider His work. The brothers have not set out for the north, because their traveling documents are not yet ready. But all the localities are eagerly expecting their visit. Sister Chou Gi-chen has been here for several days already. Thank the Lord that I now have one more sister who is one with me. Peace to you.</p><p>Sister Yu-bing, December 18</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brothers Chen and Chai,<br />Fukien Province</h2><p>A few weeks ago the co-workers sent you X dollars from Chuenchow to be used for relief to brothers in need. I wonder whether you have received it. (We have received it&mdash;Editor.) The regions along the coast in Fukien province have witnessed the clear working of the Holy Spirit during the past year. However, if there are no proper workers, how can we have proper work? Even if we work, everything is futile if we do not accomplish God's most excellent will. For this reason we desire very much that you come and help us. We have written and mentioned the work in Dong-Yuen. Thank the Lord that He brought us through. Thirteen people were baptized, and the Lord's table was started. There is now a testimony of the local church. Glory to His name!</p><p>Brothers Chen Ke-san, Chai Tse-chung, October 27</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chang Kwang-rong, Chekiang Province</h2><p>After the meetings in Shi-Si in Tai-Shun, I went with Brother David to Ju-Si. He received a special commission from the Lord the next day and left to go to Tsen-Shia-Kwan. After staying in Tsen-Shia-Kwan for five days, I went to Ding-Bu-Tou, Yueh-Hu-Yang, and Wan-Yao. Now I am in Chiao-Dun-Men. Tomorrow I will be in Kwan-Mei and Wu-Tai- Shan. Everywhere I go we will have a few days of meetings. I have been taught and am now clear that the ministry God has assigned to me is not to gather many people and conduct big meetings. Rather, it is to visit small places and to have home meetings every evening according to the condition of each place. Drawing near to the Lord, studying the Word, and mutually asking and answering questions in this way gives everyone a chance to touch God. From my experience, this affords the Spirit more freedom to work in the meetings. This is what I am doing. May the Lord make me faithful.</p><p>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, January 31</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_069.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_071.html">Next</a> </body></html>
