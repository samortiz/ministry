No one wants to stay too long because this is too close to the war zone. Moreover, there have been air raids (four times already). They stay for as long as a month and as little as one or two days.</p><p>Brother Ma Chuan-foo<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ning-Po, Chekiang Province</h2><p>I was able to secure copies of Issue Nos. 2 through 4 of The Open Door through indirect means, and through them I became acquainted with the news of the brothers and sisters. What a joy and relief! I even received light from them. I thank the Lord with all my heart, amen. I arrived here in February. There are not too many students in the school. Both staff and salaries have been reduced. Although we receive less, God is able to cause us to use less. He is indeed the wonderful King. Sisters Hsiao Yu-yin and Chang Yi-hwa are living in Shi-Lou-Tou, Chin-Nan. I heard that their light shone before men; even some unbelievers gave glory to our God because of their works. I heard that Mr. and Mrs Wang Sheng-how live Lin Chun in Chin-Si. There are still a few brothers both within and without the city who are holding on to their jobs. The local meetings are still suspended. The rented house has been returned to the owner, but we can still keep our furnishings there. Recently, there has been a surge of theft. All of the neighbors' houses were broken into, but the belongings of Brother David Hsu and Wang Shu-fa were not touched. No one was guarding them; God was protecting them. Brother Hsie Tze-yuen from Shiao-Shin was here a few days ago. He said that Dr. Ma Ming-huan in Hu-Shu of Hangchow told him that Brother Ruan Feng-tien is setting up a relief center in his school and is seeing good results. He preached the gospel there, and many were saved. Praise the Lord! Brother Ruan Tze-rue has recently been working as a hawker. Brother Chao Tsen-ting left for Shanghai a few days ago. He mentioned that Brother Sun Shao-shan's house in Hangchow was burned. Their whole family is taking refuge in Feng's Girl School.</p><p>Brother Yu Yun-fei, June 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tai-Ho, Anhwei Province</h2><p>I received The Open Door promptly. Thank the Lord who loves us and enables us to know of the news of His spiritual work in the midst of all troubles. Enclosed please find stamps worth X dollars for purchase of Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life) and X dollars for the expense of The Open Door. Because I am unskilled in words, I apologize for my inability to communicate the news of our church to the brothers and sisters. Recently, there has been no war in the border regions of Honan, Anhwei, and Shu County. There was an air raid in Shu County with three hundred seventy casualties, but none of God's children were hurt. There were also bombings in Tseng-Yang-Kwan, Ying-Shang County, and Tai-Ho County, but no believer was hurt. The bombing in Fu-Yang was even more devastating; ninety percent of the houses were burned, and no less than eighteen hundred people lost their lives. However, there were no children of God among the dead.</p><p>Brother Ho Chi-chen, July 15<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Sian, Shensi Province</h2><p>I am now in Sian. Because I am a good friend of Brother Chang Tze-yi, the principal of the orphanage, I was able to move myself and my company of people, over thirty in all, into the orphanage. When the people saw the seven hundred orphans and the forty or more staff members meeting every day, worshipping God, and praising the Savior with one mouth, they were all moved. The cold ones were revived, and the unbelievers began to seek after the Lord. Thank the Lord! The Lord's word has greatly prospered in Sian lately. Many evangelists are here. Wounded soldiers, refugees, and wanderers can hear the gospel of the Savior everywhere. Thank and praise the Lord!</p><p>Brother Tsung-kung, July 8</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
