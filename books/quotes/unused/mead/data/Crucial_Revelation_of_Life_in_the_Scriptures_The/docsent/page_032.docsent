   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EATING AND DRINKING IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The eating and drinking of Christ is also revealed in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Throughout the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus speaks of Himself as life to us 10:10; 4:14; 6:35; 7:38; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first chapter of the Gospel of John, a book showing how the Lord Jesus as life can meet the need of every man, there are five major items: God, the Word, the flesh, the Lamb, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This Word, who was God Himself, became flesh v. 14 , which means that He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a man He is the Lamb of God v. 29 , our Redeemer, and He is also our life 1:4; 10:10 . The Gospel of John begins with God, the Word, the flesh, the Lamb, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In chapter two of the Gospel of John there is a wonderful event a wedding feast vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I was young, I studied this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I understood chapter one but not chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I did not know the meaning of the wedding and of the water being changed to wine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now I realize much more.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At this wedding feast the wine ran out, so the Lord Jesus asked the servants to fill up six stone waterpots with water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These waterpots were for the Jewish rites of purification with water, which signify religion's attempt to make people clean by certain dead practices.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Lord changed the water in the waterpots, which were for purification, into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This wine was not good for outward cleansing, but for drinking!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must forget about how dirty we are outwardly and drink the Lord as our wine inwardly!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regardless of how much we may be cleansed and purified outwardly, we can still be dead inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus did not come to merely cleanse us outwardly, but He came for us to drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He turned the water into wine, changing the cleansing element into the drinking element.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's life is a feast, not for purification, for outward cleansing, but for inward drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The inward drinking will take care of the cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever we drink into us will cleanse us, not from without but from within.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a kind of metabolic cleansing a cleansing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not a cleansing in an outward way, but a metabolic cleansing from within by life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today I appreciate John 2 to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In many places, when I was asked to preach the gospel, I used John 2.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have told people, "You are just the six waterpots because you are a man made on the sixth day Gen 1:26, 31 ; therefore, the number six represents man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your need is the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your need is life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not try to improve yourself, correct yourself, or better yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To do so is just to try to cleanse or purify yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Your need is not cleansing water but wine to drink."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 2 shows us that our need is not outward cleansing but inward drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The concept of John 2 is the eating and drinking of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In chapter three, Nicodemus, a highly educated teacher and an experienced, older man, came to the Lord Jesus and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God" 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The human concept is that we need a teacher and more teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus is so wise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not argue with Nicodemus or rebuke him, nor did He speak too much with him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After listening to him, the Lord Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This word really puzzled Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He may have thought, "I came to be taught by You, to seek teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I recognize You as a rabbi, a teacher, yet I do not understand what You mean by being born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>An old man such as I cannot go back to my mother's womb and come out again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What kind of teaching is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus indicated to Nicodemus that to be born anew was not to go back to his mother's womb and come out again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be born anew is to be born of the water and the Spirit v. 5 . He that is born of the flesh is flesh v. 6 . Even if Nicodemus could go back to his mother's womb and come out again, he would still be the same Nicodemus, the same flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He needed to be something else.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He had to be born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" v. 6 . The Lord's word really puzzled Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you or I were there, we too may have been puzzled along with Nicodemus by the Lord's heavenly language.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus continued to tell Nicodemus that as Moses lifted up the serpent of brass in the wilderness, He as the Son of Man must be lifted up 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the dying people, bitten by the fiery serpents, had to look unto the brass serpent that Moses lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whoever beheld the brass serpent lived Num 21:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord was there for Nicodemus to look unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nicodemus had to believe in Him; then he would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nicodemus did not need teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His need was eternal life, the life which Christ could give him.</S>
