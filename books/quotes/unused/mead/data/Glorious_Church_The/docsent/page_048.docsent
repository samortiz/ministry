   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We admit that we have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We do not say that we are without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But regardless of this, we do not accept the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before God we are clean because we have the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not believe in the accusations more than we believe in the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we commit sin, we do not glorify God, but when we do not trust the precious blood, we dishonor Him even more.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a shameful thing to sin, but not to believe in the precious blood is even more shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must learn to trust in the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 5:9 says, "...having now been justified in His blood."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When many people come into the Lord's presence, they have no peace in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They also have a feeling of worthlessness and of being wrong within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is because they have a false hope.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They expect that they will have something positive in themselves to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they discover that they do not have anything positive to offer in themselves, the accusations come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An accusation is like this: "A person like you will never have anything good to offer to God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we must remember that we originally possessed no positive goodness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was nothing good in ourselves that we could offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We could only present one thing to Him the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We could only be justified by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not have any positive righteousness in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We become righteous only because of the righteousness which we receive through redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every time we come to the throne of grace, we can look to Him for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a throne of grace, not a throne of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every time we come before God, our only qualification is that we have been redeemed, not that we have advanced in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No Christian can ever reach the stage where he can say, "I have been doing pretty well recently; now I have the boldness to pray."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No. Every time we come before God, our only ground, our only position, is based upon the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must realize that no amount of spiritual growth can substitute for the effectiveness of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not one spiritual experience can ever replace the work of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if someone should become as spiritual as the apostle Paul, the apostle John, or the apostle Peter, he would still need the blood to stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes when we have sinned, Satan comes to accuse us, and sometimes when we have not sinned, Satan still comes to accuse us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes it is not a problem of whether or not we have sinned, but a problem of not having a positive righteousness to offer to God; so Satan accuses us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, we must be clear: We can come into God's presence only because of the blood, not because of anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since we have been cleansed by the blood and justified by the blood, we are under no obligation whatsoever to accept the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The precious blood is the basis for spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not know the value of the blood, we cannot fight.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once our conscience is weakened, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, if we do not maintain a blameless and clean conscience, we will have no way to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan can use thousands of reasons in his accusations against us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we accept them, we will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when Satan speaks to us, we can reply to all his reasons with the one answer of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is not a single reason which cannot be answered by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spiritual warfare requires a conscience without offense, and the blood alone can give us such a conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hebrews 10:2 says, "Because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins..."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a Christian's conscience no longer has the sense of sin, it is because of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once we stand on the ground of the blood, once we believe in the blood, Satan can no longer work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We often like to reason that we can no longer fight because we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Lord knows that we are sinful, so He has prepared the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord has a way for sinful man, because the Lord has the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But He has no way for one who willingly receives Satan's accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Anyone who accepts the accusations of Satan denies the power of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No one who believes in the precious blood can receive Satan's accusations at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Either one or the other must go.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we accept the accusations, the blood has to go; if we accept the blood, the accusations have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus is the High Priest and Mediator for us see Heb 2:17-18; 4:14-16; 7:20-28; 8:6; 9:15; 1 John 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is always serving in this position the High Priest and the Mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The purpose of His serving is to keep us from Satan's accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It takes only a moment of time for man to receive Him as Savior, but it is a lifelong matter to face the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The word mediator in Greek means "an appointed defender."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord is our Mediator, our Defender.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord speaks for us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But do we stand on the side of the Mediator or on the side of the accuser?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It would be ridiculous if we believed the words of the accuser while our Mediator is in the very act of defending us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If an attorney continually proved that a defendant was not guilty and defendant persisted in believing the accuser, would that not be quite absurd?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Oh, may we see that the Lord Jesus is our Mediator and that He is defending us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May we see that the blood is the basis for us to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should never answer Satan's accusations with good conduct, we should answer with the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we realized the value of the blood, there would be a great increase of peaceful and joyful Christians on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How precious are these words!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The brothers overcame him not because of their merit, their advancement, or their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whenever accusations come from Satan, we need to deal with them by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once we accept the blood, Satan's power will be nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All that we are depends on the blood, and we need the blood every day.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Just as we depended upon the blood and trusted in the blood on the day we were saved, we must continue to depend upon the blood and trust in the blood from that day forward.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The blood is our only foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God desires to deliver us from many senseless accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He wants to break these chains.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must never feel that we are being humble by receiving accusations day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must learn to overcome these accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we do not overcome accusations, we can never be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The overcomers must know the value of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Although we do not know the immense value of the blood, we can still say to the Lord, "O Lord, apply the blood on my behalf according to Your evaluation of it."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should deal with the power of Satan according to God's valuation of the blood, not according to our valuation of the blood.</S>
