<P>Today, I ask Brother Nee to forgive me for all my past attitudes and words. I also ask the responsible brothers to forgive me for my past attitudes and words. I was sympathetic toward Brother Nee's venture into business. Concerning the CBC Laboratory, I heard too many words, and they made me angry. Eventually, these angers spilled over to Brother Nee. Brother Nee said, "The magistrates are the only ones that can light a fire; the common folks should not even light a lamp." [Translator's note: A Chinese idiom meaning that only one is allowed to do something, referring to Brother Nee's venture into business.] I am not Brother Nee, and I cannot speak for him in many things. When others said that Brother Nee was wrong, how could I take such words? I could not single out Brother Nee for blame. As a result, I began to blame the other responsible brothers. Since they had promised that this [the business venture] was God's will already, how could I stop other brothers and sisters? Yet when others came to me, they were bothered to the point of a mental breakdown, and I could not help but sympathize with them. It is God's grace that I have not had a mental breakdown today. Even if ninety-nine percent of the responsibility lies with others, I still hold one percent of the responsibility. Actually, I should say that I hold more than one percent of the responsibility.</P><P>At one time, some people criticized the book The Normal Christian Church Life and asked me to say something bad about Brother Nee. People wanted to use me as a tool to oppose Brother Nee.</P><P>Concerning the CBC Laboratory, I did tell people that it was a "gossip center." My motive concerning the business was bitter, and my attitude toward Brother Nee was also bitter. I would not say that I have never condemned anything; there were indeed things which I took offense in. Once a person got involved with the CBC Lab, their spiritual condition collapsed. If what has happened these few days had happened then, none of what I am saying would need to be said.</P><P>I wish that the tears I shed today would be my last tears. I wish that when I leave the world one day, and others open up my closets, they will find them empty. If my closets are full, it will be to my shame. I realize that it is better to prefer poverty than to prefer wealth. During these years, I did have the thought of selling everything I have. Sometimes I cannot recognize my own belongings. Others always push me to buy something for myself, but I always give this and that kind of excuse. I seldom buy things for myself. When I bought an overcoat, it was three people who literally dragged me to the store to buy it. I do not care much for my own clothing. I am not saving things in my closets and keeping them for myself. As for cash, I cannot come up with even a thousand dollars. I do not have a single piece of gold with me. I can testify for my conscience' sake that all that I have is worth nothing; everything I have is what I need for myself. Of course, I can hand over my rice and my oil. I can give my last drop to the church.</P><P>The last time, when the church proposed to buy a piece of land, some people were blaming others, while others were plainly sitting back and watching. At that time, twenty pieces of gold would have done the job. But we waited and waited, until all the money was gone, and everyone was still sitting there watching. Because of this, we accomplished nothing. This is wrong. If everyone hands himself over today, what follows is the responsibility of the church. I open up myself this way today out of necessity. My words end here.</P>
