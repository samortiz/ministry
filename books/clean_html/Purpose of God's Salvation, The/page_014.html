<h2 class="head1">KNOWING AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS GOD</h2>
<p>There is a God in this universe, and this God is Christ. Christ is the true God who created the universe and all things. There is a genuine and proper man in this universe, and this man is Christ. No one is as genuine or proper as the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the true God and a real man. He has the divine life and nature, and He also has the human life and nature. As the son of David, Jesus Christ is man, and as the Lord of David, He is God. We must know that our Lord is both God and man. He has the divine nature and the human nature. We are saved, but who is Christ to us? What ground does He have in our hearts, and what effect does He have in our lives? May we see that Christ is the mystery of the universe; He is the mingling of God and man. Before Christ was born, God was in the heavens, and man was on the earth; God and man were not mingled together. Now there is One who was tested and who was found in fashion as a man but who was God. This wonderful One is the mingling of God and man. He is the manifestation and expression of God. Through His humanity God is manifested in man and expressed through man. This is the Christian faith.</p>
<p>The Christian faith has everything to do with God and man. The characteristic of Christians is that they have God within them. Genuine Christians are filled with God. Those who do not have God within them are false Christians; they are not orthodox Christians. A person may know Christ doctrinally but not experientially; he does not have a revelation concerning Christ, nor has he gained Christ. A person who sees that the Christ who indwells him is the great and unlimited God will be enlarged. Those who have the revelation of Christ are broad. Young believers may be lively and exuberant, but they need to express the greatness of Christ. This greatness is God. A young brother may be unassuming, but the great God dwells in him. If this brother knows that the Christ who dwells in him is the God of the universe, he will not put on a long face when things do not go his way or when he is offended. Instead, he would be willing to forgive, forget, and forbear offenses, and he would not be discouraged by problems. If we truly know that Christ is God and that He dwells in us, we will not focus on offenses. Those who can forgive, forbear, and cover others are broad, but those who hold grudges and are easily offended are narrow because they do not know the indwelling Christ.</p>
<p>Some saints consider their houses or their wealth to be as dear as their life. This indicates that they do not know Christ adequately. If a brother knows that Christ is God living in him, an expensive house would not mean anything to him nor would gold. A broad person has Christ. The apostle Paul counted the knowledge of Christ Jesus as excellent; hence, he was broad, and nothing earthly could touch him. Paul said that he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain Christ (Phil. 3:8). The narrower a person is, the more he cares about how he is treated and about his possessions. An excellent house would not have touched the apostle Paul&rsquo;s heart. Do we live like those who have Christ dwelling in them? When we are full of the element of Christ, we will be broad and weighty. If we lack the element of Christ, we will be narrow and lightweight.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS MAN</h2>
<p>Christ is not only God; He is also man. No one is as great or as lowly as Christ. If we are short of Christ, we will be neither broad nor lowly. Suppose four brothers serve together. Who would take the lead to be humble? I am afraid that no one would want to be the first to humble himself. However, the Lord Jesus is the great God, yet He humbled Himself and became a man (2:6-7). He could lay aside His outer garments, gird Himself with a towel, wash the disciples&rsquo; feet, and wipe them with the towel with which He was girded (John 13:4-5). When the disciples argued with one another concerning who was greater, the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone wants to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all&rdquo; (Mark 9:35). When James and John asked the Lord to grant them to sit one on His right and one on His left in His glory, the Lord said, &ldquo;You know that those who are esteemed as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be the slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many&rdquo; (10:42-45). The principle in the Bible is that the one being served is small, but the one serving is great. The Christ within us is both God and man so that we can be normal human beings who express God. If we know the Christ who is in us, we will be broad and humble. We can be as low as dust and not be concerned with how we are treated. We will be humble, lowly, and willing to serve others, because the lowly Christ is in us.</p>
<p>The Christian life should express Christ. We can be as broad as the great God and as humble and low as a proper man. If we have been graced by the Lord, nothing on earth will affect us. It will not matter whether we receive a part of the family inheritance, because the Christ within us is great and transcendent. We can also humble ourselves to serve in a lowly way, because we have Christ within us. Such is the living of ones who experience the deep work of the cross. They are touched by Christ, not by any problem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST BRINGING IN<br />
THE ONE ACCORD AND PRODUCING<br />
THE REALITY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Christ is God; therefore, people should see the greatness of God in us. Christ is also man; therefore, people should also see the lowliness of man in us. This is to live Christ out. Such a living brings in the one accord and produces the reality of the church.</p>
<p>Before the Lord Jesus died, the disciples argued concerning who was greatest (Luke 22:24). They did not have the one accord, nor did they have the reality of the church. It was not until Christ entered into them that they began to know Christ. At Pentecost Peter was filled with God and spoke the word of God with boldness (Acts 2:14-40). Peter was great, fearing no one and nothing. However, he was also so small and lowly that he could coordinate with the brothers. Thus, the disciples had the one accord and the reality of the church.</p>
<p>Because Christ is in us, we should be so broad that we have nothing to argue about and have no need to argue. We should also be so small that there is nothing we cannot accommodate and no one with whom we cannot coordinate. People in the world contend in order to be great, and no one is willing to be small or lowly. Instead, their living shows that they are quite narrow. As those who have Christ, we should not be such. We should be broad and lowly. If we have unresolved problems, we need to know Christ more. &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ?&rdquo; He is God, the Lord of David, and He is also a man, the son of David. If we know and experience Him, we will be both broad and lowly. No one among us would assume to be greater than others; rather, we would be full of grace and express the great, extraordinary, and transcendent God in all things. We would also be small, humble, accommodating, and able to serve one another. This is the living of Christians who express God, and this is the practical church life.</p>
