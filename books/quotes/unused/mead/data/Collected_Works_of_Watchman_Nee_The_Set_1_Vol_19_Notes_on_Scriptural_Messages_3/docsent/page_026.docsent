   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Second Reason</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jeremiah 30:6-7 says, "Ask now and see/Whether a man can give birth./Why do I see every man/With his hands on his loins like a woman about to give birth/And every face turned pale?/Alas!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For that day is great,/And there is none like it;/And it is a time of distress for Jacob,/But he will be saved out of it."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Daniel 12:1 says, "And at that time Michael, the great prince who stands for the children of your people, will arise; and there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time; and at that time your people, every one found written in the book, will be delivered."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These ones point out that Jeremiah said, "It is a time of distress for Jacob," and Daniel said, "Your people...will be delivered."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From this, they contend that the great tribulation is coming to the Jews only and not to the church, because the church is not the house of Jacob or the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we consider only what Jeremiah and Daniel said, then the great tribulation is indeed limited to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we should remember what the Lord said.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He not only said, "It is written," but also said, "Again, it is written" Matt 4:4, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not sufficient to see only one aspect of the Scriptures; we need to see other Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Again, it is written"; this is a very important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to other Scriptures, the great tribulation is not only for the Jews, because Revelation 3:10 says clearly, "I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everyone agrees that this refers to the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, and not only to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we may say that, on one hand, the great tribulation is the time of Jacob's trouble, but on the other hand, it is also the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They cannot quote just these two verses as evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Logically, this argument cannot stand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Third Reason</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 4:1 says, "After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 4:4 says, "And around the throne there were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and upon their heads golden crowns."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These ones say that Revelation 2 and 3 refer to the age of the church, and that in Revelation 4:1, "Come up here," refers to the whole church's being raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John represented the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, when a voice said to John, "Come up here," it meant that the whole church would be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The twenty-four elders also represent the whole church, and therefore, the twenty-four elders sitting on the twenty-four thrones refer to the whole church in heaven, that is, the glorified church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The great tribulation in Revelation begins in chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in chapter four, the whole church is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that the church will not go through the great tribulation but will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, Revelation 4:1 is not spoken to the seven churches in chapters two and three; it is spoken to John individually.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This matter is in the past, not in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was the Lord's personal word to John when he was on the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John was caught up from the island of Patmos because the Lord wanted to show him what must take place after those things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of Revelation is the record of what John saw.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If this verse can be quoted as evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation, then "the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away" Acts 8:39 can also be quoted as evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We know that although the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, he was later found at Azotus; we all know that this cannot be counted as an evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Saying that the twenty-four elders represent the whole church is totally unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Bible, the twenty-four elders cannot be counted as the representatives of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is because:</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1 The number twenty-four is not the number of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible never uses the number twenty-four to represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The number that represents the church is either seven or a multiple of seven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2 The Bible never uses the elders to represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is true that there were elders among the Jews in the Old Testament, and there are elders in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the church is not an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to historical facts, God first chose the angels, then the Jews, and finally the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only can the church not be the elders, even the Jews cannot be the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The elders in this verse have something to do with the heavens, the earth, and the seas; they have nothing to do with human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even though there are elderly ones in the church, can we say the whole church is composed of elders?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even though there is the eldership in the church, can we say that the whole church constitutes an eldership?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>3 Revelation 4:2 says, "There was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The "One" is God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then 5:6 says, "In the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who is the Lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We know that it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Revelation 4:4 says, "And around the throne there were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones twenty-four elders sitting...and upon their heads golden crowns."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These three verses tell us that God is sitting on the throne in the center; Christ is standing in the midst of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders; and twenty-four elders are sitting on twenty-four thrones which are around the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the twenty-four elders represent the whole church sitting in the heavens, can God sit on the throne and the church also sit on a throne with a golden crown on her head, and Christ not sit on a throne and not have a golden crown on His head?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not until chapter nineteen that Christ has the crown on His head, and it is not until chapter twenty that Christ sits on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Can the church sit on a throne with a crown on her head before Christ does?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What does sitting on the throne and wearing a crown indicate?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It indicates authority; it indicates reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Is it possible that the church can have authority and reign before Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We know that this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>So the twenty-four elders must not represent the church.</S>
