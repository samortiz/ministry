<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PETER</H2><P>Before we speak about what Peter represents, let us consider the difference between Peter, Paul, and John. Even though we may speak a little here and a little there, and even though it may not be very organized, nevertheless, what we say is very crucial. We do not intend to speak eloquently, but intelligibly.</P><P>Peter's work was totally different from Paul's. We only need to look at the Gospels of Mark and Luke and at Acts, and we will find an obvious difference. Mark received his Gospel from Peter, and Luke wrote down his story from Paul. Look again at Peter's testimony at Pentecost and Paul's testimony; each one has its own emphasis, and they are not the same. John's work also stands apart. The Lord's gift to John was different from the gifts to Paul and to Peter. What was Peter's testimony? If we look at Matthew 16 and Acts 2, we know that what he did concerned only one thingâ€”the kingdom of God. His line was characterized by the kingdom of God. What about Paul? I think everyone who has read Paul's Epistles can see that Paul was concerned only about God's house. In other words, he was concerned with God's church. All the testimony and work of Paul, throughout his lifetime, were on this one thing. When we consider John, we can see that his testimony was completely different. He never talked about the things regarding the church. Although Peter did not talk about the church extensively, he mentioned the overseers a little. But he did not mention anything about church organization. Neither did John say a word about church organization. John only spoke about fathers, young men, and little children. What is this? This is the testimony of God's family.</P><P>There are three clear lines before us: (1) Peter, on God's kingdom, (2) Paul, on God's house, and (3) John, on God's family. If you understand these three lines clearly, God will give you more light. This does not mean that Peter did not mention anything that John mentioned. He briefly mentioned God's house. But his main emphasis was on God's kingdom. At the same time, Paul also mentioned something about God's family, and John mentioned something about God's kingdom. But as far as their focus, Paul focused on God's church and John focused on God's family. These three lines are not absolutely distinctive, yet each one has its own specialty. Because the scope of today's topic includes the whole New Testament, I cannot speak in detail. I can only touch the subjects briefly.</P><P>Peter was the initiator. The first one in the church of Christ to open his mouth was Peter. The last one who spoke was John. Revelation, which was written by John, is the last book among the sixty-six books of the Bible. What about Paul? He was between Peter and John; he was a predecessor and a successor. There is God's kingdom and God's family; in between there is God's house. This is what God established in the Bible. It is a pity that today many people are still ignorant about the kingdom of God and the family of God. They are equally ignorant about the church of God. They only know about man's organization and denominations. If you ask people about the difference between God's kingdom, God's house, and God's family, they think that these are more or less the same. They think that once a person joins the church, he enters God's family which also means that he enters God's kingdom. They do not realize that there is a big difference between these three things. That is why God needs a Peter, a Paul, and a John to express His kingdom, house, and family.</P><P>When the Lord gave the keys of the kingdom of the heavens to Peter, it meant that Peter was the one to open the doors, first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles. We will talk about this later. But now we want to point out that since the keys of the kingdom of the heavens were put into Peter's hand, he must have been the first to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. The keys were in his hand and he kept them. If the key to our hall in Wen-teh Lane is in my hand, no matter how early you come, you will have to stand outside the iron door. Before you enter, you will have to wait until I open the door with the key and enter. Without the key, you cannot enter first. In the same way, the first to enter the realm of the heavenly kingdom was Peter. This is very clear.</P><P>In Matthew 16, the Lord spoke a marvelous thing to Peter. What did He say? He said, "And upon this rock I will build My church...I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens" (vv. 18-19). Brothers and sisters, do you realize what is different about verse 19? Oh! The greatest door handle is here. The Lord gave Peter the keys of the kingdom of the heavens. Peter could control the timing for the opening of the door of the kingdom of the heavens. He bore the responsibility of the kingdom of the heavens. But what about the church? The Lord said, "And upon this rock I will build My church." The Lord will build the church Himself; no one else can touch the church. This is the most distinctive difference between the kingdom of the heavens and the church. What is the kingdom of the heavens? It is God's spiritual domain on earth. God's kingdom is the manifestation of God's sovereignty and His administration. God's house represents God's nature in its glory, love, and righteousness. God's family expresses God's love and His relationship with us. All these stand complete in themselves. They are not the same. Many people lump everything into the church. They think this belongs to the church and that also belongs to the church. They drag everything into the church, as if the church is a warehouse in which they can store everything. This proves that they do not understand the truth of the Bible.</P><P>Peter only bore the testimony of the kingdom of the heavens, which was to open the door and let people in. We need to pay attention to John 3:5. What did the Lord say there? He said, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." If we had written this verse, we would have written it, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the family of God." But no, it says the kingdom of God. Whoever enters into the kingdom of God must be born again. Only those who are born again can enter into the kingdom of God. The keys that Peter used at Pentecost were repentance and baptism. As a result, three thousand people entered into the kingdom of God. This was the beginning of God's kingdom. Many people say that the church started at Pentecost. This is correct, but they forget that the kingdom of God also started at Pentecost. What Peter said later in the Epistles about salvation and reward refers to the future kingdom. There was no contradiction between the future kingdom and the entrance into the kingdom of God at Pentecost.</P>
