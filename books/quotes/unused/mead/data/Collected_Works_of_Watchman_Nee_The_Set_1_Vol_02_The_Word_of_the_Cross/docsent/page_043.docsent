   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Nature of the Children of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world, holding forth the word of life" Phil 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The only begotten Son of God, the Lord Jesus, is without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, all the children of God should be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although there is a generation that is crooked and perverted outwardly, we are the children of God without blemish inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who are children should be like their fathers; likewise, the children of God must also be the same in nature as their heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The crooked and perverted generation does not refer to the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wherever we see God's nature, we see the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The "children of God" is not only a title, a privilege, or a relationship, but a life from heaven, because "the Father...brought us forth by the word of truth" James 1:17-18 in order that we might "become partakers of the divine nature" 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only those who have the life of God and the nature of God are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The children of God are born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As such, they possess the nature of their heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whoever cannot reach this standard cannot be the child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The life from the throne flows only through His children who are living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Conduct of the Children of God A. They Are Holy and Pure and Righteous</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Everyone who practices righteousness also has been begotten of Him" 1 John 2:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin" 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the original, the phrase "does not practice sin" can be rendered "does not live in sin habitually."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest" v. 10 . Those who live in sin habitually and do not have the power of deliverance are not born of God but belong to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A holy, pure, and righteous conduct demonstrates a heavenly relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The life that overcomes sin and the world is a life that is born of God 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the negative side, the children of God sometimes fail and continue to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet, on the positive side, they practice righteousness and overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. Their Hearts Have a Deep and Intimate Love toward the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"If God were your Father you would love Me" John 8:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since they were born of God, they love the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Love is in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The likes, dislikes, love, and hatred within one's heart reveal whether one belongs to God or to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You can sometimes deceive man with your outward conduct, but you cannot deceive God or yourself with the inward condition of your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who know that they do not love God also know that God is not their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have already received the life of God, you will constantly long to love the Lord more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a very good test.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must also take the Lord Jesus as Lord; you must crown Him and acknowledge Him as the Master.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God" 1 John 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only those who are born of God can believe that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the Christ, so He is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This verse does not say to believe Him in a vain way, but to acknowledge that Jesus is the Christ and to offer to Him what He deserves as the suffering and glorified Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because of the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus, the children of God are brought to a realization of the preciousness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result, before the Savior they willingly pour the oil upon His head and on His feet, acknowledging Him as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>C. They Are Full of Love toward Others</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Everyone who loves has been begotten of God" 1 John 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They who are born of God, like God, have a heart of love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A loving heart is a characteristic of a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The world knows that we are the Lord's disciples because it sees that we love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are those who always make peace with others: "Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the sons of God" Matt 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A harmonious atmosphere indicates that one's origin is from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are commanded to love even our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such magnanimity and lovingkindness can only come from the heavenly regeneration which causes men to have a change in life and which makes men like God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The children of God must manifest that they are different from the world in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A heart that loves one's enemies and prays for the persecutors simply does not exist in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But since the heavenly Father shows no partiality and since the believers are the children of God, they must be as the Father is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not something manufactured but something spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The believers can be like this because God's life is within them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The removal of hatred is the very first manifestation of the regenerated life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>From these four testimonies, we can see how holy, pure, and loving are the children of God!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The argument that all the people in the world are the sons of God cannot stand under this examination.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nevertheless, the pitiful thing is that many regenerated children of God are still weak; they frequently stumble to the extent that they cannot uphold the standard of the children of God before the world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, the worldly people cannot see the difference between themselves and the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why some venture to think that all the people in the whole world are the children of God!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the children of God would constantly manifest their position, spirit, nature, and conduct, how could the world come to such a conclusion?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now let us consider another question.</S>
