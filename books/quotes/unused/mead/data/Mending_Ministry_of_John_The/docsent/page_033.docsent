   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ABIDING AND MINGLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We can abide in Him, making Him our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He can abide in us, making us His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is this mutual abiding?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word mingled is used a number of times in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers in referring to the mingling of the fine flour with oil in the preparation of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The meal offering was made of unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil Lev 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fine flour signifies the humanity of Christ; the oil is related to His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ as the meal offering presented to God was a mingling of humanity with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we abide in Christ and let Him abide in us, we are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How is it possible for one to abide in another?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It would be impossible, except that He is the Spirit and we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two spirits are joined in one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The human spirit is joined to the divine Spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some would make a distinction between being joined and being mingled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible says He is the water for us to drink John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose we pour some milk into a glass of water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Are the two liquids joined yet not mingled?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Can they help being mingled?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is illogical to make a distinction between these two words.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are mingled with Christ because He is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 and we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day these two spirits came together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When this happened, they could not help but be mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit" 1 John 3:24b; 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In both these verses John tells us that we know we are abiding in Him and He in us because of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By ourselves we are unable to abide, but by the Spirit we do abide in Him and have Him abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our previous message we said that we live Christ firstly by fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we come to the second way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We live Christ by our mutual abiding with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To abide is to remain in the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Within us is our spirit, mingled with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is here we must remain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This part of us must become our home.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here also we must allow God to make His home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We both live here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as we both have our dwelling place in this mingled spirit, spontaneously we are living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Spontaneously there is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We two are one in this flowing life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If this is our mutual abode, Christ is lived out in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is lived out in whatever we do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is lived out even in the attitudes we express.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In loving our wife, we express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are humble, our humility is Christ lived out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To live Christ is the issue of our abiding in Him and His abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We both make home in the same place, the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He and we are mingled as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This mingled spirit is our joint abode.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what makes us joyful, living, and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are in the mingled spirit, and this is our home!</S>
