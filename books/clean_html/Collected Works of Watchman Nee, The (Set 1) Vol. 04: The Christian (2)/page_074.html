<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Hidden Manna</H2><P>Let us first look at the hidden manna. Manna is the food in the wilderness. It was not found in Egypt, and it ceased to come after the entry into Canaan. It was only sent down in the wilderness. Manna is not something common. It is God's food to those who trust in Him solely, who have no other trusts, whose only support is from God, and who would die of starvation otherwise. It is because men have this dependence and need that God manifests His power and love to take up the responsibility to meet their needs.</P><P>There are those in the church who love the world. When they think of Egypt, they think of the land as being rich and filled with tasty food. They consider what the world can give to be better than what the Lord can give. "We remember the fish we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic; but now our soul is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna before our eyes" (Num. 11:5-6). Manna was given to those in the wilderness. Those whose bodies were in the wilderness but whose hearts were in Egypt did not consider the manna as being precious. On the contrary, they longed after the tasty food of Egypt. Those believers whose bodies were in the church in Pergamos but whose hearts were in the world would surely find the teaching of Balaam and his offerings most palatable. But those overcomers in Pergamos whose bodies and hearts were in the church knew that what they were passing through was merely the wilderness. As such, they were willing only to eat of the wilderness food, manna. The believers in Pergamos ate idol sacrifices, yet the Lord gave the overcomers there the manna. What a sharp contrast this is!</P><P>Of course, this manna refers to the Lord Jesus Christ. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus clearly refers to Himself as the One typified by the manna. Yet what is mentioned here is not just the manna but the "hidden manna." This hidden manna was what God had commanded Moses to put within the ark so that the Israelites would remember the food they ate in the wilderness when they entered Canaan. Naturally, this hidden manna was not eaten by the Israelites. Yet the Lord promised to give us this manna. It became possible for the overcoming believers to eat what the Israelites were not able to eat. All those who reject the reward in this age will eat of the future manna. Although we may lose the nice foods of this age, we will eat of the food of the eagle and will enjoy what the Lord will give to us at the table of the marriage feast of the Lamb. Although we miss the offerings of the kings in this age, we will be fed by our Melchisedec and will receive power from Him.</P><P>Manna typifies the Lord Jesus coming down from heaven and joining Himself to the life of the wilderness and taking a humble position. God would have the believers who are beaten in the world to remember the position of Christ here. The "hidden manna" speaks of the manna being hidden in the ark. This kind of manna was placed within the Holy of Holies and remained there as a memorial before God. This is a type of Christ, who came down to the world, and who became the portion God reserved for His people. This reminds us of the Christ who was once in the wilderness but who since then and forever remains in heaven. This hidden manna speaks of how the Christ who was here and who is now in glory has become the heavenly food. The hidden manna is not the daily manna. Rather, it is the manna that testifies daily in the land of Canaan. What a wonderful thing it is for the heavenly grace to be joined to the wilderness living! What is in the golden pot in the ark is a reminder of the life who left heaven to sympathize with those on earth. Hence, the hidden manna is a type of the ascended Christ. However, this Christ is the same One who came and lived on earth. Although He is today at the right hand of God, we still remember how He was tried and rebuffed in the world. At present, we are also in the wilderness and are beset with many special trials. If we remember how the Christ who was with us in the wilderness was tried in all things just as we are tried, and if we take this Christ as our food, we will have the strength to go on. Although at present He cannot be seen by man's eyes, He is the food of His faithful people. We must not only share with Christ in His heavenly glory, but we must also share with Him in His fellowship on earth. Although He is hidden, He is still the manna. Eventually, we will enter into heaven to enjoy all the peace and joy and will share the glory with the Lord Jesus. It is He who will give us the glory, yet it is also He who suffered and who was rejected on earth. When we think of this, do not our hearts rejoice? We abide here with Him, suffering the same kind of treatment as He suffered, but having Him as our portion. Our only regret is that we can only feebly suffer here one thousandth of a percent of what He suffered!</P><P>At the present time of apostasy and tradition, God is giving to the overcomers that which is hidden in Him. Such a promise causes every faithful one of God to leave the present, outward, and public work and come to the hidden place in the Holy of Holies. The church has been joined to the world. It has already been lifted up to a high place and is admired by all in the world! Within the church, there is already the presence of sinful works and erroneous teachings! Those who want to exalt themselves naturally find it hard to part with the church and the world, but those who faithfully serve God receive the hidden manna. Is there such a thing in the world as glorious manna? Since the manna is hidden, it cannot be for those who exalt themselves and who desire to be admired in the church or in the world. If we want to grow in the spiritual life, to fellowship with God, and to gain His Son's heart, we cannot be joined to the sinful world and the apostate church. To drift with the evil tide surely requires no spiritual effort. Both the church and the world will allow one to be on the surface of the water and to be seen by all. Yet the pitiful thing is that they would take the same one to a place that he ought not to go! The hidden manna is surely hidden from the eyes of most people. The heart of an exalted one can never be compatible with the hidden manna. Do we really know what the hidden manna is? Do we really desire it? Do we really desire and admire the form of Christ when He was on earth? Yet God treasures Him and hides Him away. What about us? If we do not know the preciousness of Christ on earth, and if we do not sympathize with God and consider His Son's life on earth as dear, we must surely be sick spiritually. A hidden life is the prerequisite for understanding the "hidden manna." Yet what a pity that important as the hidden life is, it is seriously neglected by man.</P>
