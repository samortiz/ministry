<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be a Man, to Be One with Man<br>That Man May Be One with God</H2><P>God created man with the desire that one day He would enter into man. The created man had His image, His likeness, and His breath of life as man's spirit, but he did not have God. God created man for the purpose that He would enter into man to be one with man, to make man one with Him. This is the organic union. Today we have God in us. Therefore, we have an organic union with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Tabernacling among Men,<br>Full of God's Grace and Reality</H2><P>After four thousand years God Himself became a man through a part of man, a virgin. Through this human virgin He picked up the likeness of man's flesh (Rom. 8:3). As God who became a man, He has divinity, and He also has humanity. He is one person with divinity and humanity. He is both divine and human; He is both God and man. He is the complete God plus the perfect man. He is the God-man. As the God-man He tabernacled among men, full of God's grace and reality (John 1:14, 16-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TO BRING GOD AS LIFE TO MAN</H2><P>The incarnation was to bring God as life to man. The life of God is in the incarnated Word (John 1:1-4a; 14:6a), and this incarnated Word came to bring God's life to man abundantly (10:10b). Eventually, He died as a grain of wheat to release the divine life (12:24), and He became the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18). As such a life-giving Spirit He enters into His believers to be their life (John 20:22; Col. 3:4a).</P><P>The God-man Jesus is the fulfillment of God's good pleasure and promise. However, this God-man was alone, by Himself. God's desire is that this God-man would enter into us to be our life. God created man, including us, and He became a man. But now He wants to enter into our being. After being born to be a God-man, He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, traveling back and forth, from Bethlehem to Nazareth and from Nazareth to Jerusalem. Then He was put on the cross to be killed, to be terminated. Afterward, He was resurrected, and in resurrection He as a God-man and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. At the same time, in His resurrection, He resurrected us and regenerated us (Eph. 2:6; 1 Pet. 1:3). In His resurrection He included us. When we were resurrected with Him, we all were regenerated. We were resurrected before we were born. This is God's economy. At the time of our resurrection with Christ, we all received His divine and resurrected life into us. In resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33), and we were born with Him to be the many sons of God (Rom. 8:29). It was in this way that He entered into His believers.</P><P>After entering into His believers to be their life, He ascended (Acts 1:9). From the heavens He poured Himself out as the consummated, compounded, all-inclusive Spirit upon His disciples (2:1-4). Through this the church was established and began to carry out His commission to disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:19).</P><P>Eventually, the church reached even China, where I was saved. At first when I heard the gospel I did not like it, and I would not believe. I did not like this "foreign religion." But gradually, I believed, even against my wishes and against my will. After I believed, I began to be bothered, because something entered into me. This I cannot deny. This made me happy and even made me a different person. Today I am not merely a man; I am a God-filled man. I am a man who has God in him. Today I am living God, expressing God, and magnifying God. God is my life, and I am His expression.</P>
