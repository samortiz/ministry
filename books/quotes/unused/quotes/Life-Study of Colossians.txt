Three verses, all of which are warnings, enable us to see the situation which caused this Epistle to be written- Colossians 2:8, 16, and 18
In 2:16 Paul says, 'Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths'
The vital point concerning the background of the book of Colossians is that culture had been brought into the church life
To a large extent, Christ as the unique element in the church life was being replaced by various aspects of this mixed culture
To some, the worship of angels may seem quite good, far superior to the worship of reptiles, birds, and beasts
Some justify such a practice by saying that they do not worship idols, but, in humility, worship the heavenly servants of God
Regarding themselves as too low to worship God directly, they may feel that they must worship Him through an intermediary
Christians may choose to attend a particular so-called church because the minister there is kind and sympathetic
The natural meekness or humility of such a serving one is even more damaging and frustrating than his sinfulness or pride
Because the church is composed of human beings it is difficult for the church to be separated from society which is a composition of culture
When Paul wrote the Epistle to the Colossians, a number of isms were exerting their influence: Judaism, asceticism, mysticism, Gnosticism
Paul's purpose in the book of Colossians is to show that in the church nothing should be allowed to be a substitute for Christ
Brothers, beware of your sound mind, strong will, boldness, and any other virtues that are substitutes for Christ
If Satan cannot corrupt us with evil things, God knows that he will try to use the good aspects of culture to replace Christ
Some may preach Christ or teach the doctrines regarding Christ, but even this preaching and teaching becomes a substitute for Christ Himself
If we have a clear understanding of the background of this Epistle we shall realize that the only way for us to take is the way of the cross
The better we are or the more capable we are of doing things, the more Christ may be replaced in our experience
When we turn from Colossians to 1 Thessalonians, we also sense that there is no connection between these books
Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians are a cluster of books that make up the very heart of the Bible
As a result, Paul came to realize that Judaism is contrary to Christ and that Christ is versus religion with its law
He went on to say that the world, meaning specifically the religious world, was dead to him and that he was dead to the world
In Galatians Paul speaks of Christ being revealed in us, of Christ living in us, and of Christ being formed in us
Paul's purpose and subject are not stated explicitly, but rather indirectly through various indications to be found in these verses
If we understand truth here as reality not just as sincerity then it is correct to regard the words in truth as modifying the predicate knew
Hope, faith, and love in verses 4 and 5 are the three things which the apostle stressed in 1 Corinthians 13:13
The emphasis here is on hope, which, strictly speaking, is Christ Himself , for the revelation of Christ as everything to us
Some think that the hope that is being laid up for us in the heavens refers to a particular blessing or some kind of glorious enjoyment
From the time we first believe in Christ, we spontaneously have love for other believers, no matter what their nationality may be
We praise the Lord that no matter what our nationality may be, we love one another because we all have faith in the Lord Jesus
The reason we can love those whom we could never love naturally is that hope is being laid up for us in the heavens
Suppose a certain brother loves all the saints, no matter what their nationality or cultural background may be
If day by day we do not live Christ, Christ will be there in the heavens, but He will not be laid up as a glory for us
In the same principle, the amount of hope that is being laid up for us in the heavens depends on how much we are living Christ
In 3:4 Paul says that Christ is our life and that when Christ is manifested, we shall be manifested with Him in glory
Suppose we do not live by Him; instead we live by the self and by our preferences, loving only those saints who match our taste
Do you think that, if this is your daily living with respect to the Lord Jesus, you will be excited and shout praises at His coming?
Whether or not Christ's coming back will be glory to you depends on how much hope you have laid up in the heavens by living Christ today
In our preaching of the gospel there must be not only the word of the gospel, but also the truth of the gospel, which is Christ Himself
Although we may be slow in speech, the listeners must be able to sense that the reality of Christ is being infused into them
After the Colossians had believed in the Lord Jesus, the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers came to love one another
It was Christ who was growing in the Colossians from the day they first heard the word of the truth of the gospel
To know the grace of God in truth is to know it in its reality experientially, not just in word or in doctrine mentally
The way the gospel grows in us and bears fruit is through our enjoying Christ and experiencing Him as our grace
The more we enjoy and experience Christ, the more we grow, bear fruit, live by Him, and lay up hope for ourselves in the heavens
The words 'in truth' may be regarded either as an adverb modifying the predicate knew or as an adjective modifying the noun grace
If we take the words 'in truth' as an adverb modifying knew, we see that our knowledge of grace should not be in doctrine, but in reality
In verse 7 Paul says, 'As you learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow-slave, who is a minister of Christ faithful for you'
God's will here refers to the will of His eternal purpose, of His economy concerning Christ , not His will in minor things
The will of God here is not focused on things such as marriage jobs or housing it is concerned with the allinclusive Christ as our portion
In verse 9 Paul was not praying that the Colossians would know whom to marry, where to live, or what kind of job they should have
It was not God's will for the Colossians to follow Judaistic observances, Gentile ordinances, or human philosophies
It was not God's will for them to practice asceticism, to treat the body severely in order to bridle the indulgence of the flesh
If we know that God's will is for us to be saturated with Christ, then we have the proper knowledge of God's will
Bearing fruit here refers to living Christ, growing Christ, expressing Christ, and producing Christ in every respect
Christ is not only the will of God and our walk, but He is also every good work and even the full knowledge of God
The more we get into the book of Colossians, the more we see that Christ is hope, truth, grace, the will of God, and everything to us
In verse 11 Paul goes on to say Empowered with all power according to the might of His glory unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy
The Apostle Paul did not pray that the Colossians would have the best husbands or wives, the best houses, and the best jobs
In contrast to many Christians today, Paul did not give thanks for things such as healing, health, housing, family life, or a job
Rather, he gave thanks to the Father for qualifying us 'for a share of the portion of the saints in the light'
The Father has qualified us not to inherit some heavenly mansion, but to have a share in Christ as the all-inclusive portion of the saints
After the children of Israel had entered into the land of Canaan, each of the tribes was given an allotment of the land
Of course, our portion, our allotment, today is not a physical land in Palestine; it is the all-inclusive Christ
Each of the tribes had an allotment of the good land, and the members of each tribe had a share of this allotment
Verse 13 is the explanation and definition of how the Father has qualified us for a share of the portion of the saints
There is the need for us to pray concerning knowing the will of God and walking worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing
In 1:13 Paul says, 'Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love'
In chapter two Paul linked idolatry, the worship of angels, to philosophy, mysticism, Gnosticism, and asceticism
Some observances are even based on God's commandments in the Old Testament; for example, the regulations concerning eating
To be delivered out of the authority of darkness is to be delivered from the Devil, who has the might of death
We have been delivered from the Devil, Satan, by the death of Christ and by the life of Christ in resurrection
Satan systematizes some people by luring them into practicing evil, but he systematizes others through their efforts to suppress evil
Mormons, who are known to be honest, ethical, and moral in their daily living, also are controlled by seemingly good things
The Lord appeared to him and charged him to open the eyes of others so that they might turn from darkness to light
Now, having been brought to Christ, he must seek to turn others from darkness to light, from the authority of Satan unto God
Throughout the world today people are under darkness, just as they were when the book of Colossians was written
Although these include the highest products of culture, they are nonetheless the authority of darkness by which Satan controls people
Whenever we live in the self, we are under the control of the authority of darkness and are systematized by Satan
New ones who visit our meetings may be under the authority of darkness, especially the darkness of doctrine and of doctrinal understanding
Whatever we are, whatever we do, whatever we think, and whatever we say-all is under the authority of darkness
The only thing we can do is go to the cross and allow the cross to deal with every aspect of the satanic authority of darkness
We have been not only delivered out of the authority of darkness, but also transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God's love
The object of the divine love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love with the authority in resurrection
It is easier to give an illustration of the kingdom of the Son of His love than it is to give an adequate definition of it
Because of the pleasantness of the Lords rule in us we do not care even to speak a vain word or to have a thought that is displeasing to Him
When we were holding to our philosophy, ethics, asceticism, and ordinances, we were under the authority of darkness
God has delivered us out of this authority and has transferred us into a kingdom of love that is full of life and light
It is not a matter of consistency, but of refusing to be under the control of the authority of darkness through ordinances and observances
Our Father has delivered us from the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love
If we have anything divisive among us, that is an indication that some element of the authority of darkness is still with us
The division and confusion among Christians today are the result of the influence of the authority of darkness
To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love is to be transferred into the Son who is life to us
When we live by the Son as our life in resurrection, we are living in His kingdom, enjoying Him in the Father's love
Under the heavenly ruling and restriction, we have genuine freedom, the proper freedom in love, with life, and under light
In Colossians the authority of darkness refers to the good aspects of culture and of our character, disposition, and natural being
The authority of darkness includes our virtues, religion, philosophy, observances, ordinances, principles, and ethical standards
We do not sense that we are under righteousness, power, or authority, but under the loving and lovable Lord Jesus
In John 12:46 the Lord Jesus said, 'I have come a light into the world, that every one who believes in Me may not remain in darkness'
In John 812 He declared I am the light of the world he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
The Lord's word here indicates that anyone who does not receive Him as life will not have any light, but will walk in darkness
The Gospels indicate clearly that the Jewish religion which was formed and constituted according to God's Word had become darkness
With this darkness there was an authority, the authority identified by Paul in Colossians 1:13 as the authority of darkness
As Paul testified later, he 'saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun' shining round about him
Colossians, on the contrary, deals not with sinful things, but with religion, observances, ordinances, and philosophy
Those in the seminaries may study theology and Christology, but they may not have the genuine experience of God and of Christ
If we in the Lord's recovery do not have Christ experientially and in a practical way in our daily walk, we are in darkness
We should never think that darkness prevails only in Judaism, in Catholicism, or in the denominations and divisions, but not in us
Otherwise, at least certain parts of our daily walk will not be filled with Christ, and those parts of our life will be in darkness
In certain respects, our life and our walk may be bright, full of light, because Christ occupies the prevailing position there
In other parts of our being or in other aspects of our living, we may be closed to the Lord and not allow Him to touch us
To accept something in place of Christ is not only to be in darkness, but also to be under the controlling authority of darkness
At Colosse, the authority of darkness was Jewish religious observances, pagan ordinances, philosophy, mysticism, and asceticism
Although these things seemed to be good, they were actually the authority of darkness because they replaced Christ
With this as the background, we need to see that Christ is the preeminent and all-inclusive One, the centrality and universality of God
In 1:15 we are told that Christ is the 'firstborn of all creation,' and in 1:18, that He is the 'firstborn from among the dead'
Although this is correct, here Paul does not modify the word fullness by a phrase such as 'of the Godhead' or 'of God'
There is something in this universe known as the fullness, and this fullness is pleased to dwell in the preeminent, all-inclusive Christ
According to the revelation of the Bible, we must testify that Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the reality of all positive things
He pointed out from the book of Colossians that the all-inclusive Christ is the center and the circumference of God's purpose
Let us now in the way of an overall survey look at Christ in the Gospels in the Acts in the Epistles in Revelation and then in Colossians
If a Jew were asked what happened when Jesus was crucified, he would probably answer that a man named Jesus of Nazareth died on the cross
A more advanced Christian may reply that not only was Christ crucified as his Savior, but that he himself also was crucified with Christ
An even more advanced Christian may answer that Christ, the self, Satan, and the world were all dealt with on the cross
He was the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground and produced many grains in resurrection to form the church
In the Epistles we see that Christ is our righteousness , our life , our life supply , our holiness , our redemption , and our glory
All these aspects of Christ indicate that we shall experience a full transformation resulting in glorification
In Revelation we see that Christ is the King in the coming kingdom and, ultimately, the center of the New Jerusalem in eternity
In Colossians Paul uses a number of unique expressions to describe Christ, expressions that are not found elsewhere in the Scriptures
In 1:12 Paul says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, Who qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light'
According to the book of Genesis, no promises were given that involved blessing or enjoyment before the call of Abraham
Of course, in Genesis 3:15 there is the promise that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent
A promise of blessing is first mentioned in Genesis 12, at the time God called Abraham out of his country and his father's house
If we read the Word carefully, we shall surely realize that God's promise to Abraham concerning the land is striking and very important
In a very real sense, apart from the first eleven chapters of Genesis, the entire Old Testament is a story about the land of Canaan
When the children of Israel entered into the land of Canaan, they inherited not only the seed, but also the land
The Son of God as the course was incarnated, lived on earth, was crucified, and on the third day was resurrected
To believe this is to believe that there are two Spirits who can give life, the Holy Spirit and the life-giving Spirit
In 1:13 he goes on to say, 'Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love'
Paul's concept in 1:13 is the same as that revealed in the exodus from Egypt and in the entering into the good land
In 1 Corinthians we have the church typified by the tabernacle, but in Colossians and Ephesians, the church typified by the temple
The Christ we enjoy in Colossians is not simply the lamb and the manna, but the good land, the lot, the portion of the saints
Many of us can testify that when we came into the church life, we made an exodus and were delivered out of the authority of darkness
When the children of Israel entered into the good land, nothing with an Egyptian flavor was brought into Canaan
In the same principle, there is no worldly 'garlic' in the church life, only Christ as the portion of the saints
We have seen that the portion of the saints is Christ as the good land, the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit
The light on the first day was rather abstract and unsubstantial, but on the fourth day we have the solid luminaries
At the time of Paul's conversion, the Lord Jesus told him to open the eyes of people so that they may turn from darkness to light
The Bible reveals that the light is related to God, the Word of God, Christ, the life of Christ, the believers, and the church
The Word of God, Christ, the life of Christ, the believers, and the church can all be light because they have God as their source
When we receive Christ as life, this life becomes light in us, shining upon us and enlightening us from within
We believed in the Lord Jesus and thanked Him for dying on our behalf, and we received Him as our Savior and Lord
Instead of remaining in the presence of the Lord and treasuring the inner shining, we turned to good things that are not Christ Himself
We exchanged the presence of Christ for doctrine, for some type of observance or practice, and thereby lost the inner shining
After we were saved, we were in the darkness of teachings, observances, works, formalities, and religious rituals
In more than fifty years of contacting Christians, it has been hard to find any who speak of the enjoyment of Christ
Do you know of Christians who testify of Christ as their portion and who encourage others to partake of Christ and to enjoy Him?
Through the help of pastors, ministers, and Christian workers, many of us were distracted and led away from the enjoyment of Christ
When we turn to the Lord and come into His presence, we are in the light and spontaneously begin to enjoy Him as our portion
If we do this, the more we study the Bible, the more we shall be in darkness, removed from the Lord's presence
The proper way to read the Scriptures is not only with the mind but also with our seeking spirit looking to the Lords countenance as we read
When we read the Bible in a pray-reading spirit, opening ourselves to the Lord, we are brought into His presence
In many things we may be able to pretend, but in this matter of enjoying Christ in the light there is no room for pretense
In Isaiah 2:5 the prophet sounded forth a call, 'O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord'
As we fellowship with the Lord and follow the inner anointing, we shall experience Him as the life within us in a practical way
We need to be in the church life and attend the meetings, for in the church and in the meetings we are in the light
In the meetings of the church we often have the sense deep within that we are in the light enjoying Christ as our portion
Now we can understand why after Paul speaks of light in Colossians 1:12, he goes on in the next verse to speak of the authority of darkness
We have pointed out that in Colossians the authority of darkness includes observances, ordinances, philosophy, and the various isms
In the universe everything that exists is included under one of two basic headings: the Creator and the creation
In order to show us that Christ is all, the Bible tells us that Christ is both the Creator and the firstborn of all creation
In Colossians Paul deals with such things as Jewish observances, Gentile ordinances, mysticism, Gnosticism, and asceticism
Of all the negative things that he deals with, one stands out as especially serious-the worship of angels, which is a form of idolatry
The Bible records that the law was not given to Moses by God directly; it was given through the mediation of angels
It seems as if these teachers were telling those in Colosse, 'You shouldn't be so proud as to think that you can go directly to God
Paul was fighting against such a concept when he said Let no one purposely defraud you of your prize in humility and worship of the angels
Christ is the Head of all the angels, not only of subordinate angels, but of those angels that have rule, power, and authority
It is rather easy for us to understand that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily, that is, in bodily form
The One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells and the One in whom we are made full is the very Head of all rule and authority
Because the Colossians were regarding angels as intermediaries, they needed to see that Christ is the Head of all the angels
Both doctrinally and experientially, we should be able to testify that in Christ we have been made full and are short of nothing
The Son of His love, 'the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance' , is His image, expressing what He is
The image here does not mean a physical form, but an expression of God's being in all His attributes and virtues
Otherwise He could not have been arrested, tried, and crucified; and He could not have shed His blood on the cross for our sins
If Christ were only God and not man, He could not have been born, for God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending
The difference between God's estimate of time and ours also helps us understand why Christ is called the second man
Because Christ is the first among the creatures, we can say that as the all-inclusive One He is both the Creator and part of creation
Of saying as Brother Nee did that the Son is the number one of the creatures the translator says that the Son is the head of all creation
The translator of these messages changed Brother Nee's words in order to avoid trouble with certain theological concepts
Through Him' indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed
Verses 15 through 17 unveil Christ as the first in the original creation, as the One who has the preeminence among all creatures
The new creation, on the contrary, came into being through resurrection, through the death and resurrection of the old creation
All Christians realize that Christ was born through incarnation, but not many regard His resurrection also as a birth
Through the two births of Christ, divinity has been brought into humanity, and humanity has been brought into divinity
In this two-way traffic God came into man through incarnation, and man was brought into God through resurrection
Because all the fullness dwells in Christ and because we have been put into Christ, we have been made full, filled with the divine riches
On the day of His resurrection, the Lord appeared to the disciples, breathed into them, and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter
He took the step of incarnation to become a man for the accomplishment of redemption and for the termination of the old creation
In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit in order to regenerate us to produce the church, God's new creation
In both the old creation and the new creation Christ is the first and occupies the first place, the place of preeminence
Since Christ is the first both in the universe and in the church, He must be all things in the universe and the church
According to our estimation, if Christ is the first, then something else should be the second, third, and others in sequence
Chapters two and three reveal that the Colossians had turned to various isms-Gnosticism, mysticism, legalism, and asceticism
Pray over these messages on Colossians and have fellowship concerning them, and you will see what a difference it will make in you
We do not need regulations or teachings-we need to be infused and saturated with Christ as the all-inclusive One
If Christ is infused into you, you will drop everything that is not Christ, and you will be constituted with Christ in your very being
In the body of His flesh Christ has reconciled us to God in order to present us holy, blameless, and without reproach before God
We still need to 'continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast and not moved away from the hope of the gospel'
Rather, the Bible speaks of Christ as the means of creation, as the means through which all things came into being
If Christ were merely an objective Creator, not the subjective means of creation, Christ could not express God in creation
He was not simply an objective Creator, but also the subjective instrument through which creation was processed
Of saying that Christ created the universe, the Bible says that all things came into being through Him or were created in Him
If the power of gasoline were objective, an automobile would not bear the characteristics of the intrinsic power of gasoline
Since gasoline is subjectively related to the automobile, the vehicle driven by it bears the characteristics of its intrinsic power
The three prepositions in, through, and unto were used by Paul to point out the subjective relationship of Christ to creation
Creation took place in the power of Christ's Person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him as its consummation
Colossians 1:17 does not say that all things exist in Christ or consist in Him; it says that all things subsist in Him
To exist is to be, to consist is to be composed or constituted, and to subsist is to hold together for existence
All things were made in the intrinsic power of Christ's Person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him as the consummate goal
For the fullness to dwell in Christ means that all the expression of God, all of His image, was pleased to dwell in Him
God is expressed in Him because all things have come into being in Him, through Him, and unto Him, and they subsist in Him
Through His subjective relationship to creation, Christ is the fullness of the unseen God, the image of the invisible God
Verses 19 and 20 say that in Christ the fullness was pleased to dwell, and 'through Him to reconcile all things to Him'
It is the fullness that dwells in Christ, it is the fullness that reconciles us, and it is to the fullness that we shall be presented
We have seen that all the fullness in verse 19 does not denote the riches of what God is, but the expression of those riches
When we consider the universe and the church, the old creation and the new creation, we see all the fullness of the Triune God
In verse 15 Paul puts the phrase 'firstborn of all creation' in apposition to the phrase 'the image of the invisible God'
If you study the universe in a thoughtful way, you will confess that it testifies of the eternal power and of the divine nature
The three prepositions used in verse 16-in, through, and unto-indicate that creation is subjectively related to Christ
The issue of these items is all the fullness, the fullness in the old creation and the fullness in the new creation, spoken of in verse 19
In Pauls words in Colossians Christ is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of all creation and the firstborn from among the dead
As the Son of the Father's love, He is the full expression of God, seen both in the old creation and in the new creation
The Greek word rendered stewardship here, oikonomia, is the same word rendered dispensation in Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9
The word also appears in Ephesians 3:2, where Paul speaks of the stewardship of grace which had been given to him
Because our Father has such vast riches, there is the need in His household for many stewards to dispense these riches to His children
The riches of such a Christ, who is the full expression of the Triune God, need to be dispensed into the members of God's family
The stewardship of God is needed for this rich, all-inclusive, preeminent Christ to be dispensed into the members of His Body
The New Testament ministry is the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of the all-inclusive Christ into the members of God's family
After the riches of Christ have been dispensed into us, we need to take up the burden to dispense them into others
When we carry out our stewardship by dispensing Christ into others, it becomes the dispensation of God into them
Although Christ is all-inclusive and preeminent, there is still the need for Him to be dispensed into the members of God's family
Rather, we should preach the gospel to carry out the stewardship of dispensing the riches of Christ into others
We should not merely preach the gospel or teach the Bible; we should also impart the riches of Christ to others
We should not simply move the furniture, but we should supply the riches of Christ to the members of the family, especially to the sister
If we help in the moving without dispensing the riches of Christ, we may actually make things difficult for others
All those who participate in the service of the church or in the ministry must be ready to partake of the afflictions of a steward
As we shall point out in the following message, the sufferings in which we share are for the building up of the Body of Christ
The unveiling of this mystery through the Apostle Paul is a major part of the completion of the word of God as the divine revelation
The word that needs to be completed is 'the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations'
The mystery concealed from ages and generations is the word of God that must now be completed through the preaching of the saints
If we do not minister the riches of Christ to others, their knowledge of the divine revelation will be lacking
Due to the influence of religious tradition, many believers may be reluctant to make such a statement about Christ
In typology, on the day of atonement, only the high priest, who made atonement for the people, was allowed to enter into the Holy of Holies
The high priest was a figure of Christ as the unique One capable of accomplishing redemption and qualified to do it
Here is a word telling us that at least one thing related to Christ is lacking-His afflictions for producing and building up His Body
Because this suffering has not been completed by Christ Himself, there is the need for His faithful ones to make up this shortage
If the mercy of the Lord made Paul a pattern, then His mercy can accomplish in us the same thing that it did in Paul
Just as Paul suffered for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ, so we must also suffer for the church
We cannot have fellowship in Christ's sufferings for redemption, but we need to have much fellowship in Christ's sufferings for the church
In Revelation 1:9 John says that he was a 'joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus'
To say that we are joint partakers in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus indicates that we are suffering
To be a joint partaker of tribulation in Jesus is to suffer and to be persecuted as we follow Jesus the Nazarene
When Jesus was on earth, He was persecuted by the Jewish religion, a religion formed according to God's oracles
2 Corinthians 1:5 and 6 say, 'For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ
If we care only for such activities as preaching the gospel or teaching the Bible, we may be welcomed and appreciated
If the goal of our preaching and teaching is the building up of the church, we shall be opposed by the religious ones
We were always asked to consider God's love and sympathy for pitiful sinners, and we were told to have the same feeling toward them
Some would be inspired by this preaching and with tears respond to the altar call to become ministers of the gospel
In the book of Acts we see that those in the Jewish synagogues accused the Apostle Paul of being a 'pestilent fellow'
If we preach the gospel only for the sake of soul winning and rescuing people from hell, we probably shall not suffer very much
If we take the building of the Body as the goal of gospel preaching, we must be prepared to suffer, even to be opposed and persecuted
The Lord Jesus annulled the Sabbath day, but Paul annulled something even more important to Judaism-Paul annulled circumcision
One brother was greatly helped by that message on the church and, as a result, was encouraged to turn to the way of the Lord's recovery
For the sake of the Body of Christ, the church, we need to fill up what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ
According to Acts 4:31, 'they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness'
Those who were scattered because of the persecution against the church following the death of Stephen 'went every where preaching the word'
Although the word of God preached by the early disciples grew and multiplied, it was not yet completed according to God's economy
Although Christians have both the Old Testament and the New Testament, in actuality many of them do not have the complete revelation of God
Paul's stewardship was to complete the word of God in order to dispense Christ with all His riches into the churches
All fundamental Christian teachers believe that Christ is the embodiment of God, but very few see that He is also the life-giving Spirit
In order for us to know Christ in reality as the embodiment of God, we need to experience Him as the life-giving Spirit
If we do not realize that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, the fact that Christ is the embodiment of God is merely doctrine or theory
Corinthians 15:45, which deals with the matter of resurrection, confirms this by saying that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
To the natural mind it is not logical that the last Adam, a man in the flesh, could become a life-giving Spirit
Many of us can testify of the help we have received in life through realizing that our Lord today is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit
On the one hand, He is the embodiment of the fullness of God and, on the other hand, He is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit
To many Christians it refers simply to the ways in which God deals with people, ways that are called dispensations
Paul was the first to speak of God's dispensation, and his writings reveal that God is now dispensing Himself into our being
Where else in the Bible can you find such a clear word concerning the dispensation of the Triune God into the believers?
The enemy may allow Christians to preach what is revealed in the Old Testament, in the Gospels, and in the Acts
He cannot tolerate the teaching concerning Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit or concerning the church as the mystery of Christ
Those familiar with both English and Chinese can testify that the translation is very accurate and true to the original
Under the influence of this tradition, they condemn as heretical the teaching that corresponds to the word completed by the Apostle Paul
Many of us can testify that in Christianity we did not receive the complete revelation, the completed word of God
Apparently in the Lord's ministry we are working; actually we are fighting against religion with its tradition
Although there are a great many Christian activities in this country, there is hardly any completing of the word of God
Who is bearing the burden to declare that Christ the Savior is the life-giving Spirit imparting the divine life into us?
Today there is much gospel preaching, Bible teaching, and Christian work, but where is the completion of the word of God?
Without the completion of the word of God, God's purpose cannot be fulfilled, and Christ cannot obtain His Bride or come with His kingdom
We need to experience Christ as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit and stand with the church on the proper ground
No matter how much we are opposed and attacked, we must stand with the church and experience Christ in our daily life
May the Lord make us all clear concerning His recovery and concerning the wrestling for the completion of the word of God
God's intention in His economy is to dispense Himself-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-into His chosen people
In order to see it we need to pray and to exercise our spirit as we study the Epistle of Colossians in a detailed way
The word of God is the very mystery which has been hidden from the ages and generations, but is now made manifest to the saints
Due to the influence of religious tradition, many believe that such things as God's economy cannot be understood by the so-called laymen
As the mystery of Christ, the church is the Body of Christ, His fullness, and the new man to be the full expression of Christ as well
Paul says that God has willed to make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, that is, among the Gentile 'swine'
Various terms could be used to describe the Gentiles: sinners, rebels, enemies of God, sons of disobedience, sons of wrath
If we see this glory, we shall also know the riches of the glory, even though we lack the language to utter these riches adequately
Although the Jews in ancient times were the people of God and not Gentile 'swine,' they did not recognize the Lord Jesus as their Messiah
The Jews who receive Christ into them will not only be the people of God chosen by Him, but also the sons of God regenerated by Him
Those in Colosse however had lost the vision of this mystery and had become distracted by philosophy observances ordinances and practices
Like the Colossians, today's Christians have also lost the vision of the glory of Christ as the mystery of God's economy
The vast majority of genuine Christians have been distracted and carried away to things other than Christ Himself
Because we have the One who is all in all, we have no need to turn to philosophies, ordinances, observances, and practices
If we see the vision that the all-inclusive Christ who indwells us is our hope of glory, our living will be revolutionized
If we see this vision, we shall also realize how much Christians today have been distracted to things other than Christ
It is crucial that we see the Christ who is the mystery hidden from eternity but now made manifest to the saints in the New Testament age
God has willed to make known among the nations the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in us as the hope of glory
As he announced Him, he was 'warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom' in order to 'present every man full-grown in Christ'
Paul's concept concerning his ministry was that of dispensing Christ into others so that they may grow in Christ to maturity
As the elders care for the saints in the churches, they should seek to present all the dear ones full-grown in Christ
By means of the operation in this power he carried out his ministry to present every saint full-grown in Christ
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, Who qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light'
Finally, in verse 19, Paul presents the conclusion of this line of thought: 'For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell'
If we would understand Colossians 1:15-20, we must see that the image in verse 15 denotes the very fullness as the expression in verse 19
Because Christ is the firstborn of both the old creation and the new creation, He is the expression of the invisible God
Many Christians speak of the indwelling Christ without realizing that the Christ who indwells them is the all-inclusive One
If some were asked what kind of Christ lives in them, they would speak only of Christ as the Savior and the Redeemer
The Christ who indwells us is the mystery of this economy, an economy that involves God's administration of the whole universe
What need did they have for philosophy when they had the very Christ who is the mystery of God's universal economy?
Although we may hear message after message about Christ as the mystery of God, we may not apprehend anything we hear
There was no need for the Colossians to go back to those things because they had Christ, and Christ is everything
There was no need for the Colossians to be occupied with natural or cultural differences among the various peoples
What corresponds to our concept is Paul's teaching about wives submitting to their husbands, and husbands loving their wives
Of taking Paul's word in Colossians for granted, we should dig into this book in order to discover for ourselves all these aspects of Christ
We need to remember the Lord and to praise Him according to the revelation contained in the book of Colossians
He has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, and now He is in ascension
In 1:27 Paul says not only that Christ dwells within us, but also that He dwells within us as our hope of glory
Paul's ministry was to impart Christ to others so that they may be perfect and complete by maturing in Christ unto full growth
Even in preaching the gospel, our aim should be to im- part life in order to present others mature, full-grown, in Christ
If we fail to impart Christ to others as we preach the gospel, our gospel preaching will fall short of God's standard
If in our daily living we live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, we shall spontaneously infuse Christ into others as we contact them
It is possible to be what everyone would consider a good brother or sister, but still be short of the riches of Christ
Whenever you bring something to them in fellowship, the matter becomes clear to you because they themselves are so transparent
We may be more concerned about our individual spirituality and growth than about the building up of the church
If we are short of Christ and lacking in transparency, we shall have little concern for the building up of the church
We present others full-grown in Christ by completing the Word of God with the full revelation of Christ and the church
If we continue to be short of the riches of Christ, we shall not have in our own experience the completion of the Word of God
There is the desperate need for us to pray and to labor on Christ for the completing of the Word of God concerning Christ and the church
More and more our experience must be that in every aspect of our daily living, wherever we may be, we are one spirit with the Lord
In our experience we must know what it is to be one spirit with the Lord, who is the embodiment of the Triune God
If we experience Christ as the embodiment of God, we shall be able to minister Christ to others for their nourishment and enrichment
If others feed on the Christ we minister to them as the mystery of God, they will be perfected and mature in Christ
If we would present others mature in Christ, we must minister the church as the mystery of Christ, as the ex- pension of Christ
He tried his best to avoid the subject of the church, but my concept was that we must labor for the building up of the churches
Due to the subtlety of the enemy, most Christian bookstores will sell Brother Nee's books on spirituality, but not his books on the church
Brother Nee's books related to spiritual matters have been popular with Christians around the world for many years
Does the Lord want people who only seek after spirituality, but who do not participate in the proper church life?
Some have claimed that the ministry concerning the church has no future because the opposition against it is so widespread and intense
The more others advise us not to minister on the church, the more we must be faithful to minister regarding it
Finally, we need to minister Christ as life to His members so that they may live by Him and grow with Him unto maturity
Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life, and in John 6:57; 14:19; and Galatians 2:20 we see that we need to live by Him
If we desire to present others full-grown in Christ, we must minister to them all the matters we have considered in this message
In presenting others full-grown in Christ we need to follow the principle set up in Genesis 2: Man tills the ground, and God sends the rain
As we trust in God and look to Him for the rain, we should be faithful in our responsibility to till the ground
If we depend only on our work of tilling the ground and do not trust in the Lord to send the rain, we are wrong
We are also wrong if we only pray to the Lord for rain and do not fulfill our responsibility to till the ground
Paul did not say that he struggled so that the Colossians and Laodiceans would see the vision of Christ given in chapter one
Paul did not say that he struggled so that the saints would exercise their spirits to see what he had shared with them concerning Christ
The words unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God Christ are in apposition to unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding
Paul knew that if we would present others full-grown in Christ, we must be concerned about the condition of their hearts
The church in Colosse had been invaded by Jewish ordinances and observances and by pagan philosophy, mysticism, and asceticism
They also caused the hearts of the saints to be hurt and to become cold, divided, and separated from one another
The words 'knit together in love' indicate that some kind of separation had taken place and that there had been a loss of love
Once the heart has been hurt and has become cold and divided, it is easy for the mind to be distracted or even attacked by the enemy
When the mind is in such a condition, it cannot understand the word that is ministered concerning Christ and God's economy
Paul no doubt realized this; he knew that it was crucial for the hearts of the Colossians to be comforted and knit together in love
If their hearts were cared for in a proper way, the saints would have the riches of the full assurance of understanding
When our hearts have been comforted and our minds function normally, we shall have the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God
If their hearts have not been cherished, they will not be able to receive anything we minister to them concerning Christ
When the hearts of the saints have been comforted, it will be easy for us to minister the riches of Christ to them
The reason you may sense little of Christ's operation within you is that you strive too much and pray too little to contact the Lord
If we would know Christ as the mystery of God, we need to have the full experience of everything covered in 2:2
If you spend time examining your face in a mirror, you will be impressed with the complexity of your physical body
As the crucified and resurrected One, He is living both on the throne in the heavens and in our spirit as well
Paul realized that concerning the mystery of God, Christ, the believers needed certainty, the assurance that comes from faith and knowledge
Otherwise, they would not have turned to the worship of angels or taken in such things as observances, ordinances, and philosophies
While they were with us, they praised the Lord for His recovery and declared that they were absolutely for the church life
In 2:2 Paul speaks not only of the full assurance, but of all the riches of the full assurance of understanding
Some saints may have the full assurance concerning the church ground, but they may not have the riches in their understanding
Regarding the ground of the church, we need to be exercised until we have all the riches of the full assurance of understanding
We need to be exercised to such an extent that we always have something to say about Christ as the mystery of God
If we have all the riches of the full assurance of understanding concerning Him, we shall never be short of things to say about Him
We need to inquire of the Lord and dig into the Word until we have the riches of the full assurance of understanding
Concerning Christ as the mystery of God, Paul says, 'In Whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden'
According to history, the influence of Gnostic teaching, implying Greek philosophy, invaded the Gentile churches in Paul's time
If they had such an assurance, they would know all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge that are hidden in Christ
If we exercise our being to contact the Lord, Christ as the life-giving Spirit will saturate our spirit and our mind
We should not be like the Colossians, who allowed pagan philosophy to defraud them of the wisdom and knowledge hidden in Christ
It is crucial for us to see that the fullness of the Godhead is the expression of the Godhead, that is, the expression of what God is
Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but it did not dwell in Him bodily
If we would experience Christ as the mystery of God, we need to have the full knowledge of Him as God's mystery
If you spend adequate time on these three books, you will gain a considerable amount of knowledge concerning Christ
If we fail to apply Him, then in a practical way in our daily living there is little significance to having received Him
The base of this oneness is the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father, as mentioned by Paul in Ephesians 4
Some Seventh-Day Adventists consider the keeping of the Sabbath another testimony on earth in addition to the local churches
Some denominations, such as the Church of Christ, go so far as to insist that only in their water can a believer be baptized properly
Although some groups insist on baptism by immersion, others oppose it; they claim that baptism is strictly spiritual and in the Spirit
In order to be built up corporately, the Colossians had to forsake the Judaistic observances and the heathen ordinances and philosophies
Whenever we take in some kind of philosophy, ordinance, observance, or practice in place of Christ, the church life is annulled
Verse 7 concludes with the words, 'Being established in the faith as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving'
If we are distracted from Christ and turn our attention to things that replace Him, our faith will be weakened, perhaps even shaken
If we would experience Christ as the mystery of God, we must take care not to be deluded or carried off from Him
In the past few years some were distracted by certain things which they took as their ground instead of Christ
If we care for anything instead of Christ, we shall be deluded and carried off from Him and thereby become present-day Colossians
Any who have been deluded and carried away from Christ need to receive Paul's word in this book and return to the all-inclusive Christ
Only when the hearts of the saints in Colosse were comforted, cherished, and warmed, could they have a proper understanding of Christ
Once the Colossians had the full assurance of understanding concerning the all-inclusive Christ, they could then walk in Him
In particular, as Paul was writing the book of Colossians, he had before him the picture of the land of Canaan
It was through the good land that they could worship God and build the temple for God's testimony and for His unique dwelling place
The first major conference held in the United States in December, 1962, was on the all-inclusive Christ typified by the land of Canaan
Based on these verses, we considered the unsearchable riches of the land: the water, the food, and the minerals
Because the meaning and significance of the good land are concealed, we may also say that the land is concealed in the Scriptures
By means of the supply of manna in the wilderness, God's people were able to build the tabernacle as God's dwelling place
He is the wheat and the barley, which signify respectively the incarnated and crucified Christ and the resurrected Christ
Without these verses in Deuteronomy 8, we would be short in our understanding of the all-inclusiveness of Christ
Beginning with the book of Genesis the Old Testament takes the land as the center and mentions again and again something related to the land
As we have pointed out repeatedly, the land is the figure of the all-inclusive Christ, a type of Christ as everything to us
Satan, the enemy of God, has been doing his utmost continually to frustrate the people of God from enjoying the good land
Because of Satan's rebellion, God had to judge the universe, and due to that judgment the earth was buried beneath the waters of the deep
Through the redemption of the ark, Noah and his family obtained the right to possess the land and enjoy all its riches
The flood separated the people from the earth, but the ark brought Noah and his family back to the enjoyment of the earth
It was not too long before the enemy did something further to spoil the enjoyment of the earth, this time through the rebellion at Babel
Out of the fallen race made rebellious by Satan, God called one man, Abraham, and told him that He would bring him into a certain land
Even this chosen one gradually drifted away from the land into Egypt, and the Lord had to bring him back to the land
Centuries later, the enemy moved again and sent the army from Babylon to spoil the land and capture the people
Have you ever realized that Christ is the very land in which you are rooted, that you are a plant rooted in Christ as the soil?
After being processed, the Triune God is the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit for us to experience
In 2 Timothy 4:22 Paul says, 'The Lord be with thy spirit,' and in 1 Corinthians 6:17, 'He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit'
Having the full assurance that the all-inclusive Spirit is mingled with our spirit, we should set our minds on this mingled spirit
According to typology, the children of Israel enjoyed Christ in three stages: in Egypt, in the wilderness, and in the good land
The Passover enjoyed in Egypt was not only for their redemption; it also strengthened them to make their exodus from Egypt
In the wilderness God's people were sustained by manna, which enabled them to build God's tabernacle and to carry it as a testimony
Stone was not used in the building of the tabernacle, but a great deal of stone was used in constructing the temple
Today some churches may be in the first or second stage of the enjoyment of Christ, whereas others may be in the third stage
It is very easy to be deceived by something that is close to the real thing, by a counterfeit that is almost identical to something genuine
Concerning submission, the teachings of Confucius and the teachings of the Bible appear to be the same in principle
If we do not have discernment, we could be led astray from Christ by ethical teachings that appear to be the same as those of the Bible
It seems right that just as God rested on the seventh day after laboring for six days man should have a day of rest after six days of labor
If we have light from God, we shall see that in the Scriptures God first labors and then rests, but man first rests and then works
If we are not clear about this, we may be deceived by the teaching of the Seventh-Day Adventists regarding the keeping of the Sabbath
We need to tell the Seventh-Day Adventists that with God work came before rest, but with us rest comes before work
If we see the vision of the all-inclusive Christ presented in the book of Colossians, we shall not be deluded by anything
In Corinth, the standard was low, there were divisions, and some saints were involved in lawsuits, some even in fornication
In verse 8 Paul goes on to say, 'Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit'
The first step, seen in verse 4, is to be deluded; the second step, seen in verse 8, is to be carried off as spoil
We need to have a keen discernment to be kept from being deceived by the traditions in Catholicism and the denominations
We should care only for God's direct revelation in the holy Word, not for anything that is according to the tradition of men
We need not accept anything inherited from men as a tradition if it does not correspond to the divine revelation in the Bible
The philosophy and empty deceit are not only according to the tradition of men, but also according to the elements of the world
They did not realize that Christ alone is everything in God's economy, and they did not take Christ as their life or as their Head
They did not experience the indwelling Christ as their hope of glory, nor did they live, move, and have their being in Christ
Our defense against deception is the Christ who is our life our Head the mystery of God the hope of glory and the good land in which we walk
Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, that the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily form
The fact that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that it dwells in Him in a way that is both real and practical
Because all the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ and because we have been placed in Him , we have been made full in Him
All that He has passed through is now our history, and all that He has obtained and attained is our inheritance
Although some Christians have a doctrinal knowledge of this, a mere mental understanding of our union with Christ is not adequate
We should not consider ourselves poor, just as a poor woman who has married a rich man should no longer think of herself as poor
Even though she may feel poor, she must practice applying the fact that the riches of her husband belong to her
Exercise your faith to realize what He is, what He has passed through, what He has obtained and attained, and where He is today
The rule and authority spoken of here are the angelic powers, in particular the fallen angels who still occupy positions of power
For this reason, in the book of Daniel there is mention both of the prince of Greece and of the prince of Persia
All the nations on earth today are under the rule of authorities in the heavenlies; however, not all of these are evil
Paul told them that since Christ is the Head of all the angels and since we are in Him, there is no need for us to worship angels
According to this false doctrine, we must humble ourselves and worship the angels as mediators between us and God
In addition to that physical circumcision, there is another kind of circumcision, the circumcision in Christ, which is not made with hands
When Christ was crucified on the cross, His crucifixion was the genuine, practical, and universal circumcision
Regarding the positive things, we are not short of anything, and regarding the negative things, we are no longer troubled by anything
According to our apparent situation, we are short of everything positive and are troubled by everything negative
Because we are in Him, we have been made full positively, and we have been circumcised to clear away the negative things
In baptism there is the burial aspect, which is the termination of our flesh, and the raising aspect, which is the germination of our spirit
By faith we have the reality of the termination and burial of the old man, the self, the flesh, and the natural life
According to the teaching and practice of asceticism, treating the body severely eliminates lusts and restricts indulgence
As we shall point out in a later message, this severe treatment of the body is 'not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh'
In this message we have seen that, positively, we have been made full in Christ and that, negatively, we have been circumcised in Him
We who once were dead in offenses and in the uncircumcision of the flesh have been made alive together with Christ
The first aspect in the economy of God's salvation is that He has made us alive together with the resurrected Christ
The ordinances, or decrees, refer to the ceremonial law with its rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship
In verse 15 Paul continues, 'Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it'
Based upon this, the heretical teachers at Colosse advocated the worship of angels as mediators between God and man
The Greek words translated 'in it' refer to the cross, but they can also be rendered in Him, referring to Christ
Although God has used both the law and the angels, in the economy of His salvation there is no place either for the law or for the angels
Not only were sin, the natural man, the world, and Satan crucified on the cross; the law was also crucified there
For this reason, in 2:14 Paul says that God wiped out the handwriting in ordinances by nailing it to the cross
Verse 14 is a powerful weapon to counteract the teaching of the Seventh-Day Adventists about the observance of the Sabbath
Rather, point out that the keeping of the Sabbath is part of the handwriting in ordinances which has been taken away
We have pointed out that at the time of Christ's crucifixion God stripped off, put off, the rulers and authorities
After God created the heavens, the earth, and the billions of items in the universe, an archangel rebelled, and many angels followed him
At that very juncture, God stripped them off, triumphed over them, and made a display of them openly, putting them to an open shame
The rulers and authorities who gathered around God and Christ in displeasure at what was taking place on the cross have been defeated
Now that the law and the angels have been set aside, God has a clear ground and a peaceful environment for the enlivening of His chosen ones
He now has a proper atmosphere to carry out the pleasant task of enlivening the very ones He chose in eternity past
In the economy of His salvation God enlivens us, nails the law to the cross, and strips off the evil rulers and authorities
Have you ever seen that the evil rulers and authorities were swarming around God and Christ and that a warfare was raging at the cross?
Praise the Lord that by triumphing over the angelic powers and stripping them off, God has cleared the ground to enliven His chosen people
Because of the subtlety of the enemy, the believers at Colosse were returning to the ordinances of the law and even were worshipping angels
According to Paul's word in 2:14, the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us and contrary to us, has been taken out of the way
Although God made use of the law, it was rather difficult for Him to move on to carry out His economy with the law in the way
The new creation came into existence on the first day of the week, on the day the Lord Jesus was resurrected from among the dead
Through Christ's resurrection, the new creation, including the church constituted of the regenerated believers in Christ, was produced
As the seventh day was a token of the old creation, the eighth day, the first day of the week, is a token of the new creation
For this reason, nowhere in the New Testament are we told that Christians met together to worship on the seventh day
In 1 Corinthians 16:2 Paul says, 'Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him'
Another indication of the importance of the first day of the week in the New Testament is found in Revelation 1:10
On the Lord's Day, a testimony of God's new creation, John was in spirit to see visions related to God's economy
The children of Israel were to bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest to the priest to be waved before the Lord
We have seen that in Gods economy the seventh day is a memorial of the old creation whereas the eighth day is a memorial of the new creation
Because we, the church, are in the new creation and no longer in the old creation, we are not required to keep the seventh day
Those believers in Christ who advocate the observance of a seventh-day Sabbath are short of the proper knowledge of the Bible
All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come
The festivals, the new moons, the Sabbaths, and the regulations concerning eating and drinking all were shadows
Even the satisfaction we enjoy after a good meal is not the real satisfaction but a shadow of Christ as the reality of satisfaction
As we have pointed out, eating and drinking are daily, the Sabbaths weekly, the new moons monthly, and the feasts yearly
Eating and drinking signify daily satisfaction and strengthening, and the Sabbath signifies weekly completion and rest
Just as the new moon marked a new beginning in Old Testament times, so Christ affords us a new beginning with light in darkness today
In chapter two he goes on to say that Christ is the mystery of God and the One in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden
As we have pointed out again and again, the reality of all these daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly things is Christ
He is the reality of our food and drink of our completion and rest of our new beginning with light in darkness and of our enjoyment and joy
Since Christ is the body of all shadows, we can be free from the judgment or opinion of those who advocate Gnosticism and asceticism
Because Christ is our factor, reason, element, and source, there is no need for us to express our opinions or to argue
Some people may prefer to eat with chopsticks, whereas others may prefer a knife and fork or even their fingers
If Christ is truly everything to us in our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly life, there will be no need for us to express our opinion
Although Colossians is a short book, different parts of it are written from different directions, from different points of view
In turning from the universal perspective to the practical perspective, he enables us to see the economy of God's salvation
In His salvation God has no intention to preserve the law; neither does He intend for angels to occupy a prominent position
All the positive things that remain after the law and the angels have been taken out of the way are shadows of Christ
The heavens the sun the moon the stars food and drink are all shadows figures of Christ who is the body the substance of the shadows
We insult Him if we respect physical or material things more than Christ, for all such things are shadows of Christ
In order to clear the way to enliven His chosen ones, He nailed the law to the cross and stripped off the angels
There was no need for them to accept religious ordinances or the highest products of culture including mysticism philosophy and asceticism
At Corinth there was the problem of fornication, but in Colosse the saints were practicing asceticism in order to restrict the lustful flesh
The Greek expression for 'purposely defraud' points to someone who contacts another with the fixed and determined intention of capturing him
In Colosse certain ones came to the saints, judging them and criticizing them with respect to particular practices
As verse 16 indicates, they judged the believers regarding eating and drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths
All those who seek to defraud you come firstly with a critical spirit to point out things they feel are wrong or mistaken
The intention of such criticism is to deceive you and then to defraud you by snatching you away from Christ and the church
The evil intention of the Judaizers and Gnostics was to defraud the saints in Colosse of their enjoyment of Christ and the church
It is crucial to see that all the items listed in 2:16 are shadows of which Christ is the reality and substance
The heretical teachers of angel worship taught the saints to show humility by considering themselves not worthy to worship God directly
They defrauded the saints of their prize in Christ in the element and sphere of such humility and worship of angels
They advocated a type of self-abasing humility, some form of self-depreciation which was supposed to show that a person was humble
Through such a show of humility, they seduced the Colossian believers and led them astray to the worship of angels
God's economy is to head up all things in Christ through His Body, the church, thereby to make Christ the center of all things
For this reason, as the Bible says, we need a sober mind, a mind renewed according to the image of the One who created us
To be preserved in Christ for the church life is to hold Him as the Head, out from whom the Body grows with the growth of God
As the Body of Christ, the church should not be deprived of Christ, who is the embodiment of God as the source of life
The one Person, Christ, is the center of the universe; and the one way, the cross, is the center of God's government
Since Christ is the substance of all the shadows we should not allow the shadows to be a substitute for the One who is the body the reality
God's intention is not to give us thousands of items; it is simply to give us one Person, the all-inclusive Christ
These elements are the elementary principles of outward, material things, the childish teachings of externalism
It is an elementary principle of asceticism to mistreat the body or to treat ourselves severely in an effort to suppress the flesh
For the most part, Christians appreciate the physical aspect of the cross, the aspect that can be observed with human eyes
As we have pointed out, the evil angelic rulers and authorities were busy also, having come to interfere with what God and Christ were doing
Because all this activity was brought to a focus on the cross, the cross became God's eternal, central, and unique way
Since we have died with Christ from the elements of the world, Paul asks us why as living in the world we subject ourselves to ordinances
Paul was asking the believers why they still subjected themselves to ordinances as if they were still living in human society
These rules refer respectively to things that move, to things that are edible, and to things that are tangible
Those who do not have Christ and the cross are often superstitious and also given to the practice of asceticism
We not only have Christ, the unique Person who is versus all things; we also have the cross, the unique way, which is versus all other ways
Speaking of spiritual experience, we also must pass through many crosses before we can reach the New Jerusalem
What we need to do is simply lie down through the cross at night, have a restful sleep, and then rise up in the morning in resurrection
Paul is saying that all material things are destined to decompose and to be destroyed through corruption when they are used
Since whatever we eat is destroyed in the using, there is no need for us to be subject to regulations about eating
In the same principle, only the cross can enable the leading ones in a locality to be one and in perfect harmony
By passing through all manner of crosses, large and small, we shall have oneness and harmony in the church life
If we have a daily life of passing through the cross, there will be harmony both in the family life and in the church life
Not only did Christ go to the cross, but the very man God had put on Himself with the entire creation went to the cross with Him
There is a great deal of traffic between the heavens and the church, traffic that moves faster than the speed of light
We also need to point out that the all-inclusive Spirit is the reality of the compound ointment described in Exodus 30
Our God is now the processed God who descends as the allinclusive Spirit upon His chosen people and enters into them to make them the church
In His second birth the firstborn Son of God was born with all His brothers, who are the members of His Body, the church
In the foregoing message we pointed out that in God's economy there is one Person, Christ, and one way, the cross
The teachings of Plato Socrates and Confucius and the practices of asceticism are all outside of Christ and apart from the way of the cross
We all need to be recovered from so many different kinds of isms, philosophies, and practices to this one line, to Christ and the cross
In our daily Christian experience we need to know the difference between practicing asceticism and taking the way of the cross
Some saints may say that to experience the cross is to exercise faith in order to apply what Christ accomplished on Calvary to our situation
If we spend more time considering the diagram, we shall be helped to realize in what way we have Christ as our life
Because our life has been hidden with Christ in God, who is in the heavens, we should no longer care for things on the earth
In verse 4 Paul continues, 'When Christ our life is manifested, then you also shall be manifested with Him in glory'
As a result of the process outlined in this diagram, God, man, the heavens, and the church have been brought together
We can also say that to be in the church is to be in the heavens and that to be in the heavens is to be in God
Regarding matters such as this, we do not follow the traditional teachings of the so-called historic church; we follow the pure Word of God
The reason for my hesitation is that it is difficult to print a biography of someone without exposing that person
In our sinful members is the law of sin, which makes us captives of sin and causes our corrupted body to become the body of death
Our members which are sinful are identified with sinful things such as fornication uncleanness passion evil desire and unbridled greedy lust
In 3:6 Paul points out that because of these things 'the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience'
We execute Christ's death upon our sinful members by crucifying them, by faith, through the power of the Spirit
According to Romans 8:11 and 13, the putting to death of the practices of the body is an action carried out in the power of the Spirit
Although we are not to practice asceticism, we are to put to death the negative things in us by the power of the Holy Spirit
We eventually learned that reading such books without discernment can lead seeking Christians into the error of asceticism
Asceticism is spiritual suicide; in contrast, what we are speaking of is the application of Christ's death through the flowing of the Spirit
The New American Standard Version makes this very error in Colossians 3:10 by adopting the rendering, 'have put on the new self'
Although Ephesians and Colossians are sister books, what they say concerning the new man is not exactly the same
How can we say that, on the one hand, the new man is created and that, on the other hand, the new man is renewed?
Because we who belong to the old creation were involved in the creation of the new man, he needs to be renewed
Before the new man was created in our spirit in resurrection, we did not have the Spirit of God or the life of God within us
At the time the new creation took place in our spirit in resurrection, the Holy Spirit with the divine life was added into our being
On the one hand, in our spirit the new man was created with new elements, the elements of the divine life and the Holy Spirit
In 3:10 Paul says that the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge 'according to the image of Him who created him'
In Ephesians 4:24 Paul says that the new man 'according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth'
In Ephesians 4:24 the new man is created according to God, but in Colossians 3:10 the new man is being renewed according to the image of God
The renewing of the new man results in full knowledge, and this full knowledge is according to the image of God
In some of the foregoing messages we pointed out that the image in 1:15 refers to the expression of God and to the fullness of God
We are like the Colossians in that the new man has been created in our spirit, but our mind has not yet been renewed unto full knowledge
We need to be renewed in our mind unto full knowledge according to the expression of God, that is, according to Christ as God's image
The Colossians could be deluded because in their minds they did not have the full knowledge according to God's expression
In Ephesians we see that the new man was created in our spirit with the elements of the divine life and the Holy Spirit
In Colossians, however, the new man is being renewed in our minds unto full knowledge according to Christ as the image of God
Both in spiritual experience and in human experience, the mind affects the emotion, and the emotion affects the will
Although we still need a great deal more renewing, we nevertheless have a certain amount of knowledge of the Lord Jesus
The central point of Paul's word to the Colossians concerns the renewing of the mind unto the full knowledge of Christ
Circumcision refers to the observers of the Jewish religious rituals; uncircumcision refers to those who do not care for the Jewish religion
No matter what kind of person we may be, as far as the new man is concerned, we must regard ourselves as nobodies
As those who are part of the new man, we should not regard ourselves as Chinese, Americans, Germans, or any other nationality
To say that Christ is all and in all in the new man indicates that we are one with Christ and that Christ is one with us
Before we consider verses 15 through 17 in more detail, let us look at certain aspects of verses 12 through 14
As such a new man we need to put on all the necessary spiritual virtues a heart of compassion kindness lowliness meekness and longsuffering
When we take Him as our person and live by Him, forgiving others will be a spontaneous virtue of our Christian life
In verse 15 Paul says, 'And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body; and be thankful'
The Greek term for arbitrate can also be rendered umpire, preside, or be enthroned as a ruler and decider of everything
Our having been called to the peace of Christ should also motivate us to let this peace arbitrate in our hearts
We should not only let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts, but we should also be thankful to the Lord
In the Body life our heart should always be in a peaceful condition toward the members and thankful to the Lord
With respect to a certain matter one of the parties within us may be inclined one way whereas another party may be inclined the opposite way
Now that we are saved, one party may encourage us to do one thing, but another party may encourage us to do something else
We need to understand this matter of the peace of Christ in relation to the background of the Epistle to the Colossians
Of the peace of Christ prevailing, the Greek philosophical concepts and the Judaistic practices were prevailing among the believers
It is necessary for these brothers to pay attention to the arbitrator, to the peace of Christ presiding within them
A normal Christian life should be one that is filled with the Word so that the Spirit may bubble from within us in melodies of praise
We have pointed out that in Ephesians the emphasis is on the Spirit, whereas in Colossians the emphasis is on the Word
The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us so that it may operate and minister the riches of Christ into our inner being
Perhaps you have not realized the need for the peace of Christ to arbitrate within you and for the word of Christ to make home in your heart
It is crucial for us to let the word of Christ enter into us, dwell in us, and replace our concepts, opinions, and philosophies
What we need today is to live in union with Christ, to be ruled by the peace of Christ, and to be inhabited by the word of Christ
Gods ultimate goal in His economy is to gain this new man constituted of the preeminent allinclusive Christ wrought into a corporate people
Paul's intention in writing the book of Colossians was to impress all the believers with the fact that Christ is everything
The Jewish believers should forget their ordinances and observances, and the Gentile believers should lay aside their philosophical concepts
Now we need to be filled with Christ, saturated with Christ, and permeated with Christ until Christ becomes us
As those who are part of the new man, we need to let the peace of Christ arbitrate within us and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly
We see this in 3:18-4:1, a sister passage to Ephesians 5:22-6:9, regarding the believers' ethical relationships
In Ephesians the emphasis is on the need of spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life
If we would be those through whom Christ can live, we need to pass through the first two and a half chapters of the book of Colossians
Coming to 3:15 and 16, we need to be those in whom the peace of Christ arbitrates and in whom the word of Christ dwells richly
In the relationship between wife and husband and between children and parents we need to live out Christ and express Him
If we would express Christ in our human living and preserve the grace we have received from the Lord, we need to persevere in prayer
As we spend time to consider the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ in Colossians, we shall surely receive grace from the Lord
Eventually, we shall see that we and Christ are one, that His peace is arbitrating within us, and that His word is filling us
In this evil age, every day is an evil day, full of pernicious things which destroy, spoil, and waste our time
If we do not persevere in prayer and if we are not watchful, we shall fail to grasp opportunities to minister life
In verse 6 Paul says, 'Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one'
If our words are with grace and are salted, they will cause things to be agreeable, and they will also arouse the proper taste in others
No matter which one we take as the focal point, it is a certainty that the proper Christian life requires that we redeem the time
If we are such persons, we shall be those who redeem the time and seize every available opportunity to minister life
Through the thorough dealing of the Lord, whatever proceeds out of our mouth will be a word of grace seasoned with salt
Considering the revelation in this book as a whole, the space devoted to the conclusion seems out of proportion
Consider the contrast between the lofty aspects of Christ revealed in this book and Paul's fellowship at the end of chapter four
In these verses different kinds of people are pointed out: Jews, Greeks, circumcision, uncircumcision, slaves, and masters
Onesimus, who had become a 'faithful and beloved brother' , was a slave belonging to Philemon, who was the father of Archippus
Think of how many names are mentioned in 4717 Tychicus Onesimus Aristarchus Mark Barnabas Justus Epaphras Luke Demas Nymphas and Archippus
Paul also refers to the brothers in Laodicea, the church in the house of Nymphas, and the church of the Laodiceans
Because Christ is the unique constituent of the new man, there should be no differences among the believers who are part of this new man
There should be no differences among the churches, for example, no difference between the church in Laodicea and the church in Colosse
What Paul wrote to the Colossians was also for the Laodiceans, and what he wrote to the Laodiceans was for the Colossians
In 47 Paul says All that concerns me Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellowslave in the Lord shall make known to you
If Paul did not have the consciousness of the new man, he would not have regarded it necessary to give Tychicus such a charge
As we read through these eleven verses, we find that they are a detailed portrait of the new man living in the Mediterranean area
Any church which holds such an attitude has a consciousness only of itself, not of the totality of the new man
They do not care about the churches in other places, and they do not want other churches to be involved with them
They do not have the realization that, although they are located in a specific church, they belong to the church everywhere
The second section is focused on Christ as the preeminent and all-inclusive One, the centrality and universality of God
If we would live Christ as the constituent of the new man, we need to be ruled by the peace of Christ and inhabited by the word of Christ
It is crucial that the peace of Christ be allowed to preside in our hearts and to speak the final word regarding any controversy among us
If we remember the background of the book of Colossians, we shall realize that among the believers in Colosse there were various parties
All of our inward parts-our mind, emotion, will, heart, and spirit-must be empty, available to be filled with the word of Christ
We pray that all the saints in the Lord's recovery will give place to the arbitrating peace of Christ and to the inhabiting word of Christ
At the time the book of Colossians was written, Judaism had been in existence for centuries, and the church had come into being
In order to do this, we need to spend more time pray-reading and fellowshipping concerning the book of Colossians
Because the Colossians did not have the adequate experience of Christ for the church life, things other than Christ crept into the church
If we experience Christ in our daily life, we shall have more to share of Christ in the meetings of the church
To say that there is no room for Greek and Jew means that there is no room for philosophy and for religious observances
The Colossian believers devoted much attention to matters of culture and did not want to be like barbarians or Scythians
Paul pointed out that in the church as the new man, there is no room for either the cultured or the uncultured
The praise for this so-called victory should not be given to Christ; instead, it should go to this brother's asceticism
In the natural concept there is the thought of denying the self and of suppressing the indulgence of the flesh
Negatively, we must set aside our cultural standards, and positively, we need to be filled with the word of Christ
Not only shall we have a lofty revelation of Christ, but we shall also experience Him in a practical way in our daily life
It is rather easy for readers of the New Testament to understand what Paul is dealing with in such books as Corinthians and Galatians
At the time of Paul the culture in the Mediterranean region included three main elements Jewish religion Greek philosophy and Roman politics
Just as culture exerted a strong influence on the believers in Colosse, culture today exerts a strong influence on us
Some may agree that humility could defraud them of Christ, but they would not admit to being defrauded of Him by the worship of angels
If we get into the depths of the book of Colossians, we shall see that it deals not with sin or with the law, but with man's culture
According to the book of Colossians, what defrauds us of the enjoyment of Christ and frustrates the church life is our culture
Based upon the culture we have, we develop our type of asceticism, our own practices to restrict the indulgence of the flesh
The expression 'our life' is a strong indication that we are to experience in our daily living the Christ revealed in this book
According to the revelation of the New Testament, this Christ has been processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
In 3:15 and 16 Paul charges us to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts and to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly
When the peace of Christ calms our opinions, the word of Christ, which is to dwell in us richly, replaces them
There is no doubt that our hearts need to be comforted and knit together in love unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding
The goal of this comforting of our hearts is that we would have the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God
We should not allow the concern with the heart to keep us from the realization that we need Christ the mystery of God to be everything to us
According to Ephesians 2:15, Christ's death on the cross has abolished all the cultural ordinances and differences and terminated them
According to 3:11, in the new man there is no possibility for the various cultural distinctions to continue to exist
There is no longer the distinction between the cultured and the uncultured, for in the new man Christ is all and in all
After speaking of this Paul goes on to charge us who come from many different backgrounds to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts
Whenever the peace of Christ presides in us, this peace will subdue cultural opinions, religious observances, and philosophical concepts
Whenever we experience genuine prayer, we are outside of our culture; in particular, we are outside of our cultural opinion
At such times of genuine prayer the death of Christ works within us in a prevailing way to terminate all the negative things in our being
When we enter into genuine prayer, we are far away from asceticism and all other isms, for we are one with the living Lord
We touch the reality of the one new man, where there is no Greek or Jew, barbarian or Scythian, circumcision or uncircumcision
We realize that the new man is constituted of Christ alone and that in this realm there are no differences of culture
In our natural life we make up our minds to do good, and we endeavor to accomplish what we have determined to do
Because we are one spirit with this living Person, taking Him as our life and as our person, there is no striving to live properly
Rather, as we are one with the Lord in spirit, the death of Christ is applied to us, and His resurrection power becomes prevailing in us
According to Colossians, the first aspect of the all-inclusiveness of Christ is that He is the image of the invisible God
The image of God denotes the expression of God, just as the image of a person denotes that person's expression
Regarding this aspect of the all-inclusiveness of Christ, it is helpful to have a bird's-eye view of the Bible, God's complete revelation
In the opening verses of Malachi, the last book of the Old Testament, God is revealed as the one who loves Jacob
Coming to the New Testament we see that Matthew begins with the words The book of the generation of Jesus Christ Son of David Son of Abraham
The Gospel of John opens like this: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
In Revelation 1:5 Christ is described as 'the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth'
The name Jesus implies the incarnation, and the title Christ indicates that the Lord Jesus is God's anointed One
In His ascension and enthronement He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth, for He is now Lord and Head of all
Something else that is very subtle stands in the way of Christ and the church; this subtle opposing element is culture
Although the word culture is not found in the New Testament, it is nonetheless a fact that culture is a frustration to God's purpose
In Galatians Paul deals with the law and the ordinances of Judaism, which were frustrating the believers in Galatia from enjoying Christ
The Jewish believers in Colosse had a background of Jewish culture, and the Greek believers had a background of Greek culture
We know from our own experience that to come into the church life does not necessarily mean that we give up our cultural background
Our culture includes not only our nationality, but even our special feeling toward a certain region of the country
These illustrations show how prevailing is the influence of culture and how difficult it is for us to drop our background
After the church is raised up in a certain country, it is easy for the culture of that country to invade the church
Philosophy the elements of the world and the worship of angels were all aspects of the culture which had invaded the church in that locality
Gnosticism borrowed from a variety of sources, combining pagan, Jewish, and, later, Christian teachings and practices
Paul argued with them by pointing out that the Christ in whom they believed was the firstborn of all things of the material creation
Paul said that all things, including all material things, were created in Christ, through Christ, and for Christ
If we look at God's creation, we shall see that, far from being evil, creation is the expression of the invisible God
Christ is not only the firstborn of the old creation, but also the firstborn from among the dead in the new creation
If the old creation is in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and subsists together in Christ, so the new creation is all the more
We have pointed out that both in the old creation and in the new creation Christ is the firstborn for the purpose of expressing God
Seeing that Christ is everything, we need to have the realization that this Christ is in us to be our hope of glory
If we would talk about our different concepts of the world, we would find out that we are still living according to our philosophy
In their attempts to convince one another and subdue one another, those with different philosophies may forget Christ
In the church we are in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and we subsist in Christ to be God's expression in Christ
Having seen this vision, my concept of the heavens, the earth, and all physical things, even food and clothing, has changed
The church was created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and the church subsists in Christ who is the very image of God
In 2:8 the phrase 'according to the elements of the world' is in apposition to 'according to the tradition of men'
Verse 16 says, 'Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths'
In verse 17 Paul says that the items in the foregoing verse 'are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ'
Although religion and philosophy are necessary for human society, there is no place for them in the church life
Although some theologians talk freely about Christ as the image of the invisible God, they are reluctant to expound this troubling phrase
Theologians may be happy to point out that as the firstborn from among the dead, Christ was the first to be resurrected
Very few are willing to point out that, as the firstborn of all creation, Christ is also the first of the creatures
We cannot remove from our Bibles Paul's word which says that Christ is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation
Even those things which Jews regard as unclean, including turtles, frogs, snakes, and swine, were among the things created in Christ
We have pointed out that, according to Gnosticism, the material world, including man's body, is inherently evil
Paul's desire concerning the Colossians was that they would not teach others according to the tradition of men, but only according to Christ
It is crucial for us to learn to estimate all things and to evaluate them, not according to our cultural mentality, but according to Christ
The saints were distracted from Christ, not by sin or worldliness, but by some of the most developed aspects of culture
Referring to the items listed in 2:16, Paul says in verse 17 that these 'are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ'
Eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are all shadows of which Christ is the body, the reality, the substance
We also need to receive Him as the mystery of God, God's embodiment, and as the reality of all positive things
We need to apply the matter of experiencing Christ as the reality of every positive thing to every part of our daily life
We who believe in Christ should consider all things and evaluate all things according to Christ, who is everything to us in a practical way
Christ, the mystery of God and the substance of every positive thing, is everything to us: food, clothing, housing, transportation
They do not realize that the very Christ whom they have received is the embodiment of God and the reality of all positive things
We need to be those who are filled with Christ, saturated with Christ, clothed with Christ, and fully taken over by Christ
There should be testimonies of how we have been made full in knowledge, wisdom, patience, kindness, lowliness, humility, love, discernment
As you listen to the testimonies of the saints, you can realize that most of us are short in the daily experience of Christ
Many of us still do not realize adequately that the Christ we have received is the all-inclusive One in whom we should walk
Our concern should not be simply to become holy, spiritual, and victorious; it should be to possess and experience the all-inclusive Christ
In 3:15 Paul says, 'Let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body'
If we allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in us and if we are filled with the word of Christ we shall have the new man in a practical way
We care for Him as our life and as the constituent of the new man, not for our background, culture, opinion, and judgment
In saying that Christ is versus culture, we are not saying that we should drop our culture and then live without any culture whatever
If we try to drop our culture in this way, we shall simply develop another form of culture, a culture of dropping our culture
Through the process of death and resurrection, the Son became the life-giving Spirit , the Holy Spirit who gives life
Man's physical body contains the soul, and the soul contains the spirit, which is a vessel to receive God and contain Him
After we have received Christ, we should not allow our culture to limit Christ or to frustrate us from experiencing Him
Testify to others that you have received Christ and that now you are living Christ, growing Christ, and producing Christ
In the book of Acts we see that Peter was used by the Lord to establish the first local church, the church in Jerusalem
As Peter was considering what this vision might mean, some Gentiles arrived at the place where he was staying and asked about him
For this enlargement of the experience of Christ, there was the need for Peter to lay aside his cultural background
As soon as the vision comes, we must set aside our cultural background and not allow it to replace Christ or to restrict Him
The point we are making is that since we have received Christ, we should not allow culture to become a substitute for Him
If our entire inward capacity is made available to Him, spontaneously the culture within us will be replaced by Christ
When we return home after the meetings, we automatically live according to our culture, not according to Christ
Those with a Chinese background live according to Chinese culture, and the Americans live according to American culture
In desperation he prays to the Lord and asks Him how he can become the kind of husband described in Ephesians 5
It is that we take Christ as our life and as our person to replace our culture day by day, hour by hour, and even moment by moment
Perhaps you are wondering what the difference is between living according to culture and living according to Christ
He is the One who is the image of the invisible God, the embodiment of the fullness of God, and the focal point of God's economy
All the room within us should be given over to the all-inclusive Christ who dwells in us to be our hope of glory
In 3:3 and 4 we see that the Christ who is the focal point of God's economy and the reality of all the positive things is our life
Of making up our minds to do certain things, we should simply live by the Christ who is now the life-giving Spirit in our spirit
It is not Paul's intention that we forget all the practical necessities of daily life and simply give ourselves to prayer
He is the reality of love, life, light, grace, humility, patience, power, mercy, wisdom, righteousness, and holiness
The work of creation was accomplished, then Christ became a man, the first step of the long process through which He passed
After passing through human living with its sufferings, trials, and temptations, Christ was crucified on the cross
After His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens, where He was enthroned, crowned, and made the Lord and the Head of all
If we read the Bible carefully, we shall see that the Father is in the Son and that the Son is even called the Father
Although it is a wonderful and glorious fact that we are now in Christ, this is nevertheless just a matter of position
For us to be in Christ is a matter of position; for Christ to be in us is a matter of experience and enjoyment
We see that to be in Christ is a matter of position, whereas to have Christ in us is a matter of experience and enjoyment
Although we may have been in Christ for a long time, in experience we still do not have very much of Him in us
Anything that is in us apart from Christ Himself frustrates us from the genuine experience of Christ and enjoyment of Him
Through the years we have been in the church life, many things have been discharged from our being, as grace has been added into us
Because we have our self-made standards for the Christian life, there is no need to seek the Lord, to contact Him, or to trust in Him
They may pray for the Lord's help, but the kind of help they want is that which enables them to fulfill their standard
Because our culture is part of our very constitution, we need the heavenly light to shine upon us to expose it
If we see this vision, we shall set aside our standard and aspire to be one with the Lord in our spirit moment by moment
When Christ has the free course within us to become our enjoyment and experience, our culture will be dealt with
The time has come for all of us in the churches to hear this message, to see this vision, and to condemn our cultural standards
We shall realize that what God wants is Christ and that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit
According to 1:13, He did this by delivering us out of the authority of darkness and transferring us into the kingdom of the Son of His love
According to verses 16 and 17, all things were created in Him, through Him, and unto Him, and all things subsist together in Him
The word 'fullness' here denotes a living person, not a thing, for an impersonal substance or thing cannot be pleased about something
We may have been Christians for years without knowing what God's economy is, or without even asking Him to reveal His economy to us
For years we have pointed out that Christ is life, but perhaps we have not adequately paid our attention to what Christ is
Because such a statement is according to culture, a few days after the conference that person is the same as before
Every time we make a decision to improve or to be different, we are living according to culture instead of according to Christ
We should first preach to ourselves, telling ourselves that God does not want our self-improvement, but that He only wants Christ
He has dispensed Christ into us to be our life and our everything so that we may live Him and that He may dwell in us
As the One who is God and man, He has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and enthronement
All that Christ is and all that He has obtained and attained have been compounded into the all-inclusive Spirit
Although we may love Him, we may still limit and restrict Him by our efforts to be good Christian husbands or wives
It was after His resurrection that the Lord could live in His disciples and they could live by Him, according to Galatians 2:20
We may comfort ourselves at the end of the day with the thought that in the morning we shall have a fresh opportunity to try again
Especially at the end of the old year and the beginning of the new year, we may promise ourselves to have a new beginning
After praying to the Lord in this way, we should turn to Satan and tell him to no longer tempt us to try to do anything apart from Christ
In the church life, God does not want us to be doing so much; He simply wants Christ to live in us and grow in us
Since the Son is the image, the expression, of the Father, and since He lived by the Father, the Son expresses the Father in a full way
In John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said clearly that the living Father sent Him and that He lived because of the Father
According to John 12:24, the one grain of wheat needs to fall into the earth and die in order to produce many grains in resurrection
Those who are cultured have a culture, and those who are uncultured also have a culture, although of a very different kind
Throughout the thousands of years of history, every race and nationality has had its particular kind of culture
The crucial point here is that every kind of culture is versus Christ and that Christ is versus every kind of culture
Christ is everything He is life light power might strength righteousness holiness kindness and every other divine attribute and human virtue
We may have the doctrinal knowledge from the Bible that Christ is our life without living by Christ in a practical way day by day
In addition to appreciating our natural life, we all are in the habit of using it, that is, of living according to it
A brother who has been in the church for several years truly is much more refined than he was before coming into the church life
Because the vision has not been clear, we have spent a good deal of time refining our human life instead of living Christ
Many of us can testify that by prayer we are brought into the spirit, where we are one with the Lord and take Him as our life
When we pray ourselves into the spirit, we are one with the Lord, we enjoy His presence, and we spontaneously live Him
Christ will be whatever we need: life, light, grace, comfort, health, strength, humility, patience, kindness, meekness
My burden in this message is that our eyes would be opened to see that what God wants is Christ lived out from within us
We need the kind of prayer which brings us into contact with the Lord, prayer that causes us to be one with Him in our spirit
Although the book of Colossians is short, the revelation it contains is higher than that in any other book in the Bible
If we compare Colossians with the Gospel of John, we shall be helped to realize how high is the revelation in Colossians
Although the Gospel of John is mysterious, the revelation it contains cannot compare with the revelation in Colossians
John's Gospel opens with the words, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
In 1:18 John goes on to say, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Colossians does not tell us that the Word was God, but it does speak of Christ as 'the image of the invisible God'
In apposition to this clause, Paul continues in the same verse by speaking of Christ as the 'firstborn of all creation'
John 1:3 says, 'All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being'
It is rather easy to recite John 1:3, but it is difficult to recite Colossians 1:16 and 17, verses which are far more complicated
According to Colossians, the very Christ whom we have received as our Savior and our life is the image of the invisible God
The One who is the image of God is the firstborn of all creation because in Him, through Him, and unto Him all things have been created
In 1:18 Paul goes on to say that Christ is the Head of the Body, the church, and that He is the beginning, the firstborn from among the dead
Paul is careful to point out that all the fullness, the fullness with its various aspects, is pleased to dwell in Christ
Because Colossians is part of the completion of the divine revelation, the revelation in this book is exceedingly high and rich
Because this revelation is so high and because Paul's writing is complicated, not many Christians have a proper understanding of this book
In verses 24 through 29 we have the stewardship, the economy, the dispensation, through which the objective Christ is dispensed into us
If we had verses 15 through 19 without verses 25 through 29, we would have only the objective revelation, not the subjective ministry
We need the subjective ministry in order for the all-inclusive Christ revealed objectively to be supplied to us
In verses 25 through 29 Christ is no longer merely objective, for He is now the subjective Christ dwelling in us to be our hope of glory
Paul labored, struggled, agonized, so that the saints could have Christ ministered into them and so that they could experience Him
His aim was to minister Christ to others so that they would become perfect and complete by maturing with Christ in full growth
If we desire that others enter into the practical experience of the all-inclusive Christ, we also need to labor on their behalf
After presenting the objective revelation of Christ, Paul went on to speak of the need for the subjective ministry of Christ
By means of this ministry the objective Christ revealed in 1:15-19 is dispensed into the saints to dwell in them as their hope of glory
To minister Christ into others is difficult, but to present others full-grown in Christ is even more difficult
It is crucial that we experience Christ living in us and also that we have the genuine experience of becoming full-grown in Him
Now in chapter two we have still another matterthe practical experience of the objective Christ who has been subjectively ministered into us
If you want to experience the all-inclusive Christ, do not allow yourself to remain angry with your husband or wife
Although we have been rooted in Christ, we must go on to be built up in Him and to be established in the faith
Since we have such a Christ, what need do we have for philosophy, the tradition of men, or the elements of the world?
In 2:8, 18, and 20, Paul mentions a number of matters: philosophy, tradition, elements of the world, humility, angel worship, and ordinances
The worship of angels is actually a refined form of idolatry, a practice still to be found in today's Catholicism
In the section of Colossians dealing with the practical experience of Christ, Paul lists many things that frustrate this experience
We need to keep in mind that the book of Colossians was written not to deal with sin or the law, but to deal with culture
The Christ revealed in Colossians cannot be experienced unless the cultural hindrances have been exposed and dealt with
The experience of the all-inclusive Christ unfolded in Colossians requires that we repudiate the frustration presented by our culture
In the same principle, concerning the practical experience of Christ, this book points out the most subtle frustration
The important thing is not that we attempt to drop our culture negatively; it is that we live Christ positively
It is a serious mistake for Christian parents to tell their children that they do not need culture, but only need to enjoy Christ
They were confident that they were right, and they condemned us for saying that Christ is both the Creator and the first among the creatures
In Asia Minor there was a blending of Greek culture and Jewish culture, in particular of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion
Because the church in Colosse was pervaded by such philosophical ideas, Christ was replaced, and the saints did not live by Him
What a shock this must have been to the Jewish mentality, which had been trained to distinguish the clean from the unclean
Paul presented such an extensive revelation of Christ in order to help the saints to be free from their cultural concepts
According to Acts 10, in the eyes of God there is no difference between animals and reptiles that are clean and those that are unclean
In his reluctance to obey the voice to kill and eat, Peter was still acting according to his cultural preference
Without exception every one of us has his personal and individual culture, a self-made and self-imposed culture
After they came into the recovery and began to meet with the saints in the church, some spontaneously began to conform to the church life
Some refrained from using makeup or going to movies not because they were living Christ but because they were conforming to the church life
We do certain things or refrain from doing certain things not merely because we love the Lord, but because we are living Him
If you analyze your daily living, you will probably discover that most of the time you live not by Christ, but by culture
After you have been in the church for a number of years, you may find it much more difficult to lose your temper
We are frustrated from living Christ not mainly by sin or the world, but by our virtues and our refined human living
We, however, cannot say this as long as we live mainly by our culture, including the culture of the church life, and not by Christ
My purpose in pointing out the culture in the church life is not to give ground to dissenting ones to criticize the church life
The brother expects his wife to live according to his culture, and the wife hopes that her husband will live according to her culture
In various situations and circumstances we shall no longer have opinions according to our culture; we shall care only for Christ
We all have been constituted with culture according to our race and nationality and even according to the church life
In addition to all these positive points, Paul gives the Colossians some negative points, in particular, four warnings
Unless Christ were applicable, we could not walk in Him, be according to Him, or die and be made alive together with Him
What other person is capable of being in us and of making it possible for us to die with Him, to live in Him, and to walk according to Him?
To reach us the Triune God had to pass through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
On the third day, having passed through death, conquering and subduing it, He came out of death and entered into resurrection
Paul became a person who was not according to his forefathers, the law, tradition, Judaism, or the teaching of Gamaliel
His Epistles were written not according to anything other than the all-inclusive, life-giving, processed Triune God
With the all-inclusive life-giving Triune God we have the experience of dying with Christ and of being made alive together with Him
We have all we need patience humility righteousness love kindness holiness life light power strength might and every other positive thing
Turning now to Pauls words of warning we see that in 24 he indicates that we should take heed that no one delude us with persuasive speech
In 2:16 Paul tells us to let no one judge us 'in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths'
A certain brother in the church may be very good; however, because of the influence of his self-made culture, he may also be rather peculiar
Many saints love the Lord Jesus and the church, but because they are so peculiar in their being, it is difficult for others to bear them
The church life is frustrated and even damaged by those who insist on their peculiar opinions, opinions that are according to their culture
Let us also walk in Him, having our being in Him and realizing that we have died with Him and are now alive together with Him
Let us also be one with our Head, out from whom we receive the supply to be knit together and to grow with the growth of God
We should stay with the experience of Christ so that we may have the full enjoyment of Him not caring for any religious or ethical practices
The two expressions, Christ in us and we in Christ, imply a divine, two-way traffic, a traffic which is a universal mystery
If there were no process involved with the incarnation, how could the eternal, infinite God have become a finite man?
He was processed through incarnation to become a man, and then He was processed through resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
We definitely do not believe in tritheism; we believe in the one true God, whose name, according to Matthew 28:19, is Father-Son-Spirit
The English word 'baptize' is an anglicized form of the Greek word baptizo, which means to dip, or immerse, an object in water
Being immersed in the water of baptism signifies that a believer is being put into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit
Whenever we baptize people, we should tell them that the water into which we immerse them symbolizes the Triune God
Was it in the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, in the name of Christ Jesus, or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?
When we compare Matthew 2819 with Galatians 327 we see that to baptize people into Christ is to baptize them into the Father Son and Spirit
We do not care to argue over terminology; we care only for the living Person, for the all-inclusive, life-imparting, processed Triune God
In Romans 6:3 Paul asks, 'Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
Have you ever wondered why Paul says that those who are baptized into Christ Jesus are baptized into His death?
We have seen that to be baptized is to be placed into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the death of Christ
Christ can be such water because in resurrection He was processed to become the pneuma, the life-giving Spirit
When we baptize people into Christ we baptize them into Him as the heavenly pneuma into the allinclusive lifegiving processed Triune God
Paul introduces the thought of burial; he says that with Christ we have been buried through baptism into death
Now we see that we shall also grow in the likeness of His resurrection, that is, in the newness of life, also mentioned in verse 4
One who has been baptized has grown in the likeness of Christ's death and now is growing in the likeness of His resurrection
Within the being of the resurrected Christ, there is an opening into which we, the wild olive branches, can be grafted
After the branch from a wild olive tree is grafted into a cultivated olive tree, it is part of the cultivated olive tree, and it grows in it
The more we get into Christ, the more He comes into us; and the more He comes into us, the more we get into Him
When we grow in this way, spontaneously our culture, including philosophy, asceticism, and the elements of the world, fall away
In the foregoing message we pointed out that it is in baptism that we grow together with Christ in the likeness of His death
Christ's crucifixion provided an opening in Him for us to be grafted into Him, and His resurrection ushers us into the process of growth
It is very difficult to find an English equivalent for this word, which means to grow by being planted or grafted
Recently, a brother pointed out a marvelous definition of this Greek word found in Commentary on Romans by Frederick Louis Godet
Through the organic union of two plants, accomplished by grafting, the one plant partakes of the life and characteristics of the other plant
Having become one with Him through grafting we now partake of the life and characteristics of this allinclusive One and in this way we grow
In order to understand the Bible, we need to understand both the direct meaning of the words and also the implications
Sometimes the revelation expressed through the implications of a verse is deeper than that conveyed in the direct statements
The phrase 'having been rooted and being built up in Him' is related to those who are walking in the preceding verse
Some may think that it is not logical to say, on the one hand, that we can be rooted and, on the other hand, that we walk
As those who love the Lord and pursue Him, we should always cooperate with Him and say 'Amen' whenever He moves
What we absorb of Christ into us-the element of the riches of Himself as the soil-becomes the increase of God within us
Some who tried to give up the church life because something had made them unhappy found that their efforts were not successful
In order to have proper growth as Christians, we need to realize that God has placed us, as living plants, into Christ
In the Epistle to the Colossians, Paul tells us to beware of philosophy, tradition, and the elements of the world
We should beware of culture in every form: racial culture, national culture, and self-made and self-imposed culture
If we see that culture can be a substitute for Christ, we shall no longer treasure it or appreciate it so highly
In presenting a revelation of the extensiveness of Christ, the book of Colossians uses a number of unique expressions
In 2 Corinthians 44 Paul uses the term the image of God however in that verse he does not say that Christ is the image of the invisible God
The image of the invisible God is the Firstborn of all creation, and the Firstborn of all creation is the image of the invisible God
According to the principle in the Bible, the first in a certain category often includes all the other items in that category
When the Bible says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, it implies that Christ includes every item of the creation
Based upon this illustration, we may go on to say that Christ is our clothing, transportation, housing, and everything to us
The One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created and in whom they subsist is the image, the expression, of God
In 1:18 we see that Christ is not only the Firstborn of all creation, but is also the Firstborn from among the dead
The old creation came into being by God's creating activity, whereas the new creation came into being through the resurrection of Christ
When the book of Colossians was written, the Gnostic concept of the intrinsic evil of matter had a strong influence in Colosse
Scientists recognize the fact that there is some kind of power in the universe which holds everything together
In 3:10 and 11 we see that in the church, the new man as God's new creation, the extensive Christ is all and in all
In 1 Corinthians the revelation of Christ is to deal with the problems in the church, problems which included fornication and divisiveness
The terms circumcision and uncircumcision are related to religion, whereas barbarian and Scythian are related to culture
God's intention is that we as His chosen people become saturated, permeated, filled, and clothed with Christ so that we may live Christ
In His creation of man, God intended to be everything to man: his life, joy, entertainment, provision, protection
Since Christ is ever the same and since He is the reality of every day of the week to us, every day is the same
If we care only for the all-inclusive Christ and live according to Him instead of according to culture, no one will have ground to judge us
Should someone say that there is no need to drop culture, this concept will lead to yet another type of culture
When we live Christ, we are spontaneously delivered from culture, and automatically the Christ by whom we live replaces culture
When a brother's wife expresses a concept different from his, he may begin to argue immediately and refuse to give in
In the early years of my married life, my attitude was to never give in when my wife expressed a concept different from mine
Christ descended from the heavens to the earth and then, in the interval between His death and resurrection, He descended into Hades
Now that Christ has reconciled us to Himself, we should live Him and allow Him to replace every aspect of our culture
Our human living is constituted of the various aspects of our culture, which is composed of a number of factors and elements
We have seen that the book of Colossians deals with these factors, elements, components, constituents, of our human living
As Paul says in the following verse, all these things 'are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ'
He goes on to ask, since this is the case, why we still subject ourselves to ordinances about handling, tasting, and touching
Oh, may our eyes be opened to see that every factor, element, and aspect of our natural human life is versus Christ
If He is our alphabet, He will automatically become every word, sentence, paragraph, and chapter, and ultimately, the whole book
For this reason, the book of Colossians unfolds the extensive Christ, the Christ who comes in to fill every part of our living
Having been rooted' and 'being built up' are, respectively, perfect and present participles which describe how we should walk
Our walk in Christ is based on two conditions: that we have been rooted in Him and that we are being built up in Him
The wording of these two verses is simple; however, we may take these verses for granted and not truly understand them
The objective revelation of Christ and the subjective ministry of Christ together give us the practical experience of Christ
In this message and in the messages to follow we are particularly concerned with the practical experience of Christ
A certain brother may testify that he loves the Lord and the church and that he is wholly for the Lord's recovery
Christ is not only the sphere, the realm, in which we walk, but He is also every factor and element of our human life
Even young brothers, those recently married, may behave according to their own sense of dignity instead of walking in Christ
Their attitude is that God has ordained them to be the head over their wives and that their wives should respect them and honor them
According to the extensive revelation of Christ in the book of Colossians, we should not walk in anything other than Christ
We must admit that instead of walking in Christ, we walk in many other factors or elements of our living that are replacements for Christ
According to the book of Colossians we should walk in the extensive Christ in the Christ who is universally vast and who is everything to us
We love the Lord and His recovery, but we live, walk, and have our being in things that are not Christ Himself
Because a certain brother walks in his timidity, not in Christ, he is not willing to speak the truth to others frankly in love
The young people should not say that they cannot help being young, and the old ones should not say that they cannot keep from being old
After charging us to walk in Christ, Paul immediately adds the words, 'having been rooted and being built up in Him'
If we would walk in Christ, we must fulfill the conditions of having been rooted in Him and being built up in Him
On the one hand, we have already been rooted in Christ; on the other hand, we are in the process of being built up in Him
In this growth the grafted branch, the branch from the wild olive tree, becomes deeply rooted in the cultivated olive tree
In order to transplant a tree successfully, there must be room in the soil for the tree's roots to grow and develop
On the one hand, we have been grafted into Christ; on the other hand, we have been planted into Christ, even transplanted into Him
Whether we speak from the standpoint of grafting or planting, there is the need for growth that is inward and downward
It may indicate a mushrooming type of growth, not the growth which comes from being deeply rooted in Christ and walking in Him
If the saints contact the Lord and spend time in the Word with much prayer, they will become deeply rooted in Christ
If a sister does this for a period of time, her shopping will be done in Christ, not in something other than Christ
When we are rooted in Christ, there is no need for us to make up our minds about certain things, for spontaneously we shall walk in Him
The only way to become deeply rooted in Christ as the soil is to contact Him as the soil and to daily absorb the water in the Word
After we have grown downward for a period of time, we shall automatically cease to walk in things other than Christ
On the one hand, we are rooted in our culture; on the other hand, we are built up in certain aspects of our culture
Pauls concept is that Christ the allinclusive and extensive One must become the replacement for every factor and element in our human living
Eventually, this expression will become the Body, the corporate church life, the habitation of God in spirit on earth today
For this, there are two conditions: being rooted in Christ and being built up in Christ to become the expression of Christ
We have pointed out that the book of Colossians first gives us an objective revelation of the extensive and all-inclusive Christ
The Bible indicates that Christ is the reality of many different kinds of trees the fig tree the olive tree the vine tree and the cedar tree
Because Christ is such an all-inclusive One, when He was on earth He could use various objects in nature as illustrations of Himself
The mind, emotion, will, soul, and heart are included among man's inward parts, but not one of them is the spirit
Since the spirit is different from the soul, we must be very definite in speaking of where Christ is within us
If we would experience Christ adequately, we need to realize that we have such an intimate relationship with Him
We may know that we are one spirit with the Lord, but in our daily living we may not practice living in one spirit with Him
We may insist on the freedom to choose whatever we like, to think our own thoughts, and to allow our affection to run its own course
According to His good pleasure, He created the heavens and the earth and all the billions of items in the universe
God's history refers to the process through which He has passed so that He may come into man and that man may be brought into Him
The all-inclusive Spirit who indwells us contains the elements of divinity, humanity, incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection
We have been rooted in Him, in this marvelous source, who is the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
We have been deeply rooted into Christ as the soil, the all-inclusive, life-giving, processed Triune God who dwells in our spirit
Paul's use of the words 'being built up' in 2:7 do not refer in a direct way to the building up of the Body of Christ
The soil is not our mind, emotion, or will; it is the all-inclusive, processed Triune God dwelling in our spirit
In order to become more deeply rooted into the processed Triune God, we need to exercise our spirit, not our mind, emotion, or will
In the midst of such a situation, the brother needs to exercise his spirit and call on the name of the Lord Jesus
If we understand this we shall know what it means to walk in Christ by absorbing His riches and by being built up with what we have absorbed
In order to understand what is the proper, genuine, and adequate receiving of Christ, we need to know the Christ whom we are to receive
If we do not receive Christ continually, we shall not enjoy the full benefit of the Christ we have received initially
In order for such a group of beings to come into existence, God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items
Just as a radio receiver has the capacity to receive radio waves, so our spirit has the capacity to receive God
According to Zechariah 12:1, God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
Imagine that Jesus, the mighty God incarnate, lived in a carpenter's house in Nazareth for about thirty years!
The very One who said, 'Let there be light' and caused light to shine out of darkness was the One who worked for years as a carpenter
Although Satan did everything possible to hold Him, on the third day He arose from the dead and came out of the tomb in resurrection
He was manifested to them on the day of His resurrection, when they were meeting in a room behind closed doors
As the allinclusive One Christ includes divinity humanity human living crucifixion resurrection ascension glorification and enthronement
As the mystery of God the allinclusive Christ includes incarnation crucifixion resurrection ascension glorification divinity and humanity
The Apostle Paul was struggling on behalf of the distracted, deluded Colossians to help them have a full knowledge of such a Christ
As we exercise our spirit in prayer, our aim should be to contact the Lord, not first to pray for certain people or things
As we receive such a heavenly transmission from the Lord, we not only receive the riches of Christ, but we also experience His fullness
If his wealth is only sufficient to give one dollar to every person on earth, his riches cannot be regarded as fullness
Because children are too young to behave according to Christ, they must be taught to behave according to culture
Of allowing the law to release God's chosen people and to give them over to Christ, the Judaizers used the law to keep people from Christ
The concept of the Judaizers even crept into the church to distract some of the genuine Jewish believers in Christ back to the law
Although culture is right and necessary, it is also subject to misuse and can actually keep people from Christ
Culture should be used to keep the children until they are able to receive Christ and live according to Christ
We should tell our children that the culture we gave them was only good for a certain time and that now they need to receive Christ
Culture is used by God through parents to keep their children in custody until the time comes for them to receive the Lord
Now that we have received Christ, He, the all-inclusive, extensive One, must replace every aspect of our culture with Himself
Let us allow the pure Christ to fill our being and replace every aspect of our natural human life with Himself
Some saints may be rather proud of their pleasant disposition or of their natural virtues, such as humility, patience, and kindness
If we see this vision, we shall concentrate our entire being on the extensive Christ, who will then fill us and occupy us
Because we are filled with the extensive Christ, we shall have no need of Judaism, Gnosticism, mysticism, or asceticism
Once we see this vision, our entire being will be attracted by this Christ and will be possessed by Christ and occupied with Him
Gradually the extensive Christ who occupies our attention will replace every element of our natural human life
To us to live will be the Christ who has taken full possession of us and who occupies us and fills us with Himself
That such a Christ should replace all the elements of our natural human life is the message of the book of Colossians
The enemy is like a crouching beast, waiting for an opportunity to pounce on us and to keep us from living Christ
Years ago, certain of the children of the Christian leaders in my home town became very worldly and pursued worldly enjoyment
After a church had been raised up in that place, a number of these young people turned to the Lord and to the church
In many cases, their parents rose up against them, even though they had not opposed them for their worldliness
At the time Paul wrote to the Colossians, Greek philosophy and Judaism were among those things which were distracting the believers
Those in favor of Greek philosophy sought the opportunity to convert the believing Gentiles back to Greek philosophy
In 2:16 Paul warns the Colossian believers to let no one judge them in eating, drinking, or in respect of feasts, new moons, or of Sabbaths
Paul realized that many things were there to be utilized to lead the believers astray from Christ and the church life
Our relationship with Christ can be illustrated by the grafting of a branch from a wild olive tree into a cultivated olive tree
We are cut off from the wild olive tree and then placed into the cultivated olive tree, in the spot where an incision has been made
We all need to grow and become full grown so that Christ may have a corporate full-grown man, the Body, as an organism to express Him
In the book of Colossians Paul sets forth not only the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ, but also the experience of Christ
For Christ to be the Firstborn of both the original creation and the new creation means that He is both extensive and all-inclusive
The completion of the Word of God found in Colossians is the mystery of God's economy-Christ in us, the hope of glory
Although there are millions of Christians in this country, not many have paid adequate attention to Christ in us, the hope of glory
Inwardly, a naturally humble person may be proud of his humility, especially when he compares himself with others
Paul told them that when he first came to them, he determined not to know anything among them except Jesus Christ and Him crucified
In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul eventually indicated that to have the church life we need the experience of Christ crucified
What the Corinthian believers needed was to live a crucified Christ and not pay their attention to knowledge and spiritual gifts
If we try to be righteous by keeping the law, we shall be severed from Christ, and He will be of no effect to us
In 3:11 Paul says that in the new man there is no Greek or Jew, no circumcision or uncircumcision, no barbarian or Scythian
As we consider the three books of 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians, we see many replacements for Christ
The quick brother automatically lives according to his natural quickness, and the slow one, according to his natural slowness
Whether you prefer the quick one or the slow one it is a fact that Christ is replaced by both our natural quickness and our natural slowness
When we are tested by the Lord concerning this, we need to humble ourselves and confess that we do not live very much by Christ
Just as there is a unique commandment for unbelievers, so there is a unique commandment for believers: To live Christ
We all have a strong culture, both the culture we have inherited and the culture we have made and imposed on ourselves
What ground does anyone have to twist God's Word to mean that Christ is merely represented in us by the Spirit?
Those who deny that Christ actually dwells in us oppose us for teaching that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit
In 2:6 and 7 Paul says, 'As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him'
The extensive, all-inclusive Christ revealed in this book is subjective to us, for He dwells in us as our hope of glory , and He is our life
We worship the enthroned Christ in the heavens, but we experience, enjoy, and partake of the indwelling Christ in our spirit
Now that we have become one spirit with the Lord, in our daily life we need to experience being one spirit with Him
Although they could speak of the indwelling Christ as the hope of glory, they had very little experience of Christ
If we would walk in Christ, we must meet two conditions: we must be rooted in Him, and we must be in the process of being built up in Him
In Matthew 15:13 the Lord Jesus said, 'Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up'
Since Christ is both the tree and the good land we can say that we have been grafted into Christ and also that we have been planted into Him
In this fellowship those factors in the plant and in the soil which correspond to each other become one in life
In our spirit we have the experience of being planted into Christ, for here we are joined to Him and become one spirit with Him
If we had only a body and a soul but had no spirit, it would not be possible for us to be planted into the Lord as the life-giving Spirit
We need to turn to the spirit, to the very place where we have been regenerated and planted into the divine Spirit
The transaction that took place between the divine Spirit and our spirit at the time of regeneration remains forever
We may say that our spirit has married the divine Spirit and thus the two spirits have entered into an eternal union
Whenever we face difficulties in our daily living, we should not remain in the natural mind, but turn to the spirit
In this way we experience Christ as the good land with the rich soil that affords us the nourishing life element
It is the result of turning to the spirit, remaining in the spirit, and absorbing the nourishing element of Christ
We have seen that if we would walk in Christ, we must be planted and rooted in Christ, the divine Spirit in our spirit, and remain in Him
By remaining in the spirit, we are rooted in Christ in a practical way and thereby absorb the rich nourishment into our spirit
It is important to see that if we have not been built up individually, we shall not be able to be built up with others corporately
If we would walk in Christ, we need to absorb His riches by being rooted in Him and to be built up as individual members of the Body
If, on the contrary, a dead stick is thrust into the earth, that stick cannot be said to be rooted in the soil
As all mothers realize, the more their children are nourished with healthy food, the more they grow, and by growing, they are built up
The words 'out from Whom' in verse 19 indicate that something is coming out from the Head to cause the Body to grow
As we consider 2:19, we must realize that the word God is not merely a term, and God Himself is not simply the object of our worship
The new man does not come into existence by taking Christians from various countries and bringing them together
The new man comes into being as we are saturated, filled, and permeated with Christ and replaced by Him through an organic process
Rather, the rich, substantial Christ must actually be wrought into us organically until He replaces our natural being with Himself
Having been rooted in Him, we must daily absorb the rich nourishment of Christ into us to be the element that causes us to grow
These verses indicate that the believers are God's plantation and that Paul was a helper of the divine Husbandman
As we daily take time to eat food, we should daily take time to absorb the Lord, take time to assimilate the riches of Christ
God Himself is our food, and we need to seek Him at His dining table, where we need to take time to eat Him slowly
One of the greatest verses in the Bible, 1 Corinthians 6:17, says, 'He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit'
Our spiritual being our inner man the regenerated spirit must be permeated with the Lord and mingled with Him to form a single living entity
In Ephesians 2:21 he says, 'In Whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord'
In Ephesians 4:13 Paul speaks of arriving at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
We arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ by growth and building which come through the eating of Christ
After a church has been in a locality for a certain period of time, friction may develop between the saints, even among the leading ones
According to these verses, Christ is the mystery of God, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
We must beware that no one carries us off as spoil from the very Christ who is the mystery of God and in whom we should walk
We have received the wonderful Christ who is the mystery of God with all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
Now we must go on to see, from verses 8 through 15, a description of the very soil in which we have been rooted
The first aspect of this very special soil is found in verse 9: 'For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily'
The believers had been rooted in Christ as the good land, as the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells
One aspect of the soil is that of the fullness of the Godhead; another aspect is that Christ is the Head of all rule and authority
Verse 12, which says that we were buried together with Christ in baptism, indicates that the soil also contains the element of burial
The phrase 'made full' implies a great deal and requires an amplified translation in order to bring out its real significance
As the image of the invisible God, Christ is both the Firstborn of all creation and also the Firstborn from among the dead
Christ, the Beloved of God, is the image of the invisible God expressed in the old creation and in the new creation
The first aspect of this land is the fullness of the Godhead, the expression of God in the old creation and in the new creation
Paul wanted the Colossian believers to realize that since they had been made full in Christ, they had no need to worship angels
Now that we have been rooted in the good land, the fullness has become ours, and we are supplied with every positive thing
On the negative side, however, as 2:11-15 indicates, we have the flesh, the ordinances, and the rulers and authorities
Young and old, male and female, cultured and uncultured-we all are troubled by these three categories of negative things
We all have the flesh, we all have some type of ordinances, and we all are subject to the evil authorities in the atmosphere
The killing and the burial take the negative things away from us, whereas being raised takes us away from the negative things
As we stay rooted in the soil and absorb its rich elements, the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies will be stripped off
In 2:10-15 Paul uses a number of verbs in either the past tense or the perfect tense in order to point to various accomplished facts
Forget your situation, your condition, your failures, and your weaknesses and simply take time to enjoy the Lord
Although even ten minutes is good, it is best to spend thirty minutes to enjoy Him at the start of each new day
If you spend thirty minutes to absorb the Lord and to enjoy Him in the morning, you will not be bothered by negative things during the day
The more we live one spirit with the Lord, the more we experience the all-inclusive and extensive Christ revealed in Colossians
Praise Him that we have been rooted in a rich, fertile soil filled with the divine attributes and uplifted human virtues!
It is a fact that the ordinances in writing have been wiped out and that the powers of darkness have been stripped off
The expression 'in Him' refers to the facts, whereas the expression 'according to Christ' refers to experience
If you cannot say that you walk according to Christ, this indicates that, in a practical way, you have been carried off from Him
You have received Christ and have been rooted in Him, but as far as your daily living is concerned, you have been carried away from Him
As long as we are severed from Christ, it does not matter whether we are far removed from Him or only a little bit away from Him
For the most part, our daily walk is according to the tradition of men and the elements of the world and not according to Christ
In this matter, however, he also may be conforming to a certain way of life instead of living according to Christ
In the church life, we should not be conformists; we should live, walk, and have our being according to Christ
We should dress ourselves and style our hair according to Christ, not according to the tradition of men or the elements of the world
Even if you attend the church meetings without walking according to Christ, you will be separated from Him in a practical way
In the matter of being carried off from Christ, you are no different from Christians who indulge in worldly entertainments
Although they may live according to high standards and follow the best practices, they may not have their daily living according to Christ
Romans 8:4 is a verse that is parallel to Colossians 2:8 in the sense that it tells us to walk according to spirit
The Spirit mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:17 is the very Spirit spoken of in John 7:39, the Spirit which was not yet until Jesus was glorified
All the necessary virtues, such as humility, kindness, honesty, faithfulness, and love, are included in the walk according to the spirit
In Him we have everything, for in Him we are made full, perfect, and complete, and we are supplied and satisfied
Now we must go on to see that, for our practical experience, this all-inclusive and extensive Christ is the Spirit
We who care for the experience of Christ must see that the New Testament reveals clearly that the Lord is now the Spirit
Should someone ask you where is the Christ about whom you talk so much, you should answer that He dwells in your spirit
One brother may be accustomed to speaking according to his mind, whereas another brother may talk according to his emotion
When they rise up early in the morning, they should exercise to talk not from the mind or from the emotion, but from the spirit
Let us look to the Lord that He would grant us the mercy and grace to have our married life according to the spirit
When we walk according to the divine Spirit mingled with our human spirit, we shall have our being according to Christ
In the book of Colossians, Christ is revealed not only as the all-inclusive One, but also as the extensive One
According to the revelation in the book of Colossians, the extensive, all-inclusive Christ is everything to us
Concerning our daily experience of Christ, Paul speaks of such common, ordinary matters as eating and drinking
If we ask ourselves whether or not we enjoy Christ in the small matters of our daily living we shall realize that we are short of experience
Colossians 2:16 says, 'Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths'
In writing these words Paul wisely refers to matters related to our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment
In referring to these matters, Paul indicates that whatever we enjoy daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly should be the enjoyment of Christ
When you are invited to go to a restaurant for a meal, you should not go there only to enjoy the shadow, but go to enjoy Christ
Many saints have suffered persecution because they have turned to Christ and to the way of the Lord's recovery
These verses reveal that Christ is not only objective, but that He is also the One for us to enjoy daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly
The same is true of the Christ we experience as our weekly completion and rest as a new beginning in darkness and as our yearly enjoyment
As we have indicated again and again, this prize is the subjective experience of Christ daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly
God wants Christ to be not only our Savior and not even just our life, but also to be our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment
As we consider the situation among the vast majority of Christians today, we see that this enjoyment has been lost
Of enjoying Christ, believers are occupied with religion, so-called worship services, and theological teaching
In particular, we need to be recovered to the continual enjoyment of Christ in a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly way
If you do not have much enjoyment of Christ, then in your experience the word of God has not been completed in full
In our daily living it is easy for us to be more concerned about our behavior than about the enjoyment of Christ
Whenever we fail the Lord in our daily walk, we are full of regret and we confess to the Lord and ask Him to forgive us and cleanse us
Although we may be very exercised in matters like this, we may not care adequately for the enjoyment of Christ
The fact that we eat and drink a number of times during the day indicates that we should not be content to enjoy Christ just once a day
As you put on your clothing, you should be reminded that Christ is the real clothing, and you should experience Him as such
Everything we do will remind us to contact Christ, to enjoy Christ, to experience Christ, and to have Christ as our everything
Colossians 2:9-15 is a description of the elements of the soil implied by the words 'having been rooted' in 2:7
As a tree absorbs nourishing elements from the soil through its roots, we also should absorb the riches of Christ into us
Even at the beginning of our prayer, we may not actually and experientially be rooted in Christ, for we may pray many unnecessary things
When our time of prayer is finished, it may happen that we do not go on to assimilate what we have absorbed of Him
We should not only absorb the Lord in the morning, but we should be like trees continually absorbing the riches of the soil
We should let every physical thing be a reminder of Christ, for all these things are shadows of which Christ is the substance
If our roots are tender and new to absorb the riches of Christ, we shall grow automatically with the riches we assimilate
Although there are millions of Christians on earth today, almost all of them have been defrauded of their prize of the enjoyment of Christ
If we do not hold the Head but stand on things which we have seen, we shall be defrauded of our prize of the enjoyment of Christ
We should not allow ourselves to be defrauded by anyone standing on things which he has seen and not holding the Head
It is important to understand, in an experiential way, what it means to hold the Head and how to hold the Head
Eating drinking Sabbaths new moons and feasts are all shadows of things to come whereas Christ is the body the reality of these shadows
His warning in 2:18 and 19 is based upon the fact, revealed in verses 16 and 17, that Christ is the reality of all positive things
Those who seek to defraud us are the ones who stand on things which they have seen and who do not hold the Head
In other words, the very Christ who is the reality of all positive things is the One who is the Head of the Body
If we would know what it means to hold the Head, we must know what it is to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things
With this as the background, we can now say that to hold the Head is simply to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things
In Paul's use of illustrations in 2:16, he covers the whole span from the hourly enjoyment of Christ to the yearly enjoyment of Him
In 2:17 Paul says that the body is of Christ, but in verse 19 he speaks not of Christ, but of holding the Head
The reason for the change in terminology from Christ to the Head is that our enjoyment of the Lord causes us to become conscious of the Body
According to our experience, we know that the more we enjoy Christ, the more intense is our desire for the Body
If we fail to contact the Lord for a period of time, we shall automatically neglect the church life or lose interest in the meetings
Instead of criticizing the church, we shall praise the Lord for the church life, and we shall testify how much we love it
Since the Christ we enjoy as our everything is the Head of the Body, the more we enjoy Him, the more we become Body-conscious
If the supply of Christ is ministered to us and we begin to enjoy Him again all the members of the Body will once again become lovable to us
The more you enjoy Christ, the more you will realize experientially that the very Christ you enjoy is the Head of the Body
In 1:18 Paul says, 'And He is the Head of the Body, the church; Who is the beginning, Firstborn from among the dead'
The fact that Christ is the Firstborn from among the dead indicates that He is the Head of the Body in resurrection
Ephesians 1 indicates that after His resurrection and ascension, Christ was made the Head over all things to the church
If we are not brought into resurrection through the enjoyment of Christ, we shall remain in our natural person
If in our experience we temporarily abandon Christ and do not continue holding Him as the Head, we shall sense that we are earthly
If in our married life we consistently enjoy Christ, we shall hold Him as the Head and be in the heavens in our experience
We can be experientially in the heavens only by enjoying Christ, the Head, as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit
If Christ were only the Head and not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to contact Him or hold Him experientially
To hold Christ as the Head is not only to enjoy Him and to be in the heavens, but it is also to be in our spirit
Anyone who is puffed up by the mind of the flesh does not hold Christ as the Head, for he is in his fleshly mind, not in the spirit
Because Christ is the unique constituent of the new man, He is every member of the new man and in every member
These riches are the very elements of God which become in the members of the Body the increase of God by which the whole Body grows
In chapter two Paul says that Christ is the mystery of God and that in Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden
In 2:9 and 10 Paul goes on to say that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and that we in Him have been made full
Other elements include circumcision, burial, being raised, the wiping out of the ordinances, and the stripping off of the powers of darkness
The matters in verse 16-eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths-are all shadows, of which Christ is the reality, the substance
We have pointed out that, experientially and practically, to hold the Head is to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things
When Abraham offered one-tenth to Melchisedec, Levi, the descendant of Abraham, who was in Abraham's loins at the time, also offered tithes
Years later, my eyes were opened to see that the very Christ who was crucified on the cross became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit
When the Spirit came into us to become one with us, the Spirit brought with Him the effectiveness of Christ's death
In Colossians 2 Paul speaks of being rooted and of holding the Head, and in John 15 the Lord Jesus speaks of abiding in the vine
Abiding in the vine is equal to being rooted in the soil, and being rooted in the soil is equal to holding the Head
On the one hand, Christ is the vine in which we abide; on the other hand, He is the soil in which we are rooted
In 220 Paul says If you died with Christ from the elements of the world why as living in the world do you subject yourself to ordinances
Today you are not happy with your husband or wife, so you purposely come down from the cross in order to argue and vindicate yourself
From our experience we know that when we hold Christ as the Head in spirit, we have the experience of being crucified with Him
In Colossians Paul implies that anything we cling to other than Christ experienced by us is an element of the world
Whenever this sister lives according to her natural character, she is living according to the elements of the world, not according to Christ
When we remain in our spirit, we spontaneously experience the death of Christ included in the all-inclusive Spirit
Under the light of such a vision, we shall hate even our kindness because it is not of Christ, but an element of the world
Only when we are in the spirit can we declare that we have nothing to do with religion, philosophy, culture, or natural virtues
When we are in the spirit, we can hate these things, because we recognize that they are worldly and not of Christ
When we stay in the spirit by watching and praying, we have the experience of being dead with Christ to the elements of the world
If we stay in the spirit, we shall have the sense deep within that we have been uplifted, raised up with Christ
In 3:2 Paul continues, 'Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth'
In Revelation 5:6 we see that Christ as the Lamb with seven eyes is now on the throne executing God's government
Our Christ is the One crowned and enthroned, the One who is the Lord and the Head, the One carrying out God's governmental administration
Paul does not say that our life is hidden with Christ in heaven, for that would be to emphasize something too material
Whenever we are in the spirit, we are raised up and have the sense that we are in God, far above everything and everyone
When we remain in the spirit holding the Head, we can proclaim that we have died to everything other than Christ
Praise Him that we have died from all the elements of the world and have been raised up to live with Christ in God!
In 3:1 Paul tells us to seek the things which are above, and in verse 2, to set our mind on the things which are above
The One who is our portion is the image of the invisible God, Firstborn of all creation and also the Firstborn from among the dead
Paul also tells us that Christ is the mystery of God and that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily
As the mystery of God and the embodiment of the Godhead, He is the reality, the body, the substance, of all positive things
The more we enjoy Him as this reality, the more we hold Him as the Head of the Body and thereby become Body-conscious
Although Paul charges us to seek the things above and set our mind on them, in Colossians he does not define what these things are
The more we open to the Lord and contact Him in this way, the more He infuses Himself into us and fills us to the brim
Eating and digesting food is a good illustration of how Christ is constituted into our being through our enjoyment of Him
If we eat an extraordinary amount of any one particular food, we shall become a constitution of the elements of that food
His daughter had eaten so many carrots that she was eventually constituted of them to the point that it affected the color of her skin
At this point we may ask how we can enjoy Christ and have Him constituted into us when He is in heaven and we are on earth
Between Christ as the fullness of God and the one new man, there is our experience of the heavenly transmission
The New Jerusalem revealed through John's ministry will be the ultimate consummation of the new man revealed through Paul's ministry
On the one hand, Paul begins with the fullness and goes to the new man; on the other hand, John goes from the fullness to the New Jerusalem
Let us look away from these things and look to the resurrected and ascended Jesus who is enthroned and crowned with glory and honor
Since we have been raised with Christ, we should seek the things above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God
Of appreciating our natural attributes and character, we need to appreciate the One crowned with glory and honor
If the believers in Colosse truly had realized this, they would not have been distracted by Judaism or Greek philosophy
In Hebrews 6:19 and 20 we see that the Lord Jesus is the Forerunner, the Pioneer, who has cut the way into glory within the veil
In Hebrews 4:14 we are told that we have 'a great High Priest Who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God'
When we call on the Lord and have fellowship with Him, we sense that something from the heavens is being transmitted into us
Our path is under the direction of the transmission from the heavens, the transmission which comes from the intercession of Christ
The first vision is of the churches on earth, whereas the second vision is of what is taking place in the heavens
Praise the Lord that according to the book of Revelation, the churches are going on under the direction of the heavenly administration!
He is the Lamb with seven eyes, with the seven Spirits of God, carrying out God's administration through the local churches
If we know these things, we shall see that the Lord Jesus has been crowned with glory and honor, that God has made Him both Lord and Christ
Of caring for our own virtues, we should care for the Lord Jesus as the crowned One, the Head, Forerunner, High Priest, and Minister
Let us lift up our eyes to the heavens and set our mind on the wonderful, excellent things, the things that are above
The riches of Christ's heavenly ministry will be transmitted into you, and you will be transformed and constituted of Christ
Colossians 3:1-4 implies that with Christ we have one position, one life, one living, one destiny, and one glory
If we do not lose our temper because we are living with Christ, then we are one with Him in life and in living
The Lord is in the Father, and He prayed that the disciples, who were not yet in the Father, would be brought into Him
If we stop here, we shall have nothing more than a mere doctrinal understanding of our one position with Christ
It is when we are in the spirit that we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven practically and experientially
Consider as an illustration how the lights in the meeting hall are connected to the power plant by the flow of electricity
Because we may experience and enjoy this unique transmission, there is no need for us to go to heaven in order to be in heaven
At the breakfast table your wife or husband may say something to bother you, and immediately you are drawn out of the spirit into the flesh
We should not think that God has one life, that Christ has another life, and that we who believe in Christ have yet another life
We see a sister who is gentle, quiet, and kind, and we think that because she has such characteristics she is full of life
Seeing a brother who is an eloquent and powerful speaker, we may take his power and eloquence as signs of life
In both cases what we see may be the natural life, not the life that Christ has, the life hidden with Christ in God
Perhaps you are wondering how to discern between the natural life and the life Christ has, the life hidden in God
A certain sister may be nice, gentle, and kind; however, all this may be in the natural life, a life that has not been crucified
If this sister lives a resurrected life while she is cleaning in the meeting hall, she will not be troubled if someone criticizes her work
According to Hebrews 1:3, having finished His ministry on earth, the Lord sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high
As the High Priest, He intercedes for us and cares for all the churches, transmitting into them the heavenly supply
To seek the things which are above and to set our mind on them is to join ourselves to the Lord in His ministry in heaven
At the appointed time, the time for a divinely-ordained display, there will be the manifestation of the sons of God in glory
We can have one position, life, living, destiny, and glory with Christ only because we are one spirit with Him
In the foregoing message we pointed out that we are one with Christ in position, life, living, destiny, and glory
Even though we speak different languages and need translation in order to communicate, we still have the sense that we are one new man
If there are some among us with no experience of Christ and no enjoyment of Christ, they will be a hindrance to our fellowship
If we enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things, we shall take Him as our food, drink, clothing, transportation, and housing
Because Christ is so active for us in the heavens, we should seek the things that are above and set our mind on them
Christ is in heaven interceding, ministering, and administrating, and we are on earth responding to Christ's activity in heaven
If Spurgeon could begin serving the Lord as a young person, the young people in the churches today can do the same
We all can experience Christ as our daily necessities and also enjoy Him by seeking the things which are above
They are like radios that are not turned on and tuned in to receive the transmission of the radio waves in the atmosphere
Although Christ is in heaven ministering and transmitting, many Christians are not responding to His ministry or receiving His transmission
When they sense that Christ is praying in heaven for a certain matter, they join Him to pray on earth for that very matter
According to 3:5-9, we put to death our members which are on the earth and put off the old man with his practices
If we seek the things above and have one living with Christ, we shall be wholly occupied with the enterprise of our Master
Our heart will be with Him in heaven, where He is interceding for the churches, supplying the saints, and administrating God's government
Although the Christ revealed in this book is profound, extensive, and all-inclusive, we can still experience Him
We expect that through the enjoyment of Christ the one new man will come forth and be expressed in a practical way
In this way, we not only enjoy Christ as the reality of our necessities, but we also take Him as our life and have one living with Him
We have pointed out again and again that the result of living together with the Lord in such a way is the new man
Those from America will no longer live an American life, and those from Japan will no longer live a Japanese life
On the one hand, the Bible does say that in the new man there is no place for the natural person because Christ is all the members
After presenting so many marvelous truths concerning Christ, Paul tells us to therefore seek the things which are above, where Christ is
According to those ethical teachings believers are charged to improve their behavior to be good neighbors to be submissive and to be loving
Of course, in the book of Colossians Paul has something to say about husbands and wives, masters and slaves, parents and children
Since man was created to express God and represent Him, to be a proper human is to be God's expression and representation
It is difficult to represent another person or an organization; how much more difficult it is to represent God
If it is difficult to be a proper human being, it is all the more difficult to be a Christian, especially a Christian who lives Christ
If we see God's standard, we shall feel like giving up, for we shall realize that in ourselves we cannot meet God's requirements
Grace is the Triune God coming into us to express Himself, to represent Himself, and to live Himself in us and through us
In the Life-study of Exodus we pointed out that in His salvation God does not want us to do anything or to be anything
When God's people were in Egypt, they had an Egyptian diet and ate the Egyptian meat, fish, onions, cucumbers, leeks, and garlic
Many have been helped to see that through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, God has been wrought into us
Christ came by incarnation to bring God into us, and He went back to God by crucifixion and resurrection to bring us into God
According to Colossians 1 and 2, the Colossians had been distracted and were paying their attention to the elements of the world
From Paul's writings we can see that Christians are peculiar people who do not need religious teachings or ethical admonitions
What makes Christians peculiar is that we have Christ in us as our life and we have God, the living Person, as our realm
The young people may need to testify to their parents that they are young people with Christ in them and that they are with Christ in God
If we see the vision, the revelation, that Christ is in us as our life and that we are in God as our sphere, we shall be changed
How good it would be for a husband and wife to testify to one another that they are peculiar because they have Christ and are living in God
Oh, may we all realize that according to the Bible, Christ is in us as our hope of glory and that with Christ we are hidden in God!
With this as a foundation, we are now prepared to consider what it means to be one with Christ in the things above
Lasting thirty-three and a half years, this ministry began with Christ's incarnation and was concluded with His crucifixion
The Body of Christ needs the heavenly ministry of Christ, the ministry of Christ above, in order to be built up
The Lord's goal is not merely to redeem us and regenerate us; His goal is to have the church, the Body, the Bride
His work for the building up of His Body has been going on for more than nineteen centuries, and still it is not complete
As the High Priest, He is interceding for us, and as the heavenly Minister He is supplying us with the riches of God
Realizing their shortcomings, many brothers may confess to the Lord that they simply are not able to be a proper husband
There will be a spiritual transmission transaction and traffic between God and you because of Christs ministry as High Priest and Minister
We should not be occupied with earthly things and with the elements of the world, but should realize that we are hidden with Christ in God
For centuries, Christ has tried without adequate success to get a people to respond to His ministry in the heavens
By His mercy and grace, there is on earth today a group of people in the Lord's recovery responding to Christ's heavenly ministry
Rather, we shall care only for Christ's intercession for His Body and for the transmission of His riches into His members
The new man is not produced by teaching; the new man is produced by the heavenly traffic, transaction, and transfusion
My burden in this message has been to point out where we all need to be-one with Christ in His heavenly ministry
Although Christ in His earthly ministry fully accomplished redemption for our salvation He has not yet completed the building up of His Body
It is not the desire of Christ simply to have a large group of saved people; He wants the saved ones to be built up together as His Body
It is most pitiful that among many genuine Christians today the connection with the heavenly Christ in their experience has been severed
They are genuine Christians, but they do not experience the divine current, and there is no fellowship between them and the Lord
Of being cut off from the heavenly Christ, in our experience we need to continually receive the divine transmission
Day and night, we should be infused with a supply from heaven, and experience the transaction between the heavenly Christ and us
According to Colossians 3, corresponding to Christ's heavenly ministry by seeking the things above is the first aspect of our Christian walk
In 3:10 Paul says, 'And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him Who created him'
On the one hand, Paul speaks of the creation of the new man; on the other hand, he refers to the renewing of the new man
Because the divine life and nature have been added to our spirit, our regenerated spirit has become part of the new creation
The reason the regenerated spirit is part of the new creation and of the new man is that the life and nature of God has come into it
There is the need for the divine life and nature to spread from our spirit into our soul and to saturate the soul
As the divine life and nature spread from our regenerated spirit into the mind, emotion, and will, our soul will be renewed
Even though we have been regenerated, we are often inclined to live according to the old man, that is, to live according to the old creation
Not many Christians have seen that the renewing of the new man depends on our seeking the things which are above
If we do not seek the things above and set our mind on them, it will be difficult for us to be renewed in soul
Our mind, however, should be set not on religion, philosophy, or culture, but on Christ and His heavenly ministry
As Colossians 3 makes clear, this renewing is related to seeking the things above and setting our mind on them
During the years the Lord's recovery has been in this country, many saints have experienced God's dispensation
There has been considerable progress even among the young people because of the renewing by the divine life and the divine nature
Through such an inward change, the new man spreads from our spirit into our soul and actually increases within us
If parents consider the growth and development of their children, they will see that they do not grow by means of knowledge
As the members of our physical body function according to knowledge, so the new man functions as it is renewed unto full knowledge
In writing this Epistle, Paul was seeking to bring them back from the elements of the world to the things which are above
When we set our mind on the things above, the way is open for the new man to spread the divine element from our spirit into our soul
Although we have been regenerated, we may have very little of the image of Christ in our mind, emotion, and will
On the one hand, He is in all the persons, the members of the new man; on the other hand, He is all things in the renewing of the new man
In the renewing of the new man, Christ is all the wonderful virtues, all the good things, and all the positive attributes
Although he was from the United States, he could be merged in the spirit of fellowship with so many saints from the Orient
In Colossians 3 and 4 there are a number of points, arranged in an excellent sequence, related to the proper Christian walk
Apparently there is no connection between setting our mind on the things above and the renewing of the new man
In the same principle, between Christ in heaven and us on earth, there is a divine transmission, the flowing of the life-giving Spirit
Christ accomplished redemption not merely to save us from sin, but even the more to impart Himself into us as the life-giving Spirit
Praise the Lord that in the universe there is a wonderful, heavenly, divine 'electricity'-the life-giving Spirit!
When we open our being and set our mind on the things above, this Spirit transmits the riches of the divine life into us
By the Lord's mercy, our aim in His recovery is not to pass on mere teachings, but to help the saints to experience the divine transmission
It is crucial for us to see the connection between the renewing of the new man and setting our mind on the things above
In the matter of arranging chairs in the meeting hall, a brother may be unhappy if the arrangement is not according to his opinion
If we open to the Lord when we are offended and tell Him that we love Him, something heavenly will be transmitted into us
The divisions caused by different opinions are a serious damage to the church life and cut the new man into pieces
The arbitrating peace of Christ brought in by the heavenly transmission keeps us in oneness and preserves the new man
With Christ as our Peacemaker, we now have vertical peace-peace between us and God- and horizontal peace-peace with one another
When we set our mind on the things above and experience the divine transmission, the peace of Christ arbitrates in our hearts
To say that the peace of Christ arbitrates within us means that it solves the problems caused by quarreling, fighting, or complaining
After a brother has such an argument with his wife, he may sense a call from the Lord deep within to pray and confess
When he asks her to forgive him, he experiences the peace of Christ arbitrating in the relationship between him and his wife
Through the arbitration of the peace of Christ, our problems are solved, and the friction between the saints disappears
In order to have a proper Christian walk and preserve the church life, we need the arbitrating peace of Christ
Only the heavenly Christ, the One who is interceding, ministering, and administrating, can solve our problems and resolve the friction
If a brother and his wife set their mind on Christ in the heavens, they will experience the divine transmission
As the saints see the revelation of Christ and experience the arbitrating peace of Christ, the church life will be preserved in freshness
If instead of praying for yourself to be ruled by the Lord you ask Him to rule others the Lord may say Let Me first set up My throne in you
Immediately after speaking about the peace of Christ arbitrating in us, Paul goes on to tell us to let the word of Christ dwell in us
The answer to this question is related to the basic principle revealed in the Bible that God's speaking requires oneness
The twelve tribes were arranged around the tent of meeting, and God spoke to the people from within the tent of meeting
God's speaking through the priests came out of the Holy of Holies, the center both of the tabernacle and of the temple
The evil intention of the Jewish religionists was to terminate the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, by crucifying Him
After His crucifixion, the Lord entered into the realm of resurrection, and in resurrection He became the Head of the Body
On the day of Pentecost Christ came down as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His disciples to make them members of His Body
How wonderful that we all are part of the enlargement of Christ, part of a universal man of which Christ is the Head and we are the members!
If we allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in us to maintain oneness and harmony, we shall be able to speak the word of God
On the day of Pentecost, Christ could come down upon the believers as the uniting Spirit and bring forth the church in a practical way
Although Christ nullified division to produce oneness, today's Christianity has destroyed the oneness and produced division
Of hearing Gods speaking many who sit in the chapels cathedrals and denominational buildings hear someone talk about social life or politics
Because God's word is full of light and it enlightens us, it can make us very clear about many different things
If we experience the word of God nourishing us and strengthening us, we shall be strong not only in spirit, but also in our soul
We have seen that the word of God enlightens, nourishes, quenches our thirst, strengthens, washes, builds up, perfects, and edifies
We all must confess that many times the Lord's word has come to us, but we did not give it adequate room within us
Suppose you are reading Matthew 19:16-22, where the Lord Jesus tells the young man to sell all that he has, give to the poor, and follow Him
In 316 Paul speaks of teaching and admonishing one another in psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to God
In the next message we shall go on to see that such an excellent situation is maintained by persevering in prayer
On the one hand, he is the enemy trying to defeat God; on the other hand, he is the adversary within God's realm seeking to cause damage
As those who take sides with God, we find that the whole universe is against us and, in particular, against our prayer
Many of the experiences we have with respect to prayer day by day prove that Satan opposes our prayer in every way possible
When we try to pray, we may also be disturbed by our children, by callers at the door, or by any animal pets there may be in the house
In their attempt to make excuses for themselves, they may point to all the responsibilities they must fulfill day by day
In light of the fact that there is great resistance to praying, let us now consider in a very practical way how to persevere in prayer
Our attitude should be that prayer is our most important business and that nothing should be allowed to interfere with it
No matter how many things we have to do each day, we can reserve at least a few minutes here and there for prayer
Unnecessary talk weakens our praying spirit, damages the praying atmosphere, and occupies time that can be used for prayer
When we set our mind on the things above during our times of prayer, we become a reflection of Christ's ministry in the heavens
When we pray, approaching the throne of grace, mercy and grace will become a river flowing in us and supplying us
The heavenly current, the divine electricity, is the Triune God as grace flowing out of the throne and into us
The more we pray, the more we experience being one with the Lord, and the more we enjoy His presence and have fellowship with Him
If you practice this for a long period of time, it will get easier and easier, for you will realize the rewards of praying
If we are constantly giving thanks to the Lord, do you think it will be possible for a brother to argue with his wife?
If we continually offer thanks to the Lord, the adversary will not be able to carry us off from our prayer life
In 4:6 Paul says, 'Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one'
If we are praying people, we shall utter thanks to the Lord, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, our speech will be with grace
If all the saints in all the churches make such a deal with the Lord, the recovery will be greatly enriched and uplifted
