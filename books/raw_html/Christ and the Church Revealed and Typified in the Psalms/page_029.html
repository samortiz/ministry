<p>The praise about the King should undoubtedly come first, but the praise concerning the queen should follow. Suppose you were the King: what part of the praise would make you happier? If I were the King, I would delight more in the praise about the queen. Christ is deeply gratified when we speak well of the local churches. Our praises must be not only about Christ, but many times about the queen, about the churches.<p>The queen is seen in gold of Ophir. Gold in typology signifies the divine nature. The church’s beauty is not in anything but the divine nature. She is royal and she is divine; she is in gold of Ophir, the best gold.<p>Then the Psalmist immediately turns to the queen and says, “Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house.” Instead of praises here we have an instruction to the queen which is exceedingly meaningful. Sometimes even the instructions given to the local churches are the same as praises in the ears of Christ. Why? Because the proper instructions given to the church make the church more really the church; therefore these too are praises. These are the instructions: Hearken and forget. All the local churches must learn how to hear and how to forget, how to hear the Spirit’s living, up-to-date speaking, and how to forget the past—the old relationships, the old ways, the old background. We must forget our people and our father’s house—“so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty.” The more we forget the past, the more beautiful we become in His eyes. Whenever I hear some people speak of their past, I have the sense of ugliness. If we would leave all the past and go on with the Lord in a new way, we would obtain beauty in the King’s eyes.<p>In verse 1 of this Psalm Christ is the King, in verse 2 He is a man, in verse 6 He is God, and in verse 11 He is the Lord. Because He is the Lord, He is worthy of our worship. “He is thy Lord; and worship thou him.” The Bible allows us to worship only God; anything or anyone that is not God, we should not worship. But here we have proper worship, because it is worship of the Lord. He is the King, He is a man, He is God, and He is the Lord—He is everything! Worship Him!<p>Verse 12: “And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.” Here we see that if the local church is in a proper condition, the people of the earth will come to it. Not only the poor and the lowly will come, but the rich and the honorable, on the one hand with a gift, and on the other hand to entreat the church’s favor. All these are praises about the church, but praises to Christ.<p>Now let us go on to verse 13: “The king’s daughter is all glorious within the inner part of the palaces: her clothing is of wrought gold.” Here we have not the daughters, but the daughter. In verse 9 we read that the queen was arrayed in gold, but here the clothing is of wrought gold. Gold, as we have seen, signifies the nature of God. Wrought gold, however, signifies Christ. Christ is not only gold, but wrought gold. He, with His divine nature, has undergone so many sufferings and has been dealt with in so many ways that the gold in Him has become wrought gold. Now this wrought gold, this Christ, has become our clothing, our righteousness, that we may stand justified in the presence of God. In the eyes of God, we are clothed with Christ as the acceptable righteousness. Christ is our righteousness before God.<p>Then verse 14: “She [the queen] shall be brought unto the king.” It does not say that she will be brought unto God, but unto the King. Wrought gold is sufficient for us to abide in the presence of God, but an added factor is necessary that we may stand in the presence of the King. “She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of broidered work.” This raiment of embroidered work is the pure and white linen mentioned as the righteousness of the saints in Revelation 19. What is this? The clothing of wrought gold, as we have seen, is Christ. The raiment of embroidered work here is also Christ. But the first is the objective Christ; the second is the subjective Christ. The objective Christ is our righteousness that we may stand in the presence of God; the subjective Christ is Christ Himself woven into our character, embroidered into our being, that we may stand before the King. The latter is not merely a garment that we put on, but one that is worked into us, stitch by stitch. Christ as the wrought gold is the righteousness put upon us—that is our justification. But following that, the Holy Spirit is working day by day to embroider Christ into us stitch after stitch. Thus, we will have another raiment. We will have two robes: the first is for the Father’s satisfaction; the second is for Christ’s satisfaction. It is by the second that we will be brought unto Christ. All these are definitions and descriptions of the church, but praises unto Christ.<p>I believe that nearly all of you have the wrought gold as your clothing. You have joyful assurance that you have been justified. But suppose that today you should be brought unto Christ. How would you feel? On one hand you have been justified, but on the other hand you are short of Christ being wrought into your being. There is a real shortage of the embroidery. From the day you were justified until today, how many stitches have been embroidered into your being?<p>All the brothers and sisters in the church life are indeed precious, and we praise the Lord for them. But in another sense everyone is a little needle. In the local churches we need many needles to do the embroidery work that Christ may be wrought into our being. Then we will have a raiment of embroidered work to satisfy Christ. In Revelation 19 we see that it is by this garment the bride is made ready for the wedding. This is the garment of broidered work mentioned in Psalm 45. Praise the Lord, we have the first robe, but we need the second that we may not only praise Christ, but be a praise to Christ.<p>Verses 14 and 15: “The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace.” The virgins also are the saints. They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing—they are all praises to Christ. They shall enter into the King’s palace. All the saints shall be brought into the New Jerusalem.<p>Now we come to the third section of the Psalm, the praise to the King about His children. Verse 16: “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.” On one hand we are the daughters and the virgins, but on the other hand we are the princes, the children of Christ, who will rule the earth under Him. In that day the earth in a practical way will be possessed to the uttermost by the King through all His princes. Then all the earth, all the saints, and the entire universe will say, “O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!”<p>Verse 17: “I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever.” How could Christ be on earth with all the people praising Him for ever and ever? It is through the princes, through His children, through us. To satisfy Him we are the virgins, the kings’ daughters. To rule for Him we are the princes. He will rule over all the earth through us as His princes and will be praised by all peoples through us.<p>I believe that this Psalm, Psalm 45, is the richest Psalm concerning Christ. No human mind could compose such a Psalm; it is far beyond human mentality. In such a short Psalm of only seventeen verses, how many aspects, how many points, how many items there are! What a good matter we have with which to bubble over!
