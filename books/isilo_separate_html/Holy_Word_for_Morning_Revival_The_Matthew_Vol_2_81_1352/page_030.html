Let me illustrate this from my own experience. I was born of a Southern Baptist mother. She taught us the stories of the Bible; however, at that time, although she was for Christianity, she herself definitely had not been saved....The professor of world history in the American Presbyterian college where I studied came from a Jewish background. He was a false believer, believing neither in the Bible nor in the resurrection of Christ....Some of the missionaries in China were modernists. Among both the Methodists and the Presbyterians, modernistic missionaries taught the people that the Bible was a book of fairy tales.</p><p>In Matthew 13 we see a picture of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. (Please refer to the chart on pages [30-31, RcV].) The kingdom of God covers everything from eternity past to eternity future. Between the two eternities there is time divided into various ages or dispensations. The first is the dispensation before law....The period of the Patriarchs, the fathers, extending to Moses.... Then comes the dispensation of law. Following this are two crucial dispensations, the first of which is the dispensation of grace, the church age, and the other, the dispensation of the kingdom, the millennium....The kingdom of the heavens covers only these two dispensations. In the dispensation of grace there are a number of complications, for the kingdom of the heavens has three aspects: the aspect of reality [chs. 5-7], the aspect of appearance [ch. 13], and the aspect of manifestation [ch. 24]. As long as the church is normal, it is the reality of the kingdom. In a normal situation the church equals the reality of the kingdom. The third aspect of the kingdom, the manifestation, is in the heavenly part, the upper part, of the millennium.</p><p>The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is today&#8217;s Christendom. It is dark, devilish, and even hellish, and we all must condemn it. Where are you? Are you in the appearance of the kingdom or in the reality of the kingdom?...All real Christians are in the church, but some...have become abnormal and defeated. You may say that you are neither in the world nor in Christendom, the appearance of the kingdom. You are in the church. But are you in the church in a normal situation or in an abnormal situation?...Thus, there are four classes of people: the normal believers, the abnormal [and defeated] believers, the false believers, and the worldly people....We want to be real and normal believers, real sons of the kingdom who...grow Christ by living a life according to the constitution [of the kingdom of the heavens].
