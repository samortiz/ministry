<h2 class="head2">The First Step&mdash;Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>We want to fellowship concerning the new way that the Lord has shown us. The new way includes three steps; the first step is preaching the gospel. After four years of thorough research, we have discovered that it is wrong to think that it is best to save more people when we knock on doors to preach the gospel. If our goal were merely to save people from eternal perdition, then it would be better to save more people. However, God wants to gain a group of people among His chosen ones to be the living members of the Body of Christ for the building up of the Body. This Body is not according to the common understanding of the church. In order for the new believers to become living members who are built up together as the Body of Christ, we should not preach a gospel that merely leads people to salvation. We should first consider how many people we can take care of and then preach the gospel to save people according to that number. If we are able to care for four or five people, we should gain seven or eight people through preaching the gospel and give proper care to these seven or eight people.</p>
<p>After one month of caring for the seven or eight new believers, some of them may begin to avoid us even to the extent of denying the Lord. At this point we can knock on more doors to gain more people. There should always be seven or eight people under our care. We must keep this principle. No matter where we go, we should always have seven or eight people under our care. This will not be too many people for us to nourish in home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Second Step&mdash;Nourishing the New Ones</h2>
<p>In caring for the new believers, we should nourish them immediately after they are baptized. Nourishing is the second step of the new way. Immediately after a person is baptized, we should have a home meeting to nourish him. In other words, we should nourish him on the day that he is baptized. It is difficult to understand the function of nourishing, and there are many important details related to nourishing. After we baptize a person, we should stay with him and nourish him in an organic way. We should not be formal; rather, we should calmly fellowship with him and explain that we call him a brother because he is a member of the household of God.</p>
<p>We must help the new believers know that the Lord Jesus died on the cross by giving up His body and shedding His blood for us in order to become our Savior. He passed through death, burial, and resurrection. In His resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit to enter into those who believe into Him and who receive Him. When we call on the Lord, the Spirit enters into us to give us a sweet, pleasant feeling. This is an experience we did not have before we were saved, and it proves that we are saved. The inward sense that the Lord gives when we call on His name is His operation within us. When we call on the Lord, we are breathing, just as we breathe in fresh air.</p>
<p>We should also let the new believers know that they have a spirit within them. God is Spirit, and we have a spirit; hence, we touch the Spirit and contact the Lord by calling on the name of the Lord. We should not use our mind, our thoughts, or our emotions to call; rather, we must call from our spirit. From the deepest part of our being we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; This kind of calling on the Lord is also praying.</p>
<p>While a new one is calling on the Lord, we should encourage him to express what is in his heart. If he feels that he wronged his mother in the past, he can call on the Lord and confess his sin. If he feels thankful for all that the Lord has arranged, he should offer thanks to the Lord. There is no formal rule concerning prayer. We simply help the new one know that the Lord is the Spirit, that he has a spirit, and that by exercising his spirit he can contact the Lord Spirit. We should lead him to pray in this way and then explain prayer to him. Then we should lead him to pray again and speak some more. In this way he will be nourished and perfected.</p>
<p>There are no regulations or forms in the home meetings. We should simply speak freely with the new ones. The meeting should not last longer than one and a half hours, but this is not a regulation. It is better to nourish a new one immediately after he is baptized than to wait and nourish him one week after his baptism. Furthermore, after a person is baptized, we should tell him that the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting is important and invite him to attend the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting to worship the Lord with us. We should even visit him before the Lord&rsquo;s Day. In this way we will have our third contact with him on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. It is easy to retain people if we practice in this way, and the ones we contact will be solid.</p>
<p>Next, we need to make appointments to have regular home meetings with the new ones. The new ones may be willing to have a meeting three times a week. They may want to meet every other day, or they may want to meet twice a week. In the home meetings we must get rid of the old way of meeting and the ordinances. We must not give the new ones the impression that there are regulations or rituals in the home meetings. From the first meeting we must give them the impression that Christian meetings are in the spirit and that everyone worships, prays, and calls on the Lord in spirit. Then when a new one is by himself, he will know how to pray in spirit and how to call on the Lord. In Matthew 18 the Lord said, &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst&rdquo; (v. 20). There are no rituals when we gather together. Sometimes we begin the meeting with prayer, at other times we may read a few verses, and at still other times we may sing a hymn. No matter how we begin the meeting, the prayer, reading, or singing must be living, not stiff. Let us take singing as an example. There is no need to sing a hymn from beginning to end; we may sing only one verse. The important thing is to be living. If we meet in this way, after two or three months the new ones will be able to do what we do. They will go out and help others in the same way that we helped them.</p>
<p>As we contact new ones, they will open themselves to us. Perhaps they will ask us questions. They may ask what they should do about the worship of ancestors. We must answer these questions seriously; we should not merely feed the new ones without teaching them. We may say, &ldquo;There is only one God in the universe, and He is Jesus in whom we have believed. He should obtain all our worship. We respect our ancestors, but we should not worship them, because worship is reserved for God alone. We worship only God, and we respect our ancestors and our parents. Chinese people often speak of doing great things to glorify our ancestors, and the best way to glorify our ancestors is to do honorable things. Only the Lord within us can give us the power to do honorable things and to make us upright people. This is the only proper way to glorify our ancestors.&rdquo; In this way we help the new ones with the truth.</p>
<p>The new ones may ask how to deal with their statues of Buddha. We must help them to see that their statues are idols, and that Satan, the devil, is behind every idol. On the one hand, we must speak the truth to them, and on the other hand, we must lead them to clear the past. We should quote some verses in the Bible and show them the verses. We may use Exodus 20:3-5, which says, &ldquo;You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make for yourself an idol, nor the form of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water beneath the earth. You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them.&rdquo; This will help the new ones grow in life. The new ones may ask us a question at any time, so we must be prepared before we go to visit them. If they do not have any questions, we can ask them a question. When we sing hymns, we should not be formal and stiff. We can even begin singing on the way to visit the new ones. We do not need to wait to enter their door before we sing. We must be living in everything we do.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
