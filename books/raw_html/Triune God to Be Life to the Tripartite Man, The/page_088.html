<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CROSS AND THE FELLOWSHIP<br>OF THE TWO SPIRITS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 2:1; Lev. 14:6-10, 14-18; Gal. 2:20a; Acts 16:6-10; 1 Cor. 1:18, 24-25; 2:2</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Hymns: #279, #631</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE TWO SPIRITS</H2><P>In this message we want to see how the cross is related to the divine fellowship, the fellowship of the two spirits. The divine fellowship is a particular capacity of the divine life. This fellowship has two aspects&#151;the vertical aspect by the Holy Spirit between us and the Triune God and the horizontal aspect by the human spirit among us believers.</P><P>Second Corinthians 13:14 is a verse which shows us the vertical aspect of the divine fellowship by the Spirit. This verse speaks of the grace of Christ, the love of the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The Triune God is referred to in this verse&#151;Christ, the Father, and the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, three things are covered&#151;grace, love, and fellowship. Just as the Spirit is the consummation of the Divine Trinity, fellowship is the consummation of love and grace. Love is the source, grace is the course, and fellowship is the application. The application is the consummation of the flow of the Divine Trinity.</P><P>In the Divine Trinity, the Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the application of what the Triune God is to us. This application is the consummation. If we have the Spirit, we have the Son and the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. With this Spirit there is the particular capacity of the divine fellowship. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the vertical aspect of the divine fellowship.</P><P>Philippians 2:1 speaks of the horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship, the "fellowship of spirit." This refers to the regenerated human spirit of the believers. The divine Spirit regenerated our human spirit with the divine life (John 3:6b), and now our human spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit (Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17). The divine Spirit is for vertical fellowship, and the human spirit is for horizontal fellowship. These two aspects of the divine fellowship are inseparable. If we have the vertical aspect with God, it will bring us to the horizontal aspect with our fellow believers. If we are in the horizontal aspect of the divinefellowship, we are also in the vertical aspect. These two aspects of the divine fellowship are woven together.</P>
