   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE PRACTICE OF THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AFTER CHANGING THE SYSTEM THE GOAL OF CHANGING THE SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we began changing the system, we spoke of our goals.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We said that we are changing the system to eliminate the traditional Christian way of meeting, to give the brothers and sisters the opportunity to exercise their organic function in the meetings, to support the brothers and sisters who meet regularly, to recover the ones who have not met for a long time, and to bring in new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By doing this, the church can multiply and increase, and the Lord s recovery will have a future.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, we will be able to gospelize Taiwan within the next few years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot say that we have been successful in these matters, but we are seeing the initial signs of success.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead of going backward, we are making progress, and we are increasing, not decreasing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>CHANGING THE SYSTEM NOT BEING EASY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since changing the system involves eliminating old habits and developing new habits, everyone is affected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Human beings are accustomed to old things and old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are subconsciously accustomed to and prefer old things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, it is difficult and inconvenient for us to begin something new.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, when I first wore Western suits, I felt that they were not as comfortable as Chinese gowns.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Western suits have a shirt with buttons on the collars and the sleeves, they need a necktie, and the trousers need to be worn with a belt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, I made the change, and I have been wearing Western suits for approximately forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now I do not feel that the Chinese gowns are comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am no longer accustomed to wearing them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows that we can become accustomed to new things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is very difficult for older people to change their ways.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In some families each member has a designated seat at the dinner table.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is difficult for an elderly person to sit in a different chair because he is accustomed to sitting in a particular chair, even though the chairs are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He must also sit at a particular distance from the table; otherwise, he is unable to eat his meal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This example shows that it is not easy to change our habits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we must sympathize with the older brothers and sisters because it is difficult for them to become accustomed to new things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is especially difficult for the older saints, because in changing the system we no longer emphasize the big meetings, and the small group meetings may not seem to be conducted in an orderly way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In spite of these changes, we are still in the process; we have not arrived at the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though our progress is not ideal, we are moving forward, not backward, and our numbers have increased, not decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are making progress in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TAKING CARE OF OUR ACTUAL SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though we have changed the system and set new goals, we are not ignoring our actual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In every country, whether it is Christian or non-Christian, most people do not work, and they do not go to school on the Lord s Day; they are free on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the Lord s Day is the best day for us to hold a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Over the past two centuries, Christianity has been a part of the Western influence that spread in the East.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The influence of Christianity has even affected all the countries in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, going to church to worship on the Lord s Day is a common practice, and Christmas, which is not according to the truth, is celebrated by Christians and non-Christians around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These are common practices.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone is accustomed to Christians worshipping on the Lord s Day; hence, we do not need to be an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He went to the synagogues to preach the gospel on the Sabbath Mark 1:21; Luke 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, He had no intention of keeping the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He clearly said that with His coming, the Sabbath is over Matt 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He also had no intention of worshipping God in the synagogues, but He went to the synagogues on the Sabbath to teach, to preach the gospel, to perform miracles, to cast out demons, and to heal the sick.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The apostles did the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The apostle Paul went to the synagogues in Gentile lands when he was on his ministry journeys.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In those days the Jews were not the only ones meeting in the synagogues.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many God-seeking Gentiles also met in the synagogues because of the Jewish influence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, when Paul went to a city, he would first go to the synagogue if there were no believers in that city Acts 9:20; 13:5, 14; 14:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul even went on the Sabbath 17:1-2 , but he had no intention of keeping the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He used the time, place, and environment to preach the gospel to people.</S>
