   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said clearly that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To worship God is just to contact God, to receive God, to enjoy God, and to experience God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, very few among the human race today know that God is a Spirit and that we have been created by God with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has ordained that we should contact Him and receive Him by the exercise of our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In God's creation there are principles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For instance, if we want to see different colors, we must use our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose I were blind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Could I hear the colors?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Could I smell them?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to see colors, we must use the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The principle is the same in relation to us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is real, yet some dare to say that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, if we do not exercise our spirit, surely there is no God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot touch God by means of our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Neither can we realize Him by our mentality, by our mind, for this is not the proper organ to use in contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we would worship Him, contacting Him and receiving Him, we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank God that in His creation He made three crucial, equally important matters the heavens, the earth, and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our spirit, therefore, is as crucial, as important, as the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Zechariah is a book unveiling Christ as God's center and circumference, yet this Christ is intimately involved with human history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not just anyone can know this One, but God's chosen people who realize that they have a spirit can know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In reading the book of Zechariah and in contacting the Christ revealed in this book, we must first know that we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we need to exercise our spirit to pray, saying, "Lord, I want to gain the Christ who is unveiled in Zechariah."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we exercise our spirit in this way, we will sense something living touching us deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why there is in this book such a verse as 12:1, a verse that charges us to pay full attention to the receiver within us, our human spirit, that we may receive the Christ revealed in the book of Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's purpose is for us to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, Christ is complex in all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is all-inclusive, because He is so many items.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, this all-inclusive Christ is very involved with history, politics, and governments.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can we understand such a One?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The only way is, after reading and studying, to turn ourselves to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we turn ourselves to prayer, we exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that moment, Christ imparts Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the heavenly, divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through this dispensing we receive Christ as our life, our light, our patience, our love, our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Though Zechariah was a young man, he knew the secret of contacting God to receive what God has revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all need to learn of him to exercise our spirit to receive God and to receive what He has revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us now proceed to consider the prophecy in chapter twelve.</S>
