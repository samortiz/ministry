   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Taking Care of the Disciples in an Easy Manner</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While the Lord was handing Himself over to the people, He took good care of His disciples in a very easy manner.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 18:8 Jesus said, I told you that I am; if therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was the fulfillment of the Lord s word in 17:12, where He said, Of those whom You have given Me, I have not lost one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We see here that under the suffering of the betrayal of His false disciple and the arrest of the soldiers, the Lord still took good care of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This reveals His easy manner in passing through the process of death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was not at all frightened by the environment of death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>E. Without Any Resistance</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His willingness to die was also proved by the incident of Peter s cutting off the right ear of Malchus, the slave of the high priest 18:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter, a very rough brother, did not know the purpose of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although he intended to help the Lord, he only caused trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus said to him, Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord told him to sheath his sword because He had come to fulfill the purpose of the Father, which was to give Himself as life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord willingly took the cup from the Father; He was not forced to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the Lord was not forced to die; He willingly delivered Himself to death so that He could release His life to bring forth much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 18:10 and 11 we see that the Lord did not offer any resistance to His arrest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By delivering Himself up to death, the Lord proved that He was life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without death, how could He have proved that He was life?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord became a man, He firstly proved that He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From chapter one through chapter seventeen, the Lord was among men proving that He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now, in chapters eighteen and nineteen, He was going into death to prove that He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we know that the Lord is life?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is by His going into death and not being subdued by it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord was not frightened, troubled, controlled, or governed by death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we read these two chapters, we discover that when the Lord went into death, He conquered and subdued it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are many proofs in these two chapters that the Lord conquered and subdued death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Firstly, the Lord was not frightened by death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord knew that the religious with the political ones were coming to arrest Him and put Him to death, He was not fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He went boldly to meet them and delivered Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Secondly, the Lord was composed when death came to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the face of death, He took care of His disciples in an easy manner telling His arrestors to let His disciples go.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a group of policemen came to arrest you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Would you be at ease?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in every scene depicted in these two chapters, the Lord was at ease; He was neither moved nor influenced by the fear of death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, the Lord was composed before the high priest and before Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was so much at ease that He was not troubled even when He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While He was on the cross, He could even take care of His mother.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Troubles were heaped upon Him during that time of suffering, yet the record discloses that He was always composed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord s life was a life that could subdue and conquer death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He went into death by crucifixion and came out of it by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What better proof can there be than this that He is the life that death cannot influence, subdue, or conquer?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He conquered death because He is the resurrection life 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John 18 and 19 show how strong and powerful the Lord was when He went into death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When death was threatening, He was strong, powerful, and not subdued by its influence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He could go into death and come out of it without being hurt by it or held by it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What a proof that He is life!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>EXAMINED IN HIS DIGNITY BY MANKIND A. As the Passover Lamb Examined</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord was examined in His dignity by mankind 18:11 19:16 , being examined as the Passover lamb was examined Exo 12:2-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus was crucified on the Passover as the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the type, before the Passover lamb was killed, it had to be examined to determine whether or not it had any blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The examination of Christ by mankind was the fulfillment of this type.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After Pilate examined Him, he declared, I find no fault whatever in him 18:38; 19:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was no blemish in this Passover lamb; He was fully qualified to be the lamb for God s people.</S>
