<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Crucified to Accomplish<br>the All-inclusive Death for Redemption</H2><P>The Lord Jesus was crucified in order to accomplish the all-inclusive death for redemption (John 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:3b; Heb. 2:14b; John 3:14; 12:31-33; Gal. 6:14; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20a; 5:24; John 12:24). The Lord Jesus died an all-inclusive death, and His death dealt with six main negative items: sin (including sins&#151;John 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:3b), Satan (Heb. 2:14b; John 3:14), the world (John 12:31-33; Gal. 6:14), the old man (Rom. 6:6), the flesh (Gal. 5:24), and the "I" (Gal. 2:20a), which includes our natural life. In addition, the Lord's all-inclusive death accomplished one positive thing: it released the divine life from within His humanity (John 12:24). Thus, the Lord's death was at least sevenfold in its accomplishments. The Lord Jesus' all-inclusive death became a strong factor in His consummated triune Being. Through such a death, He obtained an eternal redemption for His redeemed people (Heb. 9:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Resurrected to Bring Humanity into Divinity,<br>Making the Believers of Christ<br>Sons of God and Members of Christ</H2><P>After He passed through death, the Triune God entered into resurrection. In resurrection, He brought humanity into divinity, making the believers of Christ sons of God and members of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12; Rom. 12:5). To bring humanity into divinity is to bring man into God. The incarnation of the Triune God brought God into man, and His resurrection brought man into God. Through this kind of traffic, a wonderful mingling takes place. Now, in His resurrection, God is mingled with man and man is mingled with God. Thus, man and God, God and man, are one. How wonderful this is! In this mingling, God made the believers of Christ sons of God. These sons of God are human and divine. God can say to His believers, "I am divine and human," and His believers can reply, "Praise You, Lord. You are divine and human, and we are human and divine." This was accomplished through His resurrection.</P><P>Whenever we live in resurrection, we bring humanity into divinity. This means that when we live in resurrection, we bring ourselves into God, and when we do not live in resurrection, we are outside of God. Thus, resurrection is still going on today. Romans 6:4-5 says that we were buried through baptism into death and were raised to walk in newness of life (v. 4), which is the likeness of Christ's resurrection (v. 5). As we are living in resurrection, we are one with God and are being brought into God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Consummated to Be the Compound,<br>All-inclusive, Indwelling Spirit</H2><P>Through the steps of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God has been consummated to be the compound, all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit (Exo. 30:25). This Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God. In Exodus 30, an ointment was prepared, and this ointment was called a compound ointment because it was made from oil compounded with four different spices (vv. 22-25). This compound ointment is a type of the compound Spirit, who is the Triune God compounded with humanity, the all-inclusive death of Christ, the all-powerful resurrection of Christ, and the transcending ascension of Christ. This compound Spirit is the consummated Triune God.</P>
