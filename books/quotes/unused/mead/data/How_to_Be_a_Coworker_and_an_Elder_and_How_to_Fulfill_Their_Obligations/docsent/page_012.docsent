   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: O Lord, thank You that You are the Lord who speaks and who gives to us the Spirit, even the unlimited Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We believe that You will speak here tonight and will give us the unlimited Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are not eloquent, we cannot speak, and we do not know how to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Your word has been spoken, but we do not get it; Your Spirit has been poured out here, but we cannot receive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are indeed utterly pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nevertheless, Your mercy is rich and Your grace is abounding.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We look to You for Your rich mercy and Your abounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Besides this, we have no way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>O Lord, we are a group of pitiful ones who gather at Your feet waiting for Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the preceding message we saw that, as co-workers and elders, we must first know Christ in four particular items.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then after knowing Him, we have to experience and enjoy Him that we may gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But how do we experience, enjoy, and gain Him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We experience, enjoy, and gain Him Phil 3:8 according to His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages, that is, according to all that He has done and is doing in His three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. In the Second Stage, the Stage of His Inclusion, from His Resurrection to the Degradation of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first stage of Christ's full ministry was the stage of His incarnation, from His birth through His human living to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second stage is the stage of His inclusion, from His resurrection to the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to see why we call it the stage of inclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His first stage He possessed only two elements divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was a little more complicated than what He had prior to His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before His incarnation, in eternity past, He possessed only one element divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From the time of His incarnation, when He put on human nature, He possessed humanity in addition to His divinity; hence, He had two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After His death and resurrection, more elements were added to Him in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His resurrection, the last Adam, Christ in the stage of His incarnation, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This "becoming" made Him the Christ of inclusion, with the divine element and the human element included in Him, with the element of His death and its effectiveness included in Him, and with the element of His resurrection and its power included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, in the Old Testament there is the type of the holy anointing ointment Exo 30:22-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The holy anointing ointment was not merely oil, which was just one of the ingredients; it was an ointment compounded with many ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The holy anointing ointment typifies the compound, life-giving Spirit whom Christ became in the stage of His inclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This light was hidden from us until 1954 when we saw it clearly through The Spirit of Christ, a book written by Andrew Murray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapter five of his book, Andrew Murray indicates that in the Spirit of the glorified Jesus today there is not only His human nature but also His death with its effectiveness and His resurrection with its power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1954, in Hong Kong, I released a message saying that in the Spirit of the glorified Jesus there are the divine element, the human element, the element of His death with its effectiveness, and the element of His resurrection with its power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these elements can be likened to the ingredients in a dose which contains a germ-killing element like the effectiveness of death and a life-supplying element like the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The elements contained in the Spirit of Christ are bountiful and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the stage of His inclusion Christ accomplished three great things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, He was begotten as God's firstborn Son; second, He became the life-giving Spirit; and third, He regenerated His believers for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Apparently, these great things are quite simple, but actually they are very complicated.</S>
