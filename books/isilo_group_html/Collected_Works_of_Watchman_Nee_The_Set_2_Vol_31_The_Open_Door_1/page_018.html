The address is 7 Kwai-Shu-Fang, Kwai-Shu Road, North Shore. Brother Hsu is living there now. Every Saturday afternoon at three o'clock we have the prayer meeting. On Lord's Day we have a gospel meeting at nine o'clock. Due to the war, we temporarily stopped these meetings. We have not, however, stopped the bread-breaking meeting held at three o'clock on the Lord's Day. There are only a dozen or so brothers and sisters attending, and recently the number has decreased. But we understand that we are here to build up the Body of Christ and not to build up a meeting. We are all well through God's protection. Thank Him! Greetings to you in the Lord. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters meeting in Hankow under the Lord's name.</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Rong-fei<br />October 16<br />(Brother Yu has left Ning-Po by now&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I did not receive your postcard dated November 16 until the twenty-sixth. Thank you for remembering me in the Lord. From the local newsletter in Shanghai, we learned of your move to Hankow. May the Lord preserve you in peace. We moved from Ning-Po to the villages for refuge on the fifteenth because planes bombed the train station of Ning-Po on the twelfth. The station is very close to my home, and my whole family was frightened. The bombing shattered and damaged over a hundred buildings and killed over a hundred people. We have been preserved in peace according to the Lord's promise. Presently, the table meeting has stopped. In Chen-Po-Du we have meetings on the Lord's Day afternoon where we pray and remember the Lord. Sister Yu-yin and her aunt, as well as senior Sister Chen, are all here. We should thank the Lord for the comfort He has provided us here in terms of clothing, food, and shelter. He is indeed our Shepherd, and we have no want! Sisters Ai-chuen, Wang Ho-yueh, and senior Sister Bi are scattered in the villages and are safe in the Lord. Brother Yu Rong-fei returned to the villages after the school suspended classes. Presently, we may be separated through earthly tribulations, but we look forward to the Lord's soon return when we will never be separated again in Him forever. What a joy that will be! Greetings to you in the Lord. Greetings also to Sister Peace and Phoebe. Sister Yu-yin asks me to send you her greetings also.</p><p>Sister Yu-hwa<br />November 28<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Family Letter to Sister Hsieh Jing-wen, Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear Jing-wen:</p><p>In the future when you write to me you should mail to: Hwa-Ying Pharmacy, Dah-Shang Bridge, Shao-Shing. You should not mail directly to Tsao-Miao Lane. I have decided to move to Chou-Shan. There are brothers there who can accommodate us. My family will not be going alone; quite a number of sisters are going the same way with us. Personally, I will still travel in and out of the city and will be back and forth. Most of the time I will be in the Hwa-Ying Pharmacy. I am saying this only in anticipation of change. Whether or not we will put this into effect depends on the God in whom we trust and who is guiding our footsteps. May the loving Father and the living God spare us from fleeing for refuge. Peace to you.</p><p>Your father (Hsieh Tse-yuen)<br />November 17<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
