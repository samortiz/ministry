   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE METHODS THAT WE SEE TODAY The Need for a Service Office</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If there were only seven or eight believers in a local church or if there were only two or three gathered into the name of the Lord, we would not need a business office.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If there are a good number of saints in a locality, one hundred, several hundred, or more than a thousand, it would be difficult and confusing without a business office.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the first problem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we want to see something regarding the methods the apostles used to do things in their time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Principle of the Record Book</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From my point of view, the second thing that I want to specifically point out is the principle of the record book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the principle of the widows being enrolled in the record book.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the record book were a method instead of a principle, then God would have told us the length and the thickness of it and its format.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But God described the record book in a very brief way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, you are able to know that there is a principle of the record book.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If anything in God's Word is described with only one phrase without any details, then you know that that matter is a principle in the Bible and is, therefore, not in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man's Memory Not Reliable</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why do we need a record book?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need it because man's memory is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>People depend on their memory to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a person's memory is not reliable, he will not be able to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If he sometimes remembers and sometimes forgets, what shall he do in order to carry out anything?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, I recognize that some brothers and sisters among us have very good memories.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if one day your memory were faulty, what would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is recorded in the record book is likely to be more accurate than what is in your memory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not Easy to Find People</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, even if one's memory is good, it may be difficult to find him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The one who is taking care of this matter may remember everything, but if he has gone away, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there were a record book, we could open it and read and understand the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Timothy was in the church in Ephesus, he had to take care of the churches in the surrounding area, establishing elders to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Timothy went to Rome and Titus went to Jerusalem, what would have been done concerning the problems of the widows if there had been no record books?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Maybe they would have had to send a person to Rome to ask Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If Timothy had said, "I have forgotten what I did.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not know whether I moved one from Pergamos to here or one from Thyatira to there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have forgotten.''</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then what would have been done?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If record books were there, no one would need to remember, and anyone could open them up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we need to see that church records and the keeping of records in the church are important.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the principle of the record book.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You cannot say that you or I will remember.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The whole point is to write it down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It does not matter who it is; once time passes, even the one with the best memory can forget.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the world there are not that many people who can still remember things accurately after many years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if you can remember, if suddenly you cannot be found, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the principle of having the record book comes in. The New Testament does not show us how to write things down in this record book or what kind of records we should keep, but the Lord has shown us that keeping records should be our principle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, many church matters need to be recorded in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason, we hope that any church with a considerable number of people would have a business office.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you do not want to use this name, there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You can call it whatever name you choose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Shanghai it is called the service office because deacons are the ones taking care of affairs there all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We want to keep this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not want to be like many Protestants who pay attention to these titles; we only want to do things according to the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the church it is acceptable to call it the service office or the business office.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The business office is a secular term; the service office is a name given by us.</S>
