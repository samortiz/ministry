   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS OUR PEACE OFFERING 2 Scripture Reading: Lev 3:1-5; 7:11-15, 28-34; 16:3, 5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we get into the details of the enjoyment of Christ as our peace offering, we need to see something concerning the basic divine principles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We who are believers in the Lord Jesus all know that God is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is not only our Creator, He is also our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order for Him to be our portion, He has to be our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even He has to be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you spend some time to cover all the sixty-six books of the Bible, you can pick up many wonderful nouns and terms and names ascribed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, God intends to be our Father, our comfort, and our encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He intends to be our light, our life, our strength, our power, and even our authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible these few words are really troublesome: strength, might, power, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Especially in the New Testament these four words are used.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is our might.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is our power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is our authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you go further you would see that God is our energy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is really difficult to define these words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is difficult to know the difference between energy and strength, between strength and might, between might and power, between power and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is really hard for people to differentiate between these terms, but the Bible has differentiated these things because God is everything to us in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is everything to us our clothing, our food, and even our beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sisters, when you are adorning yourself, don t beautify yourself by other things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have to beautify yourself by God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has to be your beauty and your glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He also has to be your virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In his Epistle Peter tells us that God has called us by His glory and virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The preposition by can also be translated to.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It has a double meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that God has called us by His glory and virtue to His glory and virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although it may be difficult for us to understand the difference between glory and virtue, He is these two items to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is so many things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But although God is so many things to us, do you know how to participate in and to enjoy God as your portion?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a very practical matter, yet through all the generations it has been missed and lost among God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I don t have the assurance that many of you realize the biblical and revealed way to participate in God as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Colossians 1:12 says that the Father has qualified us for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word portion actually means lot.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the children of Israel entered into the good land, each one was allotted a portion of land.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That became his lot, his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>POSSESSING GOD BY ENJOYING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is our portion, but the poor thing is that we don t know how to possess the portion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even the word possess is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually we don t know how to enjoy our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may possess our portion and yet still not know how to enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example you may possess a lot of groceries in your refrigerator, yet you don t know how to enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible reveals to us that the real possessing is the real enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you don t know how to enjoy God as your portion, you surely don t know how to possess God as your portion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are still fellowshipping concerning the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why have the Christian meetings all become Christian services?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Christian meetings are very biblical, but the Christian services are something traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christian service is not such a good term.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is a term in the degradation among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Christian meetings degraded, they all became a kind of service.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This happened because the believers didn t know how to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because they didn t enjoy God within them, when they came together, they came with nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They came empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They had God only in name.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They didn t have the very God in reality for their enjoyment.</S>
