<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE IN 1 AND 2 TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:15-16; 4:7-8; 2 Tim. 2:2; 1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 4:2; 1:12; 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:1, 18, 7-8; 1 Tim. 1:14; 2 Tim. 4:22</h1><p>The arrangement of the order of the Epistles of the New Testament reveals the sovereignty of the Lord. By studying these particular books carefully, we can realize that the Epistles, from Romans to Jude, are divided into two main groups. The thirteen books from Romans to Philemon are the first group, and the eight books from Hebrews to Jude are the second group. The first group of Epistles gives a complete structure of the definition of the Body of Christ, whereas the second group serves as supplementary books. With good writings there is often the need of a supplement. The important matters that are hard to position in the main line are placed at the end in a supplement. The supplement is important and necessary, but it is not in the main line that runs through the writing.<h2 class=head1>ROMANS TO 2 THESSALONIANS BEING MAINLY ON LIFE</h2><p>The first main group of Epistles, which speaks of the definition of the Body of Christ, is further divided into two sections. The first section contains nine books, from Romans to 2 Thessalonians. Then from 1 Timothy to Philemon there are another four books forming a second section. The church as the Body of Christ needs two things, life and practice. Even our own physical body needs both life and exercise. For our body to do anything, it first needs life. If the body does not have life, it can do nothing. However, even if it has life, it still needs proper exercise. In order to drive a car, for example, we need the human life. A dog or a cat with its own respective life can never drive a car. Only the higher life is adequate to drive a car. However, this does not mean that as long as we have the human life, we can drive a car. There is still the need of practice and exercise.<p>The first nine books in the first section, Romans to 2 Thessalonians, deal mostly with the life side. They tell us what the nature, life, function, responsibility, and consummation of the Body of Christ are. These five matters characterize the different aspects of the life side. These books tell us how we receive life, how life grows and works within us, and how this life with its nature enables us to function in the Body and bear responsibility. Lastly, the consummation of this life is the second coming of the Lord Jesus. This is all on the side of life.<h2 class=head1>FIRST TIMOTHY THROUGH PHILEMON BEING MAINLY ON PRACTICE</h2><p>Following the life side, there is the side of practice and exercise. With life we need exercise, practice, and learning. After being taught and becoming experienced in practice, we must take the responsibility to teach others, because with life there must be practice, and practice includes teaching and learning. The four books from 1 Timothy through Philemon present practice with teaching and learning.<p>The Epistles from Romans to 2 Thessalonians seem to cover everything and be complete. They tell us how we were sinners condemned before God, how we were justified and saved, how originally we were dead but were regenerated and made alive, how we received Christ into us as our life, and how this life has a consummation. It seems that everything has been covered, and they are short of nothing. However, without 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, we would have the life of the church, but we would not know how to practice the church life. We would not know, for example, how to have elders and deacons. To remove these four books from the Bible would be a great loss.<p>The book of Acts gives us a history, not a definition, of the church practice. In Acts some elders are established, and in Acts 6 some persons are appointed, but just by Acts alone we do not know that they are deacons. In addition, we do not know what kind of persons the elders should be and in what way they should be established. Without 1 Timothy through Philemon we are almost in darkness concerning the practice of the church. Philippians 1:1 mentions the overseers and deacons in the church, but there is no record of how they were produced or what kind of persons they were. Therefore, following the section concerning the matters of life, there are four books dealing with the practical side of the church life.<p>First Timothy 3:15 says, “But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God.” This verse reveals the subject of these four books. Here the apostle Paul says that he may delay, but in principle the Lord is also delaying His coming. While the Lord is delaying His coming, these few books help us to know how to conduct ourselves in the church life. Although many matters are covered in the books through 2 Thessalonians, including the Lord’s coming, the Lord did not intend to come immediately. If the Lord had intended to return right away, there would have been no need for these four books. While the Lord delays His coming and is keeping us on the earth to be the church, these four books tell us how to conduct ourselves in the house of God.<p>Even though these books give us instructions about the practice of the church life, many people do not pay adequate attention to them and thus miss the mark, making the secondary things to be primary, even making the last things to be first. The foremost matter that these four books speak of is how to conduct ourselves in the house of God. This is a matter of practice.
