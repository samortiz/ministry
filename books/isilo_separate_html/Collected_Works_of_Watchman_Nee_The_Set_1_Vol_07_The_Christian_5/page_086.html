The Gospel of Matthew depicts Him as the King; the Gospel of Mark, as the Servant; the Gospel of Luke, as Man; and the Gospel of John, as God. One of our frequent failures in reading the Gospels is to pay brief attention to the words and deeds of Christ only. Indeed, His words and deeds are enough to capture our hearts. But to do only this is a failure. Seldom do we see Christ Himself, and seldom do we behold the Christ that we ought to behold. The reason we study these writings on Christ's words and deeds is that we would know the living Christ.</P><P>This being the case, let us spend some time to meditate on the subject. First, let us meditate on the inspired writings of God. Next, we have to meditate on the Christ who is revealed through these writings. We should sit back quietly, open up the Holy Book, and read a portion of the record of our Lord's excellent life on earth. We should meditate on His wisdom, grace, patience, love, beauty, gentleness, tenderness, meekness, and sympathy. We should meditate on Him until His life jumps out of the pages and our hearts burn in love for Him. He is precious, He is lovely, and He is refined. We should meditate on Him until His fine acts come alive before our eyes and deeply attract us, to the extent that we would desire Him alone and would feel at a loss with anything less than a full possession of Him and a full taste of His love. We should meditate on His acts, to the extent that our life bears the same kindness and grace. We see the Lord's wisdom in His answer concerning the source of His authority, and we see the wonder of His judgment in His answer concerning paying tribute to Caesar. All His acts are fully lovable. Those who meditate on Him will not be disappointed. May we know our Savior more and more.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FULL CARE</H2><P>Coarseness is something that has no place in godly living. Before believers allow God's grace to work in their lives, they have many hard and unrefined areas. To be negligent, to be inconsiderate of others, and to neglect caring for others are the common illnesses of the saints. However, these are things that even the most spiritual saints often neglect. If a person is only slightly careless, he will find himself unable to tend to everything properly. All those who are unable to control their mind properly have this problem. To be negligent is a characteristic of those who do not have full control of their mind. These people are mostly undisciplined in their mind. Their thoughts are complicated, and they themselves do not have the ability to concentrate and to integrate ideas. Since they are careless in their considerations, in many areas they become negligent and show impropriety in the way they treat others and handle matters.</P><P>Another major reason for negligence is to pay too much attention to oneself. Because a person cares too much for his own convenience, he neglects others' needs. While others are asleep, they make noises and disturb others unthinkingly. These noises may even be from praying or studying the Bible! When meetings are called, they keep others waiting for a long time while they tend to their own private affairs. In order to maintain their own name, they open their mouth to slander others. In order to preserve their own interests, they extort and cause damage to others. Because these ones do not have the spirit of the cross, without realizing it they neglect others and do not think of others. Sometimes such behavior can even come from a sincere heart! Yet they are bound to cause others embarrassment. Many times we think that negligence is just frankness, simplicity, and informality! Yet coarseness is never the fruit of the Holy Spirit. What the saints should seek after is that in everything they would be careful, considerate, sensitive not to cause others inconvenience, not to leave their own self-will unchecked, and not to embarrass others. The Lord's cross and the Holy Spirit have a grinding power which can cause the most coarse person in the world to become tender. However, in order to be careful in everything and to be sensitive and caring, there must be the real dying to the self. Only then will a person not care for his own interest and be willing to suffer and to seek for others' benefit in all things. We should exercise our will to control our mind, so that we will not become negligent unconsciously of others' needs. "So then death operates in us, but life in you" (2 Cor. 4:12). The Lord's committing of His mother to the care of others (John 19:26-27) is a real example to us!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_085.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_087.html">Next</a> </body></html>
