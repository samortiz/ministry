The authority of the pope increased daily to the extent that he ruled over not only the Catholic Church but also various countries in Europe. In the tenth century, toward the end of the Dark Ages, the enthronement of the kings in almost every European country had to be endorsed by the Roman pope. As a result, the higher the papal authority was, the greater the darkness was. It was at this moment that God raised up a reaction on earth through Francis of Assisi. Francis was the son of a wealthy merchant and had an [396] abundance of possessions. But he was so touched by the Lord that he gave up all that he had and willingly became poor, going around preaching the gospel. He could be considered the first one in church history who voluntarily became poor. Because the degradation of the age was so great and there was so much emphasis on material enjoyment, when Francis of Assisi was raised up, many were attracted to follow him and be like him.

By the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries there was still this kind of Christian. One example is Francis of Assisi. He was from a wealthy family and had received a great inheritance from his father. One day in his meditation a revelation came to him. He saw [438] that a person will lose God if he gains wealth and will have no room for wealth if he gains God. Francis had found the goal of human life, which is just God Himself. He realized that if he wanted anything outside of God, he would lose God. That day the Lord told him, \u201cSell all your possessions.\u201d In a determined manner he responded, \u201cLord, I will sell all my possessions to follow You.\u201d "}, {"book_ref": "CWWL, 1950\u20131951, vol. 1, \"The Pursuit of a Christian,\" ch. 1: The Pursuit of a Christian ", "page_num": "437", "snippet": " Another time, when Francis was meditating before God, someone teased him, saying that he was thinking about getting married.

Many Christians were touched by him and responded in the same way. This is the Christian model and goal. If God\u2019s children want to gain God, they must forsake their material wealth and willingly become poor.

They said that in order to receive salvation and become a Christian, one had to be sincere. He should not lie, debauch, or commit adultery. But the church has never been bold enough to proclaim, as the Lord Jesus proclaimed, that one should forsake everything to follow the Lord. I am not saying that there have been no real followers of the Lord. Thank the Lord, there has never been an interruption in the line of true Christians. First, we have St. Francis of Assisi. He was the son of a rich man, but he sold all of his possessions and gave to the poor. He began to practice a life of voluntary poverty. Later in Moravia God raised up Count Zinzendorf. He was a nobleman, but he opened up his estate to receive saints from everywhere. The result was the establishment of the Moravian Brethren. After this there was Sister Eva, a German, who also took the way of voluntary poverty. In the last century the Brethren were raised up by God. Among them many truths were recovered. Many leading brothers among them, such as Darby and Kelly, practiced voluntary poverty. They forsook everything to follow the Lord. This is the reason the Lord could have a way through them. In 1922 when I was just saved, I saw this truth, and I began to practice forsaking everything to follow the Lord.

One layer is the material world, and the other is the world of Christianity. The enjoyment of material things in the United States is a great attraction, and it occupies almost everyone. Furthermore, the religious atmosphere of Christianity is prevailing, and it covers many Christians. On the evening before my departure I fellowshipped with a few brothers and sisters who are participating in the service of the church in San Francisco. I emphasized that in order to work out a testimony for the Lord in the United States, we must guard against these two layers of the world. Even if we are able to overcome the snare of the material world, the trap of the religious world of Christianity is still ahead of us. We need to be strengthened to overcome these two layers of the world before we can be a strong testimony for the Lord in the United States. In a place permeated by the atmosphere of Christianity, only a strong testimony can produce a contrasting effect.

Eventually, it fell to such a low degree that reactions rose up within the Catholic Church. One of those who reacted was Francis of Assisi. He was dissatisfied with the outward riches of the church. He was originally a rich man, or at least the son of a rich man. Within a few days, he sold everything and gave it to the poor. He began to practice a life of voluntary poverty. However, the things he wrote are unreadable. We may tolerate a line or two of his writings, but by the third line, they are intolerable. Although we cannot tolerate his writings, the practice of voluntary poverty is nevertheless right.

Darby and over fifty other believers sold their all to serve the Lord. Their ministry became a powerful one. St. Francis of Assisi was another example from the Catholic Church. He was burdened for the gospel yet did not have the gift of an evangelist. His speaking was uncouth. Later he retreated to the wilderness and the seashore to preach to the birds and the fish. Originally, he was a very rich man or the son of a rich man. Within a matter of days, he sold all he had, gave it to the poor, and lived a life of voluntary poverty. The order which he founded became one of the three main monastic orders in the Catholic Church. Anyone who wished to join the order had to sell his all before he could be admitted. These men were not that clear about the gospel, but their practice of voluntary poverty is commendable. Count Zinzendorf of the Moravian movement was another example of this kind of living; he lived before Darby. His church received great attention because of his political [53] prominence. His main work was done in eastern Europe, not in western Europe. He was a wealthy landlord, yet he offered up everything he had to serve the Lord.

Even her beauty was stripped away by the Lord. To man she was a pitiable sight, but within her was indescribable joy. Count Zinzendorf, George M\u00fcller, and Saint Francis of Assisi all lived their lives this way. They were willing to drop everything to follow the Lord. As a result, they all satisfied the inward demand and achieved inward peace. The word forsake means to let go. This shows us how severe Christ\u2019s demand within us is.

You may ask, \u201cSince He indwells me, He [366] is already here. Why do you say that He will manifest Himself?\u201d Because the indwelling Christ quite often disappears. Although He indwells you, whether or not He appears or disappears from your inner sense depends on whether or not you listen to His words. All the brothers and sisters, whether they are young or old, have some experience of this. Once when I was feeling a little lonely, I said to myself, \u201cI would like to go to see Brother John and talk to him.\u201d But the indwelling Christ said no. Then I said, \u201cHow about if I go to see Brother Francis?\u201d When the indwelling One again said no, I asked, \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d The Lord said, \u201cStay with Me.\u201d Who is this \u201cMe\u201d? He is the indwelling Christ. If at such a time I say, \u201cAmen, Lord,\u201d the presence of the indwelling Lord will shine and be so sweet and strengthening. He will bring in a great deal of light. But, if when I heard Him say no, I did not care for His word and I still went to see the brothers, His presence would disappear, the darkness within me would be prevailing, I would lose my direction, and there would be no peace."}, {"book_ref": "Life-study of Romans (2nd ed.), msg. 68: God Condemning Sin in the Flesh That We May Be in the Spirit ", "page_num": "682", "snippet": "The Bible refers to the believers as saints.

How can I say that I am a saint?\u201d If you talk like this, your condition is still that of a pitiful sinner.
