<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Cross of Christ</H2><P>The cross of Christ is another means of carrying out the genuine Christian living (Gal. 6:14-15; 1 Cor. 2:2; Gal. 2:20; 3:1). The real significance of the cross of Christ is His all-terminating plus life-releasing death. He terminated all the negative things in the whole universe. He also released the divine life from within Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Union and Mingling<br>of the Believers with the Triune God</H2><P>The union and mingling of the believers with the Triune God is the fifth means of the genuine Christian perfection (Matt. 28:19; Eph. 4:4-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Joining of the Believers<br>to the Lord as One Spirit</H2><P>First Corinthians 6:17 says that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit. This joining of the believers to the Lord is another means of our Christian perfection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Regenerated Spirit<br>of the Believers</H2><P>Another means of Christian perfection is the regenerated spirit of the believers (Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). James never says a word concerning our spirit. When I began to minister in the United States, many people told me that they had never heard before that they had a human spirit. Three particular verses in the New Testament show the divine Spirit and the human spirit. Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. John 3:6 says that what is born of the Spirit is spirit. Finally, John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Discernment of the Believers' Spirit<br>from Their Soul</H2><P>Some argue that the spirit is the same as the soul. Hebrews 4:12, however, speaks of the division of the spirit from the soul. First Thessalonians 5:23 says clearly that man is composed of three parts: body and soul and spirit. If you do not know the difference between your spirit and your soul, how can you be spiritual? How can you experience Christ as life? If you do not know your human spirit, you can never know the spiritual things.</P>
