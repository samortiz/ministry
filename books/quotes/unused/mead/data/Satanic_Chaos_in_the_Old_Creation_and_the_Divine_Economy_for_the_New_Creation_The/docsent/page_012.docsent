   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Enosh was weak, frail, and fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By calling on Jehovah's rich name, this fragile man received His rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This certainly is something of the divine economy.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Enoch walked with God and was taken away by God Gen 5:21-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although man became fallen and was driven out of the garden of Eden, a fallen man could still walk with God and eventually could be taken away to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This also is something of the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Noah not only walked with God but also prepared an ark for the carrying out of the divine economy Gen 6:8-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ark typified Christ and was for the salvation of humankind.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>to Please Him</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Genesis 8:20-22, Noah built an altar and offered burnt offerings typifying Christ to God to please Him so that the earth could be kept in its systems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we also should build an altar and pray; that is, we should come to the cross and offer Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we offer Christ to God, we should pray, "O God, forgive our country.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The immorality and chaos are offenses to You, the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We ask You to remember the cross on which Your Son, our Lord Jesus, died."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To come to the cross and offer Christ to God is the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do this, we may help to save the country in which we live.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>and Killing His Brother Abel</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is likely that Adam had many sons, but only two, Abel and Cain, are used in the Bible as models.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abel is a model of the divine economy, and Cain is a model of the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Cain rejected God's promise and killed his brother Abel, bringing in God's judgment and curse Gen 4:3-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead of offering something of the flock, typifying Christ, he offered the result of his own labor, and that offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nothing of a sinner's own labor that is offered to the righteous God will be accepted by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By offering the result of his labor to God, Cain was seemingly doing a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But shortly after his offering was rejected by God, Cain did something evil he killed his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With him there were both good and evil, indicating that he surely belonged to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The situation is the same in human society today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the one hand, a gentleman does many good things; on the other hand, the same person does evil things.</S>
