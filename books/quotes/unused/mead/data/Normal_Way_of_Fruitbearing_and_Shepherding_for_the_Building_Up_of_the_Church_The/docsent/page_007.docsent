   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING A HEART OF LOVE TO CARE FOR PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have tried many ways to gain the increase, but little has worked.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently, we changed from preaching the gospel in the meeting every week so that the saints could do the preaching in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, almost no saints opened their home for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This caused me to have much concern before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no way that works if we do not have a care for and interest in people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if we do have a care and interest, the care itself will open up a way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not say that we have no way or that no one will accept the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even the closed doors of China were eventually opened, and thousands were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The work in China was very difficult at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At first when one missionary went to visit the villages, no one would open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The children would even throw stones and mud at him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Still, he would not run away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He would stop, turn around, and say, Thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The love and endurance that this brother had for the sake of the people eventually touched their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way of the gospel in every Chinese village was difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we had thought that there was no need to go to places like that, then we would have had no way there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we had a burden, a care, and an interest for people, we could have brought in a hundred people in the last few months.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because some said that it was too difficult for the saints to bring people to the gospel meeting, we tried letting the saints preach in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, however, there was no preaching in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not that we are short of ways; it is that we are short of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the missionaries came to my province, the clans in each village would not allow anyone to rent a house to the foreign devils.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of this, some of the missionaries were forced to live under bridges and underpasses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition, no one was allowed to sell them food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It seems that they had no way to live, but the Lord had a way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One family of missionaries who lived in an underpass observed a peddler of soy bean cakes who passed by early each morning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One morning while the peddler left his cakes unattended, the missionary took a piece and put some money in its place, several times more than what the cake was worth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the peddler returned, he found that a piece was gone but that the money had been left in its place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This went on morning after morning for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Finally the peddler waited to see who was buying his cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He and the missionary made contact, and the peddler was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Under no situation should we say that there is no way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It altogether depends upon the kind of heart we have.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In principle, the situation in the United States, the most modern nation on the earth, is the same today as it was in old China.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The devil at that time was the ancient serpent, but today he is more modern.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The same serpent uses different ways to keep people from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we need a praying spirit and a heart to love and care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we have this kind of heart and an intensified care for people, the way will be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BEING RESCUED FROM</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A FORMAL, LUKEWARM CONDITION BY HAVING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A GENUINE HEART OF CARE FOR OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After being in this country for over fourteen years, I have observed that many brothers are desirous for the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In their consideration, the only way for them to be useful is to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They think that if they cannot be an elder, at least they must be a leader of a service group.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even the sisters desire to be leading ones among the other sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have prayed concerning this situation with a great feeling of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church there should be no such ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to forget about titles and position.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be useful is not only to be in the eldership; to be useful is to pick up a burden for souls.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A certain older brother who is now with the Lord was a good example to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was neither an elder, a co-worker, or any kind of leader, but he was used much by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He had a heart for the young people, the new ones, and new beginners.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Almost every new one was invited to dinner by him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we would all be like this, the church life will be marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The United States was built up not by its presidents but by the people, those who built up their own families in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To be sure, we need good leaders in the church life, but even more, we need every saint to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Each one should say, I love my Master, I love my wife, and I love my children.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I will not go out free.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I will carry out the proper service in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not care whether the meetings are high or low, living or dead, rich or poor, or hot or cold.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I simply have a burden to care for at least four younger ones all year round.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I love the Lord, I have a heart for the unbelievers, and I love my younger brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Without being conscious of it, we have drifted into a lukewarm situation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At the present time we are drifting backward.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some have said that our meetings are too formal, but it is we ourselves who have become formal.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Regardless of the way we take in the church meetings, we need to be living in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be the same as we were last week, last month, and even last year is the real formality.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no need to consider the condition of the meetings; what about our own living?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A strong church can be living even without formal meetings, but it seems that now we have meetings without being living.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The proper church life is twenty-five percent a matter of the meetings and seventy-five percent a matter of our living, but we have turned it around to be less than twenty-five percent a matter of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we did not have the meetings, there would be no church life left.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>According to our numbers, we have enough saints to begin a new church in a nearby city.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because of our shortage in life, however, we dare not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord can testify how much I have prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In my prayer I have thanked the Lord for all those who have been brought into His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, many dear ones who have been in the church life for a certain time are disappointed regarding their usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some even think that they cannot be useful unless they are elders or leaders in the practical service.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Let us forget about the eldership and pick up a genuine heart to love the sinners and a genuine burden to take care of the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we have a will to do this, we will surely be able.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we will all be like the older brother who had no position but always cared for the younger ones, our whole church life will be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our success depends not on our knowledge, way, or skill but on our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We need to pray for this and take this word for ourselves.</S>
