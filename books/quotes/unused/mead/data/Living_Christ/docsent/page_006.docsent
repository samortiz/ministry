   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Look at the Philippines today.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If technology, philosophy, religion, and the law were removed, what kind of people would the Filipinos become?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They would be bandits, robbers, or wild beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is true not only of the Philippines but also of every other country in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, these four items must not be abandoned; technology, philosophy, religion, and the law are necessary items in human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The stronger a country is in these four aspects, the greater will be its national strength.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, we must know that these four items are replacements of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may ask three young brothers to come up to the platform for a demonstration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can see that all these three young brothers have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do they have Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, what do they live by every day?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They live by Christ for only a little time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps while praying at home they enter into their spirit and live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, during the meetings when they have forgotten their own thoughts and emotions, they live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, most of the time they are neither living in the spirit nor are they living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes even their eyes are rolling and their minds are wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They see that the elders are not good, the brothers are worse, and the sisters are even more disappointing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the meetings they are watching, condemning, and criticizing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, at times even in the meetings they are not living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What do these three brothers normally live by?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, they live by technology.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may consider themselves young people of the space age, and therefore they cannot be without technology or knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second, they live by philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may say, "We are Chinese who were born in the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have the Chinese philosophy and the Filipino philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have a philosophy of the East meeting with the West."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Third, these brothers live by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their religion, which is the local churches, is first-rate and the most cultured.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Fourth, they live by good, morality, and ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have all these items, and they even have them on two levels.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One level is the Chinese ethical traits such as meekness and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consider the Chinese character for patience; it is a sharp knife stuck into the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is patience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, these brothers are willing to yield to others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another level is that they were born into a Christian family and were raised in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They have not only morality, but they also have the knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They normally live by these four items: technology, philosophy, religion, and ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now if I ask, "Brother, in the past week, did you go to the movies?", he will say, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I ask, "Why didn't you go?", he may say, "Because there were not any good ones."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Did you hear what he said?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He says he did not go because there were no good movies worth watching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He considers that the movies are not good and disdains them because he is rich in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If these movies were shown to the country people, they would think that they are great.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, this very knowledgeable young man will not go because these movies are not up to his standard.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I ask the second brother, "Why did you not go to the movies?", he replies, "When I go to the movies, I feel very uncomfortable within, so I do not go."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This seems to be somewhat related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seems that it is Christ in him who would not allow him to go to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps for the first two times, his uneasiness may be due to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, later on it may be because he is afraid that it would not look proper if others should see him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It may also be that he feels that as one who is in the church he should not go to the theater.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He may have a standard for being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If he were to go to the movies, he would feel that that is improper and have no peace in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now if I ask the third brother, "Why did you not go to the movies?", he replies, "This is the custom of the local church."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Did you hear him say that the local church's custom is to not go to the movies?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is a good brother in the local church, so how can he go to the movies?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In any case, you all can hear what these three brothers have said.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>None of them say that he did not go to the movies because Christ lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I ask a sister, "Do you quarrel with your husband?", she may reply, "Sometimes I want to quarrel with him, but after some consideration, I get the feeling that it would be better not to."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I would ask, "Please explain a little as to why you feel that it would be better not to quarrel," to which she replies, "This is due to different reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First, in front of the children, it is not proper to quarrel."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brothers and sisters, you can see that this sister is living her children instead of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She continues, "The second reason is that there are young brothers around, which also makes quarreling improper."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Again you can see that this sister is living the young people instead of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then she says, "The third reason is that sometimes it is truly Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brothers and sisters, do you see that Christ's living in her is not listed first but last?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is still another reason that I can describe for you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You may feel this way: "Now that I am in the church and I am living the church life, how can I quarrel with my husband?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This would truly be unseemly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, I must set up a good example and not quarrel."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Is this living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No, this is merely a kind of religious living.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I believe now you are all clear.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do not think that only one sister is like this; all of the sisters are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Even the brothers are not any different.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There are some elders who are too impetuous; they speak, act, decide, and handle matters in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The result is that they hurt others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There are other elders who are full of experience; they do everything slowly to avoid hurting others by being too quick.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When they are asked by anyone about anything, they say, "Wait a minute, let me pray about it; I cannot give you an answer today."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, this is to live wisdom and not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Day by day we read much about Christ, pray much to Christ, and hear much about Christ, but we do not live Christ very much.</S>
