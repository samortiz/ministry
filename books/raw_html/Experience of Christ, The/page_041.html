<P>If we want to participate in Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ, we must repudiate our flesh. The greatest obstacle to enjoying Christ is our natural heritage. For example, the greatest hindrance for a naturally gentle brother to enjoy Christ is his gentleness, for he may repudiate all things except his gentleness. Although we have enjoyed Christ to a certain degree, we all have been frustrated and hindered by our natural heritage. It is the good flesh that is the greatest hindrance to experiencing Christ and enjoying Him.</P><P>Suppose a certain person is naturally eloquent and makes a great impact upon an audience. If he becomes a Christian, he can be an outstanding preacher and draw a great crowd. Being naturally eloquent, he can be influential and have a great impact. But there will be no need for Christ or for the Spirit. With his natural eloquence, he can secure a large following. If I were such an eloquent speaker, you all would appreciate me. You would praise the Lord that such a brother had been brought into the Lord's recovery. However, it is difficult for such an eloquent speaker to enjoy Christ in his speaking because he has no need of Christ.</P><P>Suppose another person is not born with the ability to speak eloquently. On the contrary, he is slow and halting in his expression. Whenever he speaks more than a few minutes, everyone falls asleep. Suppose he gets saved, loves the Lord and the church, and has a burden to speak a word for the Lord. Having no trust in himself, he spontaneously repudiates himself and puts all his trust in Christ. He may fast and pray desperately to the Lord, saying, "Lord, if You don't speak, I will not be able to speak. If You don't do something with my speaking, I am finished." When he stands up to speak, he is in fear and trembling. But because he has repudiated himself, he experiences Christ and enjoys Christ as he speaks.</P><P>A naturally eloquent brother may have the same experience, for with him the principle is the same. He may pray, "Lord, I am in fear and trembling that my eloquence and intelligence might replace You and that my ability might hinder You and keep me from enjoying You. Lord, as I speak I have no trust in my natural ability." In this way he denies himself and repudiates his ability, eloquence, intelligence, and knowledge. Therefore, when he speaks, he also experiences Christ and enjoys Him.</P><P>No matter whether we are dull or intelligent, we must reject all that we are. Nothing natural should be allowed to replace Christ. Any naturally good thing will frustrate us from the enjoyment of Christ.</P>
