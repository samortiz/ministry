   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE MEANING OF ABIDING IN THE LORD A. In the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The experience of abiding in the Lord is based on the fact of being in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you are not in the Lord, there is no way for you to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This fact of our being in the Lord was accomplished long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The accomplishment may be divided into two stages.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord finished redemption on the cross, He joined us to Himself, putting us into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the first stage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then when we were regenerated, the Holy Spirit came into us and practically joined us to Christ, putting us into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the second stage.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 6:3 says that we were baptized into Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this we can see that to be baptized is to be put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The phrase "believe in the Lord," according to the original Greek text, should be properly rendered as "believe into the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The "into" in "believe into the Lord" and the "into" in "baptized into Christ" are the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 6 says "baptized into," and John 3:16 says "believe into."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One is to be baptized into, and the other is to believe into.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In baptism you are baptized into Christ, and in believing you believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we believe in the Lord, the Spirit puts us completely into Christ and causes us to have an organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thereafter, in practicality, we become those who are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, 2 Corinthians 5:17 says that if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone who desires to abide in Christ needs to see the fact of being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If someone does not see this fact it is useless to exhort him to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It will even be a hardship on him, for no matter how hard he tries to abide in Christ, he can never make it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if he has the light and revelation that he is in Christ, he will see that to abide is an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will realize that it is not necessary to seek abiding, because he is already in. This has already been accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us give a little illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose you are a member of the Jones family.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since your birth you have been in the Jones family.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As you were born into the Jones family, quite naturally you live with them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But suppose according to your knowledge, you are an outsider, yet you insist on living in the Jones's house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First you must see that you are one who is in the Jones family.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is an accomplished fact based on your birth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are, therefore, one of the Jones family, and all you need to do is to acknowledge this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now what is required of you is that you remain there by living at home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same principle, if you desire to abide in the Lord, you must realize a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Something has happened to you and you are now already in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before you were saved you were born in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But after you were saved, God moved you out of the realm of Adam into the realm of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fact of being in Christ is now accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"In" is a marvelous word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>B. Abide in the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word "abide" means to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Abide in the Lord may also be translated as remain in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ephesians 3:17 says that Christ dwells in our hearts through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word "dwells" means to make your home.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you live in a house, that means you dwell there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you go to a certain place and stay there for ten days, that means you remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word "abide" in the phrase "abide in the Lord" does not mean to dwell or to reside, but it means to remain, to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As you are a saved one and you are already in the Lord, what is required of you now is that you do not leave, but remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To illustrate, suppose you were baptized yesterday, and you clearly sensed that you had been joined to the Lord and that you are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Last night, however, a friend came and insisted on taking you to a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While you were about to go with him, you sensed there was something wrong between you and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As you were considering what might be wrong, your friend continued to persuade you, and you decided to go with him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that moment you felt that your fellowship with the Lord had been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You felt that way because you did not remain in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may be a saved one and thus in the Lord, but experientially you may not always remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In your experience it seems at times that you have walked out of the Lord, and your fellowship with the Lord has been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Again, for example, you have just been saved and now you have a clear sense that you are joined to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But today it so happened that something greatly provoked you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While you were about to lose your temper, you felt something was wrong inside.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Nevertheless, you went ahead and lost your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And because you lost your temper, you knew within yourself that the fellowship with the Lord had been interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It seemed as if you had walked out of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means you did not remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To remain in the Lord is to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When you thus remain in the Lord, you have continuous fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be in the Lord is a matter of union.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To abide in the Lord is a matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Fellowship is made possible by our being put into an organic union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To have unceasing fellowship is to abide, and to abide is to maintain this unceasing fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The theme of the first Epistle of John is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the first chapter of that book it tells us that we who have Christ as life do have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The life which we have received in us causes us to have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Gospel of John speaks of life, and the first Epistle of John speaks of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Gospel of John continuously shows us how the Lord came and entered into men to be their life and to save them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>First John continues to speak of the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As you have been saved and have Christ as life, this life will cause you to have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>First John 1 speaks of fellowship, and chapter two speaks of abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The abiding in the Lord which is spoken of in chapter two is the fellowship spoken of in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What does it mean to abide in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It means to have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord, not to come out of the fellowship, and to extend the union with the Lord.</S>
