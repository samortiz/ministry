   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Ten The New Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Putting On the New Man and</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>the Constitution and Renewing of the New Man Scripture Reading: Col 3:5-11, 17; Eph 2:15; 4:22-24 The ultimate goal of God in His economy is to gain the new man constituted with the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent Christ wrought into a corporate people Col 1:27; 2:2, 9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The new man equals the Body of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>10, 15; Eph 2:15-16: The new man and the Body are synonyms and may be used interchangeably: The emphasis on the church being the Body of Christ is on life; the emphasis on the church being the one new man is on the person 1 Cor 12:12; Eph 4:4; 2:15; 4:24.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person Col 3:4; Eph 3:17a.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ and we together form a universal man; as the One in heaven, Christ is the Head, and as those on earth, we are the Body Col 1:18a.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The new man is the corporate God-man, with Christ, the firstborn Son, as the Head and the believers, the many sons of God, as the Body; for the new man as the corporate God-man we need to live the life of a God-man 3:10; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:10; Phil 1:19-21a.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the new man was already created in Christ, we still need to put on the new man Col 3:10; Eph 2:15; 4:24: Since the new man is the Body of Christ, to put on the new man means to live a life by the Body, not individually but corporately: Individualism is hateful in the sight of God; if we would know the Body, we need to be delivered from our individualistic life 1 Cor 12:18-20.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The strongest proof that we have seen the Body is that we can no longer be individualistic Acts 9:4-6; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>14.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before our salvation we were living in the old man, in the old society, but now we are members of Christ, living in His Body; thus, we should put off the old man with the old social life and put on the new man, the church Col 3:10, 15; Eph 4:4, 22-24.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to put on the new man in an experiential way, we need to take Christ as our person 3:17a; Gal 2:20: The church is the new man, and in this new man there is only one person Christ Matt 17:5; Col 3:10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The old man must be put off, and we must live by our new person vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>5-9; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20; Eph 4:22-24.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we live by taking Christ as our person, especially in making decisions, our living will be the living of the new man John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38; Rom 15:32; James 4:13-15.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would put on the new man in a practical way, we need to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Col 3:17: The name denotes the person, and the Lord s person is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17a.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To do things in the name of the Lord is to act in the Spirit; this is to live Christ Gal 5:16; Rom 8:4; Phil 1:21a.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The new man is Christ constituted into us Col 3:10-11; Eph 3:17a; 4:24: As the One who indwells us and who is our life, Christ is the constituent of the new man Col 1:27; 3:4.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Christ we enjoy as our God-allotted portion becomes the constituent of the new man 1:12; 3:10-11: Through enjoying the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent Christ we experience Him as the content and constituent of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The issue of our experience and enjoyment of Christ is the church as the new man; as we enjoy Christ, He is constituted into us, and we become the new man 1:27; 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because Christ is all and in all, in the new man there is room only for Christ; there is no room for the natural man v. 11: Since Christ is all and in all in the new man and we are part of the new man, we are part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is everyone in the new man, and He is in everyone in the new man v. 11.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The only way Christ can be all and in all in the new man is for Him to be constituted into us Eph 3:17a.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning the new man, we need to be renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him Col 3:10: Because the new man was created with us, who belong to the old creation Eph 2:15 , as his constituents, he needs to be renewed; this renewing takes place mainly in our mind as the mingled spirit spreads into our mind and saturates it Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The new man is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of the One who created him Col 3:10: This image is Christ, God s Beloved the wonderful, glorious, all-inclusive Christ as the expression of God 1:15.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to be renewed in our mind unto full knowledge according to the expression of God, according to what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The renewing of the new man depends on our seeking the things which are above 3:1-2: If we turn to the heavenly Christ with all His activities and set our mind on these things, the renewing of the new man will take place spontaneously Heb 8:1-2; 12:2; Col 3:2, 10.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we set our mind on the things above, the way is open for the divine element to spread from our regenerated spirit into our soul; this spreading of the divine element within us is according to Christ, who is the image of God, God s expression.</S>
