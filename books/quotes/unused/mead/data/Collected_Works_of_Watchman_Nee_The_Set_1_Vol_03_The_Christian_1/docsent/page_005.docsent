   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>About a hundred years ago, Dr.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chalmers pointed out that the word was in "the earth was without form" should be translated became.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dr. I.M. Haldeman, G.H. Pember, and others also pointed out that this word is the same as the word became used in Genesis 19:26.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And she became a pillar of salt."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the same word is translated became in 19:26, why should it not be translated the same way here?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even the word became in 2:7 is the same word as in 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, it is not hypothetical to translate 1:2 the following way: "And the earth became without form."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was not without form and void.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later it became such.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us read a few more verses:</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is" Exo 20:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Comparing these two verses, we can see that the world in Genesis 1:1 was very different from the world in 1:3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth, but in the six days, God made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a vast difference between create and make.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One is to have something from nothing, while the other is to improve the things that are in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The world can make, but it cannot create, while God can both create and make.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why Genesis says that "in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later because of the cataclysm, the earth became desolate, and "in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is" Exo 20:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second Peter 3:5 through 7 says the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The heavens and the earth in verse 5 are the heaven and the earth in Genesis 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 6 speaks of the world flooded with water, which is the earth that was without form and void and that was under the water in Genesis 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"The heavens and earth now" in verse 7 is the restored world after Genesis 1:3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a clear difference between God's work in the six days and His work of creation at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more we read Genesis 1, the more we will see that our explanation above is the proper one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the first day light was called into being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before the first day there was already land, but it was "without form, and void" and was buried in the deep under the water.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the third day God did not create the land; He merely caused it to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>F.W. Grant said that the work of the six days merely put a new order to the earth; it did not create something out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The earth was there already.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible never says that the earth was created during the six days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Grant also said, "At which point did the first day begin?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some may think that it began from desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet this is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The evening' on the first day indicates light had been there since the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The darkness he called Night,' yet the evening' is a darkness that is already under the control of light."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the first day God did not create the light; He merely caused the light to appear on the darkened earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same way in the second day, He did not create the heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The heaven there was not the heavens, but the atmospheric "heaven" which surrounds the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was not created then.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where then did the atmosphere come from?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our answer is that it was created in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, there was no need now to create; there was only the need to restore.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no detailed discussion here.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not know if the primordial world was created in an instant or became what it was through an endless period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not know if it was completed in a few thousand years or millions of years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not know the shape and the size of it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All that we know is that "in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not know how many years there were between verses 1 and 2 of Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not know how long ago God created the heaven and the earth, and we do not know how many years after the creation of the primordial world did the desolation of verse 2 occur.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But we believe that there was a long period of time between the perfect creation at the beginning and the later change into something that was without form and void.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How much later was it that "the earth became without form, and void"?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot tell.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we know one thing: there was a long gap between the two expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This long gap between the first two verses of Genesis covers the whole prehistoric period.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But from verse 3 until now there are less than six thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since we have proved that there is a big gap between the first two verses of the Bible, all the years which geology demands to exist and all the geological periods associated with these years can fall within this period.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not know how much time passed on the earth and how many changes occurred on the earth's surfaces and in the atmosphere before there was the condition of void and formlessness; the Bible does not say anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But we can say for sure that the Bible never says that our earth is only six thousand years old.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible only testifies that there are six thousand years of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the Bible has not said something, science can conjecture all it wants.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But science cannot form conjectures on what the Bible has already said.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After we understand the first two verses of the Bible, we can be assured that there is no contradiction between the Bible and geology.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All the attacks by geology on the Bible are beating the air.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How wonderful is the Word God has written!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are not saying this to please science.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God's revelation never wavers before man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We do not give up the Bible's authority in order to accommodate man's inventions.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If there are any contradictions between the Bible and science, and we would expect there to be some, because fleshly man is always at enmity with God , we have no intention to reconcile and annul these differences.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The above assertion was not proposed after some geological discoveries, in an effort to reconcile the Bible with science.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There were men in the ancient church who spoke about this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At that time, geology was not yet in existence!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When men like St. Augustus interpreted Genesis, the world did not yet have the term geology!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A Christian does not trust in human wisdom, but in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need nothing other than the sure rock of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As long as we have the "it is written" Matt 4:6 in the Scripture, everything is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Unfortunately, many apologetics have forgotten their ground; they change the words of the Scripture to accommodate man's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>An example is given by A.W. Pink, who noted that after the translation of a certain Assyrian tablet, the apologetics enthusiastically reported that much of the Old Testament history was verified! This turns things upside down! Does the Word of God need verification? If the record on the Assyrian tablet coincides with that of the Bible, it only shows that the Assyrian tablets have no historical error.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If they do not agree, it merely proves that the tablets are in error.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Worldly men and vain scientists will of course scorn at our logic.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But this only goes to demonstrate God's Word which says, "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually" 1 Cor 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must never lower ourselves to appease men.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It seems like a good idea to change the Bible to suit man's taste, but doing so changes the true nature of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How wonderful is Genesis 1!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It devotes only one verse to the description of the first creation!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It uses only one verse to describe the desolation of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is far less than the thirty or so verses that describe the restoration of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Who can come up with a composition that matches the record of Genesis 1?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The subject is difficult, yet the explanation is clear; the facts span a long time, yet the description is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It does not talk about science, yet it is scientifically accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Who except God can compose such a writing?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The reason God did not say more than this is that He only intended to show man His own relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>J.N. Darby said:</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This revelation from God is not a history by Him of all that He has done, but what has been given to man for his profit, the truth as to what he has to say to.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Its object is to communicate to man all that regards his own relationship with God...But historically the revelation is partial.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It communicates what is for the conscience and spiritual affections of man...Thus no mention is made of any heavenly beings...Thus also, regards this earth, except the fact of its creation, nothing is said of it beyond what relates to the present form of it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Synopsis of the Books of the Bible, reprinted 1970, p.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Indeed, God's revelation is not given to satisfy human curiosity, but to manifest His Godhead, the world's sinfulness, the way of salvation, and the coming glory and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The present worldly knowledge is indeed dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Unless God bestows grace on man, man would boast in himself and use the knowledge he acquires as a basis to oppose God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>How difficult it is for an intellectual person to humble himself!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Man can search for knowledge as much as he wants.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But God will not supplement this with His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is why He does not say much in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Our present need is not more science, but deeper spiritual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Only this will reap real fruit in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We have to praise God the Father because He is full of love!</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He not only created us, but re-created us, and made us a new creation in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>How sweet is this name!</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>God has given us His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>What a marvelous grace this is!</S>
