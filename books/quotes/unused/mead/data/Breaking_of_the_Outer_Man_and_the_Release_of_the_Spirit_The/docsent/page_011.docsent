   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If God grants us mercy and breaks our outer man, we will manifest the following traits: Our old curiosity will be dead; we will no longer be curious.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Formerly, we were very strong in our emotion; we were easily stirred up in the tender sentiment of love or in the raw sentiment of anger whenever something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We reacted as soon as something happened around us, and we were caught up in those things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result, we lost God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if God is merciful to us, He will break our outer man, and our inner man will no longer be touched when many things happen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We will remain calm, and God's presence will abide with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must see that the enjoyment of God's presence is based on the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A man can only enjoy God's uninterrupted presence when his outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Lawrence worked in a kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people would come and demand service from him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There was noise all around him; plates were shuffled back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet Brother Lawrence was not affected by all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had God's presence when he prayed, and he also had God's presence when he was busily working.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How could he maintain God's presence in the midst of his hectic work?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The secret is that no outward noise could affect his inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some people lose God's presence because they are inwardly affected as soon as they hear any noise around them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some who do not know God try to hold on to God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What do they do?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They look for an environment where there is "no shuffling of plates."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They think that the farther away they are from people and activities, the closer they will be to God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They think that the problem is with the "plates," the human distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No, the problem is with them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is not delivering us from the "plates"; He is delivering us from being influenced by them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything around us can be in turmoil, but within we can remain untouched.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything around us can be clamorous, but within we can be perfectly still.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once the Lord breaks our outer man, our inner being will not respond to such things; we will have a deaf ear to these noises.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thank God that we can have very sensitive ears.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the action of grace and the operation of His work will break our outer man, and nothing that comes upon our outer man will affect us any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the "plates" clamor, we can hide ourselves in God's presence as much as when we are praying by ourselves alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once the outer man is broken, a man does not have to come back to God because he is with God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no need for a coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An unbroken man needs to come back to God whenever he goes about with his business because he has moved away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the reason he has to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A broken man never moves away; therefore, he does not need to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many people move away all the time, even while they are working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because their outer man has never been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is best that they not do anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as they do something, they move away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But those who know God in a genuine way never move away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, they never need to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If they spend the whole day praying to God, they enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If they spend the whole day busily scrubbing the floor, they still enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as our outer man is broken, we will live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We will not need to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There will not be the feeling nor need to come back.</S>
