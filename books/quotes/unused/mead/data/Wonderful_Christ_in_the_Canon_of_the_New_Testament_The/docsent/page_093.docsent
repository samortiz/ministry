   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNIVERSAL AND LOCAL BUILDING IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then Paul tells us that we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are being builded together into an habitation of God in spirit Eph 2:20-22, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. In these verses we see that all Christians are fitly framed together to grow into an holy temple in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the universal aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But Paul also practically covers the local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He says that we also are being built together locally into an habitation of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This local building is now under the process.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ye also are being builded together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many teachers in Christianity say that it is impossible to have the building now.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They say that this will be in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But I cannot find such a teaching in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is not to be built in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The next age will be the dispensation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That will not be the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church age is today!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ye also as local saints in your locality are being builded together into an habitation of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is something in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not through the Holy Spirit as translated by the King James Version.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit is the dweller, not the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our spirit is the dwelling place and the Holy Spirit is the dweller.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>GOD S FARM FOR GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul continues to tell us in 1 Corinthians 3 that we are God s farm to grow Christ, and we are God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ye are God s farm, ye are God s building 1 Cor 3:9b, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>. Whatever is grown on God s farm is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the foundation, and we are not only the materials, but also the builders.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we must be careful which materials we use for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble...</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1 Cor 3:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must build with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the same as in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s intention from Genesis to Revelation is to obtain such a building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the book of Revelation, John gives us the full consummation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the harvest of all the seeds in the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seed of the tree of life was sown in Genesis, but the harvest of the tree of life is at the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Gold, pearl, and precious stones are sown in Genesis as a seed, but they are reaped in a city built up with these precious materials at the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Revelation is the reaping of all the things sown in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jesus, Peter, and Paul all spoke about the building, but what they spoke was not the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John reaped the building in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How marvelous is the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not a heavenly mansion as poor Christianity teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is the consummation of God s building!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A UNIVERSAL GOLDEN LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we must see something in detail concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The city proper is a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Its height is twelve thousand furlongs Rev 21:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The number is meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is one thousand times twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have seen that twelve is the mingling of three and four, which means the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So the New Jerusalem is the mingling of God with man one thousand times.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The length and the breadth and the height are equal Rev 21:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are all twelve thousand furlongs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The city is a big mountain with God s throne on the top.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Out of the throne the living water is flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the bottom of the mountain a wall is built which is 144 cubits high Rev 21:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is twelve times twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The height of the wall is not too high, but the height of the city proper is twelve thousand furlongs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This mountain is all of gold, the ultimate consummation of all the golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The seven lampstands are local, and this golden lampstand is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The New Jerusalem is a universal golden lampstand, holding the Lamb as the lamp shining out the glory of God Rev 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God as the light is in Christ as the lamp shining out from the top of this universal golden lampstand.</S>
