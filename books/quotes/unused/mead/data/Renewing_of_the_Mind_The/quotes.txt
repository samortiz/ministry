[1]  The spirit gives us God-consciousness; it enables us to have communication with God and sense God.
[2]  The spirit is the organ for communicating with God, for being intimate with God, for understanding the will of God, and for knowing God.
[3]  Matthew 12:34-35 says, "Offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things?
[4]  For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
[5]  The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things."
[6]  The Lord Jesus said that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, because the heart is the man himself.
[7]  It is very interesting that, even though man is composed of three parts spirit, soul, and body , when the Bible speaks of our regeneration, it does not say that God gave us a new soul, but it says that God gave us a new spirit and new heart.
[8]  Ezekiel 36:26 says, "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh."
[9]  How is the nous related to a Christian's living, work, service to God, walk, etc.?
[10]  No matter how weak or strong a believer is, he is born of God, and he has a new spirit and new heart.
[11]  On the other hand, if you speak about God to some who are wise and philosophical, they may understand and know everything, but still not believe in God.
[12]  We think it is sufficient if we have a new heart, but the Bible speaks not only of this; it also says that our nous needs to be renewed.
[13]  If a man's nous is not renewed, this nous will have some particular experiences in its dealing with men.
[14]  If a man's nous is not renewed, naturally he will have some very inaccurate thoughts toward other men.
[15]  In a believer whose nous has not been renewed we can see the following characteristics toward God: he cannot trust God, he cannot know God in the same way that he knows the Lord Jesus as his Savior, and he has many doubts.
[16]  The reason they do not know it is that they do not have the organ to know God's will.
[17]  We think that if we harbor hatred toward others in our heart, if we sin, if we commit fornication, we will offend God.
[18]  The biggest fault of a believer is thinking about his past.
[19]  If no one leads you on, you will put yourself in a dangerous position, and you may even think that you are not saved, that you have committed an unforgivable sin, or that God has forsaken you.
[20]  You should not think that your mind is too dull.
[21]  Do not think that only those who are naturally intelligent will grow and quickly understand the truth of God.
[22]  If your nous is renewed, you can understand God, and you can know everything of God.
[23]  Therefore, we always need to keep an open and unveiled spirit in the presence of God so that we can have a living communication with Him.
[24]  If the nous is closed, God cannot give light to the spirit, because even if He gave light to the spirit, there would be no channel to express what the spirit had received.
[25]  But you did not so learn Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus, that you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your nous and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality."
[26]  Let us pay attention to verses 17 and 18 which say that the nous of the Gentiles is corrupted by vanity, and the heart is hardened and alienated from the life of God.
[27]  If the disease starts from the heart, we should deal with the heart first; if it starts from the nous, we should deal with the nous first; if it starts from life, we should deal with life first.
[28]  The function of the nous is darkened because the Gentiles are alienated from the life of God, and they are alienated from the life of God because they are ignorant and hardened in their heart.
[29]  Suppose a believer hears that baptism is according to the Bible and is something that God has clearly commanded.
[30]  If you want to know whether or not a person's heart is proper and his mind is right, you need only talk to him.
[31]  I have mentioned only a few conditions of a sick nous.
[32]  We should pay attention to one more matter: the trouble with man's nous originates in man's heart; therefore, if the nous is to be renewed, the prejudiced heart must also be corrected.
[33]  Whoever is willing to say to God, "God, if You teach me right now, I thank You; if You do not teach me right now, I will not insist," can be taught by God.
[34]  A renewed nous, with respect to God, is able to know His will; with respect to the self, it is able to control one's own mind and clarify his thoughts; and with respect to others, it can discern, receive, and understand the words of others.
[35]  Several years ago I saw in a magazine something written by Mrs. Penn-Lewis which said, "If your spirit is obstructed, it is because your nous is obstructed." In other words, the spirit is closed because the nous is closed.
[36]  But if a believer's nous is not renewed, his spirit will have no outlet, and God will not be able to use him.
[37]  If you can consecrate these things to Him and put them upon the altar, your renewed nous will receive double strength from God, and you will understand God's desire and will; you will be able to think and understand everything about God.
[38]  Originally, the nous of many people is like a kitchen window that is covered with grease.
