   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE FLOCK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must go on to John 10:16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here Jesus tells us about the one flock.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The flock is a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not individual sheep; we are a flock!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So we must be flocked together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The real togetherness is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is the togetherness of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As individual sheep we will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must be in the one flock, and this flock is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Praise the Lord for one flock and one shepherd!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ONE LOAF</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In John 12:24, the Lord tells us something more of the corporate Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verily, verily I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord was the one grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying that He might produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But these many grains are not individual.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are to be ground into fine flour to make one loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This one loaf is the church 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is one body, one loaf, coming out of the mass production of the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus fell into the earth and died, but in His resurrection we were all raised up as grains to be made into one loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as an individualistic standing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be in the one flock and the one loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>MANY BRANCHES, ONE TREE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in John 15 we see the one vine tree with all the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is still the church, the corporate Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are many branches, but there is only one tree.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that you can be a separated branch.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If so, you are withered, because you have been cut off from the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise Him that we are the many branches in the one vine tree!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE PRAYER FOR ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all must realize that everything is for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is not simply a group of individual believers; it is the built up Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why the Lord prays in John 17 that we all may be one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and has loved them, as thou has loved me John 17:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus prays in this prayer for the oneness, and this oneness is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All Christians should be one!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why we are against any kind of division.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not be divided by any kind of doctrines or ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you speak in tongues and I don t, we still should be one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are immersed and someone else is not, you must all still be one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regardless of what we like, we must be one!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To have the oneness and to be built up into one body is far from the concept and practice of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone forms their own group according to their taste.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But as long as we all believe in the Lord Jesus and have been regenerated, we are one!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Believe me, the Lord today is gathering all the seeking Christians to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So many seeking Christians are coming together to be built up into this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is happening not only in the U.S.A., but on the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many seekers of Christ are for this oneness today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not mean a kind of unification.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That is of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are one already, we do not need to be unified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are one in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all have His life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>ONE IN THE GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord also prayed concerning our oneness in the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is the glory?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is just the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Jesus as the Son of God has the glory to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now this glory to express God has been given by Jesus to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now in this glory, in this expression of God, we are one!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are not for the expression of immersion, sprinkling, tongue speaking, or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All of these things divide the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are for the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To this very day the Lord s prayer in John 17 has not yet been fully fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Satan has used all of his divisive schemes and elements to divide the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many people have come into our meetings and said that they do not like this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But who are they?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They may not like it, but the Lord does!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As long as there are no idols, no fornication, and no division, and as long as we all recognize the divine person of Jesus and His redeeming work, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not oppose anything from others, neither should we impose anything on others.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As long as we all express the Lord Jesus, that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the Gospel of John, we see that Jesus is everything to us for the purpose of producing the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This Bride is the temple of God, the building.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is also the vine tree, the one flock, and the one loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This Bride is the proper church life with the oneness of all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is not by teaching, but by taking Christ as our life and as our everything.</S>
