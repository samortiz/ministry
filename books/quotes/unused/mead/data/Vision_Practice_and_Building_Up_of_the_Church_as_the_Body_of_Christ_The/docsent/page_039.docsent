   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE VISION OF GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE TEST OF OUR SPIRITUALITY Scripture Reading: Gen 28:10-19 THE VISION OF GOD S BUILDING All the Visions in the Scriptures Being</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Related to God s Building</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building up of the church is the aim of God s eternal purpose and plan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the central point, the ultimate aim, of God s purpose according to all the visions and revelations in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first vision mentioned in the Scriptures is Jacob s dream in Genesis 28:10-19.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before that time the God of glory appeared to Abraham Acts 7:2 , but that was not a vision to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first vision in the Scriptures was Jacob s dream.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The central item of that vision was Bethel, the house of God, built with two kinds of material, stone and the oil poured upon the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The stone signifies man, and the oil signifies the very God who comes to us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After Jacob poured the oil upon the stone, he called the name of that place Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The stone with the oil poured upon it became the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit, who comes to us, is the third person of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father was far away from us, and the Son was once among us yet not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the oil, the person of the Spirit, in whom and by whom the very God comes into us to be one with us, producing Bethel, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the first vision in the Scriptures is a dream, the central point of which is the house of God built with human beings mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today Christians often talk about heavenly or spiritual visions, but it seems that they are not clear concerning the central visions in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Visions in the Scriptures are always related to God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a principle of first mention in the Scriptures; that is, the principle of a matter is set forth when it is mentioned for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first vision in the Scriptures is a vision of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Accordingly, the visions in the Scriptures are always related to God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The final vision in the Scriptures is the New Jerusalem, in the last two chapters of the Bible Rev 21 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is an enlarged vision, a vision in full.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The vision at Bethel is the seed of the vision, and the vision of the New Jerusalem is the harvest of the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Between these two ends, there are a number of visions in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moses saw a vision of the building of the tabernacle Exo 25 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That was a genuine vision of the heavenly pattern for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the vision of Bethel was a seed, Moses vision on Mount Sinai was the growth of the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After Moses, the next major vision was that of David, the vision of the temple as the enlargement of the tabernacle 2 Sam 7:1-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Following this were the visions of Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Ezekiel 40 through 48, the temple that Ezekiel saw was a further enlargement of the temple seen by David.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Zechariah s vision was related to the recovery of the temple, and Daniel s visions are related to the temple in the end times.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The next great vision was that of the apostles, represented mainly by Peter and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Epistles show us the vision of the church that the apostles saw in their own time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The final vision was seen by John.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is surprising to hear Christians often speaking about visions, because many do not realize that all the visions are for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some brothers have studied the Scriptures in seminaries and Bible institutes, but they may have never heard of the vision of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we take away the above visions from the Scriptures, there will be none left.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With these visions we have the seed, the growth and enlargement, the recovery, and even the enlargement of the enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the New Testament visions we have the genuine article, the church, and in Revelation there is the ultimate manifestation of God s building, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these visions are related to one item the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our Need to See the Vision of God s Building</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because this is the age of God s purpose, we need to have not a mere teaching or doctrine but a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Beginning in 1939, Brother Watchman Nee spent three years to stress one matter our need to see the Body, which is the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He stressed that we need a vision of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To hear something about the Body is one thing, but to see the Body is another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may compare this to hearing about Los Angeles before we actually see it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I heard of Los Angeles many years ago when I was young, but I did not come here until 1958.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now I have a clear view of Los Angeles, especially when I travel by airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need a vision to see God s building, not merely to hear, learn, or know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot say exactly how we can see the vision, but as we are seeking the Lord, meeting together, and fellowshipping about this matter again and again, we eventually will see something.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before that time, we may have known about the building of God, but eventually the vision will be open to us, and we will see it in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are open to the Lord and seek Him, sooner or later the building of God will become a vision to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s desire in the universe is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is His aim and His ultimate goal, and He will obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we seek Him and His desire, we must go along with Him in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot be satisfied until we see His people built up in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>David was called a man after God s heart because he had a genuine concern for God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was occupied by nothing other than the building of the dwelling place of God, not in heaven but on this earth and in his age.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today we also must have a true concern for God s dwelling place on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many Christian brothers and sisters are very concerned for lost souls.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whenever I hear this, I am very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I too would do whatever I can to further the work of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, today the Lord is doing something more, not only to preach the gospel and save lost souls but also to bring the saved ones to be built together.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must have a true concern not only for the lost ones but also for God s building among the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the purpose for which we are here.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We do not despise any kind of gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must do whatever we can to help the gospel work, but we also need to see something further.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to see the vision of God s purpose with His building.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are not here merely for the gospel or for spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are here for God s ultimate goal and aim, which is the building up of the church.</S>
