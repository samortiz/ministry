As believers in Christ, we all have a spirit, and our spirit has been regenerated by the divine Spirit. By this the two spirits have been located&#151;in us. This is a wonder. Both of the two spirits are in us! Hence, wherever we are, these two spirits are with us. They have been located within us.</P><P>We, the believers, live the Christian life by exercising our spirit. We should learn to practice one thing: in doing anything, we should not do it hastily. When we are going to answer someone, we should not answer quickly; instead, we should consider whether or not we are answering in our spirit by the divine Spirit. In everything, we need to consider carefully. Of course, this is very difficult, but still we need to learn. I was born a Chinese, and the Chinese language is my mother tongue. When I began to study English, I found that mastering English pronunciation was very difficult for me. This has required much learning over many years. In a similar sense, we were born human, and we were reborn divine. Now, we the human beings must learn to live a human life by the divine life. This requires much learning because we do not know how to live by the divine life.</P><P>In learning to live a human life by the divine life, prayer is a great help. By nature I am a quick person. It is difficult for me to be slow and considerate. However, after much prayer I become a very slow and considerate person. Praying slows us down. This means that praying makes us more spiritual. Prayer causes us to live a human life by the divine life. If you come to ask me something and I have not prayed in half a day, I will probably answer you quickly. However, if you come to me immediately after my morning prayer, I will be very spiritual; I will not answer you quickly. Prayer slows us down because to pray is to exercise our spirit, and that spontaneously puts aside our emotion, our will, and our mind. Whenever we stir up our spirit by praying, we become a very careful person.</P><P>I have no interest in merely teaching the Bible. My burden is to help the saints to understand what Paul wrote in Galatians 5:16 and 25 concerning living and walking by the Spirit. It is very rare to meet a person who lives by the Spirit and walks by the Spirit. We should not take verses like Galatians 5:16 and 25 for granted. On the contrary, we must endeavor to understand what it means to live and walk by the Spirit.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_077.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_079.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Christian Life &nbsp; pg 78</div><br></body></html>
