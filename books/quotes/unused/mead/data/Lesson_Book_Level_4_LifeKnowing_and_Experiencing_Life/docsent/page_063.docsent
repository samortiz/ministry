   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Text I. NATURAL CONSTITUTION A. Definition</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dealing with the natural constitution is a deeper dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may ask, "What is the natural constitution?''</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Constitution'' as used here means "the aggregate of man's physical and mental powers.''</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible there is no such term as the natural constitution, and it is seldom mentioned among Christians; yet in our experience there is such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is an outstanding characteristic of the soulish man and a prominent expression of the living out of the old man which has to do with human ability, capability, wisdom, cleverness, schemes, and skills.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jacob, in the Old Testament, was a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was able, resourceful, full of schemes, and very capable and skillful; he was truly one who was exceedingly strong in the natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jacob's natural constitution was expressed even before his birth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In his mother's womb he took hold of Esau's heel, striving to come out first.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he grew up, he cleverly schemed to gain a position of advantage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He used intrigue and cheated Esau of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then by a clever device he obtained the blessing of the first-born from his father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he left home, in his wanderings, God appeared to him at Bethel and promised to bless him; then also he applied his skill and bargained with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He said, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God, then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that thou shall give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee'' Gen 28:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God had promised to bless him without any terms, nevertheless, he bargained with God on certain conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This only proves how smart and clever he was!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reason Jacob was so scheming is that he was so strong in the natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, throughout his whole life, God especially dealt with his natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The afflictions, sufferings, and troubles which beset him were for the breaking of his natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The crisis in his life occurred when God touched the hollow of his thigh at Penuel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Finally, in Genesis 35, God asked him to go to Bethel and there make an altar unto God, who had appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From thence Jacob ceased all his scheming, and his natural man fell before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All his ability, schemes, cleverness, and capability evidently disappeared and ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His whole being had changed completely.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. Dealing with the Natural Constitution</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Flesh, self, and the natural constitution all three are the expressions of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the principle in dealing with them is the same: on one hand we have the objective fact, and on the other hand we need the subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The objective fact is that Christ has already crucified our old man, while the subjective experience is the applying of the death of Christ through the Holy Spirit to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we apply it to the flesh, it is the dealing with the flesh; if we apply it to our opinion, it is the dealing with self; and if we apply it to our ability and capability, it is the dealing with the natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not say that you do not need to study anymore, because God wants to deal with our natural abilities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Though God does want to deal with our natural abilities, we still need to be educated and be well trained in every area of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may ask why.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God wants vessels to contain Him, to express Him, to serve Him, and to build up His church together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you cannot read, how can He show you His revelation through His word?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you cannot write, you would not be able to write a gospel tract.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to be highly educated, as high as we can attain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Acts 7:22 says, "Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.''</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Under God's sovereignty, Moses learned all the Egyptian wisdom while staying in the royal palace as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through his Egyptian education, he became highly cultured and received the highest learning of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not think that God will use your strength or energy for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to be used by God, we need to have a heart for Him and His interests, but our natural strength must be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God took the first forty years of Moses' life to build up a man who was strong in the natural life, and then He took another forty years to strip this man of all his natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the way God perfected Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The same principle holds true for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to endeavor to learn all that is useful, yet knowing that God will deal with our natural abilities and then use us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Young people should aspire to get the best grades and the highest degree, yet not hold on to nor depend on such things.</S>
