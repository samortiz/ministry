   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. God's Way Being Hidden in the Sea</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Revealed in His Sanctuary</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's way is hidden in the sea, and His paths in the great waters with His footsteps are not known to men v. 19 , but His way is revealed in His sanctuary v. 13 . The thought here is similar to that in Psalm 73 where the psalmist, puzzled by the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the seeking saints, said, "When I considered this in order to understand it,/It was troublesome in my sight,/Until I went into the sanctuary of God;/Then I perceived their end" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the sanctuary, the psalmist had a clear view of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Spiritually speaking, for us today God's sanctuary is our spirit and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many Christians neglect the matter of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some do not even realize that they have a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, many do not have a proper understanding concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without paying attention to our spirit and to the church, we cannot know God's way, which is revealed in His sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I thank the Lord that we in the Lord's recovery know both the spirit and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we were in Elden hall, we had a slogan: "In spirit, on the ground."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this slogan the word "spirit" refers to our regenerated human spirit, and the word "ground" denotes the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we have a twofold sanctuary: a private sanctuary the spirit and a public sanctuary the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of us can testify that certain secrets in the Bible were unknown to us until we went into this twofold sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we exercise our spirit and live in the church, God's way becomes clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may use the matter of marriage as an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the early years of my ministry, I would give many principles to those who consulted with me about whom they should marry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I discovered, however, that this did not work, and eventually I changed my practice regarding this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now if young people ask me concerning marriage, I will not give them any principles; instead, I will encourage them to exercise their spirit and to attend the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If those who are concerned about marriage will enter into the sanctuary of God by exercising their spirit and living in the church, they will know what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main point in Psalm 77 is that God's way is revealed in His sanctuary.</S>
