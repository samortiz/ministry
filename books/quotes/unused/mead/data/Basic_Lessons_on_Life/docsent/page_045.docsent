   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Vertically between the Father, the Son, and Us</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The flowing of the divine life within us first is vertical between the Father, the Son, and us 1 John 1:6, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Horizontally between Us, with One Another</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The flowing of the divine life, the fellowship of life, is also horizontally between us, with one another 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The horizontal aspect depends upon the vertical aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First John 1 says that we first have fellowship with the Father and the Son; then we have this fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our fellowship is wrong vertically with the Father and the Son, we cannot have the fellowship horizontally with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fellowship between us horizontally depends upon our fellowship with the Father and the Son vertically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This vertical and horizontal fellowship is like the weaving of a textile.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this vertical and horizontal fellowship, there is the mingling of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, the proper fellowship is the mingling of the Triune God with all the redeemed saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, the fellowship eventually consummates in the oneness of the Triune God with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This fellowship is the flow of the life of the Triune God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SOURCE OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ETERNAL LIFE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The source of the fellowship of life is the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First John 1:2-3 says that the eternal life has been reported to us that we may have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This word proves that the fellowship comes out of the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The eternal life is the source of this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just as the electrical current comes out of the power plant, the fellowship comes out of the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many in Christianity think that fellowship is a kind of social contact in a social association with social activities.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But fellowship is not a kind of social contact.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to reject that.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not want that.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The real and genuine fellowship among us originates in the eternal, divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the source is wrong, that is not the genuine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE MEANS OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The means by which the fellowship of life is carried out is the Holy Spirit, so it is called the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in 2 Corinthians 13:14.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy Spirit is the instrument, the means, that carries out this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, it is really hard for us in our experience to differentiate these three things: the fellowship, the life, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These three things are one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The life is the source, the fellowship is the flow, and the Spirit is the carrier, the means.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our experience we cannot differentiate them, but in our explanation of the truth we can.</S>
