   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PERSONAL LETTER Issue No. 12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To the brothers and sisters who have received the same heavenly calling in the Lord Jesus:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have not met with all of you here for over a year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that from other sources as well as through this magazine you all know that I have been ill.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Indeed, since 1926, my body has daily grown weaker.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have been ill time after time, and in addition, I have suffered from lack of rest due to the many responsibilities which are still upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My health has been increasingly deteriorating.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The writing of The Spiritual Man exhausted my strength, and since completing its writing, I have suffered continual illness even up till now.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I feel very sorry about one thing: During the past two years, I could not answer your letters on time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some of them I have not been able to answer at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although one or two brothers and sisters have answered on my behalf during my illness, we have still missed many letters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have to ask for your understanding in this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You are aware that normally I am busy enough.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With my sickness, I became even weaker.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that you will not be offended by this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I feel very grateful concerning this one thing: While I was perplexed on every side, a number of brothers and sisters in the Lord came to help me in my trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the resurrection of the just, may the Lord reward them richly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many brothers and sisters are aware that I do not have a constant livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So for the Lord's sake, from the north and from the south, they deprived themselves, generously and voluntarily supplying me with abundant gifts, that I need not be anxious during my illness concerning my lack.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their excellent kindness and favor toward me have been overflowing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Surely I am not worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am one of the most useless servants of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I quote Paul's words: "You sent both once and again to my need...I seek the fruit which increases to your account."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My only prayer is that your kindness toward me would not be for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that when I am up again, I may be able to accomplish a small portion of my work in God's enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Besides their financial supply, many brothers and sisters have written to show me their concern, and I express my thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I say to all who have ministered to me in such a way: Please accept my grateful, heartfelt thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, what I have experienced during my illness is most profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the very beginning I prayed that I would gain from this illness what I needed, for I am not willing to be ill for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As I look back over the past year, I can gratefully say that God's treatment is just right; not one single day could be omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many of these experiences cannot be made public, but I fully believe that they are for my personal enrichment and for your gain as well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now, through God's unlimited and inexhaustible grace and through your ceaseless prayers, once again I have returned from the gate of death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I look to the Lord that in a time convenient to Him He would bring me to complete recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At present I rest and at the same time work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I now present myself once more to God to accomplish His will and to serve His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many things concerning my personal future may have to change.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There may need to be a change in direction concerning the literature work, the local work, and the work in other provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My co-workers and I are seeking before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We desire to have deeper obedience under greater light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When "the pattern on the mount" is clear, very clear, we will inform you as well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since our conference last February, many have asked about the time for our next conference and would like to join us for such a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At present we cannot say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will wait until the Lord's will becomes apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Beloved brothers, the time of the Lord's coming back is fast approaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the days ahead we may suffer more misunderstanding and more severe opposition; but since we have been destined for this, we should remain faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The apostate ones will increase, so will the backsliding ones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Darkness will increase, and we will encounter more evil treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But all these things only show that the Lord is near.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During these days, God has said, "Let him who does unrighteousness do unrighteousness still; and let him who is filthy be filthy still; and let him who is righteous do righteousness still; and let him who is holy be holy still" Rev 22:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers, please continue to remember me in your prayers so that in all my afflictions I may be able to stand fast, faithfully bearing a good testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Just a few more miles beloved;</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And our feet shall ache no more;</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No more sin, and no more sorrow;</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hush thee, Jesus went before;</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And I hear Him sweetly whispering,</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"Faint not, fear not, still press on;</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For it may be ere tomorrow;</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The long journey will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The peace of the Lord be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A servant of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>December 1929</S>
