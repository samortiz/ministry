   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be sanctified in Christ Jesus is to be sanctified in the element and sphere of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is the element and sphere that separated us unto God, made us holy unto Him, when we believed in Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not only is Christ holy Christ Himself is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because God has put us into this Christ 1 Cor 1:30 , we have been put into the sphere of holiness.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be sanctified is to be made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, for the church to be sanctified in Christ Jesus is for the church to be made holy in Him.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Galatians 2:20 says that Christ loved me and gave Himself for me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we may pay attention to this verse, we may not pay adequate attention to Ephesians 5:25, where we are told that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Christ into whom the church was put by God loved the church and gave Himself up for it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ's loving the church and giving Himself up for the church was for redemption and for the impartation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to John 19:34, blood and water came out of the Lord's pierced side.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The blood was for redemption, and the water was for the impartation of life so that the church might come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Ephesians 5:25 we have the church coming into existence through Christ's loving her and giving Himself up for her.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of Christ</S>
