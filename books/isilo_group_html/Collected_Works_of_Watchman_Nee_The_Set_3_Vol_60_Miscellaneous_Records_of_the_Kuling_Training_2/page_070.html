A Christian should have only one goal, which is to maintain his spiritual walk and to uphold God's grace in this age. The Lord shows us through His commandments that a Christian should act in grace, not according to righteousness. The Lord wants Christians to deal with everything according to grace, not according to righteousness. If anyone slaps our right cheek, we should turn our left cheek to him. This means that we cannot be a politician or ruler. Our life reacts according to the principle of grace, not according to the principle of righteousness. This disqualifies us from becoming a ruler. A ruler must uphold the principle of righteousness among men. But as soon as a man insists on righteousness, he cannot be a Christian because a Christian is one who upholds grace. The Christian way of reacting in the realm of politics disqualifies him from holding any public office, high or low. Yet a Christian must recognize the political authority God has established. A Christian does not believe in anarchism. Genesis 9:6 says, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." A Christian believes in the death penalty, but he will never be an executioner. A Christian believes that nations should be ruled by governments, but he will never be a governor. Worldly people react according to the principle of righteousness, but Christians react according to the principle of grace. The Lord's commandment is that we turn the left cheek to those who slap us on the right cheek, yield our cloak to those who take our tunic, and walk an extra mile with those who compel us to walk one mile (Matt. 5:39-41). This is the Christian's reaction to people of the world. This does not mean that everyone in the world has to act the same way, yielding the left cheek when the right cheek is slapped, yielding a cloak when asked for a tunic, and going an extra mile when compelled to go one. But a Christian has to act this way. The world reacts by returning an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and blood for blood. This is absolutely contrary to a Christian's way of reacting. We do not believe, nor do we preach shedding blood for blood, but we know that very few Christians are willing to live according to the position on the mountain. We have to live according to the Sermon on the Mount, but we should not apply it to the world.</p><p>We must be clear about our attitude on this earth. We believe in government, and we support government. Christians, however, are not worthy of the world; we are a different race. We suffer willingly in order to bring the world blessing. However, our message is not our suffering but our gospel. Some suffer voluntarily, but that is a matter of their own choice. We have to tell the new ones that in this age, when the Lord is in heaven, we have to suffer willingly on earth. In 1 Corinthians 4:9 Paul said, "God has set forth us the apostles last of all as doomed to death." It is unnatural for Christians to assume authority or rulership on earth today. In the Old Testament Daniel and Esther reigned in foreign lands, but they did so at a time when the nation of Israel was destroyed. Under normal circumstances, a Jewish girl cannot be married to a Gentile, and even if she is married to a Gentile, she cannot be a queen. If she is, she may be stoned. Who would dare say that the kingdom of the heavens has been destroyed today, and that we are therefore justified in taking up governmental positions in China? We should never touch the politics of this age. In particular we should never be ruling authorities. If we are ordinary citizens, we have God's Word to guide us, even if we are citizens of India. But if we are rulers, there is no word to sanction our stand; we can only say that we want to do this ourselves. No Christian should be a ruler in this age.</p><h2 class="head2">Doing Our Best to Submit to Earthly Government</h2><p>A Christian should not be the ruler of a nation, but he should do his best to submit to earthly government. Romans 13:1-7 says, "Let every person be subject to the authorities over him, for there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God. So then he who resists the authority...will receive judgment to themselves....Fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due." You have to read these words to the new believers. Our way is to teach every person to be subject to the authority over him. This is our stand. We do not assume authority; rather, we want others to assume authority so that we ourselves can submit to authority. We believe that the authority of all earthly government is from God. As far as the principle of authority goes, all rulers are appointed by God. God arranges all the things on this earth, and the authorities which exist are ordained by God. He who resists authority opposes God's ordination. We have to learn to submit to all authority, whether great or small. We cannot oppose any authority. On the one hand, believers should not touch any politics. On the other hand, they should submit to all political powers. In this world God has entrusted authority to man. Anyone who opposes authority is opposing God's ordination. Those who oppose will receive judgment to themselves. Verse 4 says that those who are in authority are servants of God and are there for our good. They do not bear the sword in vain. Authority is established by God. We submit to them because they punish evil. Even when some punish the good and reward the evil in practice, they at least will claim in name that they are punishing the evil and rewarding the good. They can only be false in their conduct; they can never be false in their principle. In principle, all authority established by God punishes evil and rewards good.</p><p>Verse 5 says, "Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience." Wrath is from man, while the sense in our conscience is from God. If we do not submit, our conscience immediately bothers us. We also will come under wrath. We have to be obedient in the matter of taxation. Whatever the government orders us to pay materially, we have to obey. God has appointed earthly governments to take charge of earthly affairs. We should pay our taxes to support the government in all its expenditures (v. 6). In verse 7 we are given clear injunctions concerning our attitude in such matters. In summary, "Render to all the things due: tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due." This is the basic commandment that the Lord has given us. We have to do our best to uphold this.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_069.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_071.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 70</div><br></body></html>
