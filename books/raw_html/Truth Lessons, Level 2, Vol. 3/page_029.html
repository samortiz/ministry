<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>17. The Abiding Place</H2><P>To the believers Christ is also their abiding place. In John 15:4 the Lord said, "Abide in Me." The Greek word for abide means not only to remain in a certain place but to dwell there, even to make our home there. Christ is our abiding place, our home, and we can abide in Him to have fellowship with Him and enjoy all His riches. For this reason, we need to continually abide in Him, settle down in Him, and take Him as our abiding place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>18. The All-inclusive One<br>with the Unsearchable Riches</H2><P>Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is the One who fills all in all. Christ, as the infinite God, is without any limitation and is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such an all-extensive and all-filling Christ has the unsearchable riches (3:8). These riches are what Christ is to us, what He has for us, and what He has accomplished, attained, and obtained for us. These riches of Christ are unsearchable and untraceable. As God, He is the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Lord, and the Christ. As man, He is the Apostle, the Shepherd, the Forerunner, and the Captain of our salvation. There are countless aspects of the riches of what Christ is, for He is the reality of all positive things in the universe, and all positive things signify Christ. Therefore, when He was on earth, He could use so many things as illustrations of Himself. He could say, "I am the door" (John 10:9) and "I am the way" (14:6). To us He is also the real light, life, breath, water, food, clothing, and dwelling place.</P><P>The unsearchable riches of Christ are all the fullness of the Godhead, spoken of in Colossians 2:9, which fullness now dwells bodily in Christ. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead, but the expression of the riches of what God is. When Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, all the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in Him as One who has a human body. Therefore, the divine attributes and human virtues are included in the unsearchable riches of Christ. Christ is love, light, holiness, righteousness, wisdom, and power; He is also humility, patience, sincerity, and goodness.</P><P>In the Old Testament, the good land of Canaan, which God gave to the children of Israel, is a complete type of Christ as the all-inclusive One (Deut. 8:7-10; 11:11-12). The produce of the good land portrays the unsearchable riches of Christ. Christ as the all-inclusive One is the genuine good land to the believers. All His unsearchable riches have been given to us to be our portion, a portion which we can never exhaust. We should do our best to experience, enjoy, and apply such an all-inclusive One that we may obtain all His unsearchable riches.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>SUMMARY</H1><P>As our portion for our experience and enjoyment Christ is also the life-giving Spirit. In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit who, with His life essence and all that He is, is in us for our experience and enjoyment, and as such, He is the freeing and transforming Spirit. As the Spirit, the Lord not only gives us freedom, freeing us from the bondage of the law, but also transforms us that we may have His glorious image. He is also the door through which God's people leave the sheepfold and come into the pasture. Since we have such a Christ, we are no longer under the custody of the law; rather, we are under the supply of grace. Christ is also the pasture, the feeding place for the sheep, in which we can enjoy His abundant life supply. He is also the Shepherd, who laid down His soul-life to accomplish redemption for us that we may share His divine life and live under His shepherding to become one flock. He is also the vine, and as such, He is life and everything to us, His branches. When we abide in the Lord as the vine and enjoy all the supply of His abundant life, we bear much fruit by the overflow of the abundance of the inner life. He is also the abiding place, in which we abide to have fellowship with Him and enjoy all His riches. He is also the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches, including the divine attributes and human virtues. As the reality of all positive things in the universe, the genuine good land to the believers, He has given to us all His unsearchable riches to be our portion for us to apply, experience, and enjoy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain how the life-giving Spirit is the reality and life pulse of Christ's resurrection.</li><li>How can we experience Christ as the freeing and transforming Spirit?</li><li>Briefly explain how Christ is the door, the pasture, and the Shepherd for our experience and enjoyment.</li><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ being the vine and us being the branches.</li><li>Briefly explain the unsearchable riches of the all- inclusive Christ.</li></ol>
