<H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER SIXTEEN</H1><P>Verse 1:"And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Him asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven." The Pharisees and Sadducees had a new agreement. In chapter fifteen the Pharisees and the scribes were joined together. The Pharisees and scribes were not absolutely opposing one another, but the Pharisees and the Sadducees were opponents of one another, yet they came in one accord to test the Lord. They tested the Lord because of unbelief. The gimmicks of the unbelieving ones are the same. In chapter twelve the Pharisees and the scribes asked for a sign because of unbelief. Why then did they ask for a sign again? The Pharisees, the scribes, and the Sadducees were Jews specializing in asking for signs. The sign they asked for in chapter twelve was to satisfy their own curiosity. Here it was purely for testing the Lord and not necessarily for them to see the strangeness of a sign. The Lord kept His former decision and would not change. People in the world make improvements, but the Lord does not, for He is perfect (Heb. 13:8) and His thought never changes. Testing means unbelief. To have faith is to believe in God's word. Without God's word, man has only sin—unbelief and disobedience. Unbelief is the root, and disobedience is the issue. To test the Lord is an indication of one's not believing in Him. It seems that the Pharisees and the Sadducees were saying, "We will not believe unless you perform something for us to see." This is just like people in the world wanting to see God before they believe in Him, or like a school testing the students before admitting them. But the Lord will never perform a sign to subject Himself to be tested by men. The Lord can perform signs, but not to be examined or controlled by men. He will not attract the unbelieving ones by performing signs for them.</P><P>Verses 2-3:Because they talked about heaven, the Lord spoke on the same thing. He rebuked them, saying that they could discern the signs in the sky yet could not discern the signs of the times. The Lord acknowledged that they were scientists. The unbelieving ones today are the same. In the Lord's eyes they know only that a certain cause produces a certain effect, but they do not know the signs of the times. It is very easy for people to neglect the signs of the times. It is most unfortunate that the signs are present, yet people do not see them. Their self-satisfaction (just like the scientists') makes them blind. Since signs already exist, the Lord would no longer perform other signs. The sign at this time is the cross.</P><P>Verse 4:"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah. And He left them and went away." The sign of Jonah testifies of the Lord's death and resurrection. Jonah had to leave his own place; the Lord did the same. "Evil" here refers to man's nature; "adulterous" denotes improper communications. From this we see that not only one but everyone is evil. Therefore, the Lord left them.</P><P>Verses 5-6:To beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees is to beware of the temptation of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees is like leaven, which has the possibility to ferment. They said things and did not do them; they tried to reform others, but they themselves would not be reformed (Matt. 23:3). Therefore, we need to be careful in making friends. The unbelievers and the ungodly ones can contaminate us and leaven us. The Pharisees represent the dead conservatives, while the Sadducees represent the modernists. The leaven here means to ask the Lord to do something first before one will believe (or do a certain thing); this is tempting the Lord. The Lord warned us because it is possible that we might become leavened.</P><P>Verse 7:"But they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we did not take bread." The disciples were puzzled. They misunderstood the Lord because they thought leaven was for making bread. This is a misinterpretation of the Bible, thinking that leaven is related to bread. This kind of erroneous logic is most common today. This kind of misinterpretation also shows their unbelief and their foolishness. Even if they did not take bread, would the Lord have said such a word? The disciples forgot the case of the Lord's multiplying the loaves. Subjectiveness easily leads to misinterpretation.</P><P>Verses 8-12:Nothing can be hidden from the Lord. To have little faith is not to be without faith. But the Lord is not satisfied with those who have little faith. Reasoning indicates little faith. When men misinterpret the Scriptures, it is always their fault, not God's. The summary of 15:1—16:12 is that this generation must beware of the leaven of the Pharisees.</P><P>Verses 13-20:From this point on, the Lord began to reveal Himself; prior to this time He had only given hints concerning Himself. The phrase "from that time" in verse 21 is the center, the backbone, of the book of Matthew. Caesarea Philippi derived its name from Caesar and Philippi; the latter was the brother of Herod. This is a strange way to derive a name. The church is built at the center of the Gentile land.</P><P>Verse 13:"Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?" Why did the Lord call Himself the Son of Man? Names are quite important in the Scriptures. In the Epistles the Lord is called mainly the Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ because salvation has been accomplished. In the Gospels He is called the Son of God or the Son of Man because salvation was not yet accomplished. In Acts He is called God's Servant (3:13) until the time of the incident at the house of Cornelius. "The Son of Man" indicates that (1) He was rejected, (2) He was glorified for our sake, and (3) He is a man. Here it refers to the matters after the Lord was rejected.</P><P>Verse 14:"And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets." John was very much like one who rendered service to people, Elijah was most zealous for religion, and Jeremiah was most pessimistic. No one would acknowledge (believe) that the Lord was the Christ. John had testified that the Lord was the Son of God, yet people still said that He was a prophet.</P>
