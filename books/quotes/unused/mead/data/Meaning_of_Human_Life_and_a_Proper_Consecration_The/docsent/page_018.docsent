   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>STANDING ON THE GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE LOCAL CHURCH CONTINUAL CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the previous chapters we said that consecration is to take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I hope that you will enter into this speaking and treasure this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to continually experience consecration until it is something ordinary, regular, and normal in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we consecrate ourselves, take Christ as our person, we are practicing Paul s word in Galatians 2:20: It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This kind of consecration is not an occasional experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are becoming the Lord s dwelling place by letting Him make His home in our heart and be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will need our whole life and even eternity to fully enter into this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>GOD CREATING A CORPORATE MAN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God created man to be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Genesis 1:26-28 shows that God did not create many men; He created only one man Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 26 says, God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Hebrew word translated as man in this verse is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would like to ask whether God created only one man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not so easy to answer this question, because in verse 26 man is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 27 says, God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says that God created only one man 2:7 , and then God took a rib from this man, Adam, and built a woman vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After creating man, God blessed them and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth 1:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although God created one man, this man was to fill the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, verse 26 implies that God created a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God does not intend for people to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He intends for people to be in groups.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although the human race is fallen, communities and societies confirm that there is an inclination and a desire in human nature to have a corporate living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose someone offers you ten million U.S. dollars and the most comfortably furnished and decorated house located on a mountain and an expensive, stylish car on the condition that you must enjoy these things by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must not live in a community, nor are you allowed to live with your parents, siblings, wife, or children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You must enjoy the riches, the mansion, and the car by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You probably would not be willing to accept such a gift, because you would be very lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man was created with a desire to live in a community and with the need to communicate with other people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God does not want an individual man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He wants a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, as a result of the fall, human society is full of tension.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, we cannot live without others, that is, without social connections.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must form groups or societies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the other hand, these social groups are filled with sin, selfishness, treacheries, striving, and backstabbing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>People despise one another, look down on one another, and slander one another.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These situations come from Satan and are a result of man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are not according to the original state of man s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God does not want individuals or a society full of strife and dispute.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He wants a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The principle of being corporate is the principle of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>GOD S SALVATION MAKING US</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>MEMBERS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has no intention for us to express or represent Christ individually.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The desire in God s heart is to gain an entity that would express and represent Him in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This expression and representation is corporate; it is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This Body, this corporate entity, is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we take Christ as our person, the less we are individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our former person, though created by God, became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the old man, our person was individualistic, secluded, and odd.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are all peculiar, but the Lord has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He does not want us to live an individualistic life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He wants us to live the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, after saving us, He put us in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before we were saved, we were a complete unit unto ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, after we are saved, we are no longer complete unto ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After we are saved, we become a member of the Body; as such, we cannot be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As a person with a physical body, it is possible to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If I do not get along with someone, I can go to the north and he can go south.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, as a member, I cannot be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A hand cannot say to the body, I do not like you; therefore, I am leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I will not serve you anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A hand cannot exist apart from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Similarly, the eyes cannot say that they dislike the body and will therefore leave the body and exist by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After a person is saved, he becomes a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As a member of the Body, he has to stay in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we are members of the Body but are not in the Body, we are cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once a member is cut off, he is finished, and he loses his life and function and, at the same time, becomes quite uncomely 1 Cor 12:23 .</S>
