<P>Recently eleven full-time co-workers who had been trained in Taipei and had been sent to the countryside in Taiwan to raise up new churches were charged to return to Taipei and take care of the work among the students on the university campuses. There are more than twenty universities in Taipei, and several of these are very large. The academic standard in these universities is quite high. First, these co-workers studied and investigated to find the way to gain the young people on the campuses. They found out that the church had some young people studying in the universities already. Then, they also found out that in the summer, before the beginning of fall classes, the government held an examination for the high school graduates to determine their qualifications for entering into different kinds of universities. After that examination, all the schools announced who had been accepted. They made available a list of names with addresses. The co-workers succeeded in getting the names and addresses of the entering students, and they began to contact each one through the brothers and sisters who were students in the different schools. The brothers and sisters offered to help these incoming students in various ways. They made an appointment with them to contact them when they arrived at the universities and to help them with the various matters related to their getting settled. This was a very good beginning.</P><P>Then, second, they convinced them to stay not in the school dormitories but in the brothers' and sisters' houses. Taipei has almost sixty brothers' and sisters' houses, with nearly four hundred college-age young people living in those houses. A considerable effort is required to convince the new ones to stay in those houses. Their parents also must be convinced that our intention is positive. Later, after their children have stayed in the brothers' and sisters' houses for three or four months, the parents observe a change in the lives of their children. Because of this, the parents are no longer apprehensive about their children; rather, they appreciate their living in the brothers' and sisters' houses.</P><P>Third, the eleven co-workers, along with some mature ones in the Lord, work on the new ones every day from 6:30 in the morning to help them to practice the morning revival. Throughout the day they prepare many things and do many things for the new ones. They help the new ones to schedule their time. Finally, every evening before going to bed they have an evening prayer time, along with some fellowship concerning the truth. Twice a week this prayer and fellowship time lasts one hour. In that hour the co-workers train the students how to compose a prophecy from the morning revival points. The students are also assigned a spiritual book to read. During the evening time they come together and fellowship concerning what they gained from that book. They do this every week, week after week. The co-workers also share with the students concerning how to be a priest of the gospel by contacting people and preaching the gospel to them. The students also meet in groups with different families in the church. Although the meetings are in the saints' homes, they are carried out mainly by the students. Because they are so burdened for their group meetings, once a week the students fast and pray for the new ones in the group. The full-timers in Taipei have been successful mainly because they have transferred the burden of the work to the students. The students themselves have picked up the burden, but they are under the perfecting of the full-timers. Eventually, when these students graduate, a number of them will be ready for the full-time training.</P><P>All of us who are now in the recovery should pick up a burden to practice certain steps of the God-ordained way. In order to have a definite beginning in the practice of the God-ordained way, each one should pick up a particular item as a particular burden. The first step is to get people saved to become members of the Lord's Body. We must study this matter and get into it, and we also need to cooperate with others. We also need to pick up the further item of feeding and cherishing the new ones. This will require much learning. We should not consider this as something common. Merely visiting the new ones, speaking to them concerning the Lord, and teaching them some portions of the Bible are too common and too natural. We must study the situation and find the proper and particular way to carry out our burden.</P><P>We should endeavor to practice the group meetings with no formality, no religious service, and no religious worship. We should meet together simply as believers in Christ coming together to fellowship, making everything so natural. However, we also need to practice the main points of a group meeting. The main thing is to carry out the mutual teaching. We do not need a teacher to come to teach us; we should teach one another. All the attendants in the group meetings have the right to ask questions mutually, and everyone has the right to answer mutually. In this way the saints' knowledge of the truth will increase every week, and they will be educated and perfected. Those who are burdened for the practice of the group meetings can come together to pray and even fast for the group meetings. They can study together and find out the secrets, and then they can go to the groups to give them some instructions and help them to practice, without doing anything to replace the other members of the group.</P><P>Those who have a burden to improve the prophesying in the church meetings must bear the burden and get others to work with them. They must study and learn the secrets. Then with what they have learned they should instruct others. They also need to pray concerning whom they should go to and fellowship with concerning prophesying. During their fellowship with others they should pass on to them their own experience. They should teach others face to face, allowing them to practice and correcting them so that they can improve. In this way our prophesying meetings will be very much uplifted. Those who are burdened for the prophesying can gather a number of brothers and sisters and come together each week to investigate how to improve the prophesying and how to teach others to prophesy. This is worthwhile.</P>
