   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE FORTY LIFE S PRAYER 3 B. In the Triune God through Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by the Holy Word</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to the second factor of genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first factor is being in the Father s name by the eternal life, and the second is being in the Triune God through sanctification by the holy word vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The holy word is the sanctifying word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second stage, or the second ground, of oneness is separation from the world by the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we all have been born of the same Father and into the same family, it is regrettable that many of the brothers and sisters are not home, but have been attracted to worldly things such as surfing, movies, sports, and even gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have been attracted by such worldly things, although we are all children of the Father and have the same life, it will be difficult for us to keep the genuine oneness because we are still in the world and are unsanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After we have been born again as the children of God, we must be separated from the world by the holy word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word of the Lord has the sanctifying power to separate us from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once we have been separated from the world by the holy word, we shall be centralized to realize genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Two Kinds of Words Given</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>by the Son to His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 14 the Lord said, I have given them Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord has given the believers two kinds of words: the logos, the constant word vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>14, 17 , and the rhema, the instant word v. 8 .Both kinds of words are holy, having the sanctifying power to separate the believers from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more we take either the Lord s constant word or instant word into us, the more we are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we are nourished, saturated, and permeated with the Lord s constant or instant word, the holier we become.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And the more holiness we partake of, the more we are in the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The World</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First John 5:19 says that the whole world lies in the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The evil one is the devil, and the world is an evil system arranged systematically and ruled by the devil, Satan John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan has systematized all the things on earth, especially those related to mankind, and the things in the air into his kingdom of darkness to possess people, to distract them from the enjoyment of God, and to frustrate them from fulfilling God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every aspect of the world, regardless of what it is, belongs to this satanic system.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the whole world lies in the evil one, the believers must be kept from the evil one v. 15 , and they need to pray to be delivered from the evil one Matt 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Believers with the World</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The believers are not of the world vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>14, 16 but are separated from the world v. 19 . They have not been taken out of the world v. 15 but have been sent into the world for the Lord s commission v. 18 . Verse 18 says, As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Father sent the Son into the world with Himself as life and everything to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way, the Son sends His believers into the world with Himself as their life and their everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Son sends us, the believers, in the same way as the Father sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I came to this country, I had the deep sense within that the Lord had sent me, and I could say to Him, Lord, You sent me to this country.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since You have sent me, You must come with me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, if You won t go, I won t go either.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the way the Lord sends us into the world for His testimony.</S>
