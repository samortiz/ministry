   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MEETING BY DENYING OUR SELF AND EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we come to the Lord's table meeting, we should cross out what we know.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not pray according to what we know or what we like to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must cross out our decision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since we have encouraged the brothers and sisters to participate in the meetings, many have truly been convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, before the Lord's table a brother may prepare to offer a prayer about the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then he considers John 3:16 and the constraining love of Christ in 2 Corinthians 5:14 until he is burdened in his emotions and makes the decision to offer a prayer about this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we pray in this way, our prayer will be deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to learn to cross out what we know, cross out what we like, and cross out what we decide to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now when we come to the meeting, we will say, "Lord, I am open.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My mind, emotion, and will have all been crossed out, and there is nothing of me left."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we will exercise to speak something from within, and whatever we say will be of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The way to differentiate the spirit from the soul is to take the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should learn to apply this to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we first practice this, many times after denying our self we will seem blank.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, after a certain time of practice, it will be very easy to have something after we deny our self, because our spirit will be exercised to be very sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After a certain period of practice and exercise, our spirit will be sensitive, and we will be used to the sensitivity of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all need to learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By way of testimony, I can tell you that even today I was not clear what I should minister.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the morning I thought that I should come to a different point, but by the afternoon I had a real burden to speak something else.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I denied my thought and said, "Lord, what is Your mind about the next point I should speak on?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Most Christians today do not know the proper way to have a church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They have their meeting merely according to traditions, forms, and regulations, either written or understood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we all will learn the lesson how to deny the soul and let something spring up from within the spirit, our meetings will be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What passage in the New Testament tells us to meet in the way we do today?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We learned the way we are taking today from our background in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We start the meeting with a hymn, but where is the scriptural ground for this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to break our traditional, formal, natural, old ways from our background.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you ask me what the right way to meet is, I would say that I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One thing I do know, however, is that when we all come together, we have to come in the way of denying the mind, denying the emotion, and denying the will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we will see what comes up from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a recent prayer meeting I was very happy that we did not start with a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We simply started to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes to not use any hymns will take us to the highest heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually some hymns were called, but they were an interruption to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time I myself chose a hymn only to help bring us back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes we have to follow in the wrong direction to bring people back to the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is what the Lord did with those two disciples on the way to Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we simply should have prayed, perhaps even until midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What a bondage traditional knowledge is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, release, and freedom 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I cannot tell you what the right way for Christians to meet is, but I do believe the proper way is that we have to come together by denying the mind, the emotion, and the will, along with all our forms.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must simply do one thing exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then let us see what comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have a heavy burden about this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To discard all the traditional ways is a revelation, even a revolution.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not have any scriptural ground to prove that the present way for our meetings is right.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not know what the proper way is, but I do know that what we must do is deny the soul and meet not according to knowledge but according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then the Holy Spirit will have the free way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The way to differentiate the spirit from the soul is to deny the negative thing; then the positive thing will spring up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Learn to do this, and try to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then you will see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>KNOWING THE SPIRIT BY LIFE, PEACE, AND FREEDOM</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are two main verses in the Bible that give us the way to know the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Romans 8:6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Similarly, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Romans 8 there are two key words: life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then 2 Corinthians 3 speaks of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Life, peace, and freedom, or release, are the way to know the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever we have life, peace, and release within, we are in the way of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For the way to know that we are in the flesh, there is just one word: death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Death is versus life, peace, and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we have death within, we do not have life, and neither do we have peace or freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If someone is full of death, there is no need for him to argue that he is not in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is by death that we know the flesh, and in the same principle it is by life, peace, and release that we know the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In our physical body there is a life, yet it is hard for anyone to show us the life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a medical doctor examines a dead body, he cannot find death itself, but the life is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We know that there is life or death in a body by the expressions of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we come to someone and see the expression of death, this shows that his life is gone; then we know that this is a dead person.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is also by certain expressions that we know there is life in a person.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the same way, the way to know the spirit is by its expressions, which are revealed in the above two verses: life, peace, and freedom.</S>
