 <h2 class="head1">THE VISIONS INSERTED<br />
BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH TRUMPETS</h2>
<p>Revelation 10:1&mdash;11:13 is the second insertion in this book, between the sixth and seventh trumpets. As we have seen, chapter seven is the first insertion, between the sixth and seventh seals, and later we will see that there is a third insertion between the sixth and seventh bowls (16:13-16). Why is there the need of an insertion between the sixth and seventh trumpets? It is because this point is very close to the time when the Lord Jesus will come back to take possession of the earth, which He has redeemed and which He has the full right to possess. Moreover, at the time of the sixth trumpet and before the seventh, the two witnesses come to the earth to testify strongly to people that they must repent to God. At least these two matters are mentioned in the second insertion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Coming to Possess the Earth</h2>
<p>Revelation 10:1 says, &ldquo;And I saw another strong Angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud.&rdquo; Chapter eight also speaks of &ldquo;another Angel&rdquo; (vv. 3-5). That Angel is Christ Himself. <em>Clothed with a cloud</em> indicates that this is a time prior to that spoken of in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. In Revelation 14:14, which corresponds to 1 Thessalonians 4, the Lord sits on a cloud, but in Revelation 10:1 He is clothed with a cloud, that is, hidden in a cloud.</p>
<p>Revelation 10:1 continues, &ldquo;And the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was like the sun, and His feet like pillars of fire.&rdquo; The rainbow indicates that when the Lord Jesus comes back to take possession of the earth by His judgment, He will remind Himself of His covenant concerning the earth. Fire, as mentioned in verse 1, is for judgment, and pillars signify strength and steadfastness.</p>
<p>Verse 2 says, &ldquo;And He had in His hand a little opened scroll. And He placed His right foot on the sea and the left on the land.&rdquo; This scroll is the same one mentioned in chapter five. In chapter five He took the scroll, and now He has it in His hand. For someone to set his foot on something, as in 10:2, means that he is taking possession of it, just as God told the people of Israel to possess the land of Canaan by treading it with the soles of their feet (Deut. 11:24; Josh. 1:3). This indicates that at this time the Lord is ready to come back to possess the earth and the sea.</p>
<p>Verses 3 to 6 say, &ldquo;And He cried out with a loud voice just as a lion roars. And when He cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices. And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, and I heard a voice out of heaven saying, Seal the things which the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them. And the Angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up His right hand to heaven and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there shall be delay no longer.&rdquo; That the Angel lifted up His right hand to heaven indicates that Christ is ready to judge the earth and possess it through His judgment. That there shall be delay no longer means that there will be no more time of toleration in God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth.</p>
<p>Verse 7 says, &ldquo;But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to trumpet, then the mystery of God is finished, as He has announced the good news to His own slaves the prophets.&rdquo; At this time there is no more mystery; everything is completed and unveiled. God announced this good news to the prophets. In the Old Testament time God preached a kind of glad tidings to the prophets concerning His eternal purpose; now at this point what He preached is accomplished. This is a great verse, telling us that at the time the seventh trumpet is sounded, the mystery of God is finished.</p>
<p>Verses 8 through 10 say, &ldquo;And the voice which I heard out of heaven, I heard again speaking with me and saying, Go, take the opened scroll in the hand of the Angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. And I went to the Angel and told Him to give me the little scroll. And He said to me, Take it and devour it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey. And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the Angel and devoured it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth; and when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.&rdquo; When we take the word of God, it is very sweet, but when we begin to experience it, we often taste bitterness.</p>
<p>Verse 11 continues, &ldquo;And they said to me, You must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.&rdquo; The word <em>again</em> is very important. Chapters four through eleven comprise the first section of prophecy in this book. The second section of the prophecy of this book is chapters twelve through twenty-two. From this point, John must prophesy again in the second section.</p>
<p>At the time between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet, the Lord Jesus is ready to come back to take possession of this earth through His judgment. As such, He is the One with the scroll, the &ldquo;title deed,&rdquo; in His hand. He has the right to take possession of this earth because He has redeemed it. At this point, He is ready, and the time is near, for the seventh trumpet is about to be sounded. At the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, the mystery of God will be completed.</p>
