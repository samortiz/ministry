<h2 class=head3>1. Bringing a Sword</h2><p>“I will bring a sword upon you that will execute vengeance for the covenant” (v. 25a). This signifies that in the church there will be fightings among the brothers. Fightings among the brothers is a sign of God’s chastisement.<h2 class=head3>2. Sending the Pestilence</h2><p>“If you are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you” (v. 25b). This signifies that in the church there will be some kind of contagious disease. The “germs” of this disease are spread mainly through gossip and vain talk.<h2 class=head3>3. Delivering the People into the Hand of the Enemy</h2><p>“You shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy” (v. 25c). This signifies that the believers in the church will be taken over by the enemy. During my history in the church life, I have seen such a thing happen a few times.<h2 class=head3>4. Cutting Off the Supply of Bread So That It Will Be Delivered by Weight and People Will Not Be Satisfied</h2><p>“When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they will deliver again your bread by weight; and you will eat and not be satisfied” (v. 26). This signifies that in the church the spiritual supply will be cut off to a greatly reduced amount, so that there will be no satisfaction for the believers. We also have seen this happen in the church life. In a certain church there was a long period of time when there was no distribution of the spiritual food supply. As a result, in that church there was starvation.<h2 class=head2>E. On the Fifth Level— Being Disciplined Sevenfold Again</h2><p>In the chastisement on the fifth level the people are disciplined sevenfold again (vv. 27-39).
