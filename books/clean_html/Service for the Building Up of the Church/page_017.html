<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS NEEDING<br />
TO FORBEAR ALL THINGS AND<br />
ACCEPT THE BREAKING<br />
TO BE JOINED AND KNIT TOGETHER</h2>
<p>In a local church there may be some who love the world and others who are spiritually weak, but there is no valid basis for any separation. In order for the church to be built up, we must learn to be joined together and knit together with others. Even if we feel that a certain brother is fleshly or that a certain sister has a strange temperament, we should still be willing to be joined together and knit together with them.</p>
<p>Is there any brother or sister who has no element of the flesh or no strangeness in temperament? We must admit that we are all the same. At the most there is a difference only in the degree of our blackness as &ldquo;pots&rdquo; and &ldquo;kettles.&rdquo; Consider the different preferences that we have for food. Some like spicy food, and some like lightly seasoned food; some like soy sauce, and others like garlic. There are many different preferences for food; similarly, there are many different brothers and sisters in every local church.</p>
<p>There was a brother in Shanghai who would come to every meeting and pray without any inspiration of the Spirit. When the responsible brothers asked him not to pray, he did not get angry. Instead, he came to the next bread-breaking meeting and prayed, saying, &ldquo;Lord, the responsible brothers asked me not to open my mouth, but no one is praying. Therefore, I must open my mouth.&rdquo; Then the responsible brothers again asked him to not pray, because his prayers were not edifying. Nevertheless, he continued to pray in the meetings. We should not think that this brother is strange, because everyone is strange in some way. Our strangeness varies only in terms of degree.</p>
<p>It is impossible for people to be joined together and knit together naturally. Man is by nature a loner. If we live by our natural man, sooner or later we will be separated from the brothers and sisters. In the building up of the church, being joined together and knit together are a great test. Even though there are many things that can stop us from being joined together and knit together with others, we need to be joined together and knit together with the brothers and sisters in the church. This joining and knitting involves two points that I will speak of briefly.</p>
<p>First, we need to forbear all things. The time that we need to fellowship with particular saints and to forbear them the most is when we feel that we are not getting along with them. God often arranges for some particularly strange saints to be around us in the church so that we can learn the lesson of forbearance. In any case, we should make demands only on ourselves, not on those who are around us. We should not make demands on others, no matter what their condition is. On the one hand, we should be willing to ask ourselves whether we are the source of our inability to be joined with other brothers and sisters. On the other hand, we must forbear the genuine problems of others; we should make no demands on them. Their strangeness should not be a limitation on our forbearance. Without forbearance, we cannot be joined together and knit together with others.</p>
<p>Second, we need to accept the Lord&rsquo;s breaking. Even if we have a meek and kind nature, we will eventually have problems with people. In our natural life we have no way to be joined with others. Ultimately, we must let the Lord break our natural life.</p>
<p>To speak of our natural life being broken may seem rather abstract. Let me explain with a practical example of serving in the church. Some people can serve only in a &ldquo;new&rdquo; way, in a way that completely disregards the ways of others. They feel that their way is the best and the most effective. If others do not take their way, they become unenthusiastic and cease to serve. Still others must do everything by themselves when they serve, and they trample upon others. Overthrowing others and trampling upon others are manifestations of the natural man. In the natural man, there is no way to be joined with others; there is only isolated service that tears down rather than builds up. In order to be joined together with others, we must let the Lord break our individualistic, natural self. We should learn to respect others and enable others to serve. We should accommodate the views of others rather than disregard them. This is a great test; it requires us to consider others more excellent than ourselves, to trust others, to accommodate others, and to hand ourselves over to others.</p>
<p>This is the greatest key to the building up of the church. In order to be joined with others in the Lord, we must learn many lessons before God. If we are willing to accept the Lord&rsquo;s breaking, to allow Him to deal with our natural and individualistic elements, and to coordinate with others in one accord in every service, the church will have no problems, and the saints will be joined together and knit together and will be genuinely built up. Then the church will be immensely useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
