   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE PRINCIPLES FOR THE LEADING ONES AND THE WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following fourteen points are crucial principles for the leading ones and the workers in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BEARING THE TESTIMONY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A local church must bear the testimony of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's recovery is for the testimony of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This term, "the testimony of the Body of Christ," is all-embracing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A local church should not give people the impression that it bears a particular characteristic with a particular color or a particular flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every local church must bear the testimony of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not do anything particular.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do anything particular, we will spoil the local churches' testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the local churches should and must bear one unique testimony, that is, the testimony of Jesus which has become the testimony of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should endeavor by the Lord's mercy to delete, to reduce, and even to eliminate any particular characteristic, any particular flavor, or any particular color in your locality, in my locality, and in any other's locality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the churches should just bear one unique characteristic, one particular color, and one particular flavor the testimony of Jesus which is the testimony of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we would all take care of this, we would never do things which only fit in our local church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must do things which fit in all the local churches and which would not damage or confuse the testimony of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BEING THE SAME AS THE OTHER CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do everything under the consideration of all the other churches, trying to be the same as the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To do something merely under the consideration of the church in your locality which you are in is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It might be very good for your church, yet it may damage the testimony of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Always try to be the same, not different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all know that with the fallen human beings and in our human nature to be different from others is a pride, a boast, and a glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even in today's education there is a kind of promotion of this kind of boastful difference.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we must consider that in the Lord's recovery to be different from the other churches is a shame and an insult to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are the heavenly people, not the earthly people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the earthly people to be different is for an earthly purpose and it is a boast and a glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, for the heavenly people and for God's heavenly purpose, God does not want and neither would He allow us to be different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He only has one move by one ministry to produce and build up one Body to bear one unique testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How then could we differ?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The children of Israel provide us with a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>More than two million people traveled together, marched together, bore the same ark, and had the same tabernacle for their worship center.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was nothing different with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the record or the revelation of the Old Testament type, difference is utterly prohibited.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Anyone who would invent anything different, had to be cut off from God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a serious thing in God's eyes to make a difference because God has only one move.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The type of the children of Israel shows us there is only one move by one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In typology the Old Testament ministry carried out one thing the tabernacle with the ark to bear one testimony which is God Himself mingled with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To make a little difference in your local church from all the other churches is a serious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can see an example of this by looking at our own physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a doctor only cares for the arm of his patient, this care may damage the entire body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A good doctor or a surgeon never does things in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever he does, he does it under the full consideration of the entire body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a proper doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Otherwise, you may think you are healing a person, but after two hours he dies because of your "healing."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In like manner, in everything we do we must consider the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must also consider what kind of impression we will leave to the Christians for the future.</S>
