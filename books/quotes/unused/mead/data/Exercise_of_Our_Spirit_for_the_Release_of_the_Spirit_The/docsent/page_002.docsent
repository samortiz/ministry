   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE OUR COOPERATION WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:26-27; Jude 20; 2 Cor 3:17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these messages we would like to fellowship regarding the release of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must realize that the relationship between God and us is a relationship in the spirit because the Spirit of God dwells in our spirit, works together with our spirit, and is even joined and mingled together with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 8:16 says that the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 tells us that we are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These verses prove that the divine Spirit and our human spirit have been mingled together to be one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>COOPERATING WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit in our spirit is constantly moving, working, and acting in us in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First John 2:27 says that the anointing which we have received from the Lord abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse does not use the word ointment but the word anointing, which implies the movement or application of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ointment is the Spirit, and the anointing is the action or movement of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, this verse proves that the Holy Spirit, who is within us today as the ointment, is constantly moving, working, and acting in us in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is similar to the electricity in a house, which continually circulates throughout the house as a current.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there is no current, practically speaking there is no electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, in order for there to be a current of electricity in the house, the electricity must constantly move, circulate, and flow throughout the house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Likewise, the Holy Spirit within us is always moving.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the problem today is that much of the time we limit, frustrate, and hinder the moving, working, and acting of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The problem is not that the Spirit is not working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the contrary, the Spirit is always working.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The problem is that we do not cooperate with the Spirit enough.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may illustrate this by using the example of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A marriage is a union of two persons as one, but if the wife never cooperates whenever her husband acts, the husband can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is like our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord has mingled Himself with us and is now working within us, but we do not cooperate with Him that much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We often pray for the Lord to work, saying, Lord, we are waiting for You to work, but we do not realize that He is waiting for us to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He may be saying to us, I have been waiting a long time for you to cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The problem is not with the Lord but with us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This basic principle of the need for our cooperation must be very clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can confirm this principle by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we do not exercise our spirit, we choke off the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is like closing the flue in a fireplace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we close the flue and choke off the source of air, there is no draft or air current for the fire to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times we choke off the moving, anointing, and burning of the Spirit in a similar way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not cooperate with the Spirit and instead quench the fire of the Spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1 Thes 5:19; 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit is waiting for an opportunity to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would simply give the Spirit a chance to burn, He would burn.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, the responsibility is on us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we wanted to start a fire, it would be ridiculous for us to pray to the fire, saying, Fire, please burn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the fire could speak, it would answer, saying, You must first cooperate with me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You must apply me to something so that I can burn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no need to pray to the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fire is ready and waiting for a chance to burn, and if we would simply cooperate by opening the flue, bringing some wood, and adding some oil, the fire would burn.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the same with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the past I saw many people pray, Lord, fill us with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are waiting for the outpouring of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Most of the time this kind of prayer did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, we know by experience that whenever we cooperate with the Holy Spirit, the Spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be clear that the problem regarding the filling or working of the Holy Spirit is not a problem with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, the problem is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do not cooperate with the Spirit or are not willing or ready, the Spirit can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All He can do is wait until we are willing and ready.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>PRAYING ACCORDING TO THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Also, if we want to be ready and willing for the filling of the Spirit, we must pray Acts 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we pray for this matter, we must forget about our circumstances, our memories, and all the thoughts in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead, we must take care of the sense, feeling, or consciousness in the innermost part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This sense is the anointing of the Holy Spirit within us 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we pray for this matter, we must take care of this feeling and utter what we sense in our innermost part.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must not be bothered by our needs or circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead, we must go to the Lord and take care of the feeling in the innermost part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For instance, suppose there is a brother whose wife is seriously ill.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you were this brother, and you were going to the Lord to pray, could you forget about your wife s illness?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This would not be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Surely your wife s illness would be on your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, if you want to learn how to pray, you must exercise to forget about everything when you go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even if your wife is seriously ill, you must forget about that and take care of the innermost sense.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You must not pray according to your circumstances, needs, memory, or what others have requested; rather, you must pray according to what you sense in your innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you go to the Lord in this way, even though you may be unable to forget your wife s illness, you may have a deep sense to pray concerning something else.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You may kneel down and cry, Lord, I am so sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Lord, I have been wrong with my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You will simply forget about your wife s illness and utter what is within the innermost part of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By praying in this way, you exercise your spirit to release the Spirit who is in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is even possible that your wife will be healed by this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I am not saying that if your wife is ill that you should not pray for her to be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, I am saying that when you go to the Lord, you must take care of the deep sense within you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You must utter what is in the innermost part of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we go to the Lord to pray in this way, the first thing the Holy Spirit will do is to purge and purify us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we forget about our circumstances, the outward requests from others, and even our own thoughts and simply pray according to our inner sense, the Holy Spirit will purge and purify us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We may tell the Lord, Lord, I am so sinful and dirty in many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>My motives are wrong, and my intentions are not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I am always seeking something for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is real prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we pray in this way, we may be assured that we are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The more we pray according to our innermost feeling, the more we will be in the spirit and the more the Spirit will fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Ultimately, we will be filled with the Spirit.</S>
