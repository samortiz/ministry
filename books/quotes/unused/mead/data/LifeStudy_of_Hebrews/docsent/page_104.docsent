   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. From the Christ on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to the Christ in Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This turn in the book of Hebrews is also from the Christ on earth to the Christ in heaven 7:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Christ whom we now experience and enjoy day by day is the Christ in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While many Christians are anxious to go to heaven, we are now enjoying the Christ who is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews turns us from the Christ on earth to the Christ in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>D. From the Suffering Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>on the Pathway of the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>to the Glorified Christ on the Throne of God</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, this turn is from the suffering Jesus on the pathway of the cross to the glorified Christ on the throne of God 12:2; 13:12; 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many books have been written on the suffering Jesus and on the pathway of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many who are still on the pathway need the book of Hebrews to turn them to the glorified Christ on the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is now on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF CHRIST S PRIESTHOOD A. Typified by Aaron on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not many Christians know the two aspects of Christ s priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although many know that Christ is our High Priest, very few realize that with Christ s priesthood there are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first aspect is the priesthood of Christ typified by Aaron on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is fully revealed in 5:1-5.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. According to the Order of Melchisedec</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>in Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second aspect of Christ s priesthood is that according to the order of Melchisedec in heaven 6:20; 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 6:20 we read that as the Forerunner the Lord is now within the veil, in the Holy of Holies in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have seen, the first aspect of Christ s priesthood is mainly for the forgiveness of sin, and the second aspect is mainly for the overcoming of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first aspect brings us out of Egypt, and the second aspect ushers us into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the cross, Christ was a High Priest typified by Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we must press on to enter into the full participation in His priesthood according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do this, we shall have a complete overcoming of sin and sin will be absolutely under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We shall be on the second floor, in the Holy of Holies, having nothing to do with sin but continually enjoying grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is altogether related to the second aspect of Christ s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE TWO SECTIONS OF CHRIST S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Based upon the two aspects of Christ s priesthood, there are two sections of Christ s ministry the section on earth and the section in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is very interesting to see that in both sections of Christ s ministry there are exactly eleven items.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now, in a brief way, we need to consider the two sections of Christ s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A. The Section on Earth 1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Having Offered Himself to God</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>for Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ offered Himself to God for our sins 7:27; 9:14, 26; 10:10, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first thing that our Lord did in His priestly ministry was to offer Himself to God for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was the real sin offering, the unique sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From the foundation of the world, Christ was the unique sin offering Rev 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As such an offering, He offered Himself to God for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you read the book of Hebrews carefully, you will discover that it presents Christ only as the sin offering, not as any other kind of offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the book of Hebrews the unique offering is the offering for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ offered Himself to God for our sins once for all and He does not need to do it again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was accomplished once for all for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all must declare and announce the good tidings that the problem of sin has been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not listen to the lies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even your experience is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sin is no longer here.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all must declare, Sin has been taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ s offering of Himself put away sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus John 1:29 says, Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, many Christians do not realize or believe that sin has been taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do you believe that sin has been taken away?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not believe that sin is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if you have a failure or defeat you must tell Satan, Satan, I don t believe you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I believe the Holy Word which says that sin has been taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all must believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must forget our experiences and what we are, strongly take the Lord s word, and declare to the enemy and to the whole universe, Hallelujah, sin has been taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sin has nothing to do with me any longer because Christ offered Himself to God to take it away.</S>
