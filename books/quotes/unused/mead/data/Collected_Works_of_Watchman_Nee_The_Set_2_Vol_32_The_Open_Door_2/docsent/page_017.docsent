   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From Fu-Yang to Lan-Si, Chekiang Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear brothers and sisters:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the capitulation of Fu-Yang on December 25, the houses and belongings of the brothers and sisters and the meeting hall were destroyed!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Over forty of us escaped that morning to the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Soon the thatched hut we squatted in was burned, and we had to move to a higher mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Two weeks later our lives were endangered again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The brothers and about twenty neighboring families, sixty-seven in all, began sojourning in more than twenty different places.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We passed six counties: Lin-An, Fen-Shui, Sin-Deng, Tung-Lu, Jien-Deh, and arrived at Lan-Si.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We wandered for one hundred thirty-eight days.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although we suffered all kinds of hardships, we did not lack in food, clothing, or shelter for a single day!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Either brothers in the Lord or outsiders supplied us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot help but thank the Lord for His great power and grace!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Wang Fu-tang was hit by a bullet in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was able to crawl along for seven Chinese miles and was later moved by his family to Shan-Si-Kou in Sin-Deng.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time he gave a wonderful testimony for the Lord, saying, "When I was hit, I looked around and could find no friend or relative beside me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My vision blacked out, and I fell on the ground several times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As I crawled for a mile, blood was streaming out of me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I only said, Lord Jesus, save me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am satisfied to see Your face.'</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the blood stopped."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has since died, leaving behind his wife and six children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What a tragedy!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My nephew Yu Deh-hwa is twenty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since he was taken captive, we do not know whether he is still alive or dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please pray for them so that the parents, wife, and orphans of these two families may be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise the Lord that He has brought me through this journey to teach me many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was once short in faith but have now learned something.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was once lacking in endurance, but now I know a little of what endurance means.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I thank the Lord the most that, during this national tragedy, I was able to preach the gospel of His grace and was able to go to places where messengers of the gospel had not gone before.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am a most wicked, disobedient, and weak member.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has been gracious to me even though I have doubted Him and slighted Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I became helpless, I had to give up myself and trust in Him solely.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord's grace is made perfect in our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peace to you in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>An uncomely member in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yu Yien-chuan, May 22</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Address omitted</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We published the situation of Brother Yu Yien-chuan and others in Issue No. 2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Fortunately, they are now in Lan-Si.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has cared for them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May He continue to grace them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the time we proofread this issue, Brother Yu's family will have moved to Hunan Editor.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brother Tsi-cheng and his family are also going to Tung-An and Kulangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Together with their families there is a total of twelve people with twenty to thirty pieces of luggage.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Cars are few and overcrowded; therefore, the journey is impossible for man.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With twelve persons and twenty to thirty pieces of luggage, it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I went with them to the station at seven this morning, however, the Lord miraculously arranged for a truck to take them to Tung-An.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From there they will be transferred to Ji-Mei.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What a wonderful, sovereign arrangement of the Lord!</S>
