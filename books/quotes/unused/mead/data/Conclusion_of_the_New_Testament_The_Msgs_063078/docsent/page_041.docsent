   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As Our Peace Abolishing the Law of the Commandments in Ordinances Breaking Down the Middle Wall of Partition, the Enmity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians 2:14 and 15 we see that on the cross Christ died as our peace, abolishing the law of commandments in ordinances, breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmity: "He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we see that Christ died on the cross to abolish all the ordinances among mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Due to man's fall, among mankind there are many ordinances, many customs, habits, ways to live, and ways to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these differences among peoples have divided, scattered, and confused mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, among the human race there is no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ died on the cross to abolish all these ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In particular, He died to take away the partition between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only was there a partition between Jews and Gentiles; there were also partitions between every nationality and race.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without the removal of these partitions, there would not be a way for us to be one in the Lord Jesus as His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the ordinances were abolished by Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He was crucified, His death abolished, annulled, the different ordinances of human life and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the differences among the races and the differences of social rank have been abolished by the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 2:14 says, "He Himself is our peace."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word "our" refers to both Jewish and Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through the blood of Christ we have been brought near both to God and to God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony, in that He made both one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because of the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through Christ's redemption, this separation has been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now the two are one in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians 2:14 speaks of the middle wall of partition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This middle wall of partition is the law of the commandments in ordinances, which was given because of man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first of these ordinances was circumcision to cut off man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Circumcision became the middle wall of partition because it made the main distinction between the Jews, the circumcision, and the Gentiles, the uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the middle wall of partition, this distinction, became the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the law of Moses there were two kinds of commandments: moral commandments, such as the commandments concerning stealing and the honoring of parents, and ritual commandments, such as the commandment concerning the keeping of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The commandments regarding circumcision and the eating regulations were ritual commandments, not moral commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The moral commandments will never be abolished, not in this age nor in the millennium nor in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ritual commandments, on the contrary, are not permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the middle wall of partition Paul meant the law of commandments in ordinances, the ritual commandments related to circumcision, the Sabbath, and diet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The law of ritual commandments was a middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, any ordinance or ritual is a middle wall of partition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ abolished "in His flesh" the law of commandments in ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because mankind became flesh Gen 6:3 and was thus kept from God and His purpose, God ordained His chosen people to be circumcised from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This ordinance was given because of man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was in the flesh that Christ was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He was crucified, His flesh, which was typified by the separating veil in the temple, was rent Heb 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By breaking down the middle wall of partition on the cross, Christ has made peace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Colossians 2:14 says, "Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Greek word rendered "wiping out" can also be translated blotting out, obliterating, erasing, or annulling a decree of law .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word rendered "handwriting" denotes a legal document, a bond.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here it refers to the written law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The ordinances, or decrees, refer to the ceremonial law with its rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These ordinances God has taken out of the way by nailing them to the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances.</S>
