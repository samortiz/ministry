[1]  "We were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living; but we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead" 2 Cor 1:8-9 .
[2]  I admit that these four conclusions which I came to in my youth are all correct; but they come short of the mark.
[3]  But why do we stress the distinction between the living God and the God of resurrection?
[4]  They witnessed many other divine acts in the wilderness e.g., God gave them bread from heaven and water out of the rock but despite those and other wonders performed by God for them, nothing of God Himself was thereby imparted to them.
[5]  Brothers and sisters, do remember that God allows us to go through all sorts of distresses for this very reason, that we may know Him as the God of resurrection.
[6]  The first creation, though brought into being by God Himself, is by God Himself suffered to pass into death that it may emerge in resurrection as a creation of dual nature, i.e., combining the natures of God and man.
[7]  This, that the devastation it brings to the old creation provides an opportunity for the God of resurrection to impart Himself to His creatures, so that they emerge from the death process with a divine element in their constitution.
[8]  The primary purpose of suffering in this universe, particularly as it relates to the children of God, is that through it the very nature of God may be wrought into the nature of man.
