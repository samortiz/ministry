<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12178' href='#ref_12178'>Eph 4:7-11</a></span> But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Therefore the Scripture says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men. (Now this, He ascended, what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.) And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers,<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12179' href='#ref_12179'>Acts 2:1-4</a></span> And as the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place. And suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were distributed; and it sat on each one of them; And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12180' href='#ref_12180'>Acts 2:20-47</a></span> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord comes. And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man shown by God to you to be approved by works of power and wonders and signs, which God did through Him in your midst, even as you yourselves know- This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed; Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it. For David says regarding Him, I saw the Lord continually before me, because He is on my right hand, that I may not be shaken. Therefore my heart was made glad and my tongue exulted; moreover, also my flesh will rest in hope, Because You will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor will You permit Your Holy One to see corruption. You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of gladness with Your presence. Men, brothers, I can say to you plainly concerning the patriarch David that he both deceased and was buried, and his tomb is among us until this day. Therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him to seat One from the fruit of his loins upon his throne, He, seeing this beforehand, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was He abandoned to Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption. This Jesus God has raised up, of which we all are witnesses. Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand Until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified. And when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, What should we do, brothers? And Peter said to them, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself. And with many other words he solemnly testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this crooked generation. Those then who received his word were baptized, and there were added on that day about three thousand souls. And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. And fear was upon every soul; and many wonders and signs took place through the apostles. And all those who believed were together and had all things common; And they sold their properties and possessions and divided them to all, as anyone had need. And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart, Praising God and having grace with all the people. And the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12181' href='#ref_12181'>1 Cor 12:23-27</a></span> And those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness, But our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked, That there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care for one another. And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it. Now you are the Body of Christ, and members individually.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
