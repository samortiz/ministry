<h2 class="head1">CREATION, REDEMPTION, AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>Our God is a God of purpose. He is the great God with a great purpose. We need to see what this purpose is. In the sixty-six books of the Bible we can find only one unique purpose of God. It is true that God has done many things. First, God created the heavens and the earth with millions of items, but His purpose was not creation. In the Old Testament the first thing we see is God&rsquo;s creation. Then in the New Testament the first thing we see is God&rsquo;s redemption. God has gone on from His creation to His redemption, but neither creation nor redemption is God&rsquo;s purpose. Creation is wonderful, and redemption is even more wonderful, but neither of these two wonderful things is God&rsquo;s goal. Therefore, from redemption God is still going on. The goal in the Bible, as revealed at the end, is a city. The consummation of all the sixty-six books of the Bible is the holy city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21&mdash;22). This city is a building. Thus, God&rsquo;s purpose, His goal, is a building.</p>
<p>In the first two chapters of the Bible we see creation. In the last two chapters of the Bible we see a building. Creation is at the beginning, and the building is at the end. Between creation and building is redemption. Without creation there is no beginning, without the building there is no end, and without redemption there is nothing to bridge the long gap between creation and building. Redemption is a long bridge between the two ends of the Bible. Today we are on the bridge of redemption. We came from God&rsquo;s creation, we were redeemed, and now we are going on under His redemption toward the goal of building.</p>
<p>Creation, redemption, and building are three great matters in the Bible. Genesis 1:1a says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created.&rdquo; Creation initiated everything. Every one of us began in Genesis 1:1. God&rsquo;s creation included all of us. Regardless of our age, we were all created in Genesis 1 when Adam was created. We began to have our being not from our father and mother but from Adam. When Adam breathed, we all breathed. We all appreciate redemption, but we may think that creation was something related only to Adam, not to us. If we think that our source is our father, we must then ask where our father came from. Then we must ask from what source our grandfather came. If we continue in this way, we will eventually trace our source back to Adam. We all began from God&rsquo;s creation. After creation we became fallen and lost, but then we were saved. We have been redeemed. Thank God for His redemption! In the Old Testament and even more in the New Testament we can see this precious, great matter of God&rsquo;s redemption. However, the Bible does not end with creation, and neither does it end with redemption. Rather, the Bible ends with another great matter&mdash;building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MATTER OF BUILDING BEING REVEALED<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>In the first book of the New Testament, one day the Lord Jesus suddenly revealed the matter of building to His disciples. Peter first saw that Jesus was the Christ of God and the Son of God. Peter must have been excited to receive this revelation. The Lord Jesus asked the disciples, &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo; (Matt. 16:13). The disciples told Him, &ldquo;Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets&rdquo; (v. 14). Then the Lord Jesus asked the disciples, &ldquo;Who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (v. 15). Peter had the boldness to answer, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16). Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (vv. 17-18a). It seems that the Lord was saying, &ldquo;Peter, you received the revelation concerning Christ, but you also need to see that Christ is for something. You have seen Christ, but I also tell you that I will build My church. Moreover, I will build My church upon this rock. You have seen that I am the Christ of God, but you must also see that I am for My church. Just as you have seen the Christ, you surely need to know My church.&rdquo; Christ and the church are the great mystery (Eph. 5:32). In this way the Lord Jesus revealed the matter of building to Peter and the other disciples.</p>
<p>The three great apostles&mdash;Peter, Paul, and John&mdash;all saw the matter of building. In Peter&rsquo;s first Epistle he tells us, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2:5). In Ephesians Paul tells us, &ldquo;You also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit&rdquo; (2:22). In Revelation John shows us God&rsquo;s ultimate building, the New Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2, 10). Thus, it is clear that God&rsquo;s goal is His building. Today He is on the way, which began from His creation, passes through His redemption, and eventually will reach His building. We came from creation, we are in redemption, and we are going on to building. This is truly wonderful.</p><h2 class="head1">SATAN&rsquo;S STRATEGY TO FRUSTRATE GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Veiling God&rsquo;s People to Prevent Them<br />
from Seeing the Matter of Building</h2>
<p>We all need to see these three great matters&mdash;creation, redemption, and building. Regrettably, however, the subtle one, the old serpent, has used and is still using many things to cover the eyes of God&rsquo;s people from seeing the matter of God&rsquo;s building. Many Christians today believe that they are going to a heavenly mansion. They say, &ldquo;We are saved. God is merciful and gracious to us. Some day we will all go to a heavenly mansion.&rdquo; This &ldquo;heavenly mansion&rdquo; has become a thick veil. This is one layer of the veils that cover many of God&rsquo;s people. Other Christians do not care for the heavenly mansion. Instead, they seek spirituality. Furthermore, they reject those who are not for spirituality. Eventually, rather than being spiritual, they end up fighting against others. Still other Christians say, &ldquo;We have seen the matter of holiness. We are the holiness people.&rdquo; They teach that as a holy people, the sisters should have skirts of a certain length and hair of a certain length. If anyone does not meet their standards, they reject them as not being holy people. Another group of Christians says, &ldquo;We cannot be spiritual. We cannot be holy. Rather, we are seeking God&rsquo;s blessing. We need the second blessing.&rdquo; These four matters&mdash;the heavenly mansion, spirituality, holiness, and the so-called second blessing&mdash;are four layers of veils that cover the eyes of God&rsquo;s people. Another veil is the matter of seeking to be scriptural. Some insist that believers must be scriptural in everything. They say that in everything we need a Bible verse as a base. They argue with other believers whom they think are not as scriptural as they are.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Veils Leading to Fighting Rather Than Building</h2>
<p>Eventually, all these layers of veils lead to fighting. Those who believe in the heavenly mansion fight against those who seek spirituality, those who seek spirituality condemn those who pursue holiness, those who pursue holiness fight against those who emphasize the second blessing, and those who emphasize the second blessing are condemned by those who insist on being scriptural. This is the actual situation today. What shall we do in such a situation? We need to drop the layer of the heavenly mansion. We also need to drop the layer of spirituality, the layer of holiness, the layer of the second blessing, and even the layer of being scriptural. We should not drop the Scriptures, but we need to drop the way of seeking to be scriptural.</p>
<p>We need to have the Scriptures, but we also need to be careful about seeking to be scriptural. Seeking to be scriptural causes much trouble. You may have one interpretation of a verse, and I may have another interpretation of the same verse. You feel that you are scriptural in a certain verse, but I feel that I am more scriptural than you in the same verse. Recently, a book was published criticizing me as being unscriptural. It says that Witness Lee is not scriptural because he tells people that the Son is the Father and that the Lord Jesus is the Spirit. This book claims that this teaching is absolutely against orthodox Christian teaching and against the Bible. The book says that the Son and the Father cannot be one because the Father spoke to the Son (Mark 1:11) and because the Son prayed to the Father (John 17). This argument may seem to be very scriptural, but allow me to point out some other verses. John 14:8-9 says, &ldquo;Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us. Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?&rdquo; Furthermore, Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A Son is given to us... / And His name will be called... / Eternal Father.&rdquo; Regarding the Lord Jesus being the Spirit, I would point out 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Thus, those who wrote the book criticizing me feel that their teachings are scriptural, but I can claim that my teachings are even more scriptural. Christians can never be one by trying to be scriptural. Thus, we all need to drop the veil of trying to be scriptural.</p>
<p>It is the subtlety of the enemy to use all these layers of veils, which are seemingly good matters, to prevent God&rsquo;s people from seeing God&rsquo;s goal of building. The thought of going to a heavenly mansion is not an evil thought. Nor is there apparently anything wrong with seeking to be spiritual or holy or to have the second blessing. However, the subtle one uses all these matters to frustrate God&rsquo;s building. As long as Satan can keep us from God&rsquo;s building, he is happy. He does not care if many are hoping to go to a heavenly mansion, he does not care if we are spiritual or holy or if we experience the so-called second blessing, and he does not care if we are scriptural. However, he is truly frightened if he sees that we are being built together, for he realizes that he cannot prevail against the builded church. The Lord said, &ldquo;I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18b).</p>
<p>If we seek spirituality every day, Satan will be happy, for under his scheme we will be kept from God&rsquo;s building. Pursuing holiness also will keep us from God&rsquo;s building. As long as we are kept from God&rsquo;s building, regardless of how holy we are, Satan will be happy. Even if we study the Bible day and night, endeavoring to be scriptural, Satan will be happy. He may even strengthen us to be scriptural because the more scriptural we become, the more we will fight with others, and the more we will condemn others. Allow me to illustrate. A new believer may learn that we will all be raptured. As a result, he may begin to investigate the time that we will be raptured. When he feels that he has discovered the time, he may feel that he has become more scriptural. His being scriptural may motivate him to fight against other believers who disagree with his understanding of the time of rapture. Based on his seeking to be scriptural, he may refuse to meet with others whom he feels are not scriptural. He may meet only with others who have the same interpretation of the Scriptures that he has. When he meets with others, their unity will be in their understanding of the time of rapture. After meeting together for a period of time, some in the group may be influenced to have a different understanding of the rapture. This may immediately cause division in the group. As long as others hold a different concept, a believer who seeks to be scriptural may have nothing to do with them. Eventually, he may have nothing to do with any other Christian because he will feel that he is the only one who is truly scriptural.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANITY TODAY<br />
AND THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The situation in Christianity today is that all the believers have been divided by all kinds of concepts, all kinds of understandings of the same Bible. The Bible is one book, but there are thousands of differences in the interpretation of this one book. When any two believers have differing interpretations of the Bible, each will feel that he or she is being scriptural and the other is not. As a result, they will fight against one another and condemn one another. However, the Bible consummates not in any believer&rsquo;s concept or interpretation but in God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>I speak from experience. When I was a young believer, the time of the rapture was my favorite subject. I was addicted to it. Wherever I went, I liked to talk about this subject. Pursuing this subject caused me to feel that I was scriptural, and it caused me also to be divisive. One day the Lord opened my eyes to see that He does not care for our being scriptural. Rather, the Lord cares for a proper building; He is seeking a proper church life. After I saw what the Lord truly desires, the veil of seeking to be scriptural was peeled from my eyes. Afterward, whenever a believer came to me to discuss this kind of subject, I had no answer. I would only say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! You have been saved, and I also have been saved. You have the Lord&rsquo;s life, and I also have His life. Eventually, you will be in the New Jerusalem, and I also will be there. Hallelujah! You love the Lord, and I love Him too. You and I are truly one. Regardless of the time of rapture, we all will eventually be raptured. We are one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time a local church was raised up in my town. We began to meet not on the ground of going to heaven, the ground of spirituality, the ground of holiness, the ground of the second blessing, or the ground of being scriptural, but on the ground of the unique oneness of all the saints. When we began to have the Lord&rsquo;s table, there were eleven brothers, and these eleven brothers held many different concepts. If someone had stirred up our minds with our different concepts, we eleven brothers would have immediately begun to fight. However, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we dropped all our different concepts. Previously, I had strongly advocated baptism by immersion, insisting that we needed to do everything according to the Scriptures. Three or four others did not like this way of baptism. They thought that sprinkling was a more convenient way and that immersing people was too difficult for the sick and the elderly. They also felt that there was no difference between the outward forms of immersion and sprinkling. However, when we began to take the Lord&rsquo;s table as the local church, we all agreed not to fight. We were only for the oneness. We no longer insisted on baptism by immersion or by sprinkling. Thus, we began to have the Lord&rsquo;s table in a joyful way. At that time we still held our different concepts, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we did not insist on anything. In this way we began to have the church life.</p>
<p>We all need to see what the Lord desires. His goal is not a certain method of baptism. He is seeking the proper church life, where His lovers and seekers are one in Him, with Him, and for Him. The proper church life does not depend on any kind of concept or teaching; it is simply in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ. This is what the Lord desires today.</p>
<p>Since the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States, many Christian groups have risen up to oppose the recovery. This opposition occurs because in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we preach that believers should forget about their practices and their concepts in order to come to the genuine ground of oneness. This is not a small matter. A pastor may have worked hard for many years to establish a denomination based on the teaching of holiness. If such a one hears that those in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery teach that believers should forget about holiness and come to the unique ground of oneness, he will surely do everything he can to fight against the recovery. This is why the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is suffering by being attacked from every side.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is being attacked from every side, but it is also prevailing on every side because the truth is with the recovery. No one can claim that holiness is the unique ground of oneness. Holiness may be used by Satan as a divisive factor, but it could never be the uniting factor. Sooner or later many seekers and lovers of the Lord will realize, &ldquo;I must be for the Lord&rsquo;s Body. I should not care for spirituality, holiness, or the second blessing.&rdquo; When their eyes are opened, many will drop their denominations. When they leave their denominations, it will stir up the pastors to fight against the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Nevertheless, we declare that we are not here for holiness, spirituality, the second blessing, or being scriptural. Rather, we are here for the genuine oneness on the unique ground of oneness so that the Lord can build us all together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CHOSEN PLACE OF ONENESS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In the Old Testament</h2>
<p>We need to see what the genuine oneness and the unique ground of oneness are. Before the children of Israel crossed the river Jordan, the Lord showed Moses the good land, and then Moses died according to the Lord&rsquo;s word (Num. 27:12-14; Deut. 34:1-5). However, before Moses died, he was greatly concerned for the children of Israel. He told them that they had no right to choose the place for their public worship of God. They could worship God privately anywhere, but they had no right to choose the place to come together to worship God corporately. God would choose the unique place among the twelve tribes where He would cause His name to dwell and where He would set up His habitation (12:11-14, 17-18). Regardless of how far from that place any of the children of Israel lived, they all had to go there three times a year for the public worship of God (16:16). They had no right to offer their burnt offerings, their vows, their firstfruits, or any of the things that belonged to God in any other place. They were all required to go to the one unique place chosen by God where God&rsquo;s name and His habitation were established.</p>
<p>Many Bible readers do not know the significance of this point; they do not know why God commanded His people to worship Him publicly only in the place of His choosing. God commanded this so that His people would be kept in oneness. If the children of Israel had been given the freedom to set up centers of worship wherever they chose, many centers of worship would have been set up not long after they entered into the good land, and they would have been immediately divided. The tribe of Dan might have said, &ldquo;We are far to the north. It is not convenient for us to go down to Jerusalem to worship. God is omnipresent. If God is with those in Jerusalem, why would God not be here with us in Dan? Let us set up a center of worship here in Dan.&rdquo; However, God had the foresight and the wisdom to warn them and charge them not to set up other centers of worship but to go to the place He would choose to establish His name and set up His habitation. By doing this, the oneness among them would spontaneously be kept. Based on this charge, even today no Jew dares to build a temple because the Jews know that God has chosen Mount Moriah as the unique place for His people to build the temple that bears His name and is for His worship (2 Chron. 3:1). They can build synagogues elsewhere, but they dare not build the temple, because there is only one unique ground on which God&rsquo;s house can be built. Today they are still waiting for that ground to be returned to them.</p><h2 class="head2">The Spiritual Application Today&mdash;<br />
Our Human Spirit</h2>
<p>The unique ground chosen by God in the Old Testament for His people to gather to worship Him is a physical type. We need to see the spiritual interpretation, the spiritual application, of this type. For years it was difficult for us to see this, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and through much experience, we have seen what today&rsquo;s Jerusalem is.</p>
<p>The New Testament application of this type is revealed in John 4. One day the Lord Jesus spoke with an immoral Samaritan woman (vv. 4-26). In their conversation she was exposed for having had five husbands and for living with a man who was not her husband. Surely, she was a sinful woman. When her sinfulness was exposed, she turned the subject of conversation from her husbands to the worship of God. She said, &ldquo;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&rdquo; (v. 20). The Lord said, &ldquo;An hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). By saying, &ldquo;An hour is coming, and it is now,&rdquo; He meant that the age had changed. The real Jerusalem today is &ldquo;in spirit.&rdquo; Jerusalem is the place where the temple of God is, where God&rsquo;s dwelling place is. Ephesians 2:22 reveals that God&rsquo;s dwelling place today is in our spirit.</p>
<p>We all need to realize that today our human spirit is the place chosen by God for us to keep the oneness. Our experience verifies this fact. Whenever we exercise our mind to think about various teachings, we are immediately divided. When we come together, we should not exercise our mind to discuss, muse over, or consider various matters. We need to forget about our mentality and turn to our spirit, where we are all one. We cannot be one in our interpretation of any portion of the Bible, in any doctrine, or in any practice. We can be one only in our human spirit because today our spirit is the place chosen by God for all of us to worship Him.</p>
<p>When we come together, we should not gather in our doctrinal agreement or in certain practices. We should not gather together because we all shout in the meetings, because we all pray-read, or because we all call on the name of the Lord. Rather, we should gather in our spirit. Today our human spirit is the unique place where we can keep the oneness. We need to consider the kind of Christians we are. We are not Baptists or Presbyterians, nor are we pray-readers or callers. Rather, we are Christians who are in spirit (Rev. 1:10). We come together in spirit. Because we are in spirit, we are one. I am not concerned about the length of the sisters&rsquo; hair or the length of their skirts. I do not care for whether the sisters wear head coverings. I do not care for any of these things. We do not come together in the matter of head covering. We come together in our spirit.</p>
<p>Some dear new ones among us who are not accustomed to the brothers and sisters shouting Amen! Hallelujah! may wonder, &ldquo;Amen what? Why so many Amens?&rdquo; Many years ago some denominations had an amen corner in their church building. That age is over. Now we have not only an amen corner but an entire amen hall. Everyone says Amen. Some new ones may think that this is crazy. They may prefer to be silent. We should not be bothered by the silent ones. They are dear saints; nothing is wrong with their being quiet. We all simply need to come to the spirit. I have the full assurance that by being in the spirit for two weeks, the silent one also will say Amen. I have seen this happen. If a silent brother comes to his spirit and stays in his spirit for two weeks, he will become the loudest one, shouting, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! I have been liberated from my quiet disposition!&rdquo; The place where we can be one, typified by Jerusalem, is our spirit. As long as we are in spirit, we are one in the place chosen by God for His dwelling place. God&rsquo;s dwelling place is simply the human spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:16). Therefore, we need to keep the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:3). Oneness is of the Spirit and is kept in our spirit.</p>
<p>You may ask, &ldquo;Then what about the Bible?&rdquo; The Bible is simply our food&mdash;it is not mainly for our understanding but for our eating. When we come to the Word, we should not care for doctrinal understanding; we should care mainly for eating. We can eat the word by pray-reading any verse. By pray-reading the word, we will be fed and nourished. We do not need to ask what every verse, phrase, and word in the Bible mean. Regardless of whether we know what every word means, the Bible is good for food. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4), and the prophet Jeremiah said, &ldquo;Your words were found and I ate them&rdquo; (Jer. 15:16a).</p>
<p>Our oneness is not in our understanding of the Bible but in our spirit. Although another brother and I may have different interpretations of a verse, since we are both saved and love the Lord, we are brothers and should come together in our spirit. The spirit is our place of meeting; it is where the Lord has caused His name to dwell, where His habitation is, where we can be one, and where we can be delivered and rescued from all our different concepts. If we come together to discuss doctrines, we will fight. However, in our spirit we are one. Fighting leads to division, not the oneness of the Spirit. In our spirit we have the oneness of the Spirit. When we are in our spirit, we do not need to try to keep the oneness of the Spirit; rather, we spontaneously have the oneness of the Spirit. When we are in our spirit, we are all one. Oneness is in our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
REVEALED IN GENESIS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:27; 2:9; 3:4; Eph. 3:8-11; 2 Tim. 4:22; Gal. 2:20; 1 Cor. 1:30; 15:45b</h1>
<p>Our God is living. As a God of purpose, however, He is not only living but also moving and working. Today we are all under His moving and His working. The Bible is not a book of stories, nor is it a book of doctrines. Rather, the Bible is a book of revelation, revealing to us that the God of purpose is living, moving, and working. After God&rsquo;s work of creation in Genesis, the man created by God was seduced and fell. However, the God of purpose can never be defeated. Once God establishes His purpose, He can never be stopped from accomplishing it. Regardless of how subtle Satan is or how much he does to try to frustrate God&rsquo;s purpose, God simply laughs at him, saying, &ldquo;Little Satan, whatever you have done and whatever you are going to do will only turn out to help Me to fulfill My purpose. Do your best to try to defeat Me. I am the God of purpose and the eternal God. Once I set My mind on a certain purpose, I can never be defeated. No one can stop Me from fulfilling My purpose. Your greatest effort to frustrate My purpose will only speed up My pace. Initially, I may work only superficially, but by your help My work will go deeper and deeper.&rdquo; This thought is clearly revealed in the first few pages of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PROGRESSIVE REVELATION IN GENESIS 1&mdash;6</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Genesis 1&mdash;3</h2>
<p>Genesis 1 tells us that God created man (vv. 26-28). Genesis 2 shows the purpose for which God created man&mdash;that man might take God in as life to become precious materials for God&rsquo;s building (vv. 8-12). Also in chapter 2, Eve, the wife of Adam, was built by God (vv. 18-24). Thus, Genesis 2 reveals God&rsquo;s eternal purpose of building. Then in Genesis 3 the serpent came in, and man was seduced and fell. This may seem disappointing to us. After seeing the tree of life, the precious materials, and the building of the wife in chapter 2, we may not rejoice when we see the serpent in chapter 3. However, we need to see that the serpent is only the background, not the main figure. Genesis 3 presents a picture not of the serpent but of a wonderful person, the seed of the woman (v. 15).</p>
<p>In Genesis 3 the subtle serpent crept in and seduced the man that God had created (vv. 1-6). Satan, the serpent, was happy, thinking that he had usurped man for himself. Then God came into the garden and asked Adam if he had eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (v. 11). Adam answered by blaming God for making Eve, saying, &ldquo;The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate&rdquo; (v. 12). God did not rebuke Adam or condemn him. He was not bothered by Adam&rsquo;s passing on of the blame. Rather, God turned to Eve and asked her, &ldquo;What is this that you have done?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;The serpent deceived me, and I ate&rdquo; (v. 13). By saying this, she too was blaming God by implying that God should have crushed the serpent before he had a chance to seduce her. However, God did not rebuke her either.</p>
<p>Although God asked the man and his wife what they had done, He did not ask the serpent what he had done. God never gave an opportunity to the serpent to say anything. Rather, He said to the serpent, &ldquo;Because you have done this, / You are cursed more than all the cattle / And more than all the animals of the field: / Upon your stomach you will go, / And dust you will eat / All the days of your life. / And I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). It seems that God was saying, &ldquo;Little serpent, because you did this, you will be cursed. Now I am going to defeat you. You came into humanity through the back door, through the female. You should not have done this. In order to shame you, I will bring forth a seed through this back door. You came into humanity through the woman, but I will bring forth a seed of this woman. You thought that your coming into man was your victory, Satan, but you only built up a defeat for yourself. You only opened the door and paved the way for Me to come in and bring forth the seed of the woman, who will crush your head.&rdquo; This is wonderful! When we come to Genesis 3, we should say, &ldquo;Hallelujah for the seed of the woman! Hallelujah for His bruising of the head of the serpent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Adam and Eve ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they realized that their destiny was to die, for God had told Adam that if he ate of the tree of knowledge, he would surely die (2:17). Because Adam and Eve knew this, they were in fear and trembling (3:8). However, Genesis 3:15 was the first preaching of the gospel. People today are seeking peace, but God did not speak of peace in His preaching of the gospel in Genesis 3:15. Rather, He said that He would put enmity between the serpent and the woman and that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head. When Adam heard this gospel, these glad tidings, he was no longer in fear and trembling. Before he heard this gospel, he blamed God for giving him a poor wife. He might have thought, &ldquo;It would have been better if God had never made me a wife. I would not be in this situation.&rdquo; However, after hearing the first preaching of the gospel, Adam&rsquo;s feeling changed, and he called his wife Eve, which means &ldquo;living&rdquo; (v. 20).</p>
<p>Genesis 3 presents a wonderful picture of the seed of the woman who would come to bruise the head of the serpent. However, this picture needed a background. This background was the creeping serpent. Without this background we would not be able to see the seed of the woman as clearly. Without the serpent coming in to seduce man, causing him to fall, there might have been no way for the seed of the woman to be revealed. The seed of the woman is the Lord Jesus (Isa. 7:14; Gal. 4:4). Without the serpent and the fall of man, the Lord Jesus could never have been revealed as the seed of the woman.</p>
<p>Today the Lord Jesus is in our spirit as the seed of the woman to bruise the head of the serpent. He bruised the head of the serpent on the cross, and today He is bruising the serpent&rsquo;s head in us. &ldquo;Hark! the Herald Angels Sing&rdquo; is a famous hymn written by Charles Wesley. The last verse of this hymn says, &ldquo;Come, Desire of nations, come! / Fix in us Thy humble home: / Rise, the woman&rsquo;s conqu&rsquo;ring seed, / Bruise in us the serpent&rsquo;s head; / Adam&rsquo;s likeness now efface, / Stamp Thine image in its place: / Final Adam from above, / Reinstate us in Thy love&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #84). Christ&rsquo;s bruising of the serpent&rsquo;s head not only took place on the cross objectively but also is being accomplished in us subjectively. Without Satan&rsquo;s subtle activities in the garden, Christ could not have been revealed as the woman&rsquo;s conquering seed to bruise the head of the serpent in us.</p>
<p>Genesis 3 is a wonderful chapter because in it we see the first preaching of the high gospel. The low gospel tells man that he is going to hell but that if he believes, he will be allowed into heaven. The high gospel is the gospel of the seed of the woman bruising the head of the serpent. Actually, when the head of the serpent is bruised and Satan is destroyed, every place is &ldquo;heaven.&rdquo; If the head of Satan is bruised in our home, our home will be &ldquo;heaven.&rdquo; If the head of the serpent is bruised within us, we will be &ldquo;heaven.&rdquo; Thus, Genesis 3 is a wonderful chapter portraying the conquering seed of the woman, who bruises the head of the serpent so that our name can be &ldquo;living.&rdquo; This chapter reveals how we are saved and made living. Chapter 3, however, is not the end of Genesis.</p><h2 class="head2">Genesis 4</h2>
<p>Genesis 4 presents Abel, who brought to God an offering that was pleasing to Him (v. 4). This offering was probably instituted by God when He killed the animals to make coats of skin to clothe Adam and Eve after the fall (3:21). Thus, if it were not for the fall, man could not have experienced God&rsquo;s pleasure as deeply. It may seem inappropriate for us to appreciate the fall, but we must admit that it is truly wonderful that although man is fallen and has a sinful nature, he can please God.</p>
<p>In the end of Genesis 4, at the time of Enosh, men began to call on the name of the Lord (v. 26). Thus, Genesis 4 reveals not only that we can please God but also that we can call on His name. It is by calling on the name of the Lord that we can participate in all His riches (Rom. 10:12). Without the fall, man would probably have never realized that he needed to call on the name of the Lord. The name Abel means &ldquo;breath&rdquo; or &ldquo;vanity,&rdquo; and the name Enosh means &ldquo;frail, mortal man.&rdquo; Because of the fall, man realized that he was frail and mortal and that his life was vanity. When man has no hope in himself, he is forced to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Many Christians today do not agree with the practice of calling on the name of the Lord. However, if they are in a car accident, they will spontaneously call on the Lord. We may refuse to call when we have no problems, but we are forced to call when problems come. Once we learn to call on the Lord, however, we will no longer need problems to force us to call. Whatever my outward circumstances are, every minute I call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Therefore, everything is an enjoyment to me. This is possible because the way of calling on the Lord was pioneered by Enosh, the third generation of mankind. This is the revelation in Genesis 4.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Genesis 5</h2>
<p>In Genesis 3 and 4 God was moving and working, revealing the way for man to be living (3:15, 20), the way for man to please God (4:4), and the way of calling on the name of the Lord (v. 26). Then in chapter 5 God went on to reveal that man can walk with God (vv. 22, 24). God is the holy, almighty, bright, and glorious God, but Genesis 5 reveals that fallen, sinful man can walk with God, accompanying Him as He goes along. Without the fall, perhaps man could never have tasted the sweetness of walking with God.</p>
<p>After the way to be living, the way to please God, the way of calling on the name of the Lord, and the way of walking with God were all revealed, Noah was born (vv. 28-29). Noah was born from holy, godly forefathers. Adam&rsquo;s death occurred not long before Noah&rsquo;s birth (vv. 1-29). Thus, Noah undoubtedly inherited all the godly ways of his godly forefathers. He inherited the way to be living, the way to please God, the way of calling on the name of the Lord, and the way of walking with God, which was discovered by his great-grandfather, Enoch.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Genesis 6</h2>
<p>Although Noah inherited all these godly ways, God did not stop moving and working in Genesis 5. We may think that it is good enough to have the way to be living, the way to please God, the way of calling on the name of the Lord, and the way of walking with God. These ways are wonderful, but they are not enough. It is wonderful if a group of believers is living, pleasing to God, calling on the name of the Lord, and walking in the presence of God, but it is short of God&rsquo;s building. The matter of building is revealed in Genesis 6 with the building of the ark (vv. 13-16).</p>
<p>God is not only living but also moving and working. He was moving on with Noah. Thus, Noah was not satisfied and contented with all the godly ways he inherited from his forefathers. God came to Noah with a new revelation, which was a further step of revelation. It seems that God was telling him, &ldquo;Noah, it is good for you to adopt the way to be living from Adam, the way of pleasing Me from Abel, the way of calling on My name from Enosh, and the way of walking with Me from Enoch. All these godly ways are good, but none of them can fulfill My purpose or carry out My plan. This age has become altogether evil; it has become a crooked and perverted generation. I am finished with this age. I cannot carry out My plan with these people. I must terminate this age and usher in a new age.&rdquo; To be living, to please God, to call on His name, and to walk with Him are godly ways, but they are not adequate to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. They are not adequate to terminate the old generation and to usher in the new age. God seemed to be telling Noah, &ldquo;My revelation to you is the ark. The ark is My salvation to you, but you must build it. You need to build the ark so that I can terminate this generation and carry out My purpose in a new age.&rdquo; The ark typifies not a shallow salvation from perdition or hell but a deeper salvation, the highest salvation, one that saves us from this crooked generation to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. This salvation needs our cooperation through our building. This is the main burden in this chapter.</p>
<p>When some Christians hear this word, they may say, &ldquo;This is altogether too much. We need only to preach the gospel and help people to believe in the Lord Jesus, to love the Lord, to seek spirituality, and to be holy and good people living on the earth for the glory of God. As long as we do these things, we will all go to heaven. This is enough.&rdquo; Some have said concerning me, &ldquo;Do not listen to that little man from China. He is one of the Oriental mystics. His teaching is Oriental philosophy based on Chinese Confucian ethics. We have already heard the gospel. We already know that we need to believe in the Lord Jesus to be saved, and we already know the Bible. We do not need to listen to that little man from China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noah probably experienced something similar. When Noah received the vision to build the ark, he probably told others, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s purpose today is to build the ark. God will terminate this generation by flooding the entire earth. We all need to enter into God&rsquo;s purpose.&rdquo; Although the Bible does not record whether Noah had any brothers or sisters, I believe that he had many siblings and relatives. Eventually, however, only eight persons accepted God&rsquo;s revelation through Noah. Many must have mocked him, saying, &ldquo;Noah, what are you talking about? Are you greater than our great-grandfather Enoch? He walked with God and was taken by God, but he never told us to build an ark. What you are doing is nonsense, Noah. Forget about it. You are crazy. We are building tents for people to live in. We are tilling the ground to grow food for people to eat. You are building an ark for a flood, but the sky is clear and the land is dry. What you are doing is not practical.&rdquo; In principle, what we hear today regarding our practice of the proper church life to fulfill of God&rsquo;s purpose is the same.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE AND REVELATION IN THIS AGE<br />
BEING THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Our God is moving on; He is still working today. On one hand, the revelation of the proper church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is new; on the other hand, it is old, for the apostle Paul saw this revelation. However, over the generations this revelation was lost by Christianity. In this century God began to recover His original revelation. In the Western world, which has been saturated with traditional Christianity for centuries, God could not find the virgin land He needed for the recovery of His original revelation. For this reason, He was forced to go to poor China, where He gained a few of us and opened our eyes.</p>
<p>What the almighty God is doing in this age is to set up local churches to establish the proper church life. In a sense, this is to build up the ark in this age. This will terminate the crooked and perverted generation (Phil. 2:15) and usher in the kingdom age. In Matthew 24:37 and Luke 17:26 the Lord Jesus likened the situation of the present generation to that in the days of Noah. He said, &ldquo;Just as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark, and they did not know that judgment was coming until the flood came and took all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be&rdquo; (Matt. 24:37-39). Today people are busy working so that they can eat better food, drive better cars, own bigger homes, and find better marriages. If their marriage does not satisfy them, they feel that they can divorce their spouse and go on to another marriage. This age is an age of eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage. Nearly no one cares for God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Even among the believers, it is difficult to find some who care for God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Many have been Christians for decades, yet they have never even heard the term <em>the eternal purpose of God</em>. They have heard only of hell and heaven, things related to their own welfare, but they have never heard anything related to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>About fifty years ago the moving God was forced by the hopeless situation of Christianity in the Western world to go to the heathen land of China, where He gained a few of us and opened our eyes. There we began to see a revelation of the proper church life. Although I was a young believer, the Lord opened my eyes to see this revelation for His recovery. In 1933 I was invited by a brother to have dinner at his home with a respected pastor. During dinner the pastor said to me, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, if you will forget about the testimony of the local church, all the churches in our city will invite you to speak. Each Sunday a different church will invite you to give a message, and all our members will come to listen to you. Many doors will be open to you if you will simply close the door of your meeting place for the local church.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Thank you, but I have a burden, and I already have enough to do.&rdquo; Some missionaries warned me not to touch the matter of the church but only to preach the gospel. In my heart I said, &ldquo;If you dropped me into the Pacific Ocean, I would still speak concerning the church to the fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have a burden because I have seen a revelation. Once we have seen something, we can never deny that we have seen it. When we see someone standing before us, we cannot say that we do not see that person. I was invited to Denmark in 1958 and was warmly welcomed, but the leaders there advised me not to speak anymore concerning the church. Because I did not take their friendly advice, I lost their friendship, but I gained more genuine fellowship. If I had taken their advice, I would not be with all the saints here today. I rejoice that my relationship with the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a friendship but a genuine fellowship.</p>
<p>We are in an age in which God has a definite purpose. God is waiting for a group of people to terminate this age and usher in the coming kingdom age by being faithful to His revelation. I have no doubt that we will meet the Lord on the way of recovery. We are going on. The Lord is on the way to meet us, and we are on the way to meet Him. We are on the way of His recovery, the way of the proper church life. The way to have the proper church life is not only to meet on the proper ground of the church, nor is it merely to practice pray-reading, calling on the name of the Lord, or saying, &ldquo;Amen. Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!&rdquo; The way to have the proper church life is to be in spirit to build the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE UNIQUE CONSTITUENT<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In order to build the church, we need Christ, the seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14). Without Christ, there is no way to build the church. We can build the church only with the unsearchable riches of Christ. The purpose of every meeting, conference, and training is to minister the all-inclusive, unsearchable riches of Christ into the saints. The church is produced with Christ as the unique constituent. It is composed of the riches of Christ and constituted of all the elements and factors of Christ. The church is the enlargement and the expansion of Christ. In this expansion, which is the new man, there is no Greek or Jew; there is no human element (Col. 3:10-11). There is no Westerner, no Easterner, no British, no German, no French, no American, no Chinese, and no Japanese. In the church there is only Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being All-inclusive</h2>
<p>We need to see who Christ is. Christ is wonderful. We would need thousands of pages to describe who Christ is. Colossians 2:9 says that in Christ all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily. Because the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, He is all-inclusive, and His riches are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8). Christ is rich in mercy, grace, love, joy, peace, humility, kindness, light, power, spirituality, and holiness. In order to be holy, we must have Christ. Holiness without Christ is vanity. Likewise, spirituality without Christ is empty. God made Christ everything to us. God made Him our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). Christ is truly rich. He is rich in wisdom, rich in righteousness for our justification, rich in sanctification for our holiness, and rich in redemption for the transfiguration of our body. For our past He was made our righteousness, for our present He was made our sanctification, and for our future He was made our redemption.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>A number of people today accuse me of teaching heresy because I say that Christ is the Spirit. However, the more they try to oppose this truth, the more they expose their own folly. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; The last Adam is Christ. Therefore, Christ is surely the Spirit (cf. 2 Cor. 3:17). Some would challenge this truth by asking, &ldquo;If Christ is the Spirit, how can He be the Son?&rdquo; I cannot explain this mystery, but the Bible tells us clearly that Christ is the life-giving Spirit as well as the Son. Some say, &ldquo;I admit that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, but He is not the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; I answer them by asking, &ldquo;Besides the Holy Spirit, is there another Spirit who gives life?&rdquo; To say yes would be heretical. There is not another Spirit who gives life besides the Holy Spirit (John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6). Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. Thus, we should all declare, &ldquo;The seed of the woman, who bruised the head of the serpent, is now the life-giving Spirit in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Practically, if Christ today were not the Spirit, it would be impossible for Him to come into us. We know that Christ is in us. No genuine believer would deny this. There is no argument on this point. Colossians 1:27 says, &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; There would be no way for Christ to be in us if He were not the Spirit. Some who oppose the truth that Christ is the Spirit say, &ldquo;Christ is in heaven, and He is in us through the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This may seem to be a good utterance, but no one has been able to explain to me what it means for Christ to be in us through the Holy Spirit. I cannot find a verse in the New Testament that says that Christ is in us through the Holy Spirit, but I can immediately think of at least five verses that tell us that Christ Himself is in us (John 14:20; Rom. 8:10; 2 Cor. 13:5; Gal. 2:20; Col. 1:27).</p>
<p>Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; This verse says clearly that Christ is with our spirit. This truth is not mere doctrine; it is our experience. I can testify from my experience that wherever I go, Christ is with my spirit. If Christ were not the Spirit, He could not be with our spirit. Thus, it is not only unscriptural but also illogical to deny that Christ is the life-giving Spirit. We all need to proclaim, &ldquo;Hallelujah, Christ, whom God has made our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption, is the life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; I have heard that someone who was offended by my speaking of this truth is preparing a paper for distribution that accuses me of being heretical. I am pleased to hear this. The more such persons touch this matter, the more they expose their folly. The truth is the truth. When I say that two plus two is four, no one can dispute this simple fact. Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, and now He is with our spirit to be our righteousness, our sanctification, our redemption, our life, our patience, our humility, our boldness, and everything to us for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Living in Us to Be<br />
the Unique Constituent of the Church</h2>
<p>Now that Christ is living in us, according to Galatians 2:20, we need to say, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. I am through; I am finished. I am altogether not good for the church life. I am useless for the church life. For gossiping and for the world I am an expert, but for the church life I am nothing. I may be suitable for everything else, but I am unsuitable for the church.&rdquo; We all need to see that we are not good for the church. However, we also need to see that we have One in us who is good for the church and who even is the church. We are not good for the church, but we have the church within us. As long as we live not by ourselves but by Christ, we will have the church.</p>
<p>I do not tell the brothers and sisters that they need to be humble, good, and gentle. I do not tell the saints that they need to learn how to behave themselves so that they will not put the church to shame or lose the testimony of the church. Such teaching would be ethical teaching, like that of Confucius. Rather than teaching that we must be ethical, I teach that in ourselves we are hopeless, we are nothing, and we are no good for the church. We need to be terminated and buried. If all the saints in a certain locality think that they are good for the church, that church is finished. We all need to say, &ldquo;We are no good at all for the church, but we have One in us who is not only good for the church but who is the church.&rdquo; The church is the extension, the expansion, and the enlargement of Christ. Jesus of Nazareth was the individual Christ, but today He is the corporate Christ, the church (1 Cor. 12:12). Because the church is the corporate Christ, every factor, element, and fiber of the church must be Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Needing to Eat the Riches of Christ<br />
to Become the Fullness of Christ</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul ministered the unsearchable riches of Christ to people in order to build up the church. Ephesians 3:8-11 reveals that the church is produced from the riches of Christ. The church is simply a composition of all the riches of Christ. Because the church is a composition of the riches of Christ, we need to eat Christ. When I came to the United States, I was amazed to see many tall, husky American men. When these men were newborn babies, they each weighed only about seven and a half pounds and were only about twenty inches long. However, after twenty years those small infants may weigh two hundred fifty pounds and be well over six feet tall. This great change occurs because day by day they eat all the riches of America: American chickens, American beef, Washington apples, California oranges, and Florida grapefruit. Eventually, they become a composition of all the riches of America that they have eaten.</p>
<p>The best dietitians tell us that we are what we eat. Our physical body is simply the composition of all the riches of the food that we have eaten, digested, and assimilated. However, strictly speaking, we are not the riches themselves but the fullness of the riches. All the riches added together and assimilated into the fibers of our being become the fullness. Thus, Ephesians mentions the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ (3:8; 1:23; 4:13). We enjoy Christ&rsquo;s riches, and we eventually become His fullness, just as we enjoy the riches of America to become the fullness of America. If I came to America and saw all the rich food but not one tall, husky person, I would see only the riches but no fullness. Some Christian groups apparently have the riches of Christ, but we cannot see the fullness of Christ among them. However, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we can see not only the riches of Christ but also the fullness of Christ, constituted of all the eaten, digested, and assimilated riches of Christ. The church life is simply the fullness of Christ, the riches of Christ digested by His members. The church is not merely a group of good believers coming together&mdash;this definition is very shallow. The church is the Christ who has been assimilated into us and is expressed out of us. The expression of Christ in the many brothers and sisters who have eaten, digested, and assimilated His riches is the church, the fullness of Christ. The church is simply the expression, expansion, and enlargement of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">CHURCHING TO BUILD TODAY&rsquo;S ARK</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today we are &ldquo;churching,&rdquo; we are practicing the proper church life, in order to build today&rsquo;s ark. To many in degraded Christianity, their Christ is like a canoe, a single piece of carved wood. However, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery our Christ is the ark, something corporate that is built up not by God but by God&rsquo;s seekers. Today we are churching in order to build the ark, in which we are saved not only from eternal perdition but also from this crooked and perverted generation. The ark saved Noah and his family not only from perdition under God&rsquo;s judgment but also from the evil generation of his day. Furthermore, the ark brought Noah and his family through the flood waters, the waters of death, into &ldquo;resurrection,&rdquo; typified by the ark coming to rest on the mountains of Ararat (Gen. 8:4), in which they lived as God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth. Likewise, as the real ark, our Christ saves us not only from eternal perdition but also from the present evil age and into resurrection for the kingdom life in the coming age. This is the kind of Christ we have in the church life today.</p>
<p>Christian fundamentalists strongly oppose the idea of salvation by works. I was once influenced by such fundamentalism. In a sense, this concept is right, but not in every sense. Philippians 2:12b says, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&rdquo; There is no need for us to work out our salvation from eternal perdition&mdash;Christ accomplished this salvation once for all on the cross. Nevertheless, there is another kind of salvation, one that saves us from this crooked and perverted generation and causes us to shine as luminaries, holding forth the word of life (vv. 15-16). This subjective salvation needs our work by our cooperating with God. Actually, none of us can do this work in ourselves, but because God is operating in us, we are able to work out our own salvation. Thus, verse 13 says, &ldquo;It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&rdquo; God is operating in us today. Our working is our cooperation with His operation.</p>
<p>We are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today to build up the church according to God&rsquo;s revelation in this age. God&rsquo;s present revelation is for us to build up the church as the ark, not to be saved from eternal perdition but to be saved from the present evil age and into the coming kingdom age to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. The United States is a country with a long history of traditional Christianity. There is no need for anyone from the Far East to come to tell Americans anything concerning Christianity. It would be better for the Americans to send a missionary to the Far East to tell the heathen Chinese about Christianity. Nevertheless, the fact is that God had a need for one who saw His revelation to be sent to the United States to tell the people what God&rsquo;s intention is today.</p>
<p>We thank God for all the godly forefathers who have gone before us and for all the godly ways we have inherited from them. However, God has no intention to stop with what we have inherited. Every time I pick up my pen to write the footnotes for the life-studies of the books of the Bible, the Lord firmly charges me not to begin by reading any other biblical expositions. If I begin by going to other books, I will be influenced by the old, traditional view. There is no doubt that many good things have been revealed to those who have gone before us, but God has something further to reveal to us today. The Lord has charged me to keep myself vacant, to keep myself like a virgin land, in order to allow Him to come in to show me something new. I can testify that in writing the footnotes for the life-studies of Genesis, Romans, John, and Hebrews, I have seen a number of new points. New light has come in.</p>
<p>In writing the footnotes for the life-study of Hebrews, I saw that today we are the partners of Christ (3:14). Most Christians probably have never heard that we are the partners of Christ. However, we need to see that Christ is the Operator of God&rsquo;s economy in the universe and that we are His partners in this operation. The Greek text of Hebrews reveals that we are not only Christ&rsquo;s companions but also His partners. When I saw this, I was greatly encouraged. Now I know the value, the worth, the preciousness, of the book of Hebrews. This book reveals something unique&mdash;that we are the partners of Christ, sharing with Him God&rsquo;s interests in God&rsquo;s economy. Although I have a number of older books that expound Hebrews, I was charged by the Lord not to look into them before writing my footnotes. After I wrote the footnotes, I opened the older books to compare what I had seen with what had already been revealed to the writers of these books. I found that there was much new light and many new points that the Lord had revealed to me.</p>
<p>God is moving on today; He is still working. What the Lord is doing on earth is not merely to save people or even to help people to be spiritual. The Lord has not come back yet because He is still waiting for today&rsquo;s ark to be built. When the ark is prepared, the Lord will come. When the church life is proper, when the testimony of the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is matured, the Lord will say, &ldquo;Now is the time for Me to return.&rdquo; The proper church life will be the steppingstone, the beachhead, for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. We are here with a purpose for our God of purpose. This purpose is carried out in the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
REVEALED IN THE EXPERIENCE AND WRITINGS OF PETER</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:42; Matt. 16:18; 1 Pet. 1:3, 23; 2:2, 5; 3:4, 21; 5:2-4, 5b, 10</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE GREAT APOSTLES</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the building of the church revealed in the experience and writings of Peter. Although we may already know Peter quite well, I have a burden to help us to know him more, to know him in a deeper way. Among the early apostles who established the churches, Peter was the first. He was not the first who was brought to the Lord, but he surely was the first who was commissioned to establish the churches (Matt. 16:19). He was also the first who spoke to lead many to salvation for the building of the church (Acts 2:14-41). Peter was the first apostle to establish the churches, and Paul was the last one in the New Testament to establish the churches. Some may ask where we would place the apostle John. The New Testament reveals that not long after the churches were established, they became damaged, or broken, like a torn fishing net. Thus, John was needed as a mender. John&rsquo;s ministry was a mending ministry. After the church &ldquo;net&rdquo; was broken, God commissioned John with his ministry of life to mend the tears. Hallelujah for these three wonderful apostles! One began, the next completed, and when their work became damaged, the third came in to mend it.</p>
<p>Of the three great apostles&mdash;Peter, Paul, and John&mdash;in this chapter we will cover only the first one&mdash;Peter. We will cover Paul and John in the following chapter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE CORNERSTONE<br />
FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>Peter began the building of the church. Many Christians take Peter as a good example for gospel preaching. They often quote Acts 4:12, where Peter says, &ldquo;And there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.&rdquo; It is not wrong to quote this verse for gospel preaching; on the contrary, it is wonderful. However, people nearly always neglect the first word in this verse, <em>and</em>. This word being at the beginning of the verse points to the foregoing verse, verse 11. Thus, when we quote Acts 4:12, we must not forget the word <em>and,</em> which refers us to verse 11. Acts 4:11 says, &ldquo;This is the stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.&rdquo; This verse does not speak of Christ as the Savior of God&rsquo;s people but of Christ as the cornerstone of God&rsquo;s building. Thus, the gospel concerns not only a Savior but also a stone.</p>
<p>Our Savior is a stone. This stone was considered as nothing by the builders. The Jewish builders were supposed to be building God&rsquo;s house, but Christ, the living stone, was rejected by them (1 Pet. 2:4). They put Him aside, but He has become the head of the corner, the cornerstone of God&rsquo;s building (Eph. 2:20). A cornerstone is placed at the corner of two walls. Wherever two walls meet, a strong stone is needed to join them together. The Gentile believers and the Jewish believers are two walls of God&rsquo;s building that are joined by Christ as the cornerstone. Thus, Christ is not only the Savior but also the cornerstone for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Preachers in Christianity frequently refer to Acts 4:12, but they rarely mention verse 11. Many who have been in Christianity for years have never heard a gospel message telling them that Christ is not only the Savior but also the stone. Christ is the Stone-Savior. If He were only the Savior, He could meet our needs, but He could never fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is not merely to save a group of fallen sinners but to build His eternal habitation with His saved ones. Therefore, in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, Christ needs to be both the Savior for the salvation of sinners and the stone for God&rsquo;s building. Actually, His salvation is for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>The builders mentioned in verse 11 are the religious builders. It is not only the Jewish builders who put this stone aside; even the so-called builders in Christianity put this stone aside. Christianity preaches a poor salvation without God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. It is not a rich salvation but a scarce salvation, one that delivers people out of hell but has nowhere to place them. Christianity tries to place people in a heavenly mansion, but there is no such thing in the Bible. God has no intention to place us in a heavenly mansion. Rather, God is building us into the New Jerusalem. Christianity misses the destination of salvation; they do not have the purpose of God in His salvation. The purpose of God, the destination of God&rsquo;s salvation, is the New Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s eternal building. Hence, God&rsquo;s Son, the Lord Jesus, is not merely the Savior; He is the Stone-Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Peter Building the Jewish Wall<br />
and Paul Building the Gentile Wall</h2>
<p>Peter, the first great apostle, was used by God to begin the building of the church. Peter was an apostle to the Jewish people. Thus, Peter represents the Jewish wall. However, for God&rsquo;s building to be complete, there was the need for another wall. Hence, there was the need of another apostle, the apostle to the Gentiles. Therefore, the Lord raised up Paul. Paul was raised up to build the Gentile wall to complete God&rsquo;s house. This was the reason that God raised up Peter and then Paul (Gal. 2:7-8).</p>
<p>In Acts 15 the Jewish believers were dissenting toward Paul (vv. 1-2). It seems that they were saying, &ldquo;Paul, you have been bringing in many unclean Gentiles without circumcising them. We accept you as a believer, but we cannot agree with your bringing in the Gentiles without circumcising them or charging them to keep the law. We cannot go along with you in this.&rdquo; There was such a dissension. However, Peter, who was undoubtedly a man of God, charged the Jewish believers to receive the writings of Paul as they received the rest of the Scriptures. In 2 Peter 3:16 he says, referring to Paul, &ldquo;As also in all his letters, speaking in them concerning these things, in which some things are hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist, as also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.&rdquo; It seems that Peter was telling the Jewish believers not to dissent from the apostle Paul but to receive what he wrote as Scripture. Through the receiving of both Peter&rsquo;s and Paul&rsquo;s writings, the universal habitation of God, composed of the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers, could be built up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">John&rsquo;s Mending Ministry</h2>
<p>Not long after the building of the church began with Peter and Paul, the church became damaged. Hence, there was the need of John&rsquo;s mending ministry. John&rsquo;s ministry was neither Jewish nor Gentile but heavenly, because John brought everything back to the beginning. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; In the beginning there were no Jews and no Gentiles, but there was the Word. In this Word, there were not teachings, doctrines, ordinances, and rituals, but there was life. To keep the Jewish rituals is to be in Leviticus, the third book of the Bible. John, however, brought us back to the first book, Genesis, where we see the tree of life (2:9). The Epistles of Paul reveal that Jewish religious teachings and Greek philosophy had crept in to damage the church. The church was greatly damaged by these two elements. Because of this, God raised up John to mend the holes and repair the damage. John mended not by fighting against Jewish teaching and Greek philosophy but by saying, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God...In Him was life...And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality&rdquo; (John 1:1, 4, 14). The Word was not full of doctrines and philosophies but full of grace and reality.</p><h2 class="head1">PETER SEEING THAT CHRIST AND THE BELIEVERS<br />
ARE STONES FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>Although I came from a heathen land, China, I was born and raised in Christianity. From my youth I heard preachers, pastors, and ministers speaking concerning Peter, preaching that the Lord called Peter to be a fisher of men (Matt. 4:19). This is certainly true, but I never heard one preacher say that the Lord made Peter a stone. The first time Peter contacted the Lord, the Lord did not tell Peter that He would make him a fisher of men. The Lord spoke this word to Peter in Matthew 4:19, which is a record of the second time Peter contacted the Lord. Peter was called by the Lord twice because, like us, he was weak in his faith. The first time Peter came to the Lord, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter)&rdquo; (John 1:42). The name Peter means &ldquo;a stone.&rdquo; Hence, the first time Peter came to the Lord Jesus, the Lord immediately promised Peter that He would make him a stone. However, Peter did not stay with the Lord. Instead, he went back to his old profession, fishing. Thus, in Matthew 4 the Lord went to the seashore where Peter was fishing and called him again. This second time, the Lord said that He would make Peter a fisher of men. Thus, being a stone precedes being a fisher of men.</p>
<p>Later, when Peter was following the Lord, the Lord asked the disciples, &ldquo;Who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (16:15). Peter took the lead to answer, saying, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16). The Lord replied to him, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter&rdquo; (v. 18). It seems that the Lord was saying, &ldquo;Do not forget the new name that I gave you; you are a stone.&rdquo; This must have been the reason that when Peter was older, in writing his first Epistle, he told the believers, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2:5). Thus, we can see that when Peter first came to the Lord, he was impressed that he would be made a stone. Later, when Peter was with the Lord, the Lord reminded him that he was a stone. Eventually, when Peter stood before the leaders of the Jews, he told them not only that Jesus Christ, the rejected One, is the Savior but also that He is the cornerstone (Acts 4:11-12). Peter preached Christ not only as a Savior but also as a stone.</p>
<p>Christ is the Savior for our salvation, and He is the stone for God&rsquo;s building. Christ meets our need by being the Savior, and He fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose by being the stone. Christ saves us for God&rsquo;s building; He has no intention to save us for heaven. The Bible tells us that eventually heaven will be vacated. Revelation 21:2 says, &ldquo;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&rdquo; Many Christians are trying to go up to heaven, but God is preparing to come down to earth. Thus, these Christians are trying to go in the opposite direction from God. We must see that our Savior is a stone. It is not that He is the stone so that He can be the Savior; rather, it is that He is the Savior so that He can be the stone. In other words, the building is not for salvation; salvation is for the building. We have been saved for God&rsquo;s building, not for going to heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE BUILDING OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>Noah was charged by God to build the ark (Gen. 6:13-14). The New Testament believers are charged by God to build the church (1 Cor. 3:10, 12; 14:12, 26; Eph. 4:12, 16), which will eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2, 9-10). In each locality many dear saints are building the church by leading new ones to salvation, helping them to be transformed, and fitting them into the building. Although these saints may not be conscious of it, their labor is the building of the New Jerusalem. I expect that one day when we are in the New Jerusalem, we will recognize those whom we brought into the church and realize that we built them into the New Jerusalem. Some in Christianity may not accept this word. They may even consider it to be heretical, but this is what is revealed in the Bible. This is not a traditional Christian teaching; it is the heavenly vision. When we see one another in the New Jerusalem, we will realize that what we were building in the churches was the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>God did not build the ark by Himself; neither will God build the church by Himself. God built the ark through the building of Noah. Today the Lord is building the church through our building of the church. Many saints who love the Lord and give everything for the church life do not realize it, but they are building the New Jerusalem. The ark that Noah built was merely a type. The New Jerusalem is the final ark, the eternal ark. Today we are building the final ark, which will save us from the present evil age in the old heaven and the old earth and usher us into the new age in the new heaven and the new earth.</p>
<p>I am bold to say this because in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have seen the vision of the church. As a result, we know what the Lord is doing today, and we know what we are doing today in His recovery under His vision. We are not blindly preaching or ministering, trying to help others while we ourselves do not know where we are going. We have a clear goal, the New Jerusalem. Therefore, we have the full assurance and the boldness to say in faith that our building of the church today is the building of the New Jerusalem for God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Peter saw this vision, for in his preaching on the day of Pentecost, he indicated that Jesus Christ is not only the Savior for the salvation of God&rsquo;s chosen ones but also the stone for God&rsquo;s eternal building.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BE TRANSFORMED<br />
INTO PRECIOUS STONES FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">By Regeneration</h2>
<p>Now we need to see how we fallen, sinful, polluted, and contaminated human beings can become precious stones for God&rsquo;s building. In order to become such precious stones, we first must be regenerated, born again. First Peter 1:3 says that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This indicates we have been identified with Christ, just as the eight persons in Noah&rsquo;s family were identified with the ark. Because they were in the ark, they were one with the ark. Wherever the ark was, they were, and whatever the ark experienced, they experienced. The ark&rsquo;s history was their biography; the ark&rsquo;s life was their life. For us to be regenerated through the resurrection of Christ means that we are identified with Christ&mdash;we were put into Christ and are one with Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 23 tells us that we have been regenerated with an incorruptible seed, which is the living and abiding word of God. The word of God is the word of life. In regeneration the divine word of life comes into us as a seed of life. We now have this seed in us. We are each like a plot of soil. Soil can never produce a carnation flower if it does not have a carnation seed sown into it; it can be only a plot of soil. It can never be living, full of life, and full of beauty. No amount of teaching concerning what a proper plant should look like can ever cause a plot of soil to produce a plant. Many teachers, such as Confucius, have taught man for centuries how to be proper and virtuous, but this teaching has not worked. Nothing of life or beauty has come forth from all this teaching. Jesus came not to teach but to sow Himself as the seed of life into man. Matthew 13 clearly reveals that the Lord Jesus came as a sower to sow the seeds of life (vv. 3-8, 37). These seeds are the word of God, the Lord being in this word as life (vv. 19-23; Luke 8:11).</p>
<p>Peter was not naturally a wonderful person. It might have been that when he was young, he was a naughty boy. Nevertheless, when Peter came to the Lord, without Peter&rsquo;s knowing it, the Lord sowed Himself into Peter. Then when the Lord resurrected, the seed within Peter germinated. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection Peter became another person. He was no longer a naughty boy but a great apostle. Thus, he was able to stand on the day of Pentecost to subdue thousands. The old Peter could not have done that. However, the seed that had been sown into him three years earlier was in blossom on the day of Pentecost. We all have such a glorious seed within us that is growing and will blossom. In some it has begun to blossom already.</p>
<h2 class="head2">By Drinking the Milk of the Word</h2>
<p>In order to become precious stones for God&rsquo;s building, we also must drink the milk of the word so that we will grow. First Peter 2:2 says, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation.&rdquo; Regardless of our age, we all need to be like newborn babes. Newborn babes do not know how to do anything other than to drink milk. Day and night they are drinking. As newborn babes, we should all have an appetite to drink the milk of the word. It is by drinking milk that newborn babes are able to grow. Likewise, we must drink the milk of the word in order that by it we may grow. We should come to the Bible not mainly for teachings but mainly to drink the milk, to take in the nourishment, that we may grow. The growth of a human being never comes from teaching. Growth comes from only one thing, that is, nourishment. Mothers know that in order for their children to grow, the children do not primarily need teaching. If children are given only teaching, they will become thin and unhealthy. However, if children are fed with much nourishing food, they will be happy and will grow.</p>
<p>In the local churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery everyone has a pleasant, happy, and bright face. Several visitors have asked me, &ldquo;What happened to these people?&rdquo; Some have said to me, &ldquo;When I went into one of your meetings, everyone was glowing. Did they all win valuable prizes?&rdquo; There are no material prizes for the saints to win, but every morning they receive the prize of Christ. They receive Christ as their nourishment. Others have asked me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are an old man. Why are you so happy every day? You are like a young man.&rdquo; At times I have replied, &ldquo;Please do not call me an old man. I am not old; I am young because of the nourishment I receive from the Word day by day.&rdquo; I have been drinking the milk from the fountain of the Word for over fifty years. By now I am very familiar with this fountain. Many times even when I am not looking at the physical Bible, I am still drinking. After I speak a message, my wife is often surprised and says to me, &ldquo;I did not see you open the Bible once this week. Where did such a wonderful message come from?&rdquo; I answer, &ldquo;I open the Bible within me a hundred times a day.&rdquo; Others do not see this, but the Lord as the Spirit with my spirit sees it. When I am drinking from the inner fountain, the Lord Jesus is always happy, and I am therefore happy as well.</p>
<p>The milk we drink makes us grow. Eventually, by this growth we become different persons. By the growth of a carnation seed, a blossoming carnation flower is produced. Outwardly, I am a Chinese man, but within me something is blossoming; something is living. When we see one another, we should not look at the earthen vessel but at the blossoming Christ.</p>
<p>Moreover, this growth issues in building. The more we drink the milk of the word, the more we will desire to contact the saints. This is my experience. Today I find that without the dear brothers, I simply cannot live. The more we grow, the more we desire to be one with the saints. This is building.</p>
<p>The building of the church is not carried out by organization or by a disorderly &ldquo;piling up&rdquo;; it is entirely a matter of organic growth. The members of our physical body were not systematically organized, nor were they merely put together without any particular order. Rather, they have grown together organically. It is for this reason that our body cannot be divided. Likewise, the proper church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not something organized or piled up but something that grows up. It is absolutely different from Christianity or any kind of religion. It is the growth of Christ corporately. The Lord desires that the church be built up not by teaching but by the nourishment of the milk and the solid food in the word (1 Cor. 3:2; Heb. 5:12-14).</p><h2 class="head2">By Taking Care of<br />
the Hidden Man of the Heart&mdash;Our Spirit</h2>
<p>First Peter 3:4 mentions &ldquo;the hidden man of the heart.&rdquo; Perhaps we have never realized that in our heart there is a hidden man. Some may think that this hidden man is Jesus, but according to this verse it is &ldquo;a meek and quiet spirit.&rdquo; Within our heart is our spirit. Our spirit is the hidden man of our heart. In order to be transformed into precious stones, we need to take care of this hidden man.</p>
<p>We should not primarily take care of what we think. I may say something that offends you, and the devil may use this offense to stir up your thinking. Some may be offended when I say that today we are building the New Jerusalem by building up the local churches. They may think, &ldquo;This bothers me. I graduated from the top seminary, but I was never taught this. I have heard many preachers, but I never heard such a thing. I cannot swallow this; I cannot take it.&rdquo; If some are troubled by this word, it is because I am speaking from the spirit, but they are thinking in their mind. Therefore, it is as if we are on two different planets. Because I am on the &ldquo;planet&rdquo; of the spirit, and they are on the &ldquo;planet&rdquo; of the mind, it is impossible for us to be one. Hence, we should not stay in our mind. Rather, we all need to come to our spirit.</p>
<p>In Revelation 1:12 the apostle John said, &ldquo;When I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.&rdquo; The golden lampstands in this verse signify the local churches. In order to see the churches, we need to turn. To turn is to change one&rsquo;s angle, direction, or destination. I may say that my head has seven holes, counting my eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth. If you are standing behind me, however, you may disagree with me, saying, &ldquo;This brother is telling lies. He says that his head has seven holes, but I see no holes.&rdquo; You see no holes because you are facing my back. If you would turn to see my face, you would see that my head indeed has seven holes. Many of us have been drugged, doped, and befuddled by the traditional concepts of Christianity. As a result, we may not know where we are. Therefore, we need a turn in order to change our direction, to change our angle. We need to drop all the traditional concepts and turn to our spirit to see the churches as we have never seen them before.</p>
<p>Many saints have told me that the first few times they heard me speak, they inwardly condemned me and fought against me. However, something deep within them would not let them go. They did not know why, but something within them always said Amen to my speaking. When they went home, something in their mind said to them, &ldquo;You are foolish. You are simply following a man. Besides, if you are going to follow a man, why not follow one from the West? Why should you follow a man from China? You might be deceived by him.&rdquo; Nevertheless, when the time of the next meeting came, something deep within them told them to go. Their mind said, &ldquo;I should not go. I will stay home.&rdquo; However, something else within troubled them and stirred in them, not giving them peace to stay home. Eventually, in spite of the continued protesting in their mind, they came to the meeting. This &ldquo;something within&rdquo; that caused them to come to the meetings was the inner man of their heart, their spirit.</p>
<p>Jesus came not from a place of high regard but from the despised city of Nazareth. Nathanael said, &ldquo;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&rdquo; (John 1:46). To carry out His recovery in this age, the Lord went to the poor land of China. Some may ask, &ldquo;Can anything good come from China?&rdquo; Nevertheless, the Lord sent me from China to the United States, a country steeped in a long history of traditional Christianity. Though some in Christianity may oppose the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, no opposition can defeat us, for we are on the Lord&rsquo;s side. As long as we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we are on His side&mdash;we are identified with Him. We simply need to take care of the hidden man in our heart, our human spirit, which is where the Lord Jesus is. Today the Lord Jesus is with our spirit, the hidden man of our heart (2 Tim. 4:22). We need to listen to Him there, not to our mind, which is filled with traditional concepts. We need to forget about our traditional concepts and turn from our mind to our spirit. Then we will have the full discernment to know if what we hear is of the Lord or not.</p>
<h2 class="head2">By Being Separated from the World</h2>
<p>In order to be transformed into precious stones for God&rsquo;s building, we also need to be separated from the world. First Peter 3:20b says that by entering into the ark, &ldquo;a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water.&rdquo; The eight persons were saved by entering into the ark, which typifies the redeeming Christ. However, according to this verse, the eight persons were saved also by water. This indicates that the waters of the flood, which were a judgment to the crooked and perverted generation, were a saving to the eight persons, saving them not from God&rsquo;s judgment but from the corrupted generation. The judging water separated them, brought them out of that evil generation, and ushered them into a new age. Thus, their passing through the flood waters signifies resurrection.</p>
<p>First Peter 3:21 says, &ldquo;Which water, as the antitype, also now saves you, that is, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The saving mentioned in this verse is not a saving from hell or a saving from our flesh, as in Romans 8, but a saving from the present evil age, which is condemned by God. Christians today argue about the proper form of baptism but miss the true significance of baptism. To be baptized is to pass through the judging water to be separated from today&rsquo;s evil generation. The waters of the Red Sea, which also typify the waters of baptism, on the one hand, judged the Egyptian army and, on the other hand, separated the children of Israel from Egypt (Exo. 14:22-29). After passing through the Red Sea, it would have been difficult for the children of Israel to return to Egypt, because the sea blocked the way. If we see the real significance of baptism, we will never go back to the world after we are baptized. The waters of baptism are the waters that judge the world. We might have loved the world in the past, but we have been saved from the world, not by the ritual, the rite, of baptism but by the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">By Flocking Together</h2>
<p>First Peter 2 reveals that we need to be nourished by the word in order to grow. Chapter 3 reveals that we need to turn to the hidden man of the heart, our spirit, and that we need to be separated from the condemned world, that is, saved through water. Chapter 5 reveals that we need to flock together (vv. 2-4). All sheep need the flock. Some animals do not like to stay with others of their kind, but sheep always like to be flocked together. If a sheep does not like the flock, perhaps this is a sign that it is actually not a sheep but a wolf. First Peter 2:5 mentions our being built up. Practically speaking, this building up is the flocking together in chapter 5. To be flocked together is to be built together. We should never be individualistic. We always need to flock together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">By the Grace of the God of All Grace</h2>
<p>The final item that we need for our transformation for God&rsquo;s building is God&rsquo;s grace. First Peter 5:5 says, &ldquo;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&rdquo; Verse 10 mentions &ldquo;the God of all grace.&rdquo; God is the God not merely of one kind of grace but of all kinds of grace. Grace is God as our enjoyment and our supply. We all need the gracious supply from our all-sufficient God. May the Lord&rsquo;s grace be with us all. By His grace we will grow, by His grace we will flock together, by His grace we will be transformed, and by His grace we will be built up together. We all need to give ourselves to experience this grace, for by it we will become God&rsquo;s building and thus fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
REVEALED IN THE WRITINGS OF PAUL AND<br />
IN JOHN&rsquo;S MENDING MINISTRY OF LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:6, 9-12a; 14:5, 12; Eph. 2:20-22; 4:12-16</h1>
<p>The matter of the building of the church was revealed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16 after Peter recognized that the Lord Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God (v. 16). The Lord said to him, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (v. 18). After the matter of building was first revealed by the Lord Jesus, it was mentioned again by Peter in his preaching to the leaders of the Jews. He stood before them and told them that Jesus Christ was not only the Savior but also the stone for God&rsquo;s building (Acts 4:11-12).</p>
<h2 class="head1">NINE ITEMS OF CHRIST BEING A STONE</h2>
<p>In the Bible Christ is revealed as at least nine kinds of stones. He is the eternal rock (Isa. 26:4; Matt. 16:18), the foundation stone (Isa. 28:16; 1 Cor. 3:11), the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4), the cornerstone (v. 6; Acts 4:11; Eph. 2:20; Psa. 118:22; Isa. 28:16), the precious stone (v. 16; 1 Pet. 2:4, 6-7), the topstone (Zech. 4:7), the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4), the crushing stone (Dan. 2:34-35; Matt. 21:44b), and the stone of stumbling (Isa. 8:14; Rom. 9:33).</p>
<p>In ancient times the Jews built their dwellings with three main kinds of stones: a foundation stone, a cornerstone, and a topstone. They had flat roofs rather than sloping roofs. Godly people used the flat roofs for prayer. For example, Acts 10:9b says, &ldquo;Peter went up on the housetop to pray.&rdquo; The Jewish method of construction was to make the foundation with a large rock, then to set up the cornerstone as a support, the equivalent of today&rsquo;s column, and to finish by placing the topstone as the roof. We should recognize that today the topstone has not yet been placed on God&rsquo;s building. One day Christ will be placed on God&rsquo;s building as the topstone. According to Zechariah 4:7, at that time all the people of God will shout, &ldquo;Grace, grace to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the cleft rock, Christ is not for building but for flowing out the living water. He is the rock that was smitten and cleft on the cross to flow out His eternal life as our living water (John 19:34). In contrast, Christ is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone, not to be our supply but to be the very material for God&rsquo;s building. We may therefore call Him the Stone-Jesus. This title is altogether scriptural. If we believe in the Lord Jesus, we need to see that He is the Stone-Jesus. He is not muddy but solid and strong. He is the rock.</p>
<p>In Daniel 2:34-35 Christ is revealed as the crushing stone, who comes to destroy the totality of human government, represented by the human image (vv. 31-33). In Matthew 21:44, concerning this stone the Lord Jesus told the people, &ldquo;On whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff.&rdquo; Christ is the crushing stone, not toward the believers but toward the unbelieving Gentiles. Christ is also revealed as a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense toward the unbelieving Jews (Isa. 8:14; Rom. 9:33; 1 Pet. 2:8).</p>
<p>There are three basic categories of people on the earth&mdash;the Jews, the Gentiles, and the believers in Christ. Christ is related to each of these categories of people as different kinds of stones. To the believers Christ is the eternal rock, the foundation stone, the living stone, the cornerstone, the precious stone, the topstone, and the cleft rock. These are items of Christ as a stone in a positive sense. In a negative sense, Christ will be a crushing stone to the unbelieving Gentiles and a stone of stumbling to the unbelieving Jews. Thus, Christ is related to every kind of person on the earth. No one can say that Christ has nothing to do with him or her.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING WROUGHT INTO US TO MAKE US PRECIOUS STONES FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>In Acts 4 the apostle Peter stood before the Jewish leaders and testified that the Christ whom he was preaching was the Stone-Savior, good not only for saving but also for building (vv. 11-12). Christ is the material for God&rsquo;s building. Today this Christ is working Himself into us. The One who is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone is now being wrought into us. By our natural birth we are not stone but clay (Gen. 2:7). In order for clay to become stone, the stone element must come into it. This will cause the clay to be transformed into stone. Transformation requires another element to be added to the original element. Petrified wood becomes stone not by the wood being changed in itself but by the element of certain minerals being wrought into the wood. In like manner, we who are clay do not need to change our &ldquo;clay&rdquo; nature; rather, we need to have Christ&rsquo;s stone nature added into us.</p>
<p>One way to have Christ&rsquo;s element added into us is to call on the name of the Lord. We should not despise calling on the name of the Lord Jesus; it is not a small thing. If you play with calling on the name of the Lord, you may be caught. I know of a young man who was mocking our practice of calling on the name of the Lord, jokingly repeating, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; The next morning something happened to this young man. He could not smoke cigarettes anymore, and something within him urged him to go to the people whom he had been mocking. He was unconsciously caught by calling on the name of the Lord, for when he called, Jesus came into him. One person may open the door to the Lord by calling in a proper way, and another may open the door by calling in a mocking way, but regardless of the way, as long as the door is open, the Lord will come in.</p>
<p>Calling on the name of the Lord is not something that is done in vain, for Jesus is real and present. If a person is real, living, and near to us, whenever we call that person&rsquo;s name, that person will come to us. Jesus is real and living; He is present and available. Therefore, when we call His name, He will come to us and will enter into us. <em>Hymns,</em> #208 says, &ldquo;O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord! / Forgive me if I say, / For very love, Thy sacred name / A thousand times a day.&rdquo; The words of this hymn should not be an exaggeration to us. A sister may be bored while washing the dishes at home. The best way for her to make her task a pleasant experience is for her to call on the name of the Lord while she is working. Whenever we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, we taste Him, for He is living, real, present, and available.</p>
<p>It is Satan&rsquo;s subtlety to allow people to believe in Jesus and pray to Jesus but in a dumb way. Although we may believe in Jesus and receive Him as our Savior, if we do not call on His name, it will be difficult for us to enjoy Him. Today the Lord Jesus is working Himself into our being for God&rsquo;s building. One way for Him to work Himself into us is by our calling on His name. We may not be convinced of this, but if we will simply call on the name of the Lord Jesus for three minutes, we will never be the same. We can read the whole Bible and still remain the same, but if we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; for three minutes, we can never be the same because Jesus will work Himself into us.</p>
<p>Once the divine element, which is Jesus Himself, enters into us, this element is not silent. On the contrary, this element is aggressive and active, working, moving, and stirring in us to trouble us. If we call on the Lord one evening, the next morning something within us will begin rebuking, bothering, directing, and checking us, all the time saying no. We may be thinking of going to the theater, but something within will say no. If we are planning to play basketball, something within may say no. Perhaps when we are planning to buy a particular pair of shoes, something within will say no. Surely, we have all had this kind of troubling. This is Jesus troubling us and stirring within us. I like this kind of stirring and troubling.</p>
<p>Every kind of cooking is a kind of &ldquo;troubling.&rdquo; Cooking beef by placing it in a hot oven &ldquo;troubles&rdquo; the beef. Today we are under the &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; of the Lord by His stirring within to trouble us. Day by day He is troubling us. Even today I had a brief time with the Lord that was not very pleasant. I was thinking of saying something to please myself, but the troubling Jesus within said no. Those who were with me did not hear Him, but I heard Him clearly. He is working within us, and His working is metabolically transforming us. Thus, we will never be the same. We are all pieces of natural wood, but the heavenly flow is daily flowing through us with the heavenly element. Eventually, we will all be &ldquo;petrified&rdquo; to become precious stones. This is the way the Lord is building His church today.</p><h2 class="head1">PAUL&rsquo;S REVELATION<br />
OF THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo; In Acts 4:11 Peter said that Christ is the stone, the material for God&rsquo;s building. Then Paul came in to tell us something further&mdash;that we are not only being built but are also building. Paul himself was a wise master builder (1 Cor. 3:10). We may think that Christ was the Builder, that the apostle Paul was a builder, and that today the leading brothers are builders, but that we ourselves are not builders. However, every member of the church should be a builder. Eventually, the church will be built not directly by Christ or the apostles but by every small member.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 4:16, the building of the church as the Body of Christ is accomplished by every part of the Body. This verse says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; Out from the Head the Body builds itself up by the operation of each one part. Each one of us is a part. Regardless of how small and insignificant we consider ourselves to be, as long as we are in the church, we are a part of the Body. As a part of the Body, we each have a measure for the building up of the church. Thus, the church is not built directly by Christ or by the apostles but by us all.</p>
<p>We need to see the way in which Christ builds the church. Through His death, resurrection, and ascension He produced the apostles (vv. 8, 11). This was Christ&rsquo;s part. The apostles&rsquo; part is to equip and perfect all the saints. The apostles perfect us by feeding us. We are all like newborn babies, who have all their organs but whose organs do not function fully because of their immaturity. Therefore, we need the feeding that will cause us to grow. The growth in life will help all our spiritual &ldquo;organs&rdquo; to develop into full function. A newborn baby has ears, but his ears cannot hear distinctly. He has eyes, but his eyes cannot see clearly. He has legs and feet, but he cannot walk. However, as his mother continually feeds him, after a certain period of time, his eyes begin to see clearly, his ears begin to discern different sounds, and his legs and feet begin to stand and then to walk. These functions all come by the growth in life. In like manner, the apostles feed us that we may grow for the development of our spiritual function. The more we grow in life, the more our function will be developed. This is the perfecting by the apostles. As we are perfected, we will all begin to function, and our functioning will build up the Body directly.</p>
<p>We should not merely sit in the meetings as &ldquo;pew members.&rdquo; Remaining in our seat will cause us to be dead and eventually fall out of the church life. If we have the inspiration to stand up in a meeting to speak something for the Lord, but we are stuck in our seat, our seat has become a pew. Today some saints are functioning members. Whenever there is an opportunity, they stand up and speak something. However, others are pew members stuck in their seats. They come to listen to a brother give a message. When they tire of hearing messages, they may come to hear the testimonies. When they feel that a testimony is good, they will nod in agreement. When they do not like a testimony, they will shake their head in displeasure. The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should not be like this. This is a tradition that comes to us from degraded Christianity. I do not like to say this kind of thing, but the situation forces me to say it. Because I am burdened and commissioned by the Lord, I must be honest before Him and before the saints. Degraded Christianity has passed on many deadening practices to us.</p>
<p>It would be good if all the saints, whether old or young, stood up in the meetings to speak for the Lord. One may shout, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; Then another may declare, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus is so good.&rdquo; A third one may testify, &ldquo;Amen, I can testify that He is good.&rdquo; In this way one by one, hundreds of people can say something. All the saints&rsquo; functioning will send Satan to the lake of fire. However, the situation in Christianity today is not like this. Christians are talkative people outside the meeting hall, but when they come into the meeting hall, they are silent. Perhaps they believe that they should be seated and silent in order to be pious, godly people who are meeting in a decent order. However, this situation is deadening and killing. After the meeting is over, everyone goes outside, and the order is lost as everyone begins to talk. Some may criticize the pastor or the sermon. This is the poor situation in Christianity today. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must all rise up to function for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>We need to realize that salvation is for the building up of the church. The way this building occurs is first by Christ the Head producing the apostles by His death, resurrection, and ascension. Through the ages He has produced a number of apostles. The apostles then come to us to perfect us, feed us, and minister Christ to us that we may grow. As we grow, our functions come forth. Each one of us has a function. By the functioning of all the members of the church, the Body is built up directly. We all need to build the church in this way.</p>
<p>In every meeting we are all being built, and at the same time we are all building. We all build and are built by one another. Even saying Amen is a small way to function to build up the church. When we say Amen to a brother&rsquo;s speaking, we build him up as he is speaking to build us up. If no one says Amen to a brother&rsquo;s speaking, he will be discouraged and will not want to speak again. He will be deadened. However, if many saints say Amen to a brother&rsquo;s speaking, he will be encouraged and look forward to coming to the next meeting to function again. This is building; it is not a small thing.</p>
<p>We should not be a group of quiet Christians when we come together. As a young believer, I met with a group of quiet Christians. We were taught to be quiet. It was often said that our meetings were so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. This kind of quietness deadens the whole situation. In those quiet meetings a distinguished speaker would give a good sermon on a certain topic, such as the Lord&rsquo;s teaching that we must love not only our neighbors but also our enemies (Matt. 5:43-44). However, the only thing we could say afterwards was, &ldquo;Doctor So-and-so is truly a scholar. His speech was very good.&rdquo; Regardless of how good the sermon was, no one would receive help. We would all still be dead after the meeting.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery a brother may stand up in a meeting and testify briefly, &ldquo;I was born in an unbelieving family. One day I met the Lord Jesus, and He saved me. Hallelujah!&rdquo; If the meeting goes on for an hour with other saints functioning in a similar way, all the saints will be nourished and go home living. By rising up to speak in this way, even the smallest member can build the whole church. As each member is building, we all say Amen, and the building member is thus also being built. In this way we are being built while we are building. We should not depend on famous preachers. Instead, we should simply depend on all our fellow small members. We should come together with a living spirit and with the Stone-Savior, whom we have enjoyed and experienced, to exercise our spirit and release our portion of Christ with short sentences. If we do this, our meetings will be living, rich, uplifting, strengthening, enlightening, and comforting. This is the way that the church will be built up.</p>
<p>The first time I visited a certain locality, there were a small number of saints meeting in a rented hall. Because no ministering brother went to that locality to give a conference or stay for any length of time, when I visited that church a second time, I did not think that it would be as living as it was. When I returned and saw the situation, I was greatly encouraged to see that the church truly builds itself up. The angels do not have the privilege to build the church. We alone are privileged to be able to build the church. Most of the saints in that locality were young ones, but when I heard their prayers and testimonies, I inwardly praised and worshipped the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, thank You. You have confirmed Your recovery, Your commission, and Your revelation. Here is a church where there is not a ministering brother doing the building, but the church is being built by the functioning of all the small members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even if we function only a little, it is good enough. An older sister may stand and say, &ldquo;Do not think that I am old; in the Lord I am younger than you all. I love the Lord Jesus. He is so good to me.&rdquo; Even such a brief word will build all the saints. Building is not a matter of doctrine, teaching, or giving a sermon; it is a matter of releasing our spirit to build and to nourish others with Christ. Whenever we release our spirit, the Holy Spirit will come out of our spirit to bring Christ to others, and this Christ will become nourishment, light, life supply, strengthening, and comfort to many saints. This is the proper way to build the church. The church is built not directly by the Head in the heavens or by the apostles but by all the present members of a local church.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:20 says that we are being built, and 4:16 indicates that we all are building. While we are building others, we are being built. Actually, our building of others is our being built. While we are being built, we are building others. This is wonderful! The key, the secret, for us to build and be built is the exercise of our spirit (2:22). Just as the members of a basketball team warm up in order to prepare to play before a game begins, we must be exercised in spirit and be ready to participate before a meeting begins. In this way, when the meeting begins, we will each be able to function in turn to speak something of Christ to one another, just as the players on a basketball team pass the ball to one another. All the saints should come to the meeting in a prepared, vigilant way by being exercised in spirit. This will result in the building up of the church.</p>
<p>In response to this word, some saints may ask me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, what about all the needs? Some sisters love the Lord, yet they still wear short skirts. Some dear brothers still have long hair. Don&rsquo;t these ones need to hear some teaching to be helped? Many sisters override their husbands at home, and many brothers are mean to their wives. You need to teach us.&rdquo; My answer to these saints is that my teaching means nothing; it is in vain. However, when the saints return home after a living meeting in which all the members exercised their spirit to function and build up one another, something will be different. When the domineering sisters are about to override their husbands, something they received in the meeting will stop them. They will be stopped not by my teaching but by the living Jesus. This is the way to take care of all the needs among the saints. I have seen this way work in a number of specific instances.</p>
<p>A little over a year ago a certain young man was saved and became a brother in the church in my locality. When he was saved, he had a very noticeable beard. This brother loved the Lord and loved the church life, but his beard was a distraction to many saints. However, recently I saw that this brother&rsquo;s beard was totally gone. He testified that the Lord began bothering him to get rid of his beard a year ago, but he thought that this bothering might have been only his religious concept. Because he did not want to be religious, he waited. However, the more he waited, the more he was bothered. This inward bothering continued for over a year until one day he realized that this was surely not something religious but was the Lord Jesus. If this bothering had merely been a religious concept, it would have left him. The brother testified that finally one day he said to himself, &ldquo;How could this bothering stay with me for a year? This morning it is bothering me even more. Therefore, I must say Amen and get rid of my beard.&rdquo; I know of many similar testimonies of saints who have experienced a real change, a real transformation. If the brother who shaved off his beard simply stood up in a meeting with his shining, glowing face, it would build all the saints much more than a good sermon would. The building of the church by the functioning of all the members is not merely a matter of doctrine; it is the actual way that the church is being built in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today.</p><h2 class="head1">JOHN&rsquo;S MENDING MINISTRY<br />
BRINGING THE BELIEVERS BACK TO LIFE</h2>
<p>We have seen the building of the church revealed to Peter and to Paul. Now we come to John. John&rsquo;s ministry is a mending ministry. This mending ministry is greatly needed today because the church has been damaged. Because there are many &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in this heavenly net, there is the need of mending. However, this mending could never be carried out effectively only by teaching. The more we try to mend by teaching, the more holes we will make. Teachings never mend but only tear. Only life can mend. Therefore, John writes in his Gospel, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo; (1:1), and &ldquo;in Him was life&rdquo; (v. 4). John&rsquo;s mending ministry brings us back to the beginning. In the beginning, in Genesis, we see the tree of life (2:9), and in John&rsquo;s ministry, in Revelation, we again see the tree of life (22:2).</p>
<p>What is needed in the churches today is life. We should care more for life than for teachings. If we care mainly for teachings, we will soon be divided. Allow me to illustrate the problem of caring mainly for teachings. In Christianity we received an orthodox, fundamental teaching concerning the Trinity according to the Nicene Creed, which was compiled at a council held about three hundred years after Christ. This creed says that we believe that our God is triune&mdash;He is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is correct. However, Christianity&rsquo;s traditional teaching concerning the Trinity has drugged people, causing them to unconsciously believe that there are three Gods. Most would not admit this, but unconsciously, deep within them, their concept is tritheistic. As a result, when we touch the teaching of the Trinity, it stirs up trouble with many Christians.</p>
<p>When the Lord raised us up in His recovery, He showed us through our experience of the Lord that we have not three Gods but one. The Lord began to show us that God&rsquo;s being three persons is only one aspect of God; the other aspect is that God is one (Isa 45:5; 1 Tim. 2:5). The Trinity is three in one, or three-one. This is a divine mystery. It is impossible for us to exhaust the depths of the Divine Trinity with our human mentality. Trying to understand the Trinity with the human mentality is like trying to measure the ocean using a spoon. Christians may endlessly argue about whether God is three or one. We simply need to see that He is three in one. The Father, the Son and the Spirit are three, but They are not three Gods&mdash;They are one God.</p>
<p>We know that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God because in Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus speaks of &ldquo;the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>name</em> is singular. When I read this verse as a young believer, I was bothered, thinking that I had found a mistake. Grammatically and logically speaking, the word <em>name</em>
 in this verse should be plural. It seems that this verse should say &ldquo;the <em>names</em> of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;How can three persons have one name? Surely, either the translators or the printer made a mistake.&rdquo; However, when I checked with several versions of the Greek text, I realized that there is no doubt that the word <em>name</em>
 is singular. Thus, this verse mentions three persons but one name. This name is the all-inclusive name of the Triune God. His name is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In <em>The Principles of Theology</em> W. H. Griffith Thomas, the well-known writer of an exposition on Romans, says, &ldquo;The term &lsquo;Person&rsquo; is also sometimes objected to. Like all human language, it is liable to be accused of inadequacy and even positive error. It certainly must not be pressed too far, or it will lead to Tritheism.&rdquo; This is exactly what has happened in Christianity&mdash;the term <em>person</em> has been pressed too far. Some teach that God the Father is one person, God the Son is another person, and God the Holy Spirit is another person. This kind of teaching causes many Christians to unconsciously believe that there are three Gods.</p>
<p>From the first century until today Christians have been divided by the teachings concerning the Trinity and Christology, the study of the Person of Christ. If we pay too much attention to this kind of teaching, we will be killed. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have been helped by the Lord not to be misled by the teaching that God is three separate persons. According to our own experience of the Lord, we know that there is only one God. Moreover, in the Bible we find two verses revealing that the Triune God whom we experience is one. First, there is Isaiah 9:6, which says, &ldquo;A Son is given to us;... / And His name will be called... / Eternal Father.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the Son is the Father, for if He were not the Father, He could not be called Eternal Father. The other verse is 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord in this verse is Christ, the Son of God (4:5). Regardless of whether we understand these two verses, we must receive them as the pure revelation of the Word of God.</p>
<p>Some dissenting ones have come to argue with me, saying that the Son cannot be the Father because in Mark 1:11 the Father spoke to the Son, and in John 17 the Son prayed to the Father. Sometimes I answer these ones by simply saying, &ldquo;Brothers, I do not know a great deal, but before I answer you, please tell me how you understand Isaiah 9:6 and 2 Corinthian 3:17. These two verses are the pure revelation of the Word in clear, black and white letters. There is no need for us to guess their meaning or to interpret them. They state the simple facts that the Son is called the Father and that the Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; When I respond in this way, the dissenting ones cannot answer. Then I say, &ldquo;Brothers, we should not argue about the teaching of this mystery. We simply need to take the pure revelation of the Word of God. We should not care for the traditional teaching of any creed or organization more than the pure revelation of the Word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes I tell these dissenting ones, &ldquo;Brothers, doctrines only bring about many arguments. Let us stop the arguing. Ephesians 4:6 says that the Father is in us, Colossians 1:27 says that Christ the Son is in us, and John 14:17 says that the Spirit is in us. These three verses tell us that the Father is in us, the Son is in us, and the Spirit is in us. Do you believe this or not?&rdquo; None would say no. All would say, &ldquo;Yes, the Father is in us, the Son is in us, and the Spirit is in us.&rdquo; Then I go on to ask, &ldquo;According to your experience, how many are in you?&rdquo; None would say that there are three separate persons in them. All would say that, according to their experience, there is only one in them. Thus, our experience testifies that the three of the Triune God are one.</p>
<p>When I was a young Christian, I became bothered because I did not know whom to address my prayers to&mdash;the Father, the Son, or the Spirit? I had been taught by the Brethren that we should never address our prayers to the Son but should always pray to the Father in the name of the Son through the Holy Spirit. After trying to pray this way for a period of time, I became confused. I was taught to pray to the heavenly Father, but according to my experience the Father was no longer the heavenly Father but the Father in me. Furthermore, when I prayed in this way, I did not know whether it was the Father, the Son, or the Spirit in me or where the other two were. When I prayed, I was always afraid of praying in the wrong way. Often I would spontaneously pray, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; but then I would immediately repent and ask for forgiveness. Then I would begin again, praying, &ldquo;O heavenly Father, I pray in the name of Your Son, the Lord Jesus, through the Holy Spirit. Thank You, Father. O Lord.&rdquo; Then I would again repent for praying to the Lord and try again. Therefore, I would not have a pleasant, sweet enjoyment in my prayer.</p>
<p>After trying to pray in this way for seven years, I was finally freed. Since then I have not been concerned with the doctrine of which one of the Trinity I should pray to. I simply pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Thank You, Lord Jesus. I love You, Lord. O heavenly Father, You are so good and so gracious!&rdquo; I cannot explain this kind of prayer doctrinally, but I know experientially that when I pray in this way, I have a sweet touch with the Lord. I am no longer bothered by dead doctrine. Our experience tells us that there is nothing wrong with praying in this way. We need to go back to the beginning, back to the tree of life. We should not care mainly to understand all the teachings and doctrines concerning the Trinity. The Triune God is far beyond our understanding. We simply cannot understand the mystery of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>To those who would say that the Father and the Son cannot be one because the Father spoke to the Son and the Son prayed to the Father in the Gospels, I would point out Zechariah 2:8-11, which says, &ldquo;For thus says Jehovah of hosts, After the glory He has sent Me...For I am now waving My hand over them...and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me...For now I am coming, and I will dwell in your midst, declares Jehovah. And many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day and will become My people; and I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you.&rdquo; The more we try to understand who the Sender is and who the sent One is in this verse, the more we will be confused. The speaker in verse 8, who is the sent One, is Jehovah of hosts, but in verses 9 and 11 He says, &ldquo;Jehovah of hosts has sent Me.&rdquo; Thus, Jehovah of hosts is both the Sender and the sent One. This means that the Sender is the sent One. Just as the same Lord is both the Sender and the sent One in Zechariah 2, the same Lord is the praying Son and the listening Father in John 17. This is all we can say, and this is all we can understand. It is a mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OFFENSE CAUSED BY<br />
THE STAND OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery does not recognize any of the divisive grounds of the many denominations. This offends many people. In today&rsquo;s Christianity the denominations consider one another to be wrong, yet they would not offend one another. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, however, the Lord has enlightened us and opened our eyes to see that denominations are wrong. Regardless of what others say about us or do to us, we will never recognize any denomination. However, we recognize that all the believers in the denominations are our dear brothers. In 1957 some brothers from Copenhagen and from London came to visit us in Taiwan. Although these saints were our friends, they tried to condemn us, asking, &ldquo;Why do you say that you are the church and that all the denominations are not the church? Are they not genuine Christian brothers?&rdquo; Right away I answered them, &ldquo;Dear brothers, you came from the Western world, where all the Protestant Christians condemn the Catholic Church as being devilish and demonic. Do you not know that even in the Catholic Church there are a good number of genuine Christians?&rdquo; When I was in the Philippines, I met some dear believers who were in the Catholic Church. I went to see their service and heard some sisters praying there. I appreciated their prayers. I told our visitors from Europe, &ldquo;You condemn the Catholic Church, but you know that there are genuine believers there. Simply because there are genuine believers there, would you say that the Catholic Church is the proper church?&rdquo; The answer was, &ldquo;Surely not!&rdquo; I said that my answer to them was the same. We admit that there are many dear brothers and sisters in the denominations, but we can never say that the denominations are right. This stand greatly offends people.</p>
<p>The recovery was raised up by the Lord in China in 1922. After twelve years, in 1934, all the missionaries in China were offended. They said, &ldquo;We have been called by the Lord. We gave up our country, our home, our family, and our position. We sacrificed everything to come to this country, and we have been laboring day and night. We have worn out the soles of our shoes, and we have gained a number of believers. Among them, only a few top ones genuinely love and seek the Lord. We love these ones&mdash;they are the source of our church. Now all these top ones have been proselytized by you. Of course your meetings are more living, higher, and richer than ours&mdash;you stole all our best ones. We raised up a poor flock, but you formed another flock and stole the best sheep.&rdquo; We said, &ldquo;Dear ones, we never stole anything. The &lsquo;sheep&rsquo; are living, and they make their own decisions. Do not blame us. Rather, go to your sheep and ask them why they escaped from your fold. We did not steal them; they ran away from your fold. Now even if we tried to chase them away, they would say, &lsquo;Even if you brothers would not take this way, we will still take this way.&rsquo;&rdquo; Many saints who have come into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery from denominations can testify that no one stole them or proselytized them. Rather, they were attracted by the Lord in His recovery.</p>
<p>The main reason others accuse us of heresy and wrong doctrines is that they are upset because a number of their top members have left to come into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Many denominations are truly full of wrong doctrines. Although no one says anything against their wrong doctrines, many say that we are heretical. Doctrinal disagreement is not the basic reason for this opposition; it is an excuse. The basic reason is that we offend many by standing on the unique ground of oneness. Our standing on the unique ground is a strong renunciation of all the divisive denominational grounds. Our standing on the unique ground spontaneously and unintentionally condemns all other grounds. We do not like to do this, but we have no other way to meet.</p>
<p>I hope that through this brief fellowship the whole situation may become clear to us all. We must look to the Lord that He would cover us, preserve us, and keep us from doctrinal disputation. We need to forget about any negative speaking or writing that comes to us. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today we are not for doctrinal disputation but for the pure revelation of the Word of God, which brings us back to life for the building of the church to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. We have no other way but this way, and the Lord has no other way but this way. This is the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and this is the way that will bring Him back. We need to be faithful to this way.</p></body></html>
