<h2 class="head1">GOD'S LIFE BEING RELEASED THROUGH DEATH</h2><p>Let us read Luke 12:49. This is the deepest verse in the Gospel of Luke. The Lord said, "I have come." He does not mention anything about redemption. He merely came "to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled!" This verse speaks of a fire being cast on the earth. This means that the fire is not from the earth, but from heaven and from God. Fire signifies the life in the Spirit. The Lord came to cast fire on the earth, that is, to release God's life to the earth. Following this the Lord said, "But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!" (v. 50). The word "pressed" in Greek means "bound" and "confined." The Lord was saying that He came to release the life of God. Yet He was still in the flesh and could not release such a life. He felt bound and confined. Because of His flesh, God's life could not be released; His life was limited by the flesh. This is why He felt bound and confined.</p><p>The Lord spoke of a baptism which He had to be baptized with, which was not yet fulfilled. Since He had already been baptized in chapter three, why did He say that He had another baptism to be baptized with? We must note that the Lord did not say that He had not been baptized. He was saying that there was a baptism that had not yet been accomplished. "Baptism" in this verse clearly refers to His death on the cross (Mark 10:38). The death of Christ was His great release. If Christ had not died, the divine life within Him would have been imprisoned and bound. But once He died, the divine life was released and ready to be received by man. This is what He wished to see.</p><p>The phrase in Jesus is not in the Bible. The Bible only says "in Christ." We cannot be in Jesus, because Jesus was a man. He was God's only begotten Son, and we have no part in Him. No one can be in Jesus of Nazareth. But one day this man who was in the flesh, this individual man, was crucified on the cross. Although His flesh died, this death released His life. When He resurrected from the dead, He became Christ Jesus; He became the One whom we can get into. When we are in Christ, we receive His life; we die and are raised up together with Him. This is what Christ's resurrection has accomplished.</p><p>Let us now turn back to John 12:24. The grain of wheat in this verse refers to Christ, the only Begotten of God. When Christ died, the grain of wheat died. The shell of the grain was broken, and the life of the grain was released. After some time, the one grain became many grains. All the grains come from the one grain. Originally, there was only one grain. Now it has become many grains. The one grain becomes many grains by falling to the ground to die. Christ, the one Man, died; His body was broken, and His life was released. In resurrection, the one grain becomes us; we become the many grains. Our life has its origin in Christ, the one grain. Our life is derived from Christ. In this way, we know what it means for Christ to be the Head and for us to be His members. Although this life is in us today, this life comes from Christ. This is the process through which Christ regenerated us.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING THE SAME LIFE</h2><p>The Lord was first the only begotten Son. After His death and resurrection, He brought forth many grains and became God's firstborn Son. As the many grains, we have now become God's many sons. On the day of resurrection the Lord said to Mary, "I ascend to My Father and your Father" (John 20:17). The Lord could not have said this three days before. But on the day of resurrection, He could say this. Before His death, He did not have such a relationship with us, but through His death and resurrection, He released His life to us. We have all received the same life and become the sons of God. Before our regeneration, we were different in Adam in many ways. Now in Christ we become the same. We have the same life and share the same nature.</p><h2 class="head1">A NEW MAN IN CHRIST</h2><p>Outwardly, baptism appears to be a very simple matter. But we must never consider it as being that simple. Through baptism, everything is buried. The end of Galatians 3 says that those who are baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There cannot be Jew or Greek, slave or free man, male or female; we are all one in Christ Jesus (vv. 27-28). For many years Communism has tried unsuccessfully to abolish all class distinctions. Even if it can abolish the father-son relationship, there are the other relationships that cannot be abolished. But in Christ, all distinctions, including nationality, sex, and class are abolished. In Christ we have all become one. Please remember that our becoming one has everything to do with the baptism in verse 27. We were buried in the water when we acknowledged that our old man had died and that this old man and all that he possessed had been crucified with Christ. When we entered the water, we entered as a person in Adam. But when we came out of the water, we came out as a Christian in Christ. When we came out of the water, all of our differences in Adam were left behind in the baptismal water and buried. We now have Christ as our life; we have all become Christians, and we can now be one.</p>
