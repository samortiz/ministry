[1]  If we know what the key is and how to use it, we possess the secret with which we can unlock the door to the experience of all the fullness of this rich Christ who is our life.
[2]  A very important verse in the New Testament is 1 Thessalonians 5:23: And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3]  Another verse which shows a distinction between the spirit and the soul is Hebrews 4:12: For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit.
[4]  The soul is the soul and the spirit is the spirit, and these two must be separated.
[5]  Since God is Spirit, we must contact Him, worship Him, and fellowship with Him in our spirit and by our spirit.
[6]  At the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit came with Christ as life to quicken and regenerate our spirit, and from that time He dwells within our spirit John 4:24; Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22; 1 Cor 6:17 .
[7]  Christ is in our spirit, and if we would meet Christ, we must turn to our spirit.
[8]  For example, when we approach the Lord in prayer or come to the Word of God to contact Him, we must reject our soulish life our thoughts, our feelings, our desires and turn to our spirit in order to contact and fellowship with Him.
[9]  But the Lord s demand is that we give up the corrupted, Adamic mind, emotion, and will as the center of our life and let the life of Christ in our spirit gain control of our being.
