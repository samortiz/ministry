<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Comprising the Divinity of God<br>and the Humanity of the God-man</H2><P>The Triune God as the content of our Christian life comprises the divinity of God in His Divine Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). He also comprises the humanity of the God-man Jesus in His incarnation (Acts 16:7; Phil. 1:19b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Compounded with:</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Christ's All-resolving and All-terminating Death</H2><P>The processed and consummated Triune God is compounded with Christ's all-resolving and all-terminating death (Heb. 9:26, 28; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 5:24; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; Eph. 2:15; Col. 1:20; John 12:24). It would be helpful to remember these Scripture references. Hebrews 9:26 refers to the resolving of sin. Christ was offered once to take care of sin. Then Hebrews 9:28 says that Christ's death took care of our sins. Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ. Then Galatians 5:24 tells us that Christ's death crucified our flesh and its lusts. Hebrews 2:14 says that Christ's death has destroyed Satan, and John 12:31 says that His death judged the world. Ephesians 2:15 is the verse telling us that Christ's death has abolished all the ordinances. These ordinances include not only those set up by us human beings but also those ordained by God. All of the ordinances were taken away by Christ on the cross. Colossians 1:20 further reveals that Christ's death has taken care of all the created things. Through His death, all the lost created things were brought back to God and reconciled to God. The above verses show that Christ's death dealt with all of the negative things in the universe. John 12:24 is a verse on the positive side of Christ's death, telling us that Christ as the unique grain of wheat fell into the earth to die and bring forth many grains. This is the life-producing death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Christ's All-producing Resurrection</H2><P>The processed and consummated Triune God is also compounded with Christ's all-producing resurrection (Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3; 1 Cor. 15:45b). What was produced in Christ's resurrection? First, Christ was produced as the firstborn Son of God. Second, His resurrection produced the many sons of God to be the members which constitute the Body of Christ, the church. Finally, the life-giving Spirit was produced in His resurrection. Acts 13:33 shows that Christ as the only begotten Son of God was reborn in resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God. Then 1 Peter 1:3 unveils to us that we, the believers of Christ, were born in Christ's resurrection to be the many sons of God. Finally, 1 Corinthians 15:45b reveals that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit in His resurrection. Thus, the resurrection of Christ produced these three main things&#151;the firstborn Son of God, the many sons of God to be the members of Christ constituting His Body as the church, and the life-giving Spirit. This is why I say that this resurrection is the all-producing resurrection.</P>
