   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAKING OUR FORBEARANCE KNOWN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Forbearance is Christ as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Christ whom we live becomes the forbearance we exercise and make known.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we see this, we shall realize that forbearance is a matter of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is by no means an isolated virtue in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the contrary, forbearance is actually a synonym for Christ in our Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, we may say that our Christian life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, we may say that the Christian life is a life of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To make our forbearance known, therefore, means to make our Christ known.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not make known our forbearance, we shall have Christ only in doctrine or terminology, but we shall not have Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Young people, your parents may know that Christ is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, you need to let Christ be made known to your parents by making your forbearance known to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To all those whom we contact day by day we need to let our Christ be made known.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is to let our forbearance be known to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I wish to emphasize the fact that forbearance is nothing less than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In doctrine, we may talk about Christ; but in our experience, we need to have forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To let our forbearance be made known is to make known to others the Christ whom we experience, live, and magnify.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the proper understanding of 4:5 in the light of Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In every chapter of Philippians Christ is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, in chapter four a particular term forbearance is used to denote Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not think that chapter four of Philippians is on a lower level than chapters one, two, and three.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No, in chapter four we have Christ experienced by us and expressed through us as forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may say that the central focus of our Christian life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I certainly agree with such a statement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But from the standpoint of our practical Christian experience, the focus of the Christian life is forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Forbearance is an all-inclusive Christian virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It includes love, patience, kindness, humility, compassion, considerateness, and submissiveness, a willingness to yield.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have such an all-inclusive virtue, we shall also have righteousness and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Christian life is a life full of forbearance but without anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only when we have forbearance can we have a life without anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If our whole being is filled with forbearance, there will not be any room for anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>FITTING AND SUITABLE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek word for forbearance is rendered different ways by different translations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some versions translate the Greek word as yieldingness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word used in the Chinese version means to give in humbly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These understandings are correct, but they are rather shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Other translators point out that the Greek word means reasonable, considerate, suitable, and fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A forbearing person is one who always fits in, one whose behavior is always suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Certain saints are good, but they do not fit in. They may move from place to place, but no matter where they may go, they are not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reason these saints do not fit in is that they are not forbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A forbearing person is one who always fits in, whose behavior is always suitable, no matter what the circumstances or environment may be.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Forbearance also includes peacefulness, mildness, and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are reasonable, considerate, and able to fit in, you will no doubt be gentle, kind, mild, and peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You will also be meek and moderate, full of compassion for others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we pointed out in the previous message, the opposite of forbearance is being just in a very exacting way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A person who lacks forbearance will be exacting and demanding of others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But to be forbearing means that we are satisfied with less than our due.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Alford says that the Greek word for forbearance means to not be strict with respect to legal rights.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, a certain thing may be ours, but we do not claim it according to strict, legal right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is forbearance.</S>
