   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Why is "Christ...the end of the law"?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ as "the end of the law" means that Christ includes everything that the law has.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words, God has not just given you ten thousand talents of silver; all the money in the world has been given you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can you save a few more pennies?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The end of the law is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How are you going to find any more righteousness?</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How are you going to establish your own righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank and praise God that what He has given us is the best!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I would say a strong word in a most reverent way: God has "exhausted" His omnipotence in His Son Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The end of the law is Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those believing in Jesus are bound to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no possibility for them not to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I like this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is impossible for us not to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has given us His Son, who does not only possess the little that you need, but even everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God can never forsake those who have believed into His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has no way to reject us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All those who come to God through the Son must receive righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There will be no hassle; the guarantee is sure.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The other passage of Scripture is 2 Corinthians 5:21.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have been saved, but we still live as humans.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is true that we are now saved, and that our sins are forgiven, but what do we do while living on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are all Christians today, and are all the children of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regarding His children, God declares something most amazing here: "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has made the Lord Jesus sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Originally the Lord Jesus was without sin at all; He had nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now God has judged Him as though judging sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God judged Him this way "that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today in the Lord Jesus Christ, you and I are the showpiece of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When people see us, they see God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We, the sinners, through the Lord Jesus becoming sin for us and through His bearing of our sins to forgive us, have now become the righteousness of God in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are the living righteousness of God walking on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Christ we are the representatives of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you do not know what God's righteousness is, all you need to do is find a saved person and take a good look at him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will then know what God's righteousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you want to know what God's righteousness is, just find a Christian and you will know that God has not dealt with our sins irresponsibly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He has made sin Him who knew no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because the Lord Jesus has died, the work of redemption is accomplished.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He loves us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is not loose concerning sin at all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why He caused the Lord Jesus to die on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Look at me, a saved sinner today.</S>
