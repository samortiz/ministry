<p>In John 15 the Lord said, &ldquo;I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit...These things I command you that you may love one another&rdquo; (vv. 16-17). We must remember that bearing fruit is based on loving one another. If we do not love others, we will never bear fruit. The Lord&rsquo;s command to love one another does not apply only to those who are equal to us but even more to those who are weaker and backslidden. We love them because God loves them and because they are members of the Body of Christ. If we love one another, we will bear fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOVE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>True joining is true love for one another and true building up, which issue in bearing fruit. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up&rdquo; (1 Cor. 8:1). A building that is built of concrete and steel is sturdy and firm, because the concrete joins the stones, steel, and other materials together. The joining force in the Body of Christ is the love of Christ. Without the joining force of concrete, the materials in a building cannot be sturdy and firm. Likewise, if there are only knowledge and doctrine in the church but not the love of Christ, people will be scattered. The more doctrine we have, the more scattered the believers will be. Knowledge cannot build up; only love builds up. Love can pull together those who are falling away, unite the scattered ones, and cause the backslidden to move forward and the stumbled to stand. Love can join people together.</p>
<p>The church in Corinth was full of knowledge; hence, the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;In everything you were enriched in Him, in all utterance and all knowledge&rdquo; (1:5). However, the church in Corinth did not have the building up. On the contrary, there were divisions, strifes, criticisms, and judgments among them (vv. 11-12). The apostle seems to say that they were not short in knowledge or gifts but in love (13:2, 8). First Corinthians 13 is the only chapter in the whole Bible that speaks so specifically about love. The apostle speaks about all kinds of gifts in chapter 12, but in verse 31 he says, &ldquo;Earnestly desire the greater gifts. And moreover I show to you a most excellent way.&rdquo; Every gift requires a proper way in order for it to be used. Hence, we not only need the gifts, but we also need the way to use the gifts. The apostle presents love as the most excellent way to use the gifts.</p>
<p>For this reason, he speaks specifically about love in chapter 13, saying, &ldquo;If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). No matter what kind of gift we have, apart from love it will be rendered useless. The apostle also speaks concerning the true meaning and significance of love. If we read these verses carefully, we will see that every item is a lesson to us. Suffering long and covering all things are lessons that require us to be broken (vv. 4, 7).</p>
<p>Gifts are not foremost. Rather, love is foremost. If in any church there is a group of saints who genuinely love one another, cover one another, endure, care for, and support one another, that church will still be living even if no one has a gift of giving a message. In some places there are several believers who have the gift of giving messages, but the more they speak, the colder and drier the meeting becomes, the number of saints in the meetings gets smaller, and the saints become detached and scattered. This is because knowledge does not build up. Only love builds up.</p>
<p>May the Lord show us that if we want to afford Him a resting place, a dwelling place, and to allow Him to carry out His will in this age, we must prostrate ourselves before Him and be broken. We need to let Him remove many problems from within us, and we need to learn to be persons who can be joined together and built up with others. The problems in us must be removed so that we may love every brother and sister, regardless of their condition. We love all men because our love is of the Lord. This is the way for us to be joined with the saints as members of the Body and to be built up together. This is the way for us to be fruitful and full of function and to cause the Body of Christ, the church, to build itself up in love.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Type, and Practice of the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
