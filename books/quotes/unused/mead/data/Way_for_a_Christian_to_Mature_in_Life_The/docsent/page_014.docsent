   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD WANTING TO TRANSFORM THE MAN OF CLAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO PURE GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 2:7 records that in the beginning God formed man with the dust of the ground, 1 Corinthians 15:47 tells us that Adam is earthy, and 2 Corinthians 4:7 says that we were created to be earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The term earthen vessel in Greek denotes an earthy vessel made of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, even after receiving the life and nature of the pure gold within, we still may not have the image of the precious stones without.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may still be earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We remain the same because the life of God has not yet transformed us enough.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After we are saved, although we may not sin as we did before, much of our being remains unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though we may be somewhat transformed into the image of Christ, that amount of transformation is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have the life and nature of the pure gold within, but we may be short of the glorious image of the precious stones without.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God first put Adam in the garden of Eden, there were pure gold and precious stones there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s purpose was that the man of clay would be transformed into pure gold and precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in the garden of Eden we can see the tree of life and the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God wanted Adam to receive the life from the tree of life and the river of life so that he could be transformed into pure gold and precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BEING BOTH A CITY AND A PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we come to Revelation 21, a city of pure gold appears, and a wall of precious stones is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The street of this city is pure gold, and the outward wall is composed of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This city is a sign with a twofold significance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On one hand, this city signifies a place, because it is a city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, it signifies a person because it is a bride, the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, this city is the dwelling place of God and all the saints, and it is also the issue of God s work in man throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This city is a man of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the garden of Eden in Genesis, we see man, pure gold, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The man, the pure gold, and the precious stones are separate from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we come to the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21, we see pure gold and precious stones but no man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where is man?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Can anyone find man in the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Genesis we can see man in the garden of Eden, but in Revelation we cannot see man in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 is the issue of God s work in man throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The city, the place itself is man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the New Jerusalem, man, the pure gold, and the precious stones are one and cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the foundations of the wall of the city we can see the names of the twelve apostles, but we cannot see the twelve apostles themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this respect the New Jerusalem is different from the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the garden of Eden we can see Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if we went to the city in Revelation and saw a stone with Peter s name on it and asked where Peter was, I am afraid Peter would tell us, I am actually this stone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not our own inference.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1 Peter 2, Peter says that every saved one is a living stone before the Lord and is being built together with the Lord Jesus to be a spiritual house for God s dwelling v. 5 . In Ephesians 2 Paul also says that the saved ones are being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Old Testament God s people were in the holy temple, but in the New Testament God s people are the holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the New Testament the physical temple is gone, and the saved ones are built together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the New Testament the saved ones are the holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, we may say that the holy temple is a place and also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today the church has a twofold significance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On one hand it is a dwelling place, and on the other hand it is a group of people saved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same way, the coming New Jerusalem also has a twofold significance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On one hand it is God s dwelling place, a city, and on the other hand it is also God s counterpart, a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, in the New Jerusalem one stone is Peter, one stone is James, and another stone is John.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The twelve precious stones, which are the foundations of the wall of the city, are the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the saved ones throughout the ages are living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They all have the life of God in them, and in this life they are joined together to become the living dwelling place of God, a living city.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the coming New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>People may ask why this city is also a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They may ask why it is both the dwelling place of God and also the wife of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, when a man gets married, his bride is one thing a person and his bridal chamber is another thing a building.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But when God marries man, the bride and the bridal chamber will be one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The bridal chamber will be the bride, and the bride will be the bridal chamber.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot comprehend this in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is like Revelation 21, which says, The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass v. 21 . How can gold be transparent as glass? We cannot comprehend this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Nevertheless, we have to believe that this is not our interpretation but the revelation from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What God has been doing throughout the ages is transforming the redeemed ones with His life to make them precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One day this group of people will fully become God s eternal dwelling place in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you still want to go to heaven, you will ultimately be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One day you will become the place that you want to go to.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As the bride, do you merely wish to live in the bridal chamber?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One day you will actually be the bridal chamber, because the bride of Christ is also His bridal chamber.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is indeed a mysterious and wonderful matter.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Throughout the ages, God has been working continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Ultimately, He will make Himself one with man and bring heaven and earth together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christianity talks about the saved ones going up to heaven, but Revelation tells us that the coming New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We do not need to go up to the New Jerusalem because we are entering into it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In fact, we are not even merely entering into it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead, we are becoming part of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the result of God s mysterious plan throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What are the new heaven and new earth, and what is the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They are the oneness of God and man and the oneness of heaven and earth with nothing in between.</S>
