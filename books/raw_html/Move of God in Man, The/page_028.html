<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Blood Shed by Christ on the Cross<br>Being "God's Own Blood" in Acts 20:28</H2><P>Paul said in Acts 20:28 that the blood that Christ shed on the cross was God's own blood. God bought, purchased, the church with His own blood, so the church is so dear, so beloved, in the feeling of God and in the eyes of God. This was the word spoken by Paul to the elders of Ephesus. He was impressing the elders from Ephesus that they should love the church, considering the church very dear and beloved as God does. The church is so dear and beloved to God in His feeling, so He purchased the church with His own blood. The Bible in Acts 20:28 says that the divine God has human blood.</P><P>As we have pointed out, Charles Wesley wrote a very good hymn with a good melody, in which he spoke of the crucifixion of Christ. This is hymn #296 in our hymnal. A number of years ago, I translated this hymn into Chinese. Charles Wesley had the boldness to say in this hymn that the immortal God died for us. I am so glad that he declared this truth and that it is printed in the hymnal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Being One with Christ All the Time</H2><P>The crucifixion of Christ was also God's crucifixion because God is one with Christ all the time (John 8:29; 16:32). God never left Christ alone. When Christ was incarnated, God was incarnated. They coinhered. When Christ was living on this earth, God was living. When Christ was crucified, God was crucified. This is because They coinhere, that is, They mutually indwell each other. In the Gospels Christ told us repeatedly that the Father was in Him and He was in the Father (John 10:38; 14:10-11, 20; 17:21). Thus, we may say that God died in Christ, so Christ's crucifixion became God's crucifixion. God died in man. God died not in His own death but in another One's death. God died in the Son's death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF GOD<br>IN THE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRIST</H2><P>Now we want to see the accomplishments of God in the crucifixion of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking Away the Sin of the World<br>for God's Eternal Redemption</H2><P>In the crucifixion of Christ, God took away the sin of the world for His eternal redemption (John 1:29; Heb. 9:26, 28; 1 Cor. 15:3; Heb. 9:12). Sin implies the singular sin and the plural sins. In John 1:29 "sin" is a total term, implying both the inward sin in our nature and the outward sins, trespasses, in our conduct.</P>
