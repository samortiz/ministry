IN THE DIVINE ADMINISTRATION</h2><h2 class=head2>1. As the Ruler of the Kings of the Earth Ruling the Whole World That the Gospel May Be Spread and the Church May Be Produced</h2><p>In His work in the divine administration Christ is the Ruler of the kings of the earth. As the Ruler of the kings of the earth, Christ rules the whole earth that the gospel may be spread and the church may be produced. Apparently the earth is ruled by kings and presidents. Actually the earth is ruled by Christ, the highest Ruler, who is above all kings and presidents. If we study history in the light of the Bible, we shall realize that history has been altogether under the hand of Christ as the Ruler of the kings. He is ruling sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God&#8217;s chosen people to receive His salvation (Acts 17:26-27; John 17:2). He is managing the world&#8217;s situation for the purpose of producing the church so that He may come back to establish the kingdom of God on earth. Now we need to do our part by being faithful to Him so that He may use us to spread the gospel and build up the church.<h2 class=head2>2. As the High Priest,  Judging and Purifying the Churches and Holding the Messengers of the Churches</h2><p>In the divine administration Christ is also the High Priest, judging and purifying the churches and holding the messengers of the churches. Revelation 1:13 says, &#8220;In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.&#8221; Here Christ is depicted as the High Priest, as shown by His garment, a priestly robe reaching to the feet, signifying the fullness of His divine attributes and human virtues. Verse 14 says that His eyes are as a &#8220;flame of fire.&#8221; This fire is for divine judgment. Hence, the main significance of the Lord&#8217;s eyes being as a flame of fire is for His judgment. Furthermore, verse 15 says, &#8220;His feet were like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace.&#8221; Here the feet signify the walk. In typology brass signifies divine judgment (Exo. 27:1-6). Christ&#8217;s feet being like shining brass indicates that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise divine judgment. Therefore, in the divine administration Christ is judging the churches and purifying them.<p>Revelation 1:16, 20 and 2:1 indicate that, as the High Priest, Christ is holding the messengers of the churches. These messengers are signified by the seven stars in His right hand. The messengers of the churches are the spiritual ones in the churches bearing the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus. They should be of the heavenly nature and in a heavenly position like stars.<p>Revelation 2:12 says that Christ &#8220;has the sharp two-edged sword,&#8221; and 2:18, that He &#8220;has eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like shining brass.&#8221; In dealing with the church in Pergamos, the worldly church, Christ refers to Himself as the One who has the sharp two-edged sword. In dealing with the church in Thyatira, the apostate church, He refers to Himself as the One who has eyes as a flame of fire and whose feet are like shining brass. The worldly church requires the dealing of His smiting and killing word, whereas the apostate church needs the judging of His searching eyes and treading feet.<p>Today in the recovery Christ, the High Priest in the divine administration, is not only building up the churches in different localities but also judging and purifying them. He is also holding the responsible ones, the faithful ones, who are bearing the burden of His testimony on earth. We trust in Him and look to Him for His continued purifying and holding so that we all may go on in a pure way.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> </body></html>
