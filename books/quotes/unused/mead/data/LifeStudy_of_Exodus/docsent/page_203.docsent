   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD S COUNTENANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND OF THE SHINING OF HIS FACE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we enjoy God Himself, we also enjoy His countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Immediately after speaking of God as his portion, the psalmist says, I entreated thy countenance with my whole heart v. 58, Heb . It is also true in our spiritual experience that when we enjoy God, we desire to see His face.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to verse 58, the psalmist entreated the Lord s countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This expression is rather unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Have you ever heard of someone praying by entreating the Lord s countenance?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you consider your experience, you will realize that out of love for the Lord, there have been times when you longed to see His face.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You wanted to be under the shining of His countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His countenance was all-important to you, and you wanted nothing else but to remain under His countenance and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 135 the psalmist prayed, Make thy face to shine upon thy servant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the psalmist also enjoyed the shining of God s face.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The utterances of the psalmist about the Lord s countenance and the shining of His face are not doctrinal teachings; rather, they are words of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The psalmist was not just taught about these things; he experienced them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I also can testify that although I was never taught to seek the Lord s countenance or the shining of His face, from my experience I have learned how marvelous and wonderful it is to enjoy the Lord Himself, His countenance, and the shining of His face.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In seeking the Lord s countenance, I experience the shining of His face.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his book The Practice of the Presence of God , Brother Lawrence emphasizes the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, I do not recall that he said much, if anything, about the shining of the Lord s face.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The psalmist s expression regarding the shining of the Lord s face is very sweet, more dear and intimate than Brother Lawrence s words about God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should pray, O Lord, cause Your face to shine upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, I long to enjoy Your shining countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To enjoy the shining of the Lord s face is richer and more satisfying than simply experiencing His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you are faithful in contacting the Lord through the Word, you also will experience the shining of His countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your desire will be to remain under this pleasant, delightful shining.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such an experience and enjoyment prove that our God is real, present, practical, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What we have is not merely doctrine, but the genuine enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some say that they find it difficult to believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But because I have tasted Him and enjoyed so much of Him, I find it even more difficult to deny that God exists.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I was a child, my mother loved me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But she could not give me the kind of enjoyment I have in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only God Himself affords the supreme enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I do not have the words to utter how wonderful is the enjoyment of the shining of the Lord s countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To experience the shining of the Lord s face is even easier than to experience the shining of light by turning on the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I was a child, we did not have electricity in our house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We used old-fashioned oil lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was my responsibility to keep the lamps clean and supplied with oil, a task I disliked very much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How happy I was when electricity was installed!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No longer did I need to clean the lamps and fill them with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To get light in a room, all I had to do was turn on the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Enjoying God is even easier than this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we have been regenerated, God is now in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is the light, and our spirit is the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we want to experience Him and enjoy His shining, we simply need to turn on the switch by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once God comes into us, He never leaves us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This fact, however, is not realized by all Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many years ago, a certain booklet on the Spirit put out by a German mission was popular in China.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this booklet there was a picture of a dove, which represented the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the picture in this booklet, if we are good, the dove stays with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if we offend the Spirit, the dove flies away.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At first, I appreciated this book and valued it highly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, Watchman Nee wrote articles in protest to the teaching that the Holy Spirit leaves us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The dove of the Spirit never flies away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He always remains with us; we cannot chase Him away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At most, we can cause Him to be unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Paul s words, we may grieve the Holy Spirit Eph 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the Spirit fled from us whenever we displeased Him, it would not be possible to grieve the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The fact that we can grieve Him proves that He never leaves us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is with us even when we lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, when we are tempted to be angry and lose our temper, we should call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then the One who is always with us will rescue us from our anger.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How real, available, and practical He is!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>With the ancient psalmists, we who believe in Christ can testify from our experience, not from mere doctrine, that the Lord is real and that we enjoy Him.</S>
