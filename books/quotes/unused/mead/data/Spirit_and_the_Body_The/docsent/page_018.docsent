   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT AS A REPELLENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The all-inclusive Spirit is also a repellent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of us are familiar with the way the odor of insect repellent drives away mosquitoes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Day by day we must put on the life-giving Spirit as a repellent to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, you not only drink of Him; you also put on the life-giving Spirit as a repellent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the first thing in the morning you do not put on this repellent, the snake will attack you, and you may lose your temper during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if you call on the Lord's name a few times, you will not only drink of the living water, but also apply the repellent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever you do this, the snake will be frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we can understand why we are told in John 7 that the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, the Spirit of God was there, but the Spirit of Christ as the compound Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 16:6 speaks of the Holy Spirit, and Acts 16:7 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>. Today the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Spirit of God there is no humanity, but in the Spirit of Jesus there is both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As Paul was traveling and preaching, he needed not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our preaching today we also need the Spirit of Jesus, into which His humanity has been compounded.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 8:9 reveals that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, just as Acts 16 reveals that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Acts 16 we have the Spirit of Jesus, indicating that the apostles were suffering in the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in Romans 8 we have the Spirit of Christ, indicating that today we may live in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 8 is a chapter on the resurrection life, which is in the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Philippians 1:19 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is neither the Spirit only with humanity nor the Spirit only with resurrection, for in the Spirit of Jesus Christ we have both humanity and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the supply of such a Spirit is a bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not merely the Spirit of God with divine power, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ, including both Christ's suffering humanity and powerful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, he was in prison and was suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although he was suffering there by the Spirit of Jesus, he suffered with the power of Christ's resurrection and with the expectation of enjoying the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This reveals that he was suffering not only by the Spirit of Jesus, but also by the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, he was suffering by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, by the humanity of Jesus and by the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the all-inclusive Spirit with His bountiful supply.</S>
