   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT SANCTIFYING, CLEANSING, NOURISHING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CHERISHING 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 5:26 and 29 there are four crucial words: sanctify, cleanse, nourish, and cherish.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the enemy has veiled these matters, not many Christians have a clear understanding of their significance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason, I am very burdened of the Lord to consider them further in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE ADDITION OF THE ELEMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s intention in His economy is not to correct us or to improve us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Neither is it to have good people in place of bad people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the eyes of God, it does not matter whether we are good or bad, for the only thing of value in His economy is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, God s desire is to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether we are good or bad, we need the element of Christ added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This involves Christ s work in sanctifying us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sanctification in 5:26 does not mean merely to be separated from what is common, but it means to have the very element of Christ added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sanctification is not a matter of adjusting ourselves outwardly to fit into the situation of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, a young brother may have been rather loose before coming into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now that he is living in a brothers house he constantly reminds himself to behave properly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This behavior is not sanctification it is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the eyes of God, such religious behavior is included in what Paul calls dung Phil 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord does not want our self-improvement or self-adjustment; He wants to saturate our whole being with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, sanctification is not behavior, but the addition of the element of Christ to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>NOT DELIBERATE BEHAVIOR,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BUT A SPONTANEOUS EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As one who is familiar with both the Bible and the teachings of Confucius, I have come to realize that in their daily living many Christians live as if they were disciples of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Under the influence of the religious concept, they regard the Bible as a book of doctrines and ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, a sister may try desperately to submit to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In doing this, she is actually living like a follower of Confucius, all the while believing that she is being a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She explains her behavior by saying that, according to the Bible, her husband is the head and she is obligated to submit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a word sounds very good, but it is religious, for it is not according to God s economy to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all know that in 5:22 Paul exhorts the wives to be subject to their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But do not forget that this follows his word about being filled in spirit v. 18 . This indicates that a wife s submission should come out of the infilling of the Spirit, not out of an outward, deliberate attempt to be submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Often in Christian weddings a pastor will charge the bride and groom according to Paul s word in Ephesians 5 regarding husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The wife promises to submit to her husband, and the husband vows to love his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, neither the bride nor the groom realizes that submission and love are the issue of being filled in our spirit with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a sister s submission is genuine, it will not require deliberate effort.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, she will submit spontaneously out of her experience of Christ and her enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She may not even realize that she is submissive, for she submits without purposely trying to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such submission comes out of the element of Christ that has been imparted into that sister.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How different this is from submitting because she has been taught to be under the headship of her husband!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such deliberate submission is religious and is not according to God s economy.</S>
