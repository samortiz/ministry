   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY-FOUR BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MANIFESTATION OF MATURITY 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last message we pointed out the difference between transformation and maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Transformation is the metabolic change in life, and maturity is the fullness in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Maturity is the last stage of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we are being transformed, we are also being filled with life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more we are transformed, the more we are filled with life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one can be filled with life without being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The degree of the filling is in proportion to the degree of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we have been completely transformed, we shall be filled with life in its fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From chapter twenty-five to chapter thirty-two we see no change in Jacob's life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the record of chapter twenty-five, Jacob began supplanting even before he was born.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jacob's transformation began from the time God touched him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This took place in chapter thirty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although in chapters twenty-five to thirty-two there is no transformation, no change in life, these chapters are full of dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Remember, Jacob spent twenty years under the hand of Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During those years he suffered one dealing after another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After those twenty years of dealings, one night, at Peniel, the Lord came and touched Jacob's strongest part, his thigh, and Jacob became lame.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That marked the beginning of Jacob's transformation, and the process of transformation continued from chapter thirty-two to chapter thirty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In these chapters we see a picture of how Jacob was being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, after the time Jacob lost Joseph in chapter thirty-seven, we see no further change in Jacob's life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason for this is that at that time his transformation was nearly completed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, in chapter thirty-seven Jacob's maturity began.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are three distinct periods in Jacob's life: the period of dealings, the period of transformation, and the period of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you compare three chapters, twenty-seven, thirty-seven, and forty-seven, you will see the dealings, the transformation, and the maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter forty-seven Jacob's maturity reaches its peak and it is fully manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this message we shall consider the manifestation of Jacob's maturity.</S>
