   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPE OF THE RED HEIFER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a kind of cleansing in the Old Testament which is a type of the forgiveness of believers in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The words in 1 John 1 and 2 are typified in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us read what can be considered as the only portion in the Old Testament dealing with the forgiveness of the Christians' sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Numbers 19:1-13 says, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Tell the sons of Israel to bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect, and upon which a yoke has never come.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And you shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and she shall be taken outside the camp and slaughtered before him; and Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle some of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And the heifer shall be burned in his sight; her skin, her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burned; and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterwards he shall come into the camp; and the priest shall be unclean until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And he who burns it shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and place them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the assembly of the sons of Israel for the water for impurity; it is a purification of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And this shall be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger who sojourns among them, for a perpetual statute.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days; he shall purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whoever touches a dead person, the body of any man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Jehovah, and that person shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Numbers 19 a sacrifice is described.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This sacrifice is the most unique sacrifice in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The book of Numbers is not a book on offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The book on offerings is Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this sacrifice is not mentioned in Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, it is mentioned in Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We know that the Passover lamb was slain in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This typifies the Lord Jesus' death for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At Mount Sinai God showed us again what the Passover lamb is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The five offerings in Leviticus are the Passover lamb analyzed and broken down.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They show us the different aspects of the Lord Jesus and how He satisfies God's requirements in redeeming man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of these are for the sinners and were spoken of at Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The book of Numbers, however, is a book on the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a history of the children of Israel's wandering in the wilderness of Paran.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There the children of Israel lived as sojourners in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were a nation sojourning in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There God gave them another sacrifice, which is the sacrifice of the red heifer.</S>
