<h2 class=head2>Ephesians 4:4-6</h2><p>The third passage in the New Testament which speaks of the Triune God is Ephesians 4:4-6, which says, “One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.” Here we see the Spirit, the Son, and the Father, because these three verses speak of the Body of Christ. When we speak of the Body of Christ, we must begin with the Spirit, because it is the Spirit who is in the Body. Hence, it is “one Body and one Spirit.” How does this one Spirit come to us? It is by our being put into Him through our believing in the Lord and being baptized (Mark 16:16; 1 Cor. 12:13). Thus, it is “one Lord, one faith, one baptism.” The result is that we are regenerated to become the children of God, and God is gained by us. This means that this God is not only the God who created us but also the Father who regenerated us. He is our God and Father, who is over us and through us and in us. This is how the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—become our reality and experience in our living as the foundation and element of all our living.<p>If we have not clearly seen that the Triune God is one, then we will never be able to clearly explain these passages. If these three verses are explained according to the traditional teachings of Christianity, then some may say that there are three different Gods, and some may even say that God is not only three in one, but five in one: one is the Spirit, another one is the Lord, and still another one is composed of “three Gods,” one who is over us, another who is through us, and still another who is in us. This verse does not say that this One who is over us passes through us and now abides in us; this would involve three steps. Here Paul clearly says that these aspects are simultaneous. The one God and Father is over us and at the same time is through us and again at the same time is in us. Since He is one, how can He simultaneously be over us and through us and in us? This is the mystery of the Triune God, but it is a reality in our experience. In our experience this profound, mysterious God is over us and through us and in us. What Christianity sees is very shallow, but what we believe and experience are the divine mysteries in the Bible. We have discovered these profound points in the Bible in order to help the saints, hoping to give everyone a key to open this treasure store. I hope the young brothers and sisters would pick up the burden to continue to seek out the riches in the Bible.<p>Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of the Body of Christ. In the Body of Christ there is one Spirit. This Spirit is simply the Lord, and the Lord is the Father. The Spirit is the Son, the Son is the Father, and the Father is the Triune God, who can be over us and through us and in us. Here the words over, through, and in prove that God the Father is the Triune God. This Triune God is the Father and the Son and the Spirit. If He were only the Father, He could only be over us; if He were just the Son, He could only be through us; and if He were simply the Spirit, He could only be in us. But God the Father is the Father and the Son and the Spirit, so He can be over us and through us and in us. This also shows us that we can neither experience only the Spirit, as taught by Pentecostalism, nor only Christ, as taught by “orthodox” theology and the inner life teachers. When we experience the Spirit, we experience the Triune God, and when we experience Christ, we experience the Triune God. This is very clear.<h2 class=head2>Second Corinthians 13:14</h2><p>The fourth passage in the New Testament which speaks about the Triune God is 2 Corinthians 13:14, which says, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” Are these three steps or one step in three aspects? Are these experienced simultaneously or in succession? Do we first experience the grace of Christ, then the love of the Father, and finally the fellowship of the Holy Spirit? Actually, these are three aspects which we experience at the same time. In the fellowship of the Holy Spirit there is the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ brings the love of the Father to us. Grace and love in reality are one. Love is the hidden source; when love is expressed, it becomes grace. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the pouring out, the transmission, and the application, which applies to us the love that the Father manifests and that is expressed in the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, love, grace, and fellowship are actually one. These are not three separate items but three aspects of one item, just as the Lord Jesus Christ, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods but three hypostases of the one undivided and indivisible God. Therefore, we cannot have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit without the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST BEING THE EXPERIENCE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>The preceding four passages of the New Testament clearly reveal the Triune God, and all prove to us that both the experience of Christ and the experience of the Holy Spirit are in reality the experience of the Triune God. We all need to rid ourselves of our natural concepts and of the influences of Christianity, receive the pure revelation of the Bible, and correctly and diligently check with our own experience. If we fail to do these things, we will not be able to thoroughly and completely experience the Triune God.
