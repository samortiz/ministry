   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Experiences</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Are an Essential Factor</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second, we must go through various experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people have spent much time before God, but they have not passed through many experiences before God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If one wants to become rich, he must spend time before God, and he must pass through many experiences before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The experiences one has to go through are the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some people have been Christians for eight or ten years, but it seems as if the Holy Spirit is very lenient with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seems that He does not discipline them or even pay attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is as if the Holy Spirit does not want to concern Himself with their affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Other people, however, are taken in hand and not let off; they are severely disciplined by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It does not seem to matter what some people do, because the Holy Spirit does not speak to them through their situations or their consciences.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their situations do not give them much trouble, nor do their consciences.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though these people have the benefit of the passage of much time, they do not learn much from God because they are not restricted, carved, hindered, and chastised enough.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, they are not rich before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, let us not be dismayed by the difficulties we face before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every one of these situations adds to our wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fewer problems we have, the less we will have in reserve, and the fewer words we will be able to share with others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one can have a word without experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our wealth in the Word and our service to God's children are in proportion to the experiences we go through.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our supply comes through the lessons we have learned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not something that doctrines can give to us; nor is it something that commentaries on the Bible can give to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is something we learn when the Holy Spirit leads us in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, I hope that we will not be slack in our daily experience in learning to follow God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In all the disappointment and disillusionment we face, let us recognize the Lord's severe dealings with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us bow before Him in gratitude and worship Him, acknowledging that His purpose in all these things is to enrich us and to lead us to abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A certain brother thought that he was quite strong in faith until he fell ill.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then he began to learn the real meaning of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have never been poor, we do not know how to look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have never been ill, we do not know faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we have never had problems, we do not know true worship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are without experiences and have not learned anything, we are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Anyone who tries to avoid difficulties is a poor person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone who asks for easy circumstances is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we want progress, we must ask for some situations to pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we want to learn, the more we must experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our hope, our faith, and our submission all come into these different situations to edify us and bring us through.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we have one more situation added outwardly, we will have one more item of spiritual wealth added inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must realize that every situation we encounter is for teaching us something, no matter how hard it is for our flesh or how much we dislike it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must bow our head and say, "This is a chance, a once-in-a-lifetime chance, a hard-to-come-by opportunity!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, I thank You!"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are many people around us who are Christians, but some seem to be protected from trials.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This kind of brother or sister has a very peaceful, quiet life, but we immediately sense that the faith, hope, and reliance of these saints are very small and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, I hope you will listen to my frank words.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you encounter trials, you should lift up your head and praise the Lord, saying, "Lord, You are creating another opportunity within me for me to gain some riches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything is working together for good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You are going to produce something in me that others do not have so that I can supply the church."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers, do not be deceived into thinking that you will be able to preach by dint of much study.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A man can deliver a message, but he does not necessarily have a rich spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A man can improve his preaching and increase the abundance of his words, but this does not make him wealthy in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Being full of meaningful utterance and being full of the Spirit are two entirely different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is not treating us wrongly when He gives us more trials and difficulties; He is actually treating us very well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He has selected us and has granted us favor by providing us this big opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must look for this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have the light, we should always consider one matter: How many experiences have we passed through before the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do we have any reserves?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It does not matter how proud we are; our pride is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have something inwardly, we have it; if we do not, we do not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more we want to deceive others, the more they will know us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The prouder we are and the more we try to put on a good front, the more we will expose ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once we open our mouth, we expose ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not presume that we can deceive others when our skin feels like Esau but our voice sounds like Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The amount of our spiritual wealth is based on the amount of experiences we have passed through.</S>
