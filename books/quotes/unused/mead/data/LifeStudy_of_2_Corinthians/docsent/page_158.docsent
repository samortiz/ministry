   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL ACCUSED OF CRAFTINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 16 says, But let it be so, I did not burden you, but being crafty I took you with guile.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have pointed out, this is what some Corinthians charged against the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They said he was crafty in making gain, indemnifying himself by sending Titus to receive the collection for the poor saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The words let it be so mean to let the former matter go.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is to forget about the past, to let the past go.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although Paul did not burden the Corinthians, some of them were saying that he was crafty and took them with guile.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They said that Paul would not come himself, but used Titus as a cover to indemnify himself while he hid behind the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They were accusing Paul of being the one who actually collected the money through Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In their judgment, that was Paul s craftiness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Having been inwardly warned concerning the matter, Paul sent more than one person with Titus to collect the money.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did this in order to silence the defaming tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, even though Paul acted carefully and with forethought, some of the Corinthians still defamed him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We learn from Paul s experience that even though the saints may be honest, Satan is nonetheless crouching among them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan uses money to damage the situation between the ministering ones and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among the distracted Corinthians, some were criticizing Paul for being crafty in money matters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>WALKING IN THE SAME SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verses 17 and 18 Paul asks, Did I take advantage of you through anyone whom I have sent to you?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I entreated Titus and sent with him the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Did Titus take advantage of you?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Did we not walk in the same spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not in the same steps?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spirit in verse 18 denotes our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This spirit should govern, rule, direct, regulate, and lead us in our Christian walk Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The apostles walk in such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul s word in verses 16, 17, and 18 helps us to understand what some of the Corinthians had been saying concerning Paul and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were accusing Paul of deceiving them, cheating them, and taking advantage of them by sending Titus to collect money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It surely was not a pleasant matter for Paul to write about such things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It may seem to us that words such as these should not be found in the writings of a holy apostle, one who had received from the Lord the commission of a high ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this portion of 2 Corinthians Paul is performing surgery on the church at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He cut them open and removed the parts that were corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church in Corinth was so seriously ill that medicine could not cure them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They could only be helped by surgery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, Paul, a spiritual surgeon, performed surgery in order to heal the church and restore it, recover it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as the relationship between the believers and the apostle had not been adjusted, the church would continue to be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, an operation was necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this chapter we see how honest Paul was as a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the title of this message, here we have Paul s vindication of his apostolic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, I do not like to use the word vindication.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Probably Paul did not have the feeling that he was vindicating himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, he was seeking to heal the Corinthians by operating on them, by cutting out anything corrupt from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I believe that this message can be helpful to all those, especially the young, who have a heart for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, the young ones will be in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It certainly will be necessary for them to have a proper understanding concerning money.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all must learn not to be greedy, but instead, to spend what we have for others, even to spend ourselves, our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should be willing to pour out our whole being spirit, soul, and body for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then what we do and what we are will be a benefit to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we touch the work of the Lord for His Body, we must have a pure motive and a proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead of seeking what others have, we should seek only them and desire to gain them for the Lord s Body and to spend utterly what we are and have for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then the Body will be healed, and we shall be preserved.</S>
