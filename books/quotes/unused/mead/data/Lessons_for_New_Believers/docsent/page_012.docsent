   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONLY TERMINATING THE THINGS OF THE PAST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A believer who desires to witness for the Lord and to walk the way of the Lord in a pure manner must fully terminate the things of his past.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, if a casino operator is saved, his sin of operating a casino has been forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the dark things he may have done in operating the casino are forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if he desires to be a proper Christian and follow the Lord, he must stop operating the casino.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The casino must be closed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He will not lose his salvation if he does not close the casino, but there will be no way for him to be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he wants to walk the way of the Lord, he must close the casino.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The closing of the casino is a termination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another example is a person s clothing, especially women s clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some clothing overexposes the body, and other clothing looks strange; they are unbecoming.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a person wearing such clothing is saved, God forgives her for the way she dressed in the past, and the matter is over.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the clothing must be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She will not lose her salvation if she continues to wear this clothing, nor will she break a law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it will be difficult for her to be a proper Christian if she continues to wear such clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She should terminate, that is, no longer wear, strange clothes and clothes that expose her body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will enable her to follow the Lord properly and walk on His way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to follow the Lord and bear witness for the Lord, we need to terminate everything that is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can a believer bring people to the Lord if he does not close his casino or nightclub after he is saved?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He will be unable to witness for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same applies to a sister who still wears strange clothing and exposes her body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if she desires to bear witness for the Lord, it is unlikely that people will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we desire to walk on the right path and to bear a proper testimony, we must terminate the things of our past life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more seriously we address this point, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not a requirement of the law, and there is no regulation regarding how we should terminate the past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if we want to follow the Lord properly and bear witness for Him, we must terminate our former manner of living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, this is a conclusion of the past, not a searching through our past.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to follow the Lord and bear witness for the Lord, we need to conclude our past, but we do not need to search through our past.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Terminating the past is necessary; searching through the past is unnecessary and even can be harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>EXAMPLES OF TERMINATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the actions of a person who is saved by grace depend upon the moving of the Holy Spirit, not on regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no explicit teaching in the Bible regarding how a person should terminate the past after he repents and is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the New Testament has clear examples that show the work of the Holy Spirit within a believer in regard to terminating the things of his past and dealing with the improper items.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no direct teaching in the Scriptures concerning terminating the past; there are only examples.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Abandoning Idolatrous Things</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1 Thessalonians 1:9 Paul said that when the Thessalonians believed in the Lord, they turned away from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Most unbelievers in places like China and Japan have idols and things pertaining to idols in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, once a person is saved, he should completely remove idolatrous things from his life without waiting to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It may not be necessary to act immediately in regard to other matters, but we should be quick to terminate things related to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we feel that we do not have the strength, we can ask a few brothers to pray with us for our strengthening and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we should not allow them to remove the idols for us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to terminate the idols ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should realize that it is possible for there to be a union between men and demons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who worship idols often develop an emotional attachment to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After they are saved, they are reluctant to abandon the idol.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They may even hide it in a certain spot so that they may bring it out and admire it at a later time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the real experience of some saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, in order for a believer to close the door, he must thoroughly deal with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God absolutely detests idols!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is a jealous God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will not allow men to worship gods other than Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All believers must abandon every idolatrous and superstitious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The brothers and sisters know what items pertain to idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These include physical idols, shrines, candlesticks, and books on Buddhism.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Anything that pertains to idolatry must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some Chinese practice reading facial features, some practice fortune telling, others use horoscopes, and still others practice divination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These practices are related to idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, they must be thoroughly terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There should no longer be any idols or items pertaining to superstition in a believer s home, especially after he is baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everything pertaining to idols must be abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more we abandon and terminate these things from our past, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The presence of idols in the home of a new believer can cause a family member who is sick not to recover.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The presence of idols may cause another new believer to be confused and in darkness concerning spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet another new believer can be lacking in any manifestation of the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, once they remove the idols from their homes, a sick family member can recover, confusion and darkness can be dissipated, and the manifestation of the gift of the Holy Spirit can occur.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God detests idols.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we must abandon and terminate idols at all costs.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must even abandon things that do not apparently seem to be idols.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Portraits or statues of false gods must be abandoned, including portraits and images of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every portrait of Jesus is false.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Bible says that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, he had no attracting form or beautiful appearance Isa 53:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, every portrait of Jesus presents Him as being beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This shows that they are false even though they were painted by the best artists.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is pitiful that Christians, not just Catholics, have such portraits in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many Christian books also contain such superstitious portraits.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In God s eyes such portraits are blasphemous and should be discarded.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The reason we should not have any pictures of Jesus is not simply because such pictures are fake.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should not keep even an original picture of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God does not allow images Exo 20:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Every image is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We can use only our spirit to worship the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our physical body should not be the focus of our worship of a visible image.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This, however, is the principle of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Catholic Church teaches that we should physically worship a visible image rather than use our spirit to worship the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is a heretical teaching of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Statues of Mary in the Catholic Church are a great idol.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They must be dealt with and abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should abandon any idols that are associated with an image of Jesus or Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I have met brothers and sisters who abandoned all portraits and statues but still kept a portrait of Jesus in their room.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Every portrait and image is forbidden by God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should worship God only in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should not have any physical portraits or images.</S>
