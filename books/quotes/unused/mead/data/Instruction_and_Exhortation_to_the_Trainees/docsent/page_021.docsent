   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STRIVING TOGETHER WITH THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH ONE SOUL IN THE FAITH OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Last, you must strive together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To strive means to fight or struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must strive together with the saints with your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To strive together in your spirit is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is easy for you to be one with others in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, for you to be one with others in your soul, with a mind full of opinions, is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must strive together with your souls in the faith of the gospel Phil 1:27b .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You must not strive together in other things such as in the interpretation of the Bible, but in the faith of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as you are one with others in the faith, that is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only is it difficult to strive together to be in one accord in your soul concerning the interpretation of the Bible, but it is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You need to strive with others with one soul in the faith of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You should endeavor to practice all of these twelve points.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you go to visit a place or stay there, the church situation will not be the same as the training.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You do not need to preach, talk, advertise, or say anything about the training.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You just need to meet with the church and be one with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You should be submissive to the leading ones, love all the saints, and learn to cooperate and coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should live a life that no one can criticize, a life of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may talk to some brothers or sisters there and ask them whether or not their relatives are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You can then ask someone to arrange a time for you to go and see their cousin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way you will go and bring this one to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After two weeks you may see another one saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Still later another one may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then you will have three new ones to take care of, cherish, and nourish so that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you do this, other saints will see you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some will follow you to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time you can bring the new ones together into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you go back, there is no need to promote the training but just to live a life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no need to tell people that you are trainees who have been trained for two terms.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should just go back.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who will be staying and working in Orange County should also learn the same lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If all of the above points could be applied to your situation, it would save you a lot of trouble.</S>
