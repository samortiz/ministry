<P>Those who committed fornication with her still have a little chance and a little opportunity for repentance, but if they lose that opportunity and will not repent, they will suffer "great tribulation." This tribulation is surely not for this life only. Romans 2 says: "Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who commits evil...In the day when God judges the secrets of men according to my gospel through Jesus Christ" (vv. 9, 16). Hence, there is tribulation waiting in the future. It is difficult to point out if these people have committed moral fornication or physical fornication. However, we know that whether it be moral fornication or physical fornication, judgment is inevitable. According to our view, these fornicators are probably saved ones. They were men in the apostolic churches. Yet they will be punished. Therefore, a Christian must be careful. Although he is saved, this does not mean that God will gloss over his unrepented sins. Every sin that has not passed through the blood of the Lord Jesus will be judged.</P><P>We can find out the activities of Jezebel from the fact that she has "children." Who are these children? They are the ones produced and begotten by her teaching, the ones who have consecrated themselves to propagate her teaching. It is a pity that there are numerous such people nowadays! We can find them not only in the Roman Catholic Church but even in the Protestant churches which are fully opposed to the Roman Catholic Church. What use is there for one to bear the name of Protestantism when he is still Romish at heart?</P><P>The Lord speaks of another punishment for the children of Jezebel. The word "kill" in the original language is the same used in Exodus 5:3 and 9:15 and Leviticus 26:25 where it is translated as "pestilence." Those who committed fornication with the Moabite women also died of pestilence (Num. 25:8-9). Hence, literally speaking, the ones mentioned here will die of pestilence. Spiritually speaking, they will suffer similar punishments from the Lord.</P><P>What is the purpose of the Lord in doing this? The purpose is that "all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works." The Lord admitted that there were other churches beside these seven churches. The Lord put judgment on one church for the purpose of helping all the other churches. When the Lord judged Ananias and Sapphira, the Scripture recorded, "And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all those who heard these things" (Acts 5:11). God executes His judgment in order to warn those who are not yet judged, with the hope that they would fear and would stop sinning.</P><P>The Lord said that He did this to show all the churches "that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts." Based on this, we can say that the sin committed by Jezebel and her accomplices must have been very hidden and unknown to ordinary men. However, the Lord is the One who searches the inward parts and the hearts. There is no hidden sin that will not manifest itself before Him. When the Lord comes to judge, He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts. Even sins as hidden as fornication will be exposed by the Lord.</P><P>There is another purpose to the Lord's judgment. It is to let all the churches know that "I will give to each one of you according to your works." The word "you" here means that the Lord is dealing with the church. The principle the Lord applied here is the same both for believers and unbelievers. Psalm 62:12, Matthew 16:27, and Romans 2:6 all show this principle. We have to know that no one in the world can receive eternal life through his own works, and no Christian who has eternal life can perish through evil works. The Lord Jesus' righteousness and God's love has delivered every saved person from perdition. However, this does not mean that saints will henceforth not be punished, nor does it mean that believers will no longer stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Although it is an established and unchangeable fact that we will never perish, the Bible also tells us that those Christians who have received eternal life "must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad" (2 Cor. 5:10). "So then each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God" (Rom. 14:12). Many workers who have labored for the Lord will be rewarded then. Those whose works will be burned will still be saved, yet they will suffer loss. However, those who have sinned and have not repented of or confessed their sins, though they will not perish, will reap in the millennium what they have sown (Gal. 5:19-21; 6:7-8; Rev. 20:4-6).</P>
