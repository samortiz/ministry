   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. DEALING WITH THE FALL OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the past term of our full-time training, we studied the Christian life quite much.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this term we have begun to continue the study of the Christian life according to the Scripture from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that the Holy Scripture is not only a record of stories of man but also a record of the history of God in His union with man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the last message, we saw that God in His history in time restored the judged universe and created man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Right after God's creation of man, man became fallen, so God had to come in to save man from his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we want to see God's history in time in His dealing with man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In God's carrying out of His eternal economy, God's adversary Satan caused two great frustrations: one was Satan's rebellion, which polluted and devastated the creation of God, and the other was his seducing of man to transgress against God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, God had to deal with these two frustrations caused by His adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen in message two that God dealt with Satan by judging him and declaring God's verdict on him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now in this message we want to see how God dealt with the problem of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the record of the Scriptures, before God dealt with the fall of man, He was fully aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A. Its Initiation</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fall of man was initiated by Satan through the deceiving of the serpent Gen 3:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The subtle serpent was the embodiment of Satan the devil Rev 12:9a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the enemy of God Matt 13:39a and the tempter of man Matt 4:3 , Satan deceived man not directly but through man's wife 1 Tim 2:14 by causing her to doubt the sure word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way he lured the woman into his snare, and through her he caused man to fall in man's transgression against God's clear word Job 31:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. Its Nature</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because the fall of man was consummated by man's eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 3:6 , the nature of man's fall was not a matter of a transgression that only affected man's outward condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was both a matter of an offense that caused man to be condemned by God to remain under the condemnation of God Rom 5:18a and a matter of disobedience that caused man to be constituted a sinner in the eyes of God Rom 5:19a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man's eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil indicates that man had forsaken God as the tree of life in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This resulted in a case of offending God outwardly and of damaging man inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By eating the evil fruit of the tree of knowledge, Adam built a case of transgression, of disobedience, which caused him to be condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By this eating, Adam also accomplished a wrong action which poisoned him in his nature, causing him to be constituted a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, through this one fall, Satan caused Adam to be condemned according to the commandment of God and constituted a sinner in the nature of man.</S>
