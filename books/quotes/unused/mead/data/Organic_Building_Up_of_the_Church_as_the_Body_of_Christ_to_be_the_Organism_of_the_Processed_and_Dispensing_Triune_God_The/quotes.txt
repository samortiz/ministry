[1]  The Organic Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ to be the Organism of the Processed and Dispensing Triune God CONTENTS
[2]  FOR ITS ORGANIC EXISTENCE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:2; 5:1; John 3:3, 5-6; 1:12-13; 3:29-30; Gen 2:21-23; John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11-12; John 15:1, 5, 16, 8; Eph 1:22-23; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 10:32; 12:28; Eph 3:19b; Rev 1:4a, 11 OUTLINE The intrinsic essence of the church: The divine life, which generates the church 1 John 1:2; 5:1: By the regeneration of the Spirit in the believers spirit John 3:3, 5-6.
[3]  Making them the children of God as the bride of Christ, who is the Bridegroom, for His increase, as typified by Eve as the counterpart to Adam John 1:12-13; 3:29-30; Gen 2:21-23.
[4]  Through the release of the divine life by Christ as the one grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying there for His multiplication John 12:24.
[5]  Through the impartation of the divine life by Christ as the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection, that God may have many sons as the many brothers of Christ 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11-12.
[6]  The many brothers of Christ being His many branches grafted into Him, the true vine in the universe, to bear much fruit for His enlargement in His spreading, that they might express the Triune God as His organism John 15:1, 5, 16, 8.
[7]  The organic existence of the church: Existing in the universe as the one universal church of God for His universal expression, the fullness of God 1 Cor 10:32; 12:28; Eph 3:19b.
[8]  The first four intrinsic things of the church are: the intrinsic essence of the church for its organic existence; the intrinsic growth of the church for its organic increase; the intrinsic building up of the church for its organic function; and the intrinsic fellowship of the churches for their organic relationship.
[9]  When we speak of the essence of anything, we are referring to its most intrinsic part.
[10]  Regarding the church, the most important positive factor is its intrinsic essence.
[11]  The divine life, God s life, the eternal life, the uncreated life, the indestructible life, is the very essence of the church, and this divine life generates the church 1 John 1:2; 5:1 .
[12]  The church is not only composed of children born of God, but the church is also the bride, the counterpart of Christ, a part of Christ as Christ s increase.
[13]  The divine life imparted into us in Christ s resurrection is the intrinsic essence of the church, the organic Body of Christ.
[14]  As the branches of the true vine, we are the multiplication of Christ, the duplication of Christ, the spreading of Christ, and the enlargement of Christ.
[15]  This organism of the Triune God is the organic Body of Christ constituted with His many brothers as the many members of His organic Body Eph 1:22-23; Rom 12:5 .
[16]  FOR ITS ORGANIC INCREASE Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2; Heb 5:12-14; 1 Cor 3:6b; Col 2:19; 1:28; Eph 4:13b; John 3:29-30a; 15:1, 5, 8; Eph 4:16 OUTLINE The intrinsic growth of the church: Through the feeding on the guileless milk and the solid food of the word by the members of Christ 1 Pet 2:2; Heb 5:12-14.
[17]  The growth of the organic Body of Christ, with the divine life as the growing element, for the organic building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:16.
[18]  First Peter 1:3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.
[19]  The essence of the church is the divine life which is the processed and dispensing Triune God.
[20]  We all have been regenerated with this divine life.
[21]  The church is now growing in this life, by this life, with this life, and through this life.
[22]  The church grows through eating, and also through the watering on the Body of Christ by its gifted members 1 Cor 3:6 .
[23]  We believers are living plants who have been planted into Christ 1 Cor 3:6a, 9b .
[24]  The intrinsic growth of the church is by God s growing in the believers Col 2:19 .
[25]  We were reborn by the divine life, which is God Himself.
[26]  Now we are being fed and watered, and God is causing us to grow.
[27]  The fullness of Christ is the organic Body of Christ Eph 1:23 ; thus, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is the measure of the stature of the Body of Christ.
[28]  The fullness of Christ is His Body, and the Body of Christ is His counterpart, His bride.
[29]  The Increase of God in the Growth of Life
[30]  Christ is increasing, and God is increasing in the growth of life within the members of the organic Body of Christ.
[31]  Colossians 2:19 says, Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, by means of the joints and bands being supplied and knit together, grows with the growth of God.
[32]  As the Body of Christ, the church should not be deprived of Christ, who is the embodiment of God Col 2:9 as the source of life.
[33]  The organic increase of the church is the multiplication of Christ in the fruit-bearing by the branches of Christ, the true vine in the universe, as the organism of the Triune God John 15:1, 5, 8 .
[34]  CHAPTER THREE THE INTRINSIC BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH
[35]  FOR ITS ORGANIC FUNCTION Scripture Reading: Eph 4:8-16; 1 Cor 12:28; Acts 13:1; Rom 12:4-8; 1 Cor 12:4-11; 14:4b, 12; Eph 1:23b OUTLINE The intrinsic building up of the church: By the ascended Head giving the gifts Eph 4:8-11.
[36]  By the Head-given gifts the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers perfecting the saints Eph 4:11-12: In the local churches 1 Cor 12:28; Acts 13:1.
[37]  Unto the work of the ministry the building up of the organic Body of Christ Eph 4:12.
[38]  Until all the members of Christ arrive at: The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.
[39]  The more we eat Christ, the more we grow in Christ, and the more we eat Christ, the more we become Christ.
[40]  The intrinsic building up of the church is by the Head-given gifts the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers perfecting the saints Eph 4:11-12 .
[41]  This perfecting should go on and on until all the members of Christ arrive at three things: at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:13 .
[42]  Ephesians 4 reveals that the Head, Christ, builds up the church by making the saints gifts, and by giving these gifts to the church for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[43]  THE ORGANIC FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH In the Organic Body of Christ
[44]  In the organic Body of Christ, there are organic functions Rom 12:4-8 .
[45]  Do all of us function organically in the church life?
[46]  The organic function of the church is in the local expressions of the organic Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:28 and by the move of the Triune God in the operations of God, through the ministries of the Lord, and with the gifts of the Spirit in His manifestations to the members of the organic Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:4-11 .
[47]  FOR THEIR ORGANIC RELATIONSHIP Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-4; Acts 2:42; 2 Cor 13:14; Phil 2:1; Jude 3; 1 Tim 3:9; 2 Tim 4:7; Eph 4:14; Gal 5:20; 1 Cor 12:28 OUTLINE The intrinsic fellowship of the churches: The flow of the divine life among and through all the members of the organic Body of Christ 1 John 1:1-4.
[48]  The unique fellowship of the apostles, which is uniquely and universally of all the members of the organic Body of Christ Acts 2:42.
[49]  The fellowship based on the unique belief the faith of all the members of the organic Body of Christ according to the teaching of the apostles the unique teaching of the New Testament Jude 3; 1 Tim 3:9; 2 Tim 4:7; Acts 2:42.
[50]  The organic relationship of the churches: The unique relationship of the unique church the universal church composed of all the local churches 1 Cor 12:28.
[51]  Practiced uniquely and universally among all the local churches as the unique, organic Body of Christ the unique church in the universe.
[52]  THE INTRINSIC FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES The Flow of the Divine Life among and through
[53]  First John 1:1-2 says, That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands handled concerning the Word of life; and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us.
[54]  John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[55]  First John 1:3 says, That which we have seen and heard we report also to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[56]  The intrinsic fellowship of the churches is the fellowship of the Spirit in the regenerated spirit of all the members of the organic Body of Christ 2 Cor 13:14; Phil 2:1 .
[57]  FOR THEIR PURPOSE Scripture Reading: Matt 13:19; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 6:3; Eph 4:14; 2 Tim 2:18; Acts 8:3; 1 Cor 1:10-11; Phil 1:15-18; 3:2 OUTLINE The intrinsic factor of the winds of teaching: The winds of teaching: The winds: The devilish blowings of the evil one Matt 13:19.
[58]  The blowing teachings: Different from the New Testament teaching concerning the economy of God for the building up of the unique and organic Body of Christ 1 Tim 1:3-4; 6:3.
[59]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that You have brought us through the past four meetings.
[60]  We need to see what the winds of teaching are.
[61]  The entire twenty-seven books of the New Testament stress one thing: God s New Testament economy, the contents of which is the Triune God passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, an all-inclusive death, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit and to produce the Body of Christ which is to be expressed in many localities as the local churches.
[62]  In this book he pointed out that because the boundary of a local church is the boundary of the city in which the church is, the ground on which a local church can be built up, based on the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, is also the city in which the church is.
[63]  With the winds of teaching there is talk about the Bible and about spiritual things, but what is the intrinsic factor of such teaching?
[64]  In 1933 a brother among us received a note from Brother Watchman Nee that said, Do the right thing in the right way with the right spirit.
[65]  Also, the purpose of the winds of teaching is to frustrate the building up of the organic Body of Christ, to tear down the building up of the organic Body of Christ, and to divide the members of the organic Body of Christ causing endless divisions sects in hatred and jealousy, instead of keeping the unique oneness of the Body of Christ in love and kindness 1 Cor 1:10-11 .
