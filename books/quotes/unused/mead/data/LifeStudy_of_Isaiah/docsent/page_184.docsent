   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ's coming in incarnation as the twig was the revival of David's deprived royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>David's royal family was deprived to such an extent that there was hardly anything left of it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But one day in God's incarnation, a child was born to David's family.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Out of Mary a twig was born.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>David's "hewn down" royal family was revived at the birth of that twig.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must realize that the revival of David's family is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to our thought, Christ has two comings, but according to God's realization, He has sent His Son once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This sending started from Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Jesus was born, that was the beginning of God's sending His Son to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This sending has not yet been fully accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This sending began at the time Jesus was born and will be completed when the Son of Man comes to the earth in an open way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew 24:27 says, "For as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That will be the completion of God's sending His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ as the twig from the stem of Jesse came into existence about two thousand years ago, but His being sent has not been fully accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The completion of His being sent by God is accomplished in three ways: by His building up of the church, by His preparing of Israel, and by His adjustment, His judging, of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The present situation in the entire Middle East is altogether for the benefit of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Israel has enjoyed the benefit of the recent war between the United States and Iraq.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This can be considered as a part of Christ's coming in His preparation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The recent war involving Iraq was also God's adjustment of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since 1987 we have seen a great adjustment on earth among the nations firstly involving Russia and its satellite countries and secondly among the countries in the Middle East.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What an adjustment this has been!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ has taken a big step in these recent years in the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is much nearer to appearing on earth in an open way, and He is still on His way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord came at His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then He went to the cross to die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The disciples thought He was going to leave them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the Lord revealed that this was not His going but His coming John 14:3, 17-20; 20:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord's going through death and resurrection was actually His coming to the disciples as the Spirit to get into them and dwell in them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He also came on the day of Pentecost as the Spirit, baptizing His Body in one Spirit Acts 2:4a, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today He is still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The entire world situation is an indication of the steps of Christ's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was a little twig in the manger at Bethlehem, but as the lightning in Matthew 24:27, He will be a great standard to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to consider what is revealed in Isaiah 11.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Isaiah 11 reveals Christ as the twig and the branch.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is full of the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah v. 2 . What a Spirit! This Spirit is the sevenfold intensified Spirit Rev 1:4 . Along with this Spirit is God's administration, God's government Isa 11:3-5 . Then there is the restoration of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually the twig becomes a banner to the peoples v. 10 , and the branch becomes a standard to the nations v. 12 . Even the Gentiles will come to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where is the center of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Where is the center of the human race?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where is the center of world history?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Look at the banner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ as the banner is the center, to whom the nations must go.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the revelation in Isaiah 11.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ as the twig and the branch has already come.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, Christ as the twig and the branch is in the heavens, and on the other hand, He is within the believers and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is He doing?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is still on His way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is still "stepping" toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is in us, but He is still stepping toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the marvelous truth of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In His incarnation He was a twig.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In His resurrection He is a branch in full.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the beginning this branch was the Shoot of Jehovah as revealed in Isaiah 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His being the Shoot of Jehovah indicates His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His being a twig from the stem of Jesse and a branch from the roots of Jesse indicates His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Actually, He is one branch, a branch that is both divine and human.</S>
