   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE SEVEN SAMUEL A MAN ACCORDING TO GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 1:11, 20; 2:35; 8:1-22; 9:15-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I would like to give a further word on Samuel and his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD'S REPRESENTATIVE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the end of his ministry, by the time that Saul was raised up to be the king in Israel 9:3 10:27 , Samuel had reached the highest position.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may say that in the whole universe, there was only one who was above him, and that one was God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may even say that, as God's representative, Samuel was the acting God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God intended to move, to act, yet He needed a representative.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Samuel thus became a prophet, a priest, and a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was God's oracle and God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As such, he was the acting God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>GOD'S INTENTION TO HAVE A KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although Samuel was God's representative, God did not have any intention to make him a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, according to the Bible, God determined to raise up a man named David, through whom He intended to build up a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God chose Abraham, it was not His intention to gain a single person or even a group of people who would seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's intention has been to have a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The consummation of the revelation in the Bible is a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 11:15 says, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem, there will be the eternal kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Matthew 16 there is a word concerning both the kingdom and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Peter received the revelation of Christ as the Son of the living God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>16-17 , Jesus said to him, "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church" v. 18 , and then He went on to speak of the kingdom of the heavens v. 19 . In these verses the phrase "the kingdom of the heavens" is used interchangeably with the word "church." This shows that God does not want just a church but a kingdom-church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Romans 14:17 Paul also indicated that the practical church life is the kingdom: "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though Samuel eventually attained the highest position, God still had not reached His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a man who was according to God's heart, Samuel knew that within God's heart there was a desire for a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God wanted the kingdom to be brought in not through Samuel but through David.</S>
