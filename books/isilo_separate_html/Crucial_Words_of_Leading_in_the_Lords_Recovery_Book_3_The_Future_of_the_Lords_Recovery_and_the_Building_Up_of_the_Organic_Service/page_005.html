<p>If these messages cannot be put into practice, they should not be spoken. We frequently waste time and lead the saints the wrong way. We should never repeat the same mistakes. We must abandon our old ways and research in order to conduct our business to make a profit for the Lord. There may be reasons to continue some of the practices from the past, but why should we continue the things that do not work? Should we continue digging a well in the same spot where we have not found water? Can we not find another place to dig a well? Should we continue farming on a piece of land that does not grow anything? Should we waste seed on such land? Rather, we should either find another piece of land or till the soil, but we cannot continue in our old ways.</p>
<p>We must all wake up, evaluate our work, and change our direction. We cannot continue as we have in the past. We need a new start with more Christ, more life, more zeal for preaching the gospel, more people, and more open homes. Receive my exhortation in love and change your old ways. Why do you continue in your old ways that have no result? We must not be foolish. We must seek the Lord in order to improve our way of doing things.</p>
<p>There are benefits to meeting in districts. Even the weak saints will rise up if they form a new district meeting. Initially the district meetings might not be uplifted or high. The children in a family cannot be compared to their older brothers and sisters or to their parents. They must be taught and perfected. We must start where the saints currently are in order to bring them to the level of completion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING COMPREHENSIVELY IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Our work must be comprehensive. Brother Austin-Sparks suffered a loss in his ministry because he focused only on being spiritual. As a result, he had no second generation. Even though we should take this as a warning, we must not focus merely on numbers. We must also have the truth, the divine life, and a proper, transcendent, and living church life. This is our comprehensive leading. During our first seven years in Taiwan, the work was correct because it was comprehensive. Later we were influenced to emphasize the pursuit of spirituality. Although it is not wrong to pursue spirituality, we lost some of the blessing that we had in the beginning because we overemphasized spirituality. Rather than overemphasizing any item, we should be comprehensive. We care for the truth, life, the church life, preaching the gospel, and meeting in districts and small groups to gain people and preserve them.</p>
<p>We must be able to keep the people we gain. This can be compared to building a house&mdash;a person must first obtain the necessary material before he can build. No one expects to build a house with a pile of twenty bricks. That would be impossible. He must have a sufficient number of bricks in order to build a house. Therefore, we must have people to whom we teach the truth and whom we perfect in life.</p>
<p>We have listened to many messages. However, our present need is to analyze what has been our practice for the past thirty-five years to learn what brought us profit and what caused us to suffer loss. We must pick up what is beneficial and drop what caused us to suffer loss. We must have a comprehensive leading, and we must have meetings in districts and in groups. At the same time, we cannot have district and group meetings without paying attention to the truth, life, and the church life. We are the Lord&rsquo;s recovery because we have seen the divine revelation of the Body of Christ and the golden lampstands in every locality.</p>
<p>We have the full assurance that the district and group meetings can preserve the saints. As long as we meet in districts and in groups, we will be able to keep the new believers in the church life, they will become the second generation of the church, and we can educate and perfect them. The ones who receive a good education and are well nourished will be remaining fruit in the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
