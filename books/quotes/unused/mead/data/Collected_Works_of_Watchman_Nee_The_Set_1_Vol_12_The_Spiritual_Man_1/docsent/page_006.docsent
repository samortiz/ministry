   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A TABLE OF IMPORTANT WORDS CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT, THE SOUL, AND THE BODY</S>

   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What we have covered is but an outline of these subjects; there are still many areas which we have not covered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because there are many important Greek words which are not translated uniformly into the same Chinese words in the Chinese Union Version, which of course is often impossible to do, it becomes impossible for those who desire to search more finely into the question but who are ignorant of the original language to grasp the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the sake of accommodating these brothers, we have listed a table here to point out the different Chinese translations in our Union Version Bible of the same word in the original language, so that for each Chinese word the readers can see the corresponding word in the original language.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All other times it refers to the highest part of man, the spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The list on the heart is omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>NOUS</S>
