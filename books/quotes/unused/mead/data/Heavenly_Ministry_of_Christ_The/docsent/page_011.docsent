   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE OUR CORRESPONDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO CHRIST S HEAVENLY MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>UNDER HIS HEADSHIP Scripture Reading: Acts 8:26-39; 9:10-11; 10:1-3, 9-22; Col 2:18-19; Eph 4:14-16</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ever since His ascension the Lord has been ministering in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this ministry to be worked out on the earth, however, requires a correspondence to it on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nearly twenty centuries have gone by, but not much has been fulfilled on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, as this age draws to a close, there is an urgent need for us to correspond to the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A TWOFOLD CORRESPONDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The verses above illustrate this correspondence on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The references in Acts all relate to a move in life for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During the time of the Acts, the disciples were moving on with the Lord in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was so in the case of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch; Ananias and Saul; and Peter and Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All three were moves in life that corresponded to the Lord s ministry in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The references in the Epistles, in contrast, illustrate the growth and function in life, rather than a move in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is revealed in Ephesians and Colossians is not a move for the gospel, but the growth and function of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The one is to bring people to the Lord; the other, to build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For people to be brought to the Lord requires a move in life; for the Body to be built up, the growth and function in life is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The move in life to bring people to the Lord is outward, but the growth in life for the building of the Body is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For both the outward and the inward aspects, we need to correspond to the Lord s ministry in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CORRESPONDING TO THE MOVE IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Acts 8, 9, and 10 the Lord moved His disciples outwardly for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was ministering in the heavens to move some of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose Philip at that time had been away loving the world, Ananias had fallen into sin, and Peter had gone back to Galilee to go fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ would then have been ministering in the heavens, but there would have been no response on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise the Lord, these three were ready to respond!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Philip</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In response to the Lord s heavenly ministry, Philip left Jerusalem for Gaza Acts 8:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While he was walking along in the desert, he was responding to the heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord had one disciple there in the desert that He could move.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When He said to Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot v. 29 , Philip ran there and heard the eunuch reading Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you see how Philip was corresponding to the heavenly ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was through this that the Ethiopian eunuch was brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the corresponding on Philip s side to the move in life for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ananias</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The situation in Acts 9 was similar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ananias must have been praying, when a vision came to him from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord spoke to him via heavenly television and directed him to Saul!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Saul was also praying, when the heavenly television transmission came to him, and he saw Ananias coming!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There was a marvelous triangle of Christ ministering in the heavens, with Ananias and Saul corresponding to it on earth, all aimed at bringing Saul to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Acts 10 a Roman centurion named Cornelius was praying, when an angel came and told him to send for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose Peter had been unavailable when the messengers came to him from Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If Peter had gone fishing, the messengers would have had to return empty-handed and disappointed!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As it was, Peter, just before the men arrived, was also praying when the heavenly television transmission came to him!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A vessel like a sheet descended from heaven, full of unclean animals.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter was told, Rise, kill and eat!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His reply was, Not so, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This wonderful television program was repeated three times!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While Peter was puzzling over what it meant, the messengers appeared at the gate, asking for him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He went with them, and Cornelius, his family, and probably the soldiers as well, were all brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the proper gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is a move in life under the heavenly ministry of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not a movement organized by a mission board.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ as the Head exercised His headship to move His disciples here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They were on the alert, responding to His ministry from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope the preaching of the gospel in the recovery will be like this: a prevailing move in life, corresponding to the Lord s heavenly ministry under His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let me give you an illustration from my experience regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In July 1932 I had just come back home from my work at the office when a brother came.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Actually, he was looking for someone else, but that other brother was away.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since it was still early in the evening, I suggested that the two of us go to the beach.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>While we were on the way, he raised up some spiritual questions.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I said it would be good to sit on the beach and talk over these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This we did, conversing from about seven to eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We talked about baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our denomination practiced sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As soon as we finished our conversation, he said to me, You are the right person to baptize me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am the right person to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You must baptize me tonight!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I was just a young man, about twenty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I was not a pastor, nor an elder, nor even a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I shrank back.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No, no, no!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I said.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I am too young.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I am not a pastor, or elder, or deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He rebuked me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You just preach, but you won t practice.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You have been telling me who is the right person to baptize, where is the right place, and what is the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I have been considering: here is the right place the sea is in front of us, full of water , this is the right time a summer evening , I am the right person to be baptized, and you are the right person to do the baptizing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How can you refuse?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I was subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Even though we had not brought any change of clothing, we went into the water, and I baptized him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>After that, we were both in the third heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Two days later, on a Thursday, I was in the office and needed to record his name.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I could not remember how it was spelled.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Since one of my colleagues knew him quite well, I asked him how the name was spelled.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He was curious that I should need to know the spelling, and asked me what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You want to know what happened?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I replied.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The night before last I baptized him in the sea!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He was astonished, but I was astonished also when he said, You baptized him!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Well, I would like you to baptize me too tonight!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Because there was another colleague who had also been brought to the Lord, I replied, Let me talk to So-and-so first.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When I talked to him, he was happy to join us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>After office hours, the three of us went to the beach, along with the brother whom I had baptized earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This one I asked to do the baptizing, but he refused.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It bothered me: why was I baptizing people, as though I were a pastor?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Nonetheless, I baptized the two new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Afterwards, we were rejoicing to the uttermost!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We wandered along the streets, talking about the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We made so much noise that a man behind us pursued after us and then asked, Are you Witness Lee?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Yes, I replied.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He told us he had just come from a prayer meeting of a mission church, where they were complaining that I had baptized one of their candidates; they said I was neither an elder nor a deacon; how then could I baptize people?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Then he added, When I heard them talking, I decided I would like to get in touch with you.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I never dreamed I would find you like this.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When will you have the next meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>By the Lord s Day, there were eleven of us.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>After one week, we began to have the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The Lord exercised His headship to bring people in. Though our number was small, we were corresponding to the heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Since those days, much has been accomplished, not by organization, but by His ministering in the heavens and some of His disciples corresponding on earth.</S>
