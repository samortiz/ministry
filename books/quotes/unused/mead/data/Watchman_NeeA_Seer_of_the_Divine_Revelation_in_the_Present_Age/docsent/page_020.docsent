   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At that time Brother Nee wrote the following hymn:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How vast, immense, and measureless</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The love of Christ to me!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How else could such a wretch as I</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Be blessed so graciously?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To bring me back unto Himself,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My Lord His all did spend;</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So I would gladly bear the cross</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And follow to the end.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My all I have forsaken now,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This blessed Christ to gain;</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now life or death is no concern</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What else can me restrain?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My dear ones, wealth, ambition, fame</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What can they offer me?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My gracious Lord for me was poor;</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For Him I poor would be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My precious Savior now I love,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Him only would I please.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For Him all gain a loss becomes,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And comfort holds no ease.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thou art my comfort, gracious Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I've none in heav'n but Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And who but Thee is there on earth</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With whom I love to be?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Though loneliness and trials come,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My griefs I'd rise above.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This only would I ask Thee, Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Surround me with Thy love!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>O gracious Lord, I now beseech,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Guide me through every stage;</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Stand by and strengthen me to go</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through this dark, evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The world, the flesh, and Satan too,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do tempt my soul apace;</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without Thy love and strength'ning power</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I may Thy name disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The time, dear Lord, is running short;</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From earth my soul set free.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Thou dost come, I'll sing with joy,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah to Thee!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the following week, people began to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Weigh, who was my classmate, can testify to the fact that up to this time I had been very particular about my dress.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I used to wear a long silk gown with red dots.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But on that day, I removed my refined clothing and shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I went to the kitchen, made some paste, and with a bundle of gospel posters in my arms, went to the street to post them on the walls and to distribute gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In those days in Foochow, Fukien, this was a pioneer act.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From my second school term in 1922, I began the gospel work, and many of my schoolmates were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I prayed daily for those whose names were in my notebook.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From 1923, we began to borrow or rent places for meetings to expand the work of evangelization.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Several hundred people were saved at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All but one of those whose names were in my notebook were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is evident proof that God listens to such prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is His way that we must first pray for sinners before they can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In those few years there were many instances to confirm this fact.</S>
