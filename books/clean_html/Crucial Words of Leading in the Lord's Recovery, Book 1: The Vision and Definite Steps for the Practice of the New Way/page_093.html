<h2 class="head1">HOW TO PRACTICALLY IMPLEMENT<br />
SUCH A PLAN</h2>
<p>At present we have more than two hundred sixty young people in our full-time training. We anticipate that another two hundred or more will be added to the next term of training. Based on this number, we will need five hundred more next year. In order to reach our goal, all the elders and responsible brothers in all the churches need to pick up the burden in one accord. We need to encourage the young people in our respective localities to attend the full-time training. At the same time, the campus work should aim toward this goal. Based on the above considerations, we can probably get by with seven hundred, but one thousand is better.</p>
<p>I hope that we will consider this schedule and plan and bear this burden in oneness. I do not believe that I am asking too much. We all agree that it is more than right for us to gospelize Taiwan in five years. Without reservation we are declaring war on Satan. We are storming his house, breaking his forces, binding the strong man, and plundering his wealth. Although there are only eighteen thousand regular attendants in our meetings, any corporate effort will make our job easier; where there is the will of the entire Body, there is the way to win an &ldquo;entire city.&rdquo; As long as we function and offer up our part, it will not be difficult to accomplish this momentous task. What we need now is to strive and struggle to realize our plan.</p>
<p>In order to realize our plan, we need practical ways to implement it. First, in order to produce one thousand full-timers, there is the need of our prayers. We need to ask the Lord to give us no fewer than a thousand persons. We even need to dream of these one thousand persons. Next, we need to operate according to some practical principles. Eighteen months ago I said that the basic principle in producing the full-timers is to have one out of twenty saints in every local church giving himself to be a full-timer. At present, we have eighteen thousand regular attendants in our meetings. This means we should produce nine hundred full-timers. The potential of our source is not poor. By next year the attendance may reach twenty thousand. This will be more than adequate to produce a thousand full-timers. Next, when we say that out of twenty saints we should have one full-timer, we are taking into consideration the source of our financial support. The nineteen saints should set aside five percent of their income to support the living of the one full-timer among them. This will not pose too heavy a burden on anyone. I believe that as the saints are faithful to the Lord, we will meet this budget.</p>
<p>Our statistics show that we are barely obtaining the number of full-timers we need and our financial offering is still inadequate. I hope that as the elders return to their respective localities, they will fellowship the practical needs with the brothers and sisters. Although we are faithful in our regular offerings, we need to set aside five percent to support the full-timers. This will make up the lack. In the Old Testament, in addition to the regular sacrifices, God&rsquo;s people had to pay the temple tax, which was half a shekel of silver per person (Exo. 30:13-16; 38:26). Among the twelve tribes, the tribe of Levi served the Lord full time. The other eleven tribes took a tenth of their income to take care of the need of the Levites. I hope that all the saints will be faithful to the Lord to make up the portion that they ought to cover so that the Lord&rsquo;s work can go on in a smooth way.</p>
<p>For every saint to offer five percent of their income to support the full-timers does not mean that they should divert their regular offerings to this matter. Rather, they should offer this additional five percent over and above their regular offerings. This is only half of a tenth. It is strictly for the support of the full-timers. Only when we have such a budget can we move according to schedule. Even if we do not have a thousand full-timers by 1988, hopefully we will have seven hundred; however, if our financial support covers only five hundred, our move to gospelize Taiwan will be hampered.</p>
<p>We have received a new leading from the Lord to turn the church from the degraded situation of Christianity to the practice of the God-ordained way. We have also received a new commission to gospelize Taiwan in five years. For this, we need a schedule and a budget. We are clear about the schedule and the budget. What we need to do is to mobilize the entire congregation to obtain the people and the financial support so that we can carry out our plan as scheduled. May the Lord be gracious to all the saints in all the places, and may we set our eyes on this in steadfastness and one accord.</p>
<p>Although the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are a &ldquo;little flock&rdquo; (Luke 12:32), we thank the Lord that He has committed to us a great commission of gospelizing Taiwan in five years. This is an unprecedented task and a glorious enterprise. I hope that we will all see the bright future and share in this great enterprise. I believe the Lord will multiply His blessing on all those who spend themselves for the Lord and His gospel, and He will bless this country. The effect of this is far-reaching. May we all have the wisdom to receive this fellowship.</p>
