<h1 class="title">THE WORD BECOMING FLESH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14; Exo. 25:8; 40:17, 34; Psa. 78:60; Rev. 21:2-3; 2 Cor. 4:7; 1 Tim. 3:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING FLESH<br />
BEING GOD BECOMING MAN</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;The Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; <em>Word</em> refers to God, whereas <em>flesh</em> refers to man; hence, the Word becoming flesh means that God became a man. God became man so that God and man could be mingled together as one. Before the Word became flesh, that is, before God became man, God was God and man was man. God was in the heavens, and man was on the earth. There was no union or mingling of God and man. They were separate from one another. In the Old Testament no matter how much God contacted man or how much man drew near to God, God was God and man was man; God was not in man and neither was man in God. Then one day a wonderful, mysterious thing happened in the little town of Bethlehem&mdash;God became a man. At this point, God and man were no longer separate from each other; rather, God and man were joined and mingled as one.</p>
<p>God becoming man is a mysterious matter. The world does not understand this matter, and even very few Christians understand it. The world celebrates Christmas, but it is often nothing more than an opportunity for music and dancing to indulge the flesh. However, even pure-hearted, God-venerating Christians do not understand the significance of Bethlehem. Although they know that a Savior was born in Bethlehem, they do not see the mystery of this birth. When our Savior was born, God came to be among men by becoming a man in the flesh. The mysterious, unsearchable, unfathomable, unapproachable God entered into humanity, not only to be joined with man, but to become a genuine man. This is the significance of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; being born in Bethlehem. From that point forward, God has been joined and mingled with man; God and man are one, and now humanity as well as divinity can be found in God.</p>
<p>Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6 contain prophecies concerning the Word becoming flesh. These two verses are so mysterious that even Isaiah himself may not have understood them. Verse 14 of chapter 7 says, &ldquo;The virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; A virgin of flesh and blood bore a son, whom men would call Emmanuel, which is translated &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (Matt. 1:23). Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / ...And His name will be called / ...Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; The Son who was born to us and given to us is the Eternal Father, the source. The Son who was born in time is the Father outside of time. Although He was a child in a manger, He is the Mighty God.</p>
<p>Seven hundred years before Christ was born, Isaiah was moved by the Holy Spirit to prophesy concerning this mystery. At the appointed time, David&rsquo;s descendant, Mary, a virgin of flesh and blood, gave birth to a child who was the Mighty God. This child was not only the Son who was given, but also the Eternal Father, the source. Human language cannot fully express this mystery. I hope that in our spirit we would understand the mystery of Christ&rsquo;s birth in Bethlehem. A great event, greater than the creation of all things, took place that day: the creating God entered into the created man; the Creator and the created were joined as one.</p>
<p>The greatest matter in the universe is not creation or redemption but incarnation, that is, the entering of God into man to be one with man. The creation of all things is not as significant as the incarnation; even the accomplishment of redemption is not as significant. Incarnation is the center, the watershed event in the universe. Prior to the incarnation, God was not joined to or mingled with man. After the incarnation, God was joined to and mingled with man as one. Nothing is greater than this in the universe.</p>
<p>Many people treasure the Lord being crucified for them and shedding His blood for the redemption of their sins, but they have little regard for His incarnation. It is easy for people to be moved to tears when they hear about the Lord Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross. However, they often have no depth of feeling related to the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation. It is not easy for us to worship the Lord by giving thanks and praises to Him for His incarnation. May God give us a vision so that we see that God becoming man is the most glorious and mysterious matter in the universe. The distinguishing feature of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; birth is that the Creator entered into His creature, a created man. God became a man; the Word became flesh.</p>
<p>We should not think that God became anything other than a genuine man. He was not some sort of superior man; He was a man in the flesh. Although there was no corruption of sin in Him, He suffered from the temptation of sin and the affliction of the world (Heb. 2:18; 4:15). God became a man, but the man He became was not the perfect, beautiful man that God first created but a man afflicted by Satan, sin, and the world. Though sinless in His nature, His outward form was not attractive. Isaiah 52:14 says, &ldquo;His visage was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men.&rdquo; Verse 2 of chapter 53 says, &ldquo;He grew up... /...like a root out of dry ground. / He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.&rdquo; The man that God became was not outwardly presentable, but rather a man with no attracting form nor majesty.</p>
<p>In the universe a great thing was realized when the Lord was born in Bethlehem. God entered into man, becoming a man and being joined to and mingled with man. From that day forward, there has been One who is both God and man and man and God. This is a mysterious matter.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
