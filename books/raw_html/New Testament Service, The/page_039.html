 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">JESUS ONLY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:13-17; 17:1-8, 24-27</h1>
<p>When we read these passages in Matthew 16 and 17, we see that they are altogether for Christ and about Christ. To serve in the New Testament dispensation, we need to be very clear about Christ. The New Testament service is a matter altogether of Christ, for Christ, with Christ, and in Christ. It is altogether a matter of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHO IS CHRIST?</h2>
<p>In the first chapter of Matthew we have seen the conceiving of Christ, and in the second chapter, the finding of Christ. Matthew chapters three and four have shown us the testifying for Christ and the following of Christ. When we come to chapter sixteen, however, a real problem is raised&mdash;that is, who is Christ? There is the conceiving of Christ, the finding of Christ, the testifying of Christ, and the following of Christ, but who is Christ? Peter, James, and John, with the others, were all followers of Christ, but there was nevertheless the problem of who Christ is. Yes, we follow Christ, but do we know who Christ is?</p>
<p>In Matthew 16, the Lord raises this problem, but notice that it was not raised in the temple. It was not even in Jerusalem or in the land of Judea. Rather, it was on the border of the Gentile world, in the parts of Caesarea Philippi. Jesus left not only the temple and Jerusalem, but also the holy land. He was in the vicinity of the Gentile world when He asked, &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo; (Matt. 16:13). The Lord did not ask such a question in the religious realm. When we are in the religious district, the religious sphere, it is doubtful that we will ask questions about Christ.</p>
<p>However, once we move outside of the religious world and the religious circle, immediately the question comes, &ldquo;What about Christ?&rdquo; Why did the Lord Jesus not ask this question when He was in the temple? There was a reason. Why did He not ask it when He was in Jerusalem? Why did He wait until He crossed the border of the holy land and was in the vicinity of the Gentile world? It is quite meaningful. The reason is that the New Testament service is outside of the religious region, the religious circle, the religious sphere.</p>
<p>In the Bible there are no wasted words. If there were no significance in this matter, there would be no need for Matthew to say that Jesus and His disciples came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi. The mention of this matter indicates that to know Christ, we need to leave religion. We need to leave the temple, the holy city, and even the holy land. It is only when we come into the parts of Caesarea Philippi that we are in the right position to know Christ.</p>
<p>When Jesus asked this question, the disciples answered that some said that He was John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. He said to them, &ldquo;But you, who do you say that I am?&rdquo; And Simon Peter answered and said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 16:14-17). Peter took the lead in answering the question by saying that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God. This is really good. Then the Lord told him that his answer was not of flesh and blood, but it was something that had been revealed from the Father in the heavens. To have the revelation from the heavens, we need to be on the border of Caesarea Philippi. The disciples did not receive the revelation of Christ in the temple, in the holy city, or in the holy land. We need to be outside of the religious realm. The revelation of Christ was given outside of religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JESUS TRANSFIGURED</h2>
<p>Then in the following chapter, the Lord Jesus brought Peter, James, and John up to a mountain, where suddenly He was transfigured before them. This is not something of a doctrine or a teaching; this was a transfiguration. Jesus was transfigured before them. He was no longer in the lowly form of a little Nazarene, but with a face shining as the sun. And then Moses and Elijah came to talk with Him. At that time Peter acted very foolishly. &ldquo;And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight; hear Him! And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their face and feared exceedingly. And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, Arise, and do not fear. And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone&rdquo; (Matt. 17:4-8).</p>
<p>When Peter saw Moses and Elijah, he became excited; therefore he spoke nonsense. When we become overexcited, we often speak nonsense. Peter&rsquo;s proposal was to build three tabernacles; one for Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. This means that he uplifted Moses and Elijah to the same level as Jesus. No one knew where Moses was buried or to what place Elijah was taken. Now both of them suddenly appeared. Therefore Peter thought that surely they all were equal. The Lord Jesus said not a word; He would not vindicate Himself. The heavens, however, reacted. While Peter was still speaking, there came a voice from heaven saying, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son; hear Him!&rdquo; In other words, the Father was telling them to forget Moses and Elijah and listen to His Son. That stopped Peter&rsquo;s nonsense. Then the Lord came and touched Peter and the other two disciples. How wonderful the Lord is! He would not vindicate Himself, but He will always touch us. Whenever we are frightened, He comes to touch us. Then Peter and the others arose and saw no man but Jesus only. How full of meaning this is!</p>
<p>Not only did Peter receive a revelation in chapter sixteen, but in chapter seventeen he also saw a transfiguration with his physical eyes. Furthermore, he heard the heavenly voice with his physical ears, a voice saying that they should hear Jesus only. Why would the voice from heaven say this? Because Moses and Elijah were not there on the mountain simply as two individuals. They were there representing the law and the prophets. Therefore the voice from heaven said, &ldquo;Hear Him,&rdquo; not Moses or Elijah. This means that we need to hear the living Christ, not merely the written law represented by Moses, nor the written prophets represented by Elijah. In other words, we need to hear the living Christ, not merely the written Scriptures.</p>
<p>We need to read Matthew 17 again and again. The voice from heaven told Peter to hear Jesus only. And we should realize that Peter had suggested putting up three tabernacles, one for Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. Therefore, Peter was making the law and the prophets equal to Jesus. This was the background. The concept of listening both to Christ and to the law and the prophets is against the concept of the heavens. Therefore, the heavenly voice said, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son; hear Him.&rdquo; It seems that the Father in the heavens was saying, &ldquo;I do not like to hear you expressing your appreciation for Moses, even though you have a good intention. And I also do not like to hear that you care for Elijah, even though that also may come from a good intention. I, the Father in the heavens, do not care for the law, neither do I care for the prophets. I care for My Son. This is My beloved Son; hear Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not merely a vision, but a visible transfiguration witnessed by Peter with his physical eyes. In addition, a voice from the heavens was heard by Peter with his physical ears. Peter was shocked, and no doubt was deeply impressed. If you were Peter, could you forget what you had seen and what you had heard? You may forget the things you dream, but I do not believe you could ever forget such an experience.</p>
