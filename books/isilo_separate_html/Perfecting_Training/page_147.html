<p>We have the divine life, God&rsquo;s life. The life mentioned in Romans 8 implies a lot. It implies residing; it implies life giving; it implies liberating. It also implies a kind of law with a spontaneous power and strength. It is really hard to define this divine life. Verse 14 indicates that the matter of leading is here just because we are sons of God living a life under such a lead. The matter of leading implies a lot. This has to be the leading that we experience. You have to follow such a leading concerning marriage, concerning school, concerning jobs, concerning where to go, where to stay, where to live, and so forth. If you are led by such a leading you are living the life of sons of God. You are not living a dog life nor a cat life nor even an ordinary human life. You are living a super-resurrected human life.</p>
<p>If you will check according to your experience you will see that all these matters are present. The residing, the life giving, the putting to death, the setting of the mind upon the spirit, and the walking according to spirit were there even today in your experience. This is why in the morning you behaved yourself in a certain way, and this is why in the evening you talked to your folks in a certain way. You were under a kind of wonderful leading that even you could not understand. Yet you were under it. Perhaps even for the whole day you spontaneously lived a life which proves and testifies to the fact that you are a son of God. Even to read a message such as this eventually brings you, if not in full, at least to some extent under this leading. Your life would be changed. You had no intention to change your life, but it just changed. It is not just a matter of changing your behavior. Rather, something comes out unconsciously and spontaneously.</p>
<p>I hope this matter of leading has been made very clear. You don&rsquo;t need to spend that much time asking Him to show you His leading. You just go to praise Him, to worship Him, to offer your best thanksgiving to Him. If you practice seeking His leading, that means you are not under the lead. If you are under the lead, you don&rsquo;t need to seek His lead any more. You are simply under His lead. When you wake up in the morning you are under the leading. You just praise Him; you just thank Him; you just have a well speaking with Him and bless Him. You just stay with Him to enjoy His blessing. You stay there to enjoy His burden in you to pray for certain things&mdash;for His Body, for His interest, for the church. You don&rsquo;t need to ask for His leading. You are just under a leading.</p>
<p>This is actually to walk according to spirit. This also is to put to death the old creation, the practical flesh, the practices of the mortal body. This spontaneously is the enjoyment of the life giving of the residing Triune God. This is just the life of the Triune God residing in us. This is what is revealed in Romans 8. You have to realize that Romans 8 is so experiential, so practical, so deep. You cannot understand Romans 8 simply in a doctrinal way. It speaks of the experience of the Triune God in an experiential way.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_146.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_148.html">Next</a> </body></html>
