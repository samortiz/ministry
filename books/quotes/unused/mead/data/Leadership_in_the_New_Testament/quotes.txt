[1]  Chapter one is from Truth Messages, pages 27-35; chapter two is from The God-ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy, pages 167-173; chapter three is from Elders' Training, Book 9: The Eldership and the God-ordained Way 1 , pages 39-54; and chapter four is from The Apostles' Teaching and the New Testament Leadership, pages 17-30.
[2]  In God's New Testament economy the leadership among His children is not official, permanent, or organizational.
[3]  The New Testament reveals that all the children of God are one Body.
[4]  Although there is the truth of the leadership in the New Testament ministry, the Lord did not officially appoint someone to be the leader.
[5]  He had to charge these ones not to teach things that were different from the apostles' teaching, which is concerning God's New Testament economy to dispense the processed Triune God into His chosen and redeemed people that Christ might have a Body to express Himself and that the Triune God might have a complete, eternal expression in the New Jerusalem.
[6]  Such a leadership as exercised by Paul and by John was not the leadership in organization.
[7]  Furthermore, in 1963 and 1964 there were newspaper reports about some Pentecostal prophecies that an earthquake would strike the city of Los Angeles and that the city would fall into the ocean.
[8]  The ministry among us is not the ministry of a single person, but the unique New Testament ministry, the ministry of the Lord's move on this earth in the dispensation of the church.
[9]  CHAPTER THREE GOD'S ADMINISTRATION GOD'S ADMINISTRATION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
[10]  God's administration on this earth is very much related to the church's administration.
[11]  If we are going to see God's administration on this earth, we have to see the administration of the church.
[12]  Among the priests was the high priest with his priestly garments.
[13]  GOD'S ADMINISTRATION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The Elders Appointed by the Apostles
[14]  Both Peter and John were elders in the church in Jerusalem 1 Pet 5:1; 2 John 1; 3 John 1 .
[15]  Besides the elders as the priests and as the administrators, there are the prophets and teachers as illustrated in Acts 13:1-4.
[16]  In Acts 13 in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers.
[17]  Based upon Paul's word to Timothy in this matter, how can we say that the apostles, who appointed the elders and handed over the church to them, have nothing to do with the church or the elders once they have been established?
[18]  In 1 Corinthians 4:17 Paul says, "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church."
[19]  During that time I talked about the leading of the apostles and the leadership in the Lord's ministry, but I do not feel that what I said was accurately understood by some.
[20]  Instead, we have the leadership of one controlling revelation in the one ministry through those who bring in the revelation of the ministry.
[21]  CHAPTER FOUR THE NEW TESTAMENT LEADERSHIP Scripture Reading: Acts 2:36; 5:31; Rev 1:5; Eph 1:22; Col 1:18; 1 Cor 11:3; Heb 13:24; Rom 12:8; 1 Tim 5:17; 3:2; 1 Pet 5:2-3; 1 Thes 5:12; Heb 13:17; Gal 2:7; Rom 11:13; 1 Cor 16:12; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 2 John 9-11; 2 Cor 13:10; 1 Cor 4:17b-21; 7:17b; 16:1; 11:2; 2 Thes 3:6, 9, 12, 14; 1 Cor 1:10; 5:11-13; 11:34b; 2 Cor 10:6; Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5; 1 Tim 5:19-20; Exo 28:29-30; Num 27:15-23; 1 Sam 3:1, 19-21; Acts 15:6, 23, 28; 2:42; 13:1 OUTLINE The headship of Christ: Christ having been made Lord and Christ by God Acts 2:36.
[22]  Christ having been exalted as the Leader over all the rulers Acts 5:31.
[23]  The leadership in the church life: The elders taking the lead diligently in the church life Heb 13:24; Rom 12:8.
[24]  In this chapter we will fellowship more concerning the New Testament leadership.
[25]  The Bible does say that the church is the church of God 1 Cor 1:2; 10:32 , the church of Christ Rom 16:16 , and the church of the saints 1 Cor 14:33 .
[26]  The New Testament leadership comprises the elders in the church and those who take the lead in the ministry.
[27]  It is not right to say that there is no leadership in the church.
[28]  The leadership in the church life is carried out by the elders' laboring in teaching the saints 1 Tim 5:17; 3:2 and their shepherding the church as the flock of God, overseeing it according to God, and becoming patterns of the flock, not lording it over the flock 1 Pet 5:2-3 .
[29]  The leadership in the New Testament ministry is in the New Testament teaching more than in the leading ones of the New Testament ministry.
[30]  Second John 9-10 says, "Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God...If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!"
[31]  The New Testament shows us God's delegated authority in the leading ones in the ministry.
[32]  Without delegated authorities, the whole earth would be in anarchy and disorder and would be unsuitable to live in. Today a wind of teaching is blowing in the Lord's recovery saying that there is no delegated authority in the church.
[33]  If Brother Nee was wrong, the Bible is also wrong because the Bible strongly reveals God's delegated authority in the church life and in the ministry.
[34]  The priests in the priesthood were very close to God, even one with God.
[35]  God could open Himself to them, and they could open themselves to God so that there could be a mutual understanding between them and God.
[36]  The theocratic government in the churches in the New Testament is through the Spirit who dwells in the spirits of the apostles and the elders, both of whom are the New Testament priests, with the revelation of the New Testament teaching Acts 15:6, 23, 28; 2:42; 1 Thes 5:12; 1 Tim 3:2; 5:17 .
[37]  Whenever the apostles and the elders as the New Testament priests come to the Lord and wait on Him for His administration in the church, they will surely receive some light and some word from the Lord.
[38]  I hope that all of us can now have a clear view concerning the New Testament leadership, including the headship of Christ, the leadership in the church life, the leadership in the ministry, and God's government in the administration of the churches.
