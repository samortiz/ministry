   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INTRINSIC VIEW OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would now like to intimately share what is on my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I want to fellowship concerning what the entire Bible shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible has sixty-six books with many chapters, but what does such a book show us?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I want to present a very intrinsic view of what the Bible tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In an intrinsic way, the Bible unveils to us that the eternal God, who is divine, triune, holy, self-existing, and ever- existing, had a good pleasure Eph 1:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One day according to the good pleasure of His desire, He came out of eternity and into time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That was only about two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He came into time to become a man and to live as a man on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He passed through such a human living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, for the need, He entered into a death, which I would call the all-problem-solving death, the all-inclusive death which solves all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He entered into that death, He traveled through that death, and He had a good "sightseeing" in that death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the third day, He came out of that death and entered into resurrection, the all-conquering resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this resurrection, His human part was born into divinity to produce the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the same time, in that big birth, He regenerated all His chosen, fallen, redeemed, and justified people to be the many sons of God 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So, in this resurrection the firstborn Son and the many sons of God were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Also, in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , who is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then He ascended far above all the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was an all-transcending ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this transcending ascension, He was made the Head of the Body, the church, even the Head of all things, having the first place in all things Col 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was also made both Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 and the Leader of all the kings and the Savior 5:31 to be our High Priest in the New Testament economy Heb 4:14; 7:26; 9:11 , the Mediator of a new covenant 9:15 , the surety of a better covenant 7:22 , the Minister in the heavenly Holy of Holies 8:2 , the Paraclete Advocate of the New Testament believers 1 John 2:1; John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7 , and the New Testament believers' Intercessor at the right hand of God and within them as well Rom 8:34, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the first step of the process He went through, the first God-man was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the conclusion of His process in resurrection, the firstborn Son of God was produced, the many sons of God were regenerated, and He Himself became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did all of this within thirty-three and a half years on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the embodiment of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit who became the first God-man and then the firstborn Son of God and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As such a One, He transcended to a place above all the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He transcended above four layers: Hades, the earth, the air, and the third heaven Eph 1:20-21; 4:8-10; Heb 4:14; 7:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He ascended there with all the many sons Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the day of His ascension, He began as the consummated Spirit, as the consummation of the processed consummated Triune God, to sanctify the many sons regenerated by Him Heb 2:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were regenerated, but not grown up yet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So He still works as the all-inclusive consummated Spirit to sanctify them, making them holy unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also renews them from the old creation into the new Titus 3:5 , transforms them to change their constitution from the constitution of the old creation to the constitution of the new creation to have a constitution of the redeemed and regenerated human beings with the divine element 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Following transformation, He conforms them to the image of the firstborn Son of God to make them the real God-men, the real sons of God, and the real brothers of the first God-man, the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, He will bring all of them into glory, to glorify them in the glory of the processed and consummated Triune God Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which will be the mingling of divinity with humanity to be the very expansion, enlargement, increase, and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in humanity forever.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is all that the Bible tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all need to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will become a very controlling vision, directing our life, our move, and our action on this earth so that we can be a real son of God, a real brother of Christ, and a real God-man that we may overcome as He has overcome John 16:33; Rev 3:21 to bring in the kingdom age.</S>
