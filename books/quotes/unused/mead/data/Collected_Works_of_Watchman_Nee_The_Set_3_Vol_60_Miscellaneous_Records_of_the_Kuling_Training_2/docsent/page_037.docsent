   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Believe in the Heart</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After a man confesses his sins and reads God's Word, he has to believe in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the difference between confessing and believing?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Confession is an act.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After confession there is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Believing is trusting that God has done what He said He would do in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1 John 1:9 a sinner first confesses his sins this is an act.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Faith means that a sinner believes that God has acted according to His word and has forgiven our sins through the blood of His Son and has washed away our unrighteousnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is all that is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Believing is not waiting for something to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is having a living faith toward God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A living faith happens instantaneously, while the knowledge of the assurance of salvation comes afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's Word says that he who believes has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As soon as we believe, we have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The faith that we are speaking of here is not a general faith in the work that the Lord has accomplished but a faith that turns God's Word into accomplished facts immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As soon as one believes, he has the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to make sure that the new ones take this step immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to let them know that they have received eternal life right then and there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Confess with the Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The last step is to confess with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The best way to test if a man has believed is to ask him to confess the Lord in public.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can read Romans 10:9-10 and 13 to him, which says, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation....For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many people are not sure about their salvation because they have not confessed with their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once a man confesses with his mouth, he can be sure of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is like mixing concrete; as soon as water is added, the concrete sets.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After a man believes, we have to provide him an opportunity to immediately confess with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people who are not clear about their salvation become clear once they open their mouth to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>An awakened sinner should do the above four things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A sinner only needs to believe in God's word and confess with his mouth, then his spirit will be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God will put His Spirit within the spirit of those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once a sinner takes the step of faith, God gives him a new heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The result of this believing is a new life, which a man receives from God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is saved and born again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to spend much time on these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A sloppy person will not do a good job in leading men to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to study these matters carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must not speak lightly or quote a verse lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to exercise care in every step we take.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not only aim at saving men in a general way through our preaching but should aim at a gospel that produces high quality results.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that we can all learn these lessons properly and thoroughly.</S>
