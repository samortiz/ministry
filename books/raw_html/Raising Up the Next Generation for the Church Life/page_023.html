      <div id="ministry-text">
        <h2 class="head3">The Household of Crispus</h2>
<p>Acts 18:8 says, &ldquo;Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with his whole household...and were baptized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Bible there are individuals who believed in the Lord and there are households that believed in the Lord. Notice how easy it is for God&rsquo;s grace to come to a household. The whole household of Crispus believed and was baptized.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Promise of Pentecost<br />
Being Given to You and Your Children</h2>
<p>Let us consider the condition at Pentecost. Acts 2:39 says, &ldquo;For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The promise of Pentecost includes the forgiveness of sins and the receiving of the Holy Spirit. It was given &ldquo;to you&rdquo; <em>and</em> &ldquo;to your children&rdquo;; it was not merely given &ldquo;to you.&rdquo; Those who are heads of the family in particular should lay hold of this promise and say, &ldquo;Lord, Your promise is for me and also for my children. It cannot be mine without my children also being included. I want it for myself, and I want it also for my children.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">Peace to a House</h2>
<p>Luke 10:5-6 says, &ldquo;Into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house. And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord says that when a person sets out to preach the gospel, he should say as he enters into a house, &ldquo;Peace to this <em>house.</em>&rdquo; This shows that God&rsquo;s peace comes to man by households. It is not just given to individuals, but to households. If anyone is worthy of peace in a house, peace will come to his entire household. This verse is clear enough. God deals with man by households. Thank God, peace comes to man household by household.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Household of Stephanas</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:16 says, &ldquo;I did baptize the household of Stephanas also.&rdquo; Here Paul said that he baptized every member of the household of Stephanas. Like the jailer and the house of Lydia, Stephanas&rsquo;s whole household believed and was baptized.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Household of Onesiphorus</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 4:19 says, &ldquo;Greet Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus,&rdquo; and 1:16 says, &ldquo;May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain.&rdquo; Here was a family that took care of Paul, a household that was not ashamed of his chain. Notice again that it was not an individual matter but something to do with a household.</p>
<p>These numerous cases provide ample proof in both the Old Testament and the New Testament that God deals with man by households. This is particularly true in the case of salvation; God takes the household as a unit. (<em>Messages for Building Up New Believers,</em> vol. 2, pp. 313-315)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD<br />
TO MAKE A DECLARATION</h2>
<p>I would like to speak specifically to the heads of households. In the Bible most of those who bore some responsibility were the heads of households. The head of a family has the special responsibility before God for bringing his whole household to the Lord and to His service. You need to take your stand as the head of your family to declare that your household will believe in the Lord and that you will not tolerate anyone who will not believe. The head of the household can decide for his entire household. Even if the little children do not believe, you can still say that your household will believe in the Lord, because this household is yours and not your children&rsquo;s. You are responsible for your household, not your children. You can declare Joshua 24:15 before the Lord and before your whole family: &ldquo;As for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.&rdquo; You have to acknowledge that your family is a believer&rsquo;s family. You need to declare this by faith, and you need to put your wife and children on this ground. Always lay hold of this fact: I am the head of my family, and my family will believe in God. My household will not believe in the devil. I have decided that this family will be a family that worships God. I have decided that this family will be a family that believes in the Lord. If you declare this with faith, and if you exercise your authority to take the lead, your children will go along.</p>
<p>I believe the head of every household should make the declaration of Joshua 24:15. You should gather your children and dependents together and tell them, &ldquo;As for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.&rdquo; Then as long as you are in the household, your household will serve the Lord. The household is yours, and you have the power to decide whether this house will serve the Lord. When you take this stand, everyone who is under you will come to the Lord; they will have no other way to take. This is marvelous! (<em>Messages for Building Up New Believers,</em> vol. 2, pp. 317-318)</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
