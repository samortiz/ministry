<h1 class="title">DEATH AND RESURRECTION<br />
AND THE SALVATION OF THE SOUL</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the soul and the spirit from the aspect of incarnation and from the aspect of death and resurrection. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; This means that the Lord Jesus is God coming to be a man. The Lord Jesus is God entering into man; hence, He is the mingling of divinity with humanity. When He lived on the earth, He expressed God in man. In the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation divinity entered into humanity. In His death and resurrection humanity entered into divinity. Through His incarnation God could live in man, and through His death and resurrection man could live in God. Through incarnation there was a man on earth in whom God lived. Through death and resurrection there is a man in heaven who has entered into God. Incarnation is the mingling of God with man. Death and resurrection are the mingling of man with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INCARNATION BEING THE PRINCIPLE OF SALVATION,<br />
AND DEATH AND RESURRECTION BEING<br />
THE PRINCIPLE OF OVERCOMING</h2>
<p>Incarnation is the principle of salvation. Hence, salvation is God entering into man, God being joined to man, and divinity mingling with humanity. The living of a believer after his salvation is an overcoming living in the principle of death and resurrection. Hence, overcoming is man entering into God, man being joined with God, and humanity mingling with divinity. Incarnation involves God coming to the earth; death and resurrection involve man entering into heaven. Likewise, our salvation is God coming to the earth, and our overcoming is our entering into heaven. Therefore, the principle of salvation is incarnation, and the principle of overcoming is death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEATH AND RESURRECTION<br />
NOT ANNULLING THE SOUL</h2>
<p>If we desire to live an overcoming life, we must live in the principle of death and resurrection; that is, we must live in the mingling of humanity with divinity. Such a living does not annul our humanity. On the contrary, in such a living our humanity is strengthened with divinity. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.&rdquo; In the first part of this verse Paul says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ&rdquo;; hence, it is &ldquo;no longer I who live.&rdquo; Yet in the latter part of this verse he says, &ldquo;The life which I now live,&rdquo; showing that an &ldquo;I&rdquo; still lives. This indicates that in an overcoming living our humanity is not annulled. Rather, our humanity is mingled with divinity.</p>
<p>In the garden of Eden, Adam lived by the life of the soul. His soul was his person, and his spirit was an organ, a vessel. The soul of a believer, however, is no longer his person because his soul-life has been crucified. Hence, a believer should live by the divine life in his spirit. Since the soul-life has been crucified, our human element seemingly has been annulled. However, since the overcoming living of a believer involves the mingling of divinity with humanity, our human element has not been annulled. How can we explain this?</p>
<p>In incarnation God became the man Jesus the Nazarene. As a man, He possessed a soul, without which He would not have been a man. When He was crucified, His human life and nature were put to death, not His divine life and nature. Jesus the Nazarene possessed the human life, and He possessed the divine life of God. Adam had only the human life. Hence, once his human life died, he was finished. However, after the Lord died, He resurrected. He resurrected from the dead because the life of God was in Him. This life is the power of God. Furthermore, in His resurrection, the Lord&rsquo;s humanity was resurrected by His divinity. When we were regenerated, we were made alive by the life of God, and our humanity was enlivened by divinity. Now in our Christian living our human life is being brought into the life of God, and our humanity is being brought into divinity.</p>
<p>On the one hand, our soul-life was put to death on the cross, but on the other hand, the functions of our soul, according to our humanity, were resurrected with the Lord Jesus. Hence, our human element is being brought into God&rsquo;s life and thus lives as our resurrected &ldquo;I.&rdquo; This is what the second part of Galatians 2:20 says: &ldquo;The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo; here has passed through death and resurrection and is able to live in the faith of the Son of God. This new &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the resurrected &ldquo;I,&rdquo; who has been brought into God through the resurrection of Christ and has been joined to Christ. Hence, this &ldquo;I&rdquo; can be joined to the faith of Christ and can live in the faith of Christ.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s salvation there is not only death but also resurrection. Every experience of being put to death is followed by resurrection. When God puts our soul to death, He does not intend to annul the functions of our soul but rather to let them pass through death and enter into resurrection so that we can be strengthened with the divine life. One day our body will die and enter into resurrection to become a glorified body. Without entering into death, our soul is independent of God and cannot be mingled with Him. Only when our soul has been put to death and has entered into resurrection will it cease to be independent of God and thus enter into God. Then our spirit will become our dominant part, and our soul will be subordinate to our spirit. Furthermore, our soul will be completely under the direction of our spirit. This can be compared to mixing bronze with gold. In order for these two metals to be mixed together, they must be melted. The bronze does not disappear; rather, it is blended with the gold. In the same principle, after we experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit and the putting to death by the cross, the functions of our soul are resurrected by the life of God and are mingled with the life of God. Just as bronze and gold are first melted and then blended together to form an alloy of bronze and gold, so our soul-life must die and enter into resurrection in order to be mingled with God. Our humanity is mingled with divinity and, as a result, is strengthened and enriched with the divine nature.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
