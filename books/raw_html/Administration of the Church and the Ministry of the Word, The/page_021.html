 <h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S GOING TO PREPARE A PLACE<br />
BEING FOR THE ENLARGEMENT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>If the Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s house, how can He go to prepare a place for us? His going to prepare a place is the enlargement of Christ. First Corinthians 6:19 says that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within us. First Peter 2:5 says that we are being built up as a spiritual house. Ephesians 2:21-22 says that we are growing into a holy temple in the Lord, into a dwelling place of God in spirit. First Timothy 3:15 says that the church of the living God is the house of God. <em>House</em> and <em>temple</em> in these verses refer to the dwelling place of God. The house is the temple, and the temple is the dwelling place of God. The dwelling place of God is a mystery in the universe. God&rsquo;s dwelling place is a matter of a person, not a matter of a place. God&rsquo;s dwelling place is the church, which is composed of the believers. The believers are the enlargement of Christ. If we grasp this thought, we will understand what God is doing in the universe.</p>
<p>God dwells in the church, and the church is the house of God. Therefore, the church has the element of man and the element of God with the element of heaven. God is in the church, and heaven is also in the church. Although the church is on the earth today, it is heavenly, because heaven is in the church. Therefore, the church is the mingling of God and man, and it is the joining of heaven and earth. This is God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This dwelling place of God is different from His dwelling place in heaven. God&rsquo;s dwelling place in heaven is merely heaven; it does not have the element of man and is not joined to the earth. However, the church, obtained by God as His dwelling place, is a mystery, because God has entered into man and mingled Himself with man. When God comes, heaven comes, and because man is here, the earth is also here. This is the mingling of God and man, and it is the joining of heaven and earth. Although such an entity is not of the earth, it is on the earth. Although it is on the earth, it is of heaven and has the element of heaven. Such a dwelling place, the mingling of God and man and the joining of heaven and earth, is the eternal dwelling place which God is building. This is the place the Lord said that He would go to prepare; this place includes the church and heaven.</p>
<p>In John 14:11-12 the Lord said, &ldquo;Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves. Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes into Me, the works which I do he shall do also; and greater than these he shall do because I am going to the Father.&rdquo; In these verses the Lord was saying that He would enter into the Father, and He would also bring those who believed into Him into the Father. Here there is a person as well as a place. Heaven can be expressed on earth because it is in God and is expressed through the mingling of God and man. This is a mystery. The element of heaven can be expressed on earth through the mingling of God and man. This is the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem, like the church, possesses the mingling of God and man, and heaven is also mingled with it. The church is composed of the believers who are mingled with God and the condition, the element, of heaven that is also in us. In this way both God and heaven are expressed on earth. Even though this is a miniature, we cannot fully apprehend it. In the coming new heaven and new earth, the time of maturity and fullness, God will be fully mingled with man, and man will fully enter into God. God will take man as His dwelling place, and man will take God as his abode; thus, the elements of God and heaven will be brought into man and expressed on earth. This is what the Lord Jesus meant when He said that He was going to prepare a place for us.</p>
