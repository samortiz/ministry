   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Accomplish God's New Testament Economy concerning the Church in</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Building Up of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The work of the New Testament ministry is to accomplish God's New Testament economy concerning the church Eph 3:9-10 in the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 4:12 says that all the saints need to be perfected "unto the work of the ministry."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that hundreds and even thousands of saints can be perfected unto the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this verse the term the ministry is used.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No doubt this refers to the unique ministry of the New Testament to carry out God's eternal purpose, which is contained in the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's new covenant contains God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To carry out this economy requires much work, and that work is the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Ephesians 4:12 the phrase unto the building up of the Body of Christ appears in apposition to unto the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates clearly that to do the work of the ministry is to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>NOT MANY MINISTRIES, BUT ONLY ONE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we consider all these verses together and put them together rightly, like the pieces of a puzzle, we can see a picture showing us clearly that the New Testament ministry is the service, the work, in totality of all the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this ministry Timothy had a part called Timothy's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You also have a part called "your ministry," and I also have a part called "my ministry."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, this does not mean that in the New Testament there is one ministry, and then in addition to this one ministry there are many other ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ministry of the New Testament is uniquely one, but there are many ministers who have a part in this one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In recent years some of the dissenting ones have said that they accept all ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In saying "all ministries" they seem to have the concept that the new covenant has many ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since there is only one new covenant, how could there be many new covenant ministries?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many workers may have a part in constructing a building, but they do not carry out many different works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, they carry out only one work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That one work is not done according to anyone's opinion but is carried out under one superintendent, one master builder 1 Cor 3:10 , and according to the unique copy of the blueprint.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The one blueprint eliminates all opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every part of the work must be done according to the one blueprint and under the leadership of the one master builder.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way all the workers carry out only one building work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's new covenant is a great matter concerning the lives of millions of people, yet it is accomplished by only one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Testament we cannot see two ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may speak of Peter's ministry, of Paul's ministry, or of Timothy's ministry, but we must do so with the realization that these individual ministries are only small parts of "this ministry," the unique ministry of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"This ministry" implies and includes all the ministers' pieces of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A jigsaw puzzle does not portray two pictures; each puzzle shows only one picture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This picture is composed of many pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have the ability to put the pieces together properly, eventually we will see just one picture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, when we put all the individual ministries of the New Testament ministers together, we have just one ministry, the unique ministry of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ministry denotes the unique new covenant ministry for the building up of one building, the Body of Christ, and this ministry is the unique service of thousands of New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every member of the Body of Christ has a part of this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although every believer has a part of the ministry, their parts are not separate ministries but are only parts of the one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The carrying out of God's new covenant requires only one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there is more than one ministry, trouble will result.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that this matter will be made clear to all the dear saints in the Lord's recovery.</S>
