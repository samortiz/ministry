   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE MEASURE AND FLOW Scripture Reading: John 7:37-38; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>47:1-10, 12 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible water is a very important matter and has a great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 2, after creating man, God put him in the garden of Eden, which was watered by a river.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we see water, and as we read further, the Bible often mentions water or a river.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Psalm 36:8, God's people "are saturated with the fatness of Your house,/And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The prophets frequently referred to water; Ezekiel 47 vividly depicts water flowing out and becoming a river.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Gospels, especially the Gospel of John which deals with life, the Lord Jesus referred to water many times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He also said, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The last chapter of the Bible, Revelation 22, indicates that there is a pure river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the New Jerusalem v. 1 . In these passages, the Bible uses water as a symbol of the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we receive the life of the Lord, it enters into us and becomes as if it were a spring of water connected to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once we receive the life of the Lord, we are joined to the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to John 7:37-38, when the water comes into us, it becomes rivers of living water flowing out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we need to consider the following question: How can the life within us flow out like a river of living water?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word flow is in John 7, and the synonyms issued or ran out are in Ezekiel 47.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both John and Ezekiel said that the water would become a river.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we compare Ezekiel's word with John's, we will see how the water flowed out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It flowed out by measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Ezekiel we see that after measuring, the waters came to the ankles; after measuring again, they came to the knees; after measuring once again, they came to the loins; after measuring the fourth time, they became waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From this we should notice one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order for the water in John 7 to flow out like a river, there must be the measuring spoken of in Ezekiel 47.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By putting the two passages together we can see that the secret for the living water to flow out is measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the meaning of measuring?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Ezekiel, it means the separation of the holy from the common.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The man whom Ezekiel saw in the vision measured several times.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ezekiel 42:20 says, "He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The measuring in this verse discriminates between the sanctified and the profane; it separates the sanctified from the profane.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After measuring a piece of land, it is regarded as a sanctified, no longer profane, place and it is consecrated to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God wants us to be consecrated to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why He measures us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Any part in us that is measured is no longer profane; it is sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What was once worldly becomes godly after it is measured.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While communing with God, Ezekiel saw the measurer in a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His appearance was like the appearance of brass Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>40:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Bible speaks of man meeting God or His angel, it often mentions the appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For instance, Revelation 4 says that John saw God sitting on the throne and that He looked like a jasper stone and a sardius.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The measurer whom Ezekiel saw had the appearance of brass.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The significance of brass in the Bible is judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The altar, which was made of brass, represented judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The bronze serpent prefigured the Lord Jesus undergoing judgment on the cross on behalf of man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The measurer had the appearance of brass; this signifies that he was a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the time of measuring, there is separation as well as judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There must be a definite standard, or a definite scale, in order to measure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sloppy people cannot measure; neither can those who are unable to differentiate between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Likewise, those who are ignorant of the measuring scale cannot measure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we are in fellowship with God and are enlightened by Him, we will come face to face with the measurer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God measures us, light shines on the areas where we have fallen short of His standard or His delight.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is God's judgment.</S>
