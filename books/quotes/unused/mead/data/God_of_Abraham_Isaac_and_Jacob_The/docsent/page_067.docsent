   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Touching the Hollow of Jacob's Thigh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank God that He has a way!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is true that Jacob was very capable and that his fleshly life and natural energy were stronger than anyone else's. But in the end God prevailed over him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If God had wrestled with him according to the usual way, the wrestling might have lasted for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But God knew that the time had come.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He saw that Jacob could not be put down, He touched the hollow of his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once God touched the hollow of his thigh, it came out of joint.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The sinew of the hollow of the thigh is the strongest sinew in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It represents the strongest part of a person, the seat of man's natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God touched the seat of Jacob's natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh because on that day, the sinew of it was revealed and exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On that day, he was afraid that Esau would come and kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was afraid that his wives and children would be killed by his brother, and therefore, he put on the best performance of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He prepared his gifts, put some of each kind in each company, and asked the servants to walk in front and separate the companies by a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He also told them to speak good words when they met Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He came up with this smart way of mitigating Esau's animosity so that Esau would feel obliged to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob was putting his best ability forward; the sinew of the hollow of his thigh was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But that day God touched the hollow of his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man's natural strength always exhibits certain characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are always certain areas from which the natural strength manifests itself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are always certain spots which are particularly strong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God intends to expose these strong spots.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Unfortunately, many Christians do not know the vehicles upon which their natural energy is lodged.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The most pitiful people are not those who are weak, but those who do not know that they are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The poorest people are not those who are wrong, but those who do not know that they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are not only in error but in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not live in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result they are not aware of their wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some Christians can say that they are wrong in this and that, but the wrongs they mention are actually not the crux of the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There may be deeper problems which are not yet manifested, and God has not yet been provided the opportunity to expose them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God permitted Jacob to encounter Esau with the four hundred men so that all of Jacob's strength would be exposed and his characteristics revealed.</S>
