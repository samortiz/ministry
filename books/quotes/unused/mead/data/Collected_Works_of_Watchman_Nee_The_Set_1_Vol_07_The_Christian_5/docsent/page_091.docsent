   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 PETER 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 1-2:"But there arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And many will follow their licentiousness, because of whom the way of the truth will be reviled."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Heresies" and "licentiousness" go together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to justify a licentious deed, one has to create a heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sin is nothing but an apostate soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 7-8:"And rescued righteous Lot, who had been oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless for that righteous man, who settled down among them, in seeing and hearing tormented his righteous soul day after day with their lawless works ."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lot was a social reformer!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the result?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was being reformed by Sodom instead!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was a saved one, one who was justified by faith, but all his works were burned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The social reformers today will realize their wrong when the fire of 1 Corinthians 3 is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Compare verse 10 and verse 11:"And especially those who go after the flesh in the lust for defilement and despise lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble while reviling dignities; whereas angels, though they are greater in strength and power, do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who despise lordship and revile dignities know not to fear.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even the angels, who are more noble than they are, dared not revile.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 22:"It has happened to them according to the true proverb: The dog has turned to its own vomit, and the washed sow to wallowing in the mud."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These ones are not regenerated yet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2 PETER 3</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 3:"Knowing this first, that in the last of days mockers will come with mocking, going on according to their own lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because there is lust, there is mocking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who despise the Lord's second coming are sick spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 5:"For this escapes them by their own choosing, that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth was compacted out of water and through water."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The matter escapes them by their own choosing, rather than through their ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may say that they are deceiving others and deceiving themselves!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1 JOHN 1</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 5:"And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May the Lord be gracious to us so that every time we preach, we announce to others the light we have received from the Lord, rather than speak from our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May the Lord guard our mouth so that what we speak every day is what we have heard from the Lord, not from man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1 JOHN 2</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 10:"He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Saints are caused to stumble mostly because of men, other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if one loves his brother, there will be no reason for him to be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The love of the brothers preserves us from being stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The wile of Satan is to plant the seed of jealousy into the heart of men and cause this seed to germinate at the right opportunity, thus causing men to be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here it says, "loves his brother," not "loves some of his brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 11:"But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What a picture of a man under the authority of darkness!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word "brother" means that the hating one and the ones he hates are all saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the mind of such a one has been possessed by evil demons, and he will pay any price just to destroy the ones he is jealous of.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes it may not be as severe, yet in his conversation, subconsciously, many critical words come out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Indeed, he "walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is not fully blind, but is only blind with regard to that particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a condition of demon possession in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 14:"I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have written to you, young men, because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the evil one."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The way to overcome Satan is to have the word of God abiding in us.</S>
