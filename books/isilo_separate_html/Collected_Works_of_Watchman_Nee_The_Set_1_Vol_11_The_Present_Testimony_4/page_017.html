But I have to tell you that excitement in one's feelings is actually a hindrance to a life of faith. God has to strip you of everything you have received through your feeling, until only God and His Word remain. He causes you to believe in a calm way; there is no feeling, no excitement. You believe "coldly." When you do that, you are brought up to the mountaintop again. There is joy again, but the joy is different from the first experience of joy. The first experience is groundless, but this joy has a basis. This time God causes you to experience the real victory, not like the previous idealistic victory, because you have passed through the tunnel experience.</P><P>Please remember that every time a believer wants to acquire some spiritual experience, he has to first pass through the test of the tunnel before he can really acquire anything. When you acquire a new truth, you are very happy. But you must be careful; immediately after this there is a tunnel waiting for you. If you do not realize this fact and instead doubt the reliability of God's Word, you will be in danger. Because many Christians do not know this principle, they stay inside the tunnel and never come out. God's goal is to remove your outward feelings and your outward crutches, so that His Word will take hold of you and so that you will be empowered through faith. Brothers, before you acquire a spiritual truth, you must always go through the tunnel experience. The feeling on the first peak is not trustworthy. Only after you have gone through the tunnel experience can the truth be yours. This is true with any kind of truth.</P><P>At first, we hear a truth and receive it. This is where the teachers come in. They share the truth with us. But we must not think that just because we have heard and understood it, that it is ours. God has to bring us down from the peak to the plain and into the tunnel before we can be on the third peak again. At that time the truth will be ours. There is a particular danger with the preachers. When they reach the first peak, they think they have acquired something, and they blow their trumpet to tell others about it. Those who hear also think that they have acquired the truth. But when they are brought by God to the plain and into the tunnel, they will think that what they heard was wrong. The mistake is with the preachers themselves. When they are on the first peak, they need not be hasty in telling others anything, for everything will surely go into the tunnel. The length of time in the tunnel is not certain; it can be long or short. Only after they have come out of the tunnel will the truth be theirs. After they have gone through the tunnel experience, they will realize what that truth really means. God leads us this way in order to show us that the just live by faith and not by feeling. When we are brought into the tunnel, we realize that the only thing that will bring us through is the Word of God. Only God's Word counts; feelings do not count. After we pass through the tunnel experience, the truth will be ours. When we are brought into the tunnel by God, we think that we have lost all the truth. Actually, God is turning the truth that we have received in our feelings into real experience through the test of the tunnel. In other words, when we are in the tunnel we acquire the truth in a real way.</P><P>Let me now relate to you a story to illustrate this matter. I have a friend who is a very good poet. One day he went to a potter to watch how porcelain ware is made. He saw many people making many vases out of mud, smoothing them out, and painting flowers and letters on them. Finally, the vases were burned in the furnace. He thought of the pain the vases had to go through and wondered if the burning was necessary. A vase that has not gone through the fire looks the same outwardly as a vase that has gone through the fire. But inwardly they are very different. A vase that has passed through the fire can hold water with flowers. A vase that has not passed through the fire dissolves once water is poured into it. There must be the burning. He noticed that of the numerous vases that went into the furnace, only about one-third would come out of the fire undamaged. He was touched by this, and he went home and wrote a poem based on Peter's word about the "fiery ordeal" (1 Pet. 4:12). In the poem he metaphorically described himself as a vase, upon which were painted flowers and letters and colors. It was beautiful, yet it could not stand the touch of a finger or the splash of water. Unless he went through the fire, nothing would be solid or firm. There was no choice but to enter the furnace. Within the furnace, there was the sound of crying and murmuring. But he had to suffer this before he could possess the lasting beauty. When the time came, he emerged out of the furnace. Then there was not only outward beauty, but an inward firmness. All the pictures and letters had firmly become one with him; they belonged to him and could not be erased or washed away anymore. Now he could be presented before anyone, even before a king.</P><P>Our experience of acquiring the truth is similar to the experience of the vase. When the flowers and letters are first painted, we think everything is fine. But we cannot stand any touching and are destroyed by any washing. The truth is not ours; we only understand it in our mind and are excited in our feeling. We rejoice over it a little too soon. We have to remember that every time we go through a test, it is to help us to possess the truth that we have just heard. Suppose we have just heard the truth concerning patience. A test will come to make us impatient. The test we will face will put us in exactly the opposite place of the truth we received in our feeling. God wants to put us through the burning of the furnace. Many people go into the furnace and never come out again. But if we go through the fire and come out again, what we have acquired will be firm. Then we will be on the mountaintop once again. The truth which we received before is unusable; but the truth we now have is usable. The sword which we acquired before could not be used to fight; the sword we now have, can. What we had before was only a nice outward appearance; what we now have within is something solid. Previously, we were in the realm of the mind and the emotion; now we have really acquired something.</P><P>When we hear a new truth, we go home rejoicing. But what follows are the trials. We must pass through the fire. Here lies the difference between faithful ones and unfaithful ones. It is not enough just to put some nice colors on a vase to make it look nice outwardly. It must go through the fire and come out of the fire before it can be useful. What we receive in our feeling is of no use before God. We have to go through the fire and lose every outward thing before we will receive something real. When we receive a new truth and feel very happy about it, we must not think that we have the truth already. In the tunnel everything is dark; there is no light at all. But we should not think that we have lost the truth we have received initially. We have to realize that this is the time we are actually acquiring the truth. God's goal is to remove us from a life in the emotions and teach us to live by faith. There is only one principle: the just shall live by faith and not by feelings. With every spiritual experience the principle is the same: first there is the mountaintop feeling of joy, then there is the experience of the tunnel, and then another mountaintop joy that is genuine. After this, what we have obtained is real.</P><P>Why does God always give us a mountaintop feeling of joy at the beginning of our spiritual experience? God has His intention for doing this. If we do not have a taste of the truth, we will not receive it. Madame Guyon said that God allows us to have a taste of the joy of every new truth, so that we will not want to lose it even when we are in the tunnel. When we pass the test and come out of the tunnel, we will have a full taste of the joy of that truth. First we have a foretaste. After the trial we come into the full and unrestricted enjoyment.</P><P>Now we see the proper course of a Christian path. We cannot possess any truth without going through the test of the tunnel. Faith is the principle because feelings are unreliable. God takes away our feelings so that we can have the opportunity of trusting in Him. If our feelings are not removed, we will not trust in God.</P><P>Some brothers have asked, "Why is the truth that we think we received in the first peak, the truth we received in our feelings, not trustworthy? Why do we have to pass through the experience of the tunnel before it becomes trustworthy? What does this have to do with our feelings?" The reason is that when we receive the mountaintop feeling of joy concerning a certain truth, we think we have everything and everything is ours. Actually, we still have nothing. God puts us in a tunnel so that the truth can become really ours. When we enter the tunnel, everything is dark and there is no support anywhere. It seems as if God's Word has failed, and we do not understand why. It seems that God's Word, promises, and facts are all the same and ineffectual. It seems that our feelings have failed us, and according to our feelings, everything is lost. After a while, the truth comes back to look for us. Even though circumstantially we do not feel anything, the truth seems more real and is easier for us to believe. God is delivering us from what we think we have and understand according to our feeling, so that we can actually possess and understand these things. Mr. Andrew Murray once said that the Holy Spirit explains the Word of God to us. I will add a word: only the Holy Spirit can explain God's Word to us. For example, every evening we have our Bible study. Even though we have read and expounded every verse, this does not count; we must forget about these things and allow them to fail inside the tunnel before there can be the beginning of faith. The Holy Spirit must explain the same thing to us a second time. Whatever we think we understand, we understand only in our feelings. We must pass through the tunnel. Only the experience we gain in the tunnel is real. This is the principle of faith.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
