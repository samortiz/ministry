<p>After this there is the third item, that is, the mind set on the things of God. The things which you are praising for become your enjoyment and become a base, a ground, for you to set your entire soul on. You have to set your mind on these things. Don&rsquo;t set your mind on your checking account or on your new car. Sometimes after brothers and sisters have bought a new car, their mind has really been set on the car for at least a month. They muse on the car. They like to look at it and to touch it and to consider it and to wash it. This is to set your mind on a car. You have to turn your mind. When you are washing your car, forget about the car. Set your mind upon the things of God. This is the wrapping up of all the things of God with your inner being.</p>
<p>Firstly, your spirit is mingled by and with the Spirit of God; then it is wrapped up with all these things of God concerning Christ. If your mind is set upon all these wonderful things of God concerning Christ, you would surely be a wonderful person&mdash;filled up with Christ and saturated with all the things of God. These are the three items of the second group.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW, THE SPIRIT, AND THE LIFE</h2>
<p>Now let us come back to the first group of items. The first group is very mysterious and even somewhat abstract. You have the law of the Spirit of life. What is the law? What is the Spirit? What is life? All three of these are somewhat abstract. They are not so substantial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE PERSON IN THREE ASPECTS</h2>
<p>I must point out to you again that all these three things are one Person in three aspects. Of course, the Spirit is a Person. You should not consider the Spirit as a power or as an instrument. You must consider the Spirit as the divine Person. In the same principle the law and the life also must be a Person. The Spirit is a Person, the life is a Person, and the law is also this same Person. This is one Person with three aspects within you. One Person is in you with three titles. He is called the Spirit, He is called the life, and He is also called the law. These are not three Persons, but one Person in three aspects. The Spirit must be the Spirit of the Trinity. Furthermore, the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ, the Second of the Trinity is life (John 14:6). In the Epistles we also are told that Christ is our life (Col. 3:4). No doubt life here refers to the Second of the Trinity.</p>
<p>What about the law? The natural law always brings us to the source. If there is a law, that natural law goes to the source. Who is the source? The Father. So the Father is here as the source of the spiritual, natural law. The Father is the source of this automatic, working law. So with the law of the Spirit of life, we have the Father, the Spirit, and the Son. We have these Three working in us as the Spirit and as the law and as the life. The Triune God as a complete Person is working within us as the law, as the Spirit, and as life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING THE LAW</h2>
<p>How can we apply this? Don&rsquo;t forget that the law is just the Triune God Himself working within us in an automatic way. Within us there is a kind of work going on automatically, not by activity and not by accident. This is the law. When we come into this building and need lights, we go to the switch. When we touch the switch, the light comes. If we keep the switch on all the time, light will be shining all the time. This is not an activity, nor is it an accident. This is according to the working of the law of electricity. The electricity was installed into the building according to the law of electricity. There is something that regulates the electricity. That something is invisible, abstract, and mysterious, but it is so real. The electricians have to install the things properly because they have a law to follow. Actually, what is installed into the building is not only electricity, but also a law. An electrical law has been installed into this building. If someone fulfills the law of electricity, the electricity in the building works, not by activity nor by accident, but by law. Our Triune God today within us is such a law.</p>
<p>Sometimes Christians trust too much in their prayer in a superstitious way. This is like someone coming into the building who does not know the law of electricity and does not know where the switch is. So he kneels down and prays and fasts and does not sleep for three days and three nights. He prays in this way, &ldquo;Lord, You are almighty; You are omnipresent. Lord, You can make this room full of light. Lord, do it!&rdquo; Some put their trust in this kind of superstitious prayer. Such a prayer could never cause the room to be full of light. There is no need to pray like this. You just need to go to the switch. Within seconds light will be shining everywhere. This is not a miracle; this is the working out of the invisible, untouchable law.</p>
<p>My burden is to help you to realize that such a thing is in you. How wonderful that such a thing is in you! Now I would ask, Are you living? Recently I told a brother that the pray-reading and the calling on the name of the Lord and the singing of the hymns are being somewhat wrongly used. You think when you call on the name of the Lord Jesus at the top of your voice, that is living. But that is not living. Then you might argue that we have printed and published some messages saying that you need to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name as loudly as possible. But you have to read the context of these messages to understand what I mean. Suppose you are always a quiet person. To such a person I would say if you are going to get the Spirit, you must call on the name of the Lord loudly. You must cry! That message was published to this kind of people. After you began to shout loudly, another message came out encouraging you to be quiet. Loudness is not the Spirit.</p>
<p>Now I would tell you that the Spirit is the law of the Spirit of life. You don&rsquo;t need to beat the switches nor do you need to pray loudly. Learn to be quiet to touch the inner invisible switch. Sometimes the more the young people were shouting, the more they were dead. The more they were shouting, the more the life was gone. The shoutings, the callings, the pray-readings, the singings became a performance. It was not the automatic working of the law of the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>You have to realize that within you there is such a law. It is a law like the law of digestion. After you eat your meal you don&rsquo;t need to kneel down and pray concerning the digestion of your food. In fact, if you pray in this way you might get stomach trouble. After a meal you had better simply take a short walk. You don&rsquo;t need to pray concerning your digestion because within your stomach there is the law of digestion. Likewise, within your spiritual being there is a law that works all the time. This law works within you automatically. This law is nothing less than the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. To have your spirit mingled with God&rsquo;s Spirit is a great matter, but to have such a law working in your inner being is something even greater. This law is the Triune God. The Father as the source is working within you as a law.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_173.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_175.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Perfecting Training &nbsp; pg 174</div><br></body></html>
