Christ as Our High Priest</H2><P>The ascended Christ is also ministering to our inward need. In Old Testament times the high priest ministered to God on behalf of His people. Hebrews tells us that Christ is our great High Priest who can sympathize with our weaknesses (4:14-15). Because Christ became a man, He thoroughly knows our weak points and problems. But He is also God, constituted according to the power of an indestructible life (Heb. 7:16). Therefore He is able to take care of us in any situation (Heb. 7:25).</P><P>Surely every hour we need Him. From hour to hour we do not know what situations will confront us. Sometimes troubles come to us and we get anxious. Before we were saved, these worries were endless. But now, when anxious thoughts arise, we soon sense a soothing comfort, saying to us, "Why don't you pray? You don't need to worry." Christ has begun to intercede for us, and this is the effect it produces. Then we respond to Him, "Thank You, Lord. You bear my worries. All my cares are in Your hand." Just a few short words and the anxiety is lifted! We can enjoy Him. This is Christ's priestly intercession for us. It is unending. We should have many experiences of being reminded, comforted, strengthened, and even carried by our great High Priest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. OUR COOPERATION</H2><P>Christ is more than qualified for the great offices He holds in His heavenly ministry. He is working day and night. He is controlling every event on the earth&#151;from the rise and fall of nations to the teacher you get for English. All this is so that He can carry out God's great eternal purpose. Yet without our cooperation, the ascended Christ can do very little. He is our great Head but we are His Body. On earth, He can move only through us, His members. This is a very serious matter. Christ requires our cooperation.</P><P>He desires all men to be saved but He cannot save them unless we speak to them. In this respect, the almighty God cannot do anything unless we cooperate with Him. What a responsibility, but what a privilege! We can be those who allow God to move on the earth for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose! We are the V.I.P.'s of the universe. But we must be faithful to cooperate with Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>How wonderful it is that Jesus was made Lord, Head over all things.
