<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(6)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 1:47; Psa. 16:9; 108:1; Acts 2:26; 1 Cor. 14:7-11; Acts 6:10; 7:55; 4:31</H1><P>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for all that You are to us, and we thank You for this time that we all could come together to seek after You in Your Word. While the whole world is busy with worldly things, we are separated unto You. What a privilege, what a blessing, and even what an enjoyment! We trust in You for Your blessing. Lord, bless us. Without Your blessing we are nothing and we can do nothing. But now we do believe that You are with us. We do have the sense that You are with us. We treasure Your presence. Give us a seeking heart and, Lord, a sober mind, even an open spirit, open to You and to Your way, to Your economy, to Your speaking. Help us in the speaking. We are nothing; without Your presence, without Your anointing, we are dead persons. Yet we thank You that the ointment is within us. We trust in this. Lord, give us a new word, the up-to-date word, and a new speaking full of Your interest and full of Yourself, Your riches, Your secret, Your economy, Your dispensing. Lord, be with us. Shame the enemy. Amen.</P><P>God's economy is, first, to carry out something in the principle of incarnation. Before Christ was born, God was God and man was man. Although God came to visit man and came down upon man as the Spirit of Jehovah, God still remained by Himself, leaving man alone. However, in His incarnation, He came to bring divinity into humanity. We all need to learn and never forget the phrase to bring divinity into humanity. In the universe an extraordinary "career" was accomplished, that is, the mingling of God with man. How marvelous this is!</P><P>The history of the universe consists of nine major items. The first four are the Triune God, the universe created by Him, man, and incarnation to mingle God with man. The issue of incarnation was a wonderful person, a person with two natures&#151;the God-man, Jesus Christ. In my estimation such a God-man is much greater than the entire universe. Then, this One went to the cross and accomplished a wonderful, all-inclusive death, terminating all the old things and germinating the new creation. Jesus Christ as the God-man and His all-inclusive death are the fifth and sixth major items in the history of the universe.</P><P>After His death Christ also accomplished His resurrection. In John 11:25 He said that He is resurrection. Before His death He was resurrection already, but that resurrection was not consummated, was not processed. After His death He entered into a consummated resurrection, which produced the church. The church will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Christ's resurrection, the church, and the New Jerusalem are the last three of the nine major items of the history of the universe. We need to learn this history and endeavor to speak it to others.</P><P>First, God did a wonderful thing to make Himself one with man. Since that time, concerning His economy God would never do anything apart from man. He will never do anything merely by Himself. Without man, we may say that God is crippled; He cannot "walk" or do anything without man. God must do everything in the principle of incarnation. The Old Testament says Jehovah's Spirit came upon the prophets (1 Sam. 10:6, 10; 19:20; 2 Chron. 20:14-15; Ezek. 11:5) or that the burden of Jehovah's word came upon them (Zech. 12:1). Today many Pentecostals follow the Old Testament in their practice of prophesying. In their meetings it is common to hear someone say, "Thus saith the Lord." However, Peter never said this, nor did Paul. In 1 Corinthians 7:12 Paul said, "I say, I, not the Lord," and in verse 40 he said, "...according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God." Although Paul gave his own opinion, we must take Paul's word as the word of the Lord. We need to realize that the entire Christianity has been and still is wrong in one basic principle: they have not seen that the New Testament economy is the economy based on the principle of incarnation. In His New Testament economy, apart from man, God cannot do anything. Even the all-inclusive death of Christ was accomplished by a God-man who died a vicarious death for us. The One who died on the cross was not only man but also God, not only God but also man. This is incarnation, and this is the incarnated One.</P><P>Today this incarnated God-man is in His consummated resurrection. Fifty years ago a co-worker told me definitely that he could not believe that after His resurrection Christ still has humanity. To his opinion Christ left His humanity in the tomb. However, although Christ did leave the old linen cloths in the tomb (John 19:40; Luke 24:12), He did not leave His humanity in the tomb. When He came to His disciples on the day of resurrection, He came with a body that could be touched by their fingers (John 20:27). Furthermore, when Stephen saw Christ in His ascension, he saw Him as a man, even the Son of Man (Acts 7:56). In Revelation 1:12-13 John saw the Son of Man, after His resurrection and ascension, walking among the golden lampstands. When the Lord spoke to the chief priests at His judgment, He told them that they would see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven (Matt. 26:64). After His coming back, Christ will remain in His humanity for eternity.</P>
