Thank and praise the wonderful grace of the Father. The result of the examination showed that other than the slight inflammation of the eyes and throat (which was caused by my recent speaking and reading), my body was healthy. My blood pressure is thirty points lower than it was in Hong Kong. When I was in Ch'ang-sha, I had to give over three hundred cc of blood. Then my blood pressure was only six points lower. But this time, it went down thirty points without doing anything. The Lord has truly manifested His endurance and mercy on me, the chiefest of all sinners. What else can I say? I can only thank and praise the Lord who lives forever for me with all of my heart!</p><p>The work began officially on the twelfth. In the morning we have prayer meetings. In the afternoon we have sisters' meetings, and we have preaching meetings in the evening. There are over ten co-workers gathering here in Kulangsu. From this morning on, the co-workers are waiting on the Lord together. We hope that the Lord will gain the glory He deserves through these gatherings. We are not sure when the meetings will be concluded.</p><p>Brother Philip Luan, March 20</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Co-workers in Hong Kong and Macao</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Unless I have special leading otherwise, my trip to Szechuan will not be changed. (We have received a letter from Hong Kong stating that Brother Kaung will leave for Chungking with his family around April 19 via K'un-ming and Kuei-yang. Please pray for this&mdash;Editor.) Mr. Luan will perhaps return to Hong Kong within the month. Brother Chen Ke-san wrote and said that he can come to Hong Kong. Thank the Lord! Give my regards to all the co-workers.</p><p>A weak one,<br />Stephen Kaung, March 22, 1939</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>A while ago Brother Lin Bao-shen came to Macao and preached the gospel for seven days. Although it rained on the last day, there were still many people. That evening Brother Nee Hwai-tzu and Brother Chang Shi-wu stood up and gave a good word on the gospel after Brother Lin's preaching. Then Brothers Nee and Chang proposed to have a gospel meeting every Tuesday evening (which we are doing). In addition we have a brothers' and sisters' meeting every Thursday evening, and we have the prayer meeting every Saturday night. Those who come to the Sunday afternoon meeting all have a seeking heart. Thank the Lord!</p><p>Praise and thank the Lord. Brother Nee Hwai-tzu spoke many times in the meetings about what he read from the Word. Once he read 1 Corinthians 3 and Daniel 3 and shared something like the following: If we want our life and work to withstand the fire in the future, we must have the experience of His presence today. Only the things we do in His presence count, because only these things will pass through the fire. The three friends of Daniel were not hurt in the midst of fiery persecution and difficulty, because they had the Lord's presence. The fire burned up their bondage instead. Their clothing, signifying their righteousness, was not burned at all. Our God is a consuming fire. If we see God's presence, we will not live in a loose way.</p><p>Sister Ro-chen, March 31</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Faithful Luk, Singapore</h2><p>Sister Tsai Deh-an (a Western missionary) passed by here and stayed for twelve days. She gave her testimony a few times and spoke of the Lord's work in her, her Spirit baptism, her water baptism, and how she saw the truth concerning head covering and the church. It was very moving. She has been going through a wilderness experience during the past year and a half in the Philippines. We thank the Lord for His grace. On the fourteenth she left Singapore for Norway. She will travel from there to northern Germany. The Lord willing, she will then return to America via England. After two or three months, she will return to the Far East. She still does not know where she should work in the future, whether in China, the Philippines, Malaysia, or Surabaya. May the Lord Himself give her leading. It is my opinion that there is a big need in Surabaya, if she and Miss Loo cannot work in China in the near future. There are only seven or eight brothers and sisters in Surabaya. Two or three of them are brothers from Fu-Ching and Fukien, and the other three or four were baptized by Brother Leland Wang a few months ago. It is difficult for them to rent houses or work. I have written a letter to them telling them to break bread in the homes if it is a problem to rent a place. I intend to go there, but I am still waiting. Sister Ding is resting in the National Hospital; her illness needs our prayer.</p><p>A weak servant of the Lord,<br />Faithful Luk, March 17</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_092.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_094.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 93</div><br></body></html>
