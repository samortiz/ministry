The Temple of God</h2><p>The dwelling place of God is the temple of God. First Corinthians 3:16 says, &#8220;Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?&#8221; Here &#8220;a temple of God&#8221; refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, as in Corinth, whereas &#8220;the temple of God&#8221; in verse 17 refers to all the believers universally. The unique spiritual temple of God in the universe has its expressions in many localities on earth. Each expression is a temple of God in that locality.<p>God&#8217;s building (1 Cor. 3:9) is not an ordinary building; on the contrary, it is the sanctuary of the holy God, the temple in which the Spirit of God dwells. We, the builders of such a holy temple, should realize this that we may be careful to build not with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble but with the precious materials of gold, silver, and precious stones (vv. 10-12), which correspond to God&#8217;s nature and economy.<p>Another verse which reveals that the habitation of God is the temple of God is Ephesians 2:21. &#8220;In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;temple&#8221; denotes the sanctuary, the inner part of the temple. Because God&#8217;s building is a living one, it is growing. It grows into a holy temple. The actual building of the church as the house of God is by the growth in life of the believers. Furthermore, the entire building of God&#8217;s house as His temple, His sanctuary, is in Christ the Lord.<h2 class=head3>2. The Household of God</h2><p>The church is a composition of the believers, and the believers are children of God, born of Him and having His life and nature. Thus, they become members of the household of God.<p>In Ephesians 2:19 Paul says, &#8220;So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God.&#8221; Both the Jewish and the Gentile believers are members of God&#8217;s household. God&#8217;s household is a matter of life and enjoyment; all believers were born of God into His household to enjoy His riches. The members of God&#8217;s family added together become the household of God, which is the house, the dwelling place, of God.<p>God&#8217;s dwelling place is His household, His family, and His family comes into being by God&#8217;s begetting. If we had not been begotten of God, God could not have a family. But God does have a great family, the largest family in the universe, composed of those who have been born of Him to be His children. Eventually, God&#8217;s children will grow up to be His mature sons, and then they will become heirs.<p>We would emphasize the fact that the church is not only the assembly of God but also the household of God. The church is not only something separated from the world but something born of God, regenerated by Him. God does not simply separate sinners from the world and put them together to be His household. In addition to separation, there must be a change of life and nature through regeneration. For this reason, after God separated us from the world, He put Himself into us, germinating us, begetting us as His children. It is in this way that we have become His household. This household then becomes God&#8217;s house, His dwelling place in our spirit. Intrinsically speaking, therefore, the church as God&#8217;s household is in our God-created, God-regenerated, and God-indwelt spirit. It is crucial for us to see this.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
