<h2 class="head1">BEREAVED OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>In verse 17 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;But we, brothers, having been bereaved of you for a little while, in presence, not in heart, were more abundantly eager with great desire to see your face.&rdquo; This word implies that the apostles considered the new converts precious and dear to them. Paul likened their departure from them to a bereavement, a loss they suffered from being separated from them and that caused them to miss them. In this verse we also see the apostles&rsquo; yearning over the new converts.</p>
<p>In verse 17 Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;Brothers, we have been bereaved of you. We wanted to stay with you, and we miss you very much. But although we are bereaved of you in presence, we are not bereaved of you in heart. In our heart we are still with you. We are very eager with much desire to see your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word in verses 15 through 17 is emotional. Because he was emotional, he could touch the emotion of others. When Paul spoke about the Jews negatively, he was emotional. Likewise, when he spoke about the apostles positively, he was also very emotional. Paul&rsquo;s expression of deep emotion caused the believers to love the apostles and to shut out the Judaizers. This too is related to fostering children, to protecting them, to raising them without their being damaged by negative things.</p>
<p>Paul certainly knew how to foster the saints. He spoke about himself in such a way as to foster them and also to inoculate them. In fostering the Thessalonians, Paul pointed out to them that the Jews who opposed and persecuted needed to be shut out, but the Jews who came to them as apostles were lovable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING A REWARD</h2>
<p>In verses 19 and 20 Paul indicates that those who work with the Lord in fostering the believers to walk worthily of God will receive a reward. This reward will be the believers we have fostered becoming our crown, glory, and joy. What a glory it would be to any Christian worker for the ones he has fostered to be matured at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back! What a crown and joy this would be to him! But on the contrary what a shame it would be if none of the believers had grown and matured.</p>
<p>Many of us are working with young saints. The result of our work should be the maturing of these believers. If they mature properly, they will be in the kingdom participating in God&rsquo;s glory. This maturity will then become our crown, joy, and boast before the Lord Jesus at His coming. Suppose, however, that we work continually with new believers, but to no avail. If this is the situation, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back there will be no result of our work. What a shame that would be! When the Lord Jesus comes, the result of our work will be manifested. That result will also be our reward, our crown, our joy.</p>
<p>We see the same principle in 1 Peter 5:4. Here Peter says that the elders will be rewarded with a crown of glory. However, this reward will depend on the result of their eldership. If as a result of their eldership the saints mature, that maturity will become a crown of glory to the elders. That will then be their reward.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 of 1 Thessalonians is a healthy word for us all. From this chapter we learn how to work with the young ones and the new ones so that they may be fostered to grow into maturity and that there may be a positive result of our work before the Lord at His coming. This result will then be our crown and glory as the reward of our work today. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians,</em> pp. 107-108, 109-110, 111, 112-113, 115-116)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>In verses 1 through 12 we have the care of a nursing mother and an exhorting father, and in verses 13 through 20 we see the reward given to those who foster believers in this way. Because the apostles rendered such a care to the new believers, the apostles will eventually receive a reward from the Lord. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians,</em> p. 96)</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOPE, JOY, AND CROWN</h2>
<p>In verses 19 and 20 Paul concludes, &ldquo;For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at His coming? Are not even you? For you are our glory and joy.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;coming&rdquo; in verse 19 is parousia, a word that means &ldquo;presence.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s coming is His presence with us. In this light these two earlier Epistles were written. Every chapter of the first Epistle ends with the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>Verse 20 indicates that since the apostles were the believers&rsquo; nursing mother and exhorting father (vv. 7, 11), the believers, as their children, were their glory and joy. Apart from them, the apostles had no hope, glory, or crown of boasting.</p>
<p>Here Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;You are our hope, our joy, and our crown of boasting. Brothers, we are here only for you; we are not here for anything else. If we do not have you, we do not have anything. You are our hope, even as your hope is the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Without you, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back we shall be short of joy and glory. We need you! You are our hope, our joy, our crown, and our glory before the Lord Jesus at His coming.&rdquo; Once again Paul expressed deep emotion in caring for his children. He certainly was a father exhorting his children. As such an exhorting father, it seems as if Paul was saying, &ldquo;Children, we are here only for you. Without you, life is meaningless. If it were not for you, we would not want even to live.&rdquo; Such a word from parents is deeply touching; it touches the heart of the children.</p>
<p>Would you not be touched deeply if your parents wrote such a word to you? Would you not be touched if they said that without you life is meaningless, that they are living on earth only for you? No doubt, when you heard or read such a word, your tears would flow. This kind of speaking fosters children and helps them to grow.</p>
<p>As a good father, Paul knew how to touch the heart of his children. If you are able to touch the heart of others, you will be successful in fostering their growth. The best way to foster others is to touch their heart deeply. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians,</em> pp. 114-115)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNFADING CROWN OF GLORY</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:4 says, &ldquo;And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.&rdquo; At the apostle&rsquo;s time, crowns were given to victors in athletic games and warfare (1 Cor. 9:25; 2 Tim. 4:8). Those were corruptible crowns, whose glory faded. The crown given by the Lord to the faithful elders will be a reward for their loyal service. The glory of this crown will never fade. It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers&rsquo; enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ (2 Pet. 1:11). (<em>Life-study of 1 Peter,</em> p. 295)</p>
