 <h2 class="head1">III. THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>[The Holy Spirit is the One who brings in the Triune God for our experience and enjoyment. Therefore, we should also know Him that we may richly experience Him.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Ultimate Expression of the Triune God</h2>
<p>[In the divine Trinity, the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, is listed last, showing that He is the ultimate expression of the Triune God (Matt. 28:19).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Triune God Reaching and Entering<br />
into the Believers</h2>
<p>The Lord said in John 14:16-17 [that the Holy Spirit is the Triune God reaching man, that is, the Triune God becoming the Spirit to reach man and be with him forever.]</p>
<p>He further revealed to us in John 14:17 and 20 [that the Holy Spirit, who reaches us with the Father and the Son, will also enter into us. This indicates that He is the Triune God entering into the believers. When He enters into us, the Father and the Son enter into us (John 14:23).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. What the Holy Spirit Is</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Spirit of God&rdquo; (Gen. 1:2) participated in God&rsquo;s work of creation. The &ldquo;Spirit of Jehovah&rdquo; (2 Chron. 20:14) participated in God&rsquo;s relationship with man (Gen. 2:7). The &ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Luke 1:35) participated in Christ&rsquo;s incarnation to sanctify man unto God. The &ldquo;Spirit of Jesus&rdquo; (Acts 16:7) participated in the birth, the living, and the sufferings of Jesus. The &ldquo;Spirit of Christ&rdquo; (Rom. 8:9) participated in the resurrection of Christ and the impartation of life. The &ldquo;Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:19) participated in the birth, living, and death of Jesus, as well as in the resurrection of Christ and the impartation of life, with a bountiful supply that the believers may be saved in all things. The &ldquo;Spirit of life&rdquo; (Rom. 8:2), &ldquo;the life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45), participated in Christ being man&rsquo;s life and giving man life. &ldquo;The Spirit&rdquo;, which was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39), [is the issue of the Holy Spirit having passed through all the items of what He is, mentioned above. Thus, He is the all-inclusive and consummated Spirit as the ultimate expression of the Triune God to reach and enter into those who believe into Christ.] The &ldquo;seven Spirits&rdquo; (Rev. 1:4) refers to the sevenfold intensified Holy Spirit, that the church in desolation may receive the sevenfold riches of grace and power.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Two Aspects of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>[In the New Testament, there are two aspects of the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, related to the believers. On the one hand, He is the Spirit of life in us to be the essential Spirit of God that we may have the divine life to live and to exist. On the other hand, He is the Spirit of power upon us to be the economical Spirit of God that we may have the divine power and gift to work for God.] Jesus said in John 14:17, &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...shall be in you&rdquo;. [This is the Holy Spirit as the essential Spirit of God in the believers that they may have God&rsquo;s life to live for God.] Then He said in Acts 1:8, &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo; [This is the Holy Spirit as the economical Spirit of God upon the believers that they may receive God&rsquo;s power to work for the Lord.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit did and is still doing many wonderful things for us to bring us fully into God&rsquo;s economy. There are ten crucial things that help bring us fully into God&rsquo;s economy: 1) The Holy Spirit became the transfiguration and reality of Christ in His resurrection to testify concerning the reality of Christ in resurrection (John 15:26); 2) The Holy Spirit came to convict sinners of their sins that they may repent and believe into Christ to obtain eternal life (John 16:8); 3) The Holy Spirit, as God&rsquo;s essential Spirit of life, regenerates the repentant sinner in his spirit that he may have the life of God and become a child of God (John 3:6); 4) The Holy Spirit, as God&rsquo;s essential Spirit of life, also renews man through regeneration that man may receive God&rsquo;s salvation of life (Titus 3:5); 5) The Holy Spirit, as God&rsquo;s essential Spirit of life, abides in us to continually supply us with God&rsquo;s life and riches (2 Tim. 1:14); 6) The Holy Spirit, as the essential Spirit of God, anoints the essence (element) of God into the believers, thus producing a teaching for them that they may abide in the Lord according to the teaching of God&rsquo;s essence (1 John 2:27); 7) The Holy Spirit, as God&rsquo;s essential Spirit of life in the believers, also supplies them with God&rsquo;s holy nature, that is, the divine essence (Rom. 15:16); 8) The Holy Spirit, as the essential Spirit of God in the believers, transforms the believers metabolically with God&rsquo;s divine essence into the Lord&rsquo;s image from one degree of glory to a higher degree of glory (2 Cor. 3:18); 9) The Holy Spirit, as the economical Spirit of God, is the power upon the believers for them to work for God (Luke 24:49); and 10) The Holy Spirit is upon the believers, as the economical Spirit of God, giving them diverse gifts to work for God (1 Cor. 12:7-11).</p>
