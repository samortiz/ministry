<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God Regarding Man<br>and Being Pleased with Man<br>in the Burnt Offering</H2><P>Genesis 4:4 and 8:20-22 speak of the burnt offering, a type of Christ. God regarded man, that is, respected man, and was pleased with man, not in man's good doing, but in the burnt offering. This is why Abel came to offer the burnt offering to God and God regarded both him and his offering.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. God Judging the Corrupted World<br>with the Flood<br>and Saving Noah and His Family</H2><P>God judged the corrupted world with the flood and saved Noah and his family through the ark (6:11-20). The ark is another type of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. God Judging the Rebellious Man at Babel</H2><P>In the time from God's creation of man to the calling of Abraham, God also judged the rebellious man at Babel, which was the ancient Babylon (11:4-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. FROM THE CALLING OF ABRAHAM<br>TO THE DECREE OF THE LAW THROUGH MOSES</H2><P>The second dispensation covers the period of time from the calling of Abraham to the decree of the law through Moses. The most important aspect of this dispensation was God's promise to Abraham. For this reason, Bible teachers calls this dispensation the dispensation of promise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God Regarding Man in the Burnt Offering</H2><P>As a continuation of the previous dispensation, God again regarded man in the burnt offering (12:7; 13:18; 22:13; 31:54; Job 1:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God Promising Abraham That in His Seed<br>All the Nations of the Earth Would Be Blessed</H2><P>In addition, God promised Abraham that in his seed, the coming Christ, all the nations of the earth, including us, would be blessed (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:8, 16). Eventually this promise was absolutely fulfilled, as revealed in Galatians 3.</P>
