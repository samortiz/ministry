<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE HUMAN SPIRIT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being the Dwelling Place of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>[Why are we emphasizing the difference between the Holy Spirit and the human spirit? It is because our greatest problem is that we do not know the indwelling Spirit or realize that the human spirit is the very dwelling place of the Holy Spirit; neither do we know that these two spirits are being mingled together as one Spirit. This is a pity! It is the mark of God's economy, and many Christians are missing this mark. It is like a house that is inaccessible because the key is missing. Only the key will open the house to us that we may enjoy everything in it. For centuries the enemy has covered the key. What is the key? It is that our human spirit is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, and that our human spirit is one with the wonderful Holy Spirit.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being the Strategic Point of the Inner Life</H2><P>[The human spirit is the strategic point for the inner life. We all have to know our human spirit. It is here that we have been born again and it is here that we worship God. "God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit" (John 4:24), not in the Holy Spirit, but in our human spirit. In our reborn human spirit we worship God, we serve God, we fellowship with one another, and we grow in life. We even have the church life here.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Being the Receiving Organ</H2><P>[Man can be likened to a radio. The Holy Spirit is like the heavenly radio waves. The spirit in man is like the radio receiver. The receiver is our spirit. God has done His part, and we have to take care of our spirit. We have to cooperate with God by preparing the proper organ to receive what He is, what He has done, and what He is going to do. There is no need for us to take care of the side of the Holy Spirit. That has been fully taken care of by God. We simply need to take care of our side, the human spirit.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE THREE PARTS OF THE SPIRIT&#151;<br>THE CONSCIENCE, FELLOWSHIP, AND INTUITION</H2><P>Let us go on to see something about the composition of the human spirit. [The spirit is a complete unit, composed of three parts or functions: conscience, fellowship, and intuition. The shaded area in the diagram below illustrates the parts of the spirit.]</P><P>[The conscience is found in Romans 9:1, "My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit." Comparing Romans 9:1 with Romans 8:16, the conscience is located in the human spirit. On the one hand, the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit. On the other hand, our conscience bears witness with the Holy Spirit. This proves that the conscience must be a function of our spirit.]</P><P>[It is easy to understand the conscience. We are all familiar with this. To perceive right from wrong is one function of the conscience (Psa. 51:10; 34:18). To condemn or to justify is another one of its functions (1 Cor. 5:3). It is also easy to comprehend the fellowship. The fellowship is our communion with God (John 4:24; Rom. 1:9). Within our spirit, such a function makes it possible to contact God (Eph. 6:18; Luke 1:47; 1 Cor. 6:17). In a simple word, fellowship is to touch God. But it is not very easy to understand the intuition. Intuition means to have a direct sense or knowledge (Mark 2:8). There is such a direct sense in our spirit, regardless of reason, circumstances, or background. It is a sense without reason, a sense that is not "reasonable" (1 Cor. 2:11). It is a direct sense of God and a direct knowledge from God. This function is what we call the intuition of the spirit. Thus, the spirit is known by the functions of the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition.]</P>
