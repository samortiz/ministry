<h2 class=head3>The Error of Reformed Theology</h2><p>Of all the different schools of fundamental theology, reformed theology, which is related to Luther and Calvin, is the worst. Although reformed theologians acknowledge the four major aspects of fundamentalist truths, the views of many of these theologians are altogether heretical. First, many say that there is no such thing as a millennial kingdom. They think that it is wrong to say that the millennial kingdom will not begin until the Lord Jesus comes back. Instead, they believe that beginning with the spreading of the gospel through the apostles’ preaching of the gospel and truth, human society has been gradually reformed. As a result, human society will eventually become a utopia, a world of bliss. This kind of teaching was quite prevailing in the nineteenth century. At that time, Darby took the lead among the Brethren to refute it. Thus, Brethren teaching is in conflict with reformed theology.<p>Many of the Bible scholars of Europe and America acknowledge that Brethren theology is the top fundamental theology with the most fundamental truths. These are the very truths that we have received. The reformed theology asserts that the Lord Jesus will not come back because human society will be reformed and eventually become a utopia through the spreading of the gospel and the teaching of the truth. They do not acknowledge that the believers have two natures, the new nature and the old nature, an old man and a new man within them. They think that the new man comes out of the improvement of the old man. This way of thinking, eventually leads to not believing in regeneration. Thus, over the years the gap between reformed theology and fundamental theology has become greater and greater.<p>Although this school of thought was very popular in the nineteenth century, the belief in a so-called utopia was almost completely demolished by the war in Europe that lasted for four years beginning in 1914. From that time onward, this school of thought has declined and, for the most part, been replaced by the study of biblical prophecies concerning the second coming of the Lord Jesus. Nevertheless, despite its decline in Europe, this school of thought still gradually spread to America, especially in the area around Chicago.<p>Of the two books which attacked and slandered the Lord’s recovery in the worst way, one was written by someone who is of the school of reformed theology. The two groups which published these two books were originally one group. After the original group divided into two, one group remained in fundamental theology, not in the high-class fundamental theology, but in the reformed theology. It was this group that put out The God-Men to oppose the Lord’s recovery. Those who were in the other group did not agree to remain in fundamental theology, so they had another start and founded the Evangelical Orthodox Church. They appointed themselves “bishops” and purchased “bishops’ robes.” This second group put out The Mindbinders to oppose the Lord’s recovery.
