   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Each Attendant Having Something</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Minister to the Others in the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of us should learn how to have something to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every day in the morning we should read and pray-read two or three verses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then during the day we can practice speaking these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should learn to speak even if no one is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can speak to the desk, the window, the table, and the entire creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to speak again and again what we have read and pray-read in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more we learn to speak, the more we will have to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not speak throughout the day, we will have nothing to speak when the meeting time comes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The time to prepare ourselves to speak is not merely right before the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must prepare ourselves throughout the day in the easy way by speaking the verses we read in the morning during the entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If this becomes our practice, we will have something stored within us when we come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You do not need to speak too long when you share in the meeting about one to three minutes at most is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not sufficient for you to stand up and say, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah! and sit down.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Occasionally this is acceptable, but not frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Learn to take the verses you have enjoyed in the morning as a base for your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You do not need to memorize the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just speak according to their content.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe you will have something to speak if you put this into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose the verses you have enjoyed in the morning are the first two verses of Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse one says, The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you would speak this verse during the day, you will have something when the time for the meeting comes in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the meeting you can say, Dear saints, our Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of David and the Son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I love Him because He is the Son of David and the Son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By doing this you have begun to learn how to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Try to practice this for four weeks and see how much improvement you will receive in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you speak well, some may appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not be proud of that.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you speak poorly, some may shake their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you are listening to others, on the other hand, learn not to overly appreciate anyone nor to despise anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Practice speaking together with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through your practice you will become a different person, a useful person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Formerly you may have been dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now you will be so bubbling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Formerly you had nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now you will have much to overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A Psalm for Both Singing and Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to 1 Corinthians 14:26, the saints may have five categories of items to minister to others in the meeting: a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A saint may have a psalm for both singing and speaking in a Christ-filled spirit, not only to praise and thank God the Father but also to edify and build up the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Ephesians 5:18-21, psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing but also for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should learn to speak the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hymn #501, O Glorious Christ, Savior Mine, is a wonderful hymn for singing and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should read and study this hymn and learn to speak it privately in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we can come to the meeting and speak this hymn with others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This one hymn will become a marvelous message full of nourishment, revelation, and edification if we speak it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we have to learn not merely to read but to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to sing or speak either a psalm, a hymn, or song in a Christ-filled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must come to the meeting with a spirit filled with Christ to praise and thank God the Father and to edify and build up the attendants.</S>
