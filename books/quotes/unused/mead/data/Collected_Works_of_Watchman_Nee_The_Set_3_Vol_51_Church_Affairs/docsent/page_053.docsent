   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Service Office Being the Instrument</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for Carrying Out the Affairs</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, the service office is the instrument with which the brothers take care of affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From it you can obtain information and find out about different situations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The deacons and deaconesses have things recorded there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Based on their records, you can see what is the situation of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can observe the brothers and sisters, oversee them, and tell them what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Tell the lazy ones that they must labor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Tell the proud ones that they should learn humility.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Step by step, bring them to be attentive to what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brothers, have you seen what is called the work of God?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not merely a matter of preaching from the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We recognize that we cannot do away with the ministry of the word; this ministry is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But you also have to bring every one of the brothers and sisters to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When that time comes we will thank God that He has a way in China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the beginning you need to tell the deacons and deaconesses that when the brothers and sisters come to ask questions, they need to be courteous, polite, and not cold when replying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of these matters are your responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You need to go and carry it out and not let it go by carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You need to be firm and at the same time meek, not letting things go by.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You need to learn to serve in these matters; do not be afraid of troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You need to tell them, "He who transcribes must transcribe well; he who records must record accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If there is a little inaccuracy, you are responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, when the brothers need to retrieve what you have recorded, it will be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You should not handle it carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is God's work.''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you handle things in this way, the lazy ones will have to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not work only six days and rest one day; we work every day, seven days a week.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people are lazy because they put aside other things and use all of their time to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once you are careless, of course, you have nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you mean business before God, you only need to invest an extra hour, and then the church will be built up one day earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you invest an extra hour, pay attention to one more person, ask one more person today you ask five brothers, and tomorrow you ask ten brothers, "Have you done your job?", then, I tell you, the service of the church will be raised up one day earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, we need a very good system and we need arrangements, and on the other hand, we need a record book to write everything down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Finally, you who are the responsible ones need to follow up on people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although there is a business office and a system set up there, if you do not adequately follow up on people to do the work, it is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Never be slack; cause them to see that every one of us needs to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day you will see that all of you have a habit of overseeing each other.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Affairs should be taken care of properly; there should not be only one brother doing things there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Learn to go on together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are clear about God's purpose, you will bow your head before God and worship Him, saying, "Lord, have a way among us so that You can go on!''</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can see that there is only one purpose for all the children of God, that is, to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, there indeed is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May God give us the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>NEEDING TO BEGIN WITH CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Question: How do you motivate all the brothers to work?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Answer: I think that this way still has to begin with consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a new way, and we need to have good arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, we need to show the brothers that the service is the whole church serving, with every member of the Body having its function.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everyone should be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You need to remind them of this one matter and do so emphatically.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You also have to tell them about the matters of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I believe that we also need to pay attention to the matter of selling all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a person does not sell all, his talk of service is false and will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is the need for him to give all he has in order to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the basic thought is that everyone needs to offer all in order to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today God is calling those who belong to Him to come forth and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, everything that we have seen this time will be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It will become merely a viewpoint and a method, and you will find it unworkable as a result.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, it is not a matter of method but a matter of God opening up a way for us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Nevertheless, when we go to speak this matter, we should speak in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not speak in a begging way, as if service is to patronize God and do Him a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we are standing on that ground, we are altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to let the brothers see that their service to God is a high and glorious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today we should by no means live carelessly on the earth as before, but we must follow the Lord in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, we must be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once we are strong, we will cause others to come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to tell them, "Today our occupation is something on the side.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must learn to serve God.''</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The way that we take must be straight, and our tone must be right.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not bring ourselves down to a low level; do not beg people for God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We cannot beg people to believe in God, and even the more, we cannot beg people to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To serve God requires that man come to God to be accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Man needs to believe in God by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Yet what is this that we beg people to believe in God?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today God wants us to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have no choice but to come and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to be very clear about this before God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must see accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we see accurately, then others will see accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everyone must serve God; otherwise, there will be no church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When the brothers and sisters fall prostrate before God, when they crawl to come and serve God, then we will see that what we have talked about is not a difficult matter.</S>
