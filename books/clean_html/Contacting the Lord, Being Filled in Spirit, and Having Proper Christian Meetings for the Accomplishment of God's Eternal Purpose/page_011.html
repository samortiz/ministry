<h2 class="head2">Experiencing Christ, Bringing Christ,<br />
Exhibiting Christ, and Offering Christ</h2>
<p>In addition to abandoning all the things that were foreign to the Scriptures, we knew that we also needed to pray. We prayed much, and gradually the Lord began to lead us to go on in a new way. We began to receive light from the Scriptures concerning the proper way for the Lord&rsquo;s children to meet together. One thing that we began to see was that when the Lord&rsquo;s children come together, they must bring something of the Lord with them to the meeting and offer something of the Lord to God. We also saw that in order to do this, we had to experience the Lord day by day. For example, suppose there is a person whom you cannot love by yourself, but because you experience the Lord as love, you are empowered to love that person by, through, in, and with the Lord. Suppose that you also experience the Lord as patience. Although you are unable to be patient with the members of your family by yourself, you learn to experience Christ as your patience and are able to be patient with them in Christ. If day by day you experience Christ in many different ways, and all the other brothers and sisters do the same, when we come together, we will all have something of the Lord to bring with us. You may come to the meeting with the Lord as your love and patience, I may come to the meeting with the Lord as my peace and joy, and another brother may come to the meeting with Christ as his rest and satisfaction. When we come together, we can exhibit the Christ whom we have experienced, and we can offer our Christ to God. We can do this by offering a prayer or praise during the meeting. You can simply pray, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You. You are so wonderful to me. In these days You are so real to me. By You I can love those whom I would never be able to love by myself, and by You I can be patient with those with whom I would never be able to be patient.&rdquo; This kind of prayer exalts, glorifies, and exhibits the Lord. It also puts the enemy to shame and ministers Christ to the other saints. After you pray, a sister may declare, &ldquo;O Lord, I praise You. You are so real to me. I testify before the principalities and powers in the heavenlies that You are real to me. By You I can do what I would never be able to do otherwise.&rdquo; After this sister prays in this way, a brother may ask all of us to sing a hymn. The hymn may be an old hymn, but since we all have experienced Christ during the week, we can sing it in a new and living way, and as we sing, we can praise the Lord. After we sing a hymn, another brother may stand up and read a passage from the Scriptures and give a short message or testimony. If we meet in such a way, surely Christ will be exhibited and expressed, and all the saints will be strengthened, anointed, and enlightened. Christ will be ministered to all the attendants, and their needs will be met. If an unbeliever were to attend a meeting like this, surely he would be saved. This is the kind of meeting we should have.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament when the children of Israel came together, the Lord demanded that they not come empty-handed (Deut. 16:16). They had to come with their hands full of the produce of their labor. Throughout the year they had to till the ground, sow the seed, and care for their crops so that when the time of the harvest arrived, they could reap an abundance of rich produce from the land. Then when they came together, they brought the produce of their labor. Some brought wheat, some brought corn, and some brought wine. Each brought the firstfruits of his harvest and offered it to the Lord. The people also shared what they had brought with one another and enjoyed it together. Thus, both they and the Lord enjoyed what they brought when they came together.</p>
<p>The experience of the children of Israel is a picture of the proper Christian meeting. The rich produce that the children of Israel brought and offered to the Lord is a type of the all-inclusive Christ. The riches of the good land typify the many riches of Christ. Christ is full of rich produce for us to enjoy. Before we can enjoy Christ&rsquo;s riches, however, we need to labor on Christ day after day. We must till the ground, sow the seed, and reap the harvest. We should not be lazy but should labor on Christ every day. Our hearts are the ground, and Christ is the seed. Every morning we should rise early to till our hearts and to allow Christ to sow Himself into our hearts. If we do this, there will be a spiritual harvest of Christ in our daily living. Christ will be produced in us, and we will be able to live by the produce of Christ within us. In addition, we will also have a surplus of Christ that we can bring to the meetings and offer to the Lord. From Monday through Saturday we labor on Christ; that is, we experience Christ. Then on the Lord&rsquo;s Day we come together with all the saints and bring the Christ whom we have enjoyed. I bring my Christ, you bring your Christ, and we all bring our Christ and offer Him to God. This pleases the Father. This is also a great enjoyment for all of us, for we all enjoy each other&rsquo;s Christ. Meetings like this are wonderful, spiritual, heavenly, and full of Christ.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:26 says that whenever we come together, &ldquo;each one has.&rdquo; The little word <em>has</em> in this verse is full of meaning. It means that everyone comes to the meeting with something. One has a teaching, one has a revelation, one has a tongue, and one has an interpretation. This is the pattern of the New Testament for Christian meetings. The religious services in today&rsquo;s Christianity, however, are not like this. Instead, all the members of the congregation are merely &ldquo;pew-sitters.&rdquo; Everyone comes and sits in the pews, and perhaps only one or two pastors or ministers do everything. This is wrong. This is not a proper Christian meeting. A proper Christian meeting is one in which all the participants bring something of the Lord to exhibit, express, and share with one another.</p>
<p>While there should be no regulations or forms in our practice, we have realized in the past that there are certain things that can help us have a proper Christian meeting. One of them is to sit in a mutual way, facing one another. We call this having a &ldquo;round table&rdquo; meeting. If I were to invite some brothers to my home for a meal, I would never have them sit one in front of the other, all facing the same direction, the way pews are set up in the services in Christianity. If we were to sit this way while having a meal together, what kind of feeling would this create? I would never ask the brothers to sit this way. Instead, I would ask them to sit around the table so that we could look at and speak with one another. In our meetings it is good to sit in a similar way. Of course, this is not a form, because forms never work, but we have found that sitting in this way can be very helpful to our meetings.</p>
<p>To have proper Christian meetings, we must contact the Lord daily in our private life so that we will be living Christians. Then we must come to the meetings with the realization and understanding that we are coming to exhibit Christ and to share Christ with others. When some hear this word, they may feel that since their Christian life is marked by failure, they have nothing to bring to the meetings. They may feel that they cannot function in the meetings since their experience of Christ is so poor. Even if this is your condition, you must realize that you can still function in the meetings. You can come to the meeting and pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am so poor. I have failed you many times this week. Please forgive me and have mercy upon me. I have come to this meeting with nothing of You.&rdquo; If you come to the meeting and pray in this way, many of the saints may be deeply touched, and tears may come to their eyes. Moreover, you can also pray, &ldquo;Lord, since I have nothing of You, I come to contact You in Your Body and through Your Body. I believe that You have something for me in this meeting.&rdquo; You can pray in such a way, and you can also open yourself to the saints in the meeting and say, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, please pray for me. I have been trying to live the Christian life, but I have failed the Lord again and again. Please pray for me.&rdquo; If you bring your failures to the meeting and open yourself to the Lord and to the Body, your failures will disappear. I once knew a brother who had a very bad temper. He tried very hard to overcome his bad temper, but by himself he continually failed. One day this brother brought his weakness to the meeting and opened to the Body. After that, a wonderful thing happened&mdash;his weakness disappeared. If we experience Christ during the week, we can share our Christ during the meeting, and if we fail during the week, we can share our weaknesses with the saints. We must learn to allow others to bear our weaknesses. If we practice in this way, our meetings will be living, rich, edifying, strengthening, and enlightening.</p>
<p>When we come together to meet, there is no need for us to be formal. Let us suppose that we set the time of the meeting for 7:30 in the evening. It is good to set a definite time for the start of the meeting, but we do not need to be too formal about the time that the meeting actually begins. For example, if one sister arrives at 7:15 and a few brothers arrive at 7:20, they do not need to sit quietly until one of the leading brothers comes at 7:30 and calls a hymn. This is rather formal. If you come at 7:15 and are the first one to arrive for the meeting, you can begin to pray to the Lord quietly. When another saint arrives, the two of you can begin to pray together in a living and prevailing way. You can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, we come together for this meeting. Grant us Your presence.&rdquo; If two of you are already there, you can simply begin the meeting in this way. When others arrive at 7:25 or 7:30, they will sense the presence, anointing, and moving of the Spirit. In everything we do, we must act according to the Spirit in a very fine, divine, and orderly way, but there is no need for us to be formal. We all have the full liberty and freedom to follow the Spirit.</p>
<p>Thus, there are two requirements to having a proper Christian meeting. The first requirement is that all the attendants seek and contact the Lord in their daily lives. We all must learn how to contact the Lord in a living way and must labor to experience Christ every day. The second requirement is that when we come together, we must forget about all regulations, forms, rituals, routines, and programs. If we have a program for our meetings, we will quench the Spirit and kill the spiritual life within us. When we come together, we must abandon all things of religion and do one thing&mdash;exhibit Christ. We do this by expressing, sharing, exalting, testifying, and preaching Christ in a living way to one another.</p>
