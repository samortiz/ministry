Many localities have been out of touch with other localities. There is a real need for fellowship among the ministers. For this reason we are publishing The Ministers with the hope that the brothers will understand what we, as ministers, really are. We also hope to help each other solve problems encountered by the ministers. Finally, we hope that through this publication the brothers will at least know what is happening among the ministers. In these end times everything is solemn. These are more urgent days than we think. May the Lord have mercy upon us.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Watchman Nee<br />May 21, 1948</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S LEADING IN MERCY</h2><p>After World War II, the Lord gathered a small number of co-workers together in Shanghai. We saw that the work in China was scattered and somewhat confused. We felt that we should come together in one central locality to lay a proper foundation before spreading out. Many localities continued to invite us, and we were eager to visit the brothers and sisters whom we had not been able to see for many years; nevertheless, we felt that the Lord was not doing this, and we did not accept invitations from any locality.</p><p>In spite of this constraint, by the end of last year, we felt that we should accept the invitations of the brothers in a few localities in Fukien and Kwangtung provinces. Consequently, we visited them. During that time, our inward burden was not to start any work but to seek fellowship in the Lord with our brothers and sisters in the hope that the grace in the Body could flow in these places. We went first to Hong Kong and met with Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi. Brother Weigh accompanied us in our visit to Canton and Swatow. We stayed for some time in each place and shared the Lord's grace together. Brother Weigh then returned to Hong Kong, and we went to Amoy where we met Brother Chen Ke-san and others. Brother Ke-san accompanied us to Foochow. Foochow, like the other localities, arranged for six large meetings. (Brothers and sisters from the neighboring localities came to these meetings. However, our greater desire was to talk and fellowship with a small number of brothers and sisters.) First, we had a few days of gospel meetings; then some days of edification meetings followed. We also had some private fellowship with a small number of brothers and sisters.</p><p>We had hoped to use the opportunity of our visit in Foochow to go up to Kuling Mountain, where we would stay with Brother Nee for a few days to ask him some questions about our service to the Lord. However, when the co-workers from all the localities heard that we were going to have a meeting with Brother Nee (actually, we were not going to have any meeting, but to have some private talks only), they refused to leave because they deeply desired to attend these meetings. When we realized this, we discussed it with Brother Nee, and he agreed to allow these co-workers to come and listen to our talks. As a result, more than twenty co-workers attended these talks.</p><p>The talks began on February 26. We had a morning and an afternoon session every day. At the beginning of the morning session on the third day, Brother Nee asked me, "What should we talk about today?" I felt that I should ask him concerning a certain matter, so I said, "We have visited a few localities in the Fukien and Kwangtung provinces, and we feel that the work in every locality is scattered and somewhat in disarray. How should the work in these two provinces be carried out in the future?" He did not say much in his answer. I asked him further, "According to the Bible, are there regional distinctions in the work?" He said, "There are." I followed up with another question: "Since there are regions to the work, are there also centers to the work?" He said, "There are." Following this, he opened up the principle of Jerusalem to us. The gist of what he said is as follows: "God's way was to concentrate His workers in Jerusalem to save people and establish the church. Then men were sent out from Jerusalem to Samaria and to the ends of the earth. When we read the command, `Be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and..Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth' (Acts 1:8), we thought that the twelve apostles were to preach the word in Jerusalem, then in Samaria, and then in the uttermost part of the earth. However, what the Holy Spirit actually worked out was for the twelve apostles to preach in Jerusalem, and the people they gained to go out and preach in Samaria. After churches were raised up in Samaria, the apostles would go out to strengthen them, but it was the many believers who spread the preaching to the uttermost part of the earth.</p><p>"We know that the principle of Antioch which we saw in 1937 is correct. However, it is insufficient to have the principle of Antioch before we have the principle of Jerusalem. Our failures in the past years lay in our neglect of the principle of Jerusalem in our work. We should have concentrated the co-workers within a region in one place first and worked until the church in that place was completely established. Then we could migrate from there to other localities (or be scattered to various places through the Lord's arranged persecutions). Churches should be established in this way. Peter should work in Jerusalem, while Philip should work in Samaria. After these places were established, there could be a beginning in Antioch."</p><p>The co-workers who were present at that talk became clear about this principle. They were willing to lay aside their own work and have a fresh start in Foochow. They took Foochow as their Jerusalem and were willing to begin from there. As a result of this fellowship, the entire body of co-workers "handed over" themselves.</p><p>A few responsible brothers from Foochow were present in that meeting. They expressed their willingness to "hand over" the church there and allow the co-workers to take charge for the going on. Later a meeting for all the brothers and sisters was called on March 3, in which the responsible brothers formally "handed over" the meeting and our co-workers formally accepted it. In this way the work and the church in Foochow had a new beginning.</p><p>Before we went to Brother Nee for our talk, we had already invited him to come to Shanghai in March and April to render some help to the brothers and sisters who had come to Shanghai from other localities. (Some brothers and sisters had earlier informed us by letters that they would be in Shanghai during that time to receive help.) After our stay with Brother Nee, he accepted our invitation. Therefore, in April we had meetings in Shanghai. In those meetings the brothers and sisters also saw the same light, and they gave themselves and all they had for the coordination in the service of the Body. We really thank the Lord for His mercy on us! May all these matters be found pleasing to Him!</p><p>Witness Lee<br />June 14, 1948<br />In Shanghai</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
