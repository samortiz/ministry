God's work seems to be different outwardly in every age; actually, it is absolutely the same in principle inwardly
The Old Testament age and the New Testament age are absolutely different, and God's work in the two ages is different
Surprisingly, however, those whom God has passed through and worked on have had different outward manifestations
Intrinsically, however, the principle, way, content, and purpose of God's work are absolutely one and the same
God worked in Christ, in the apostles, and in the spiritual saints throughout the ages, and He is working in us also
What God did in Job, David, John, Martin Luther, and George Muller was outwardly different but inwardly the same
If we read the book of Daniel without seeing Daniel's character, it will be difficult for us to understand the content of the book
If we do not know the characters of Isaiah and Jeremiah, it will be difficult to understand the contents of the books they wrote
Not only the New Testament reveals that we are in Christ, but even the Old Testament reveals the same principle
When God worked Himself into George Muller, what was manifested through him was the establishing of orphanages
When God worked Himself into Charles Spurgeon, what was manifested through him was the powerful preaching of the gospel
When we say that God's work in recent ages has been to build His church, our understanding may not be precise enough
When God came to Job in the Old Testament Job was touched by God and in him there was a manifestation an operation which produced a result
In the past two thousand years those who have paid attention only to how God works have been destined to fail and err
The New Testament clearly shows that God desires to work Himself into us, yet this matter is beyond our natural thought
Although God's desire is to work Himself into man, very few in the last six thousand years have been willing to allow God to do so
To teach people the proper consecration is to help them to see that the great God desires to pass through man and issue out of man
If you are willing to let God work, there will definitely be a day when God will have a manifestation through you
In the universe God has always had a spiritual operation a spiritual work which is initiated by Him and then answered and accepted by people
According to this principle, no Christian can truthfully say that he does not have any call, demand, or feeling from God
After people are saved, they are touched by the Lord for the first time and know that it is the Lord's calling
When others receive a call, they answer it right away, and when they receive light, they follow it immediately
Conversely, there are Christians who do not have a single hole; they are like walls of brass and iron, being completely in darkness
Some boast that they love the Lord, but in their daily life they do not answer God's call but rather ignore His voice
Loving the Lord is not a matter of being zealous; it is a matter of touching the Lord from deep within and submitting ourselves to His love
We need to care not about how we behave before Him but about whether we have met Him and have sensed and obeyed His feeling
He may touch us, asking us how we could treat our wife or husband in a certain way or how we could wear certain kinds of clothes
We simply need to care about His demand and what He desires to do within us, and then cooperate with and submit to Him
In the narrow sense, which is perhaps easier to understand, to know the Lord's way in a particular matter is to know the Lord's leading
The meaning of the Lord's way is too broad, but the Lord's leading is something that everyone can easily understand
When a person desires to follow the Lord, he should not say, 'I want to touch the Lord's way,' or 'I want to know the Lord's way'
He makes a few turns on the street, not knowing whether to go south or north and thus asking directions along the way
He walks to the train station, buys a ticket, waits for the train on the platform, and finally boards the train to Kaohsiung
If we simply follow Him everything will be fine but many times we instead like to consider how we should know and understand the Lords way
Since the Lord wants us to follow Him, we should not try to go on ahead of Him, rushing to know or understand His way
Religion is man's belief in and reverence for God; it is man's consciousness that there is a God and his consequent desire to worship Him
According to the common concept, people often ask, 'What is the difference between Christianity and religion'?
We also can explain this by saying that those who truly believe into Christ are Christians, not followers of the Christian religion
It is wonderful that in the entire Bible, whenever a person has contact with God, it is always because God has contacted him first
After seeing a vision, Jeremiah rose up to prophesy to the Israelites the words that Jehovah had commanded him
Figuratively speaking, many people today hang the sign 'Christian' outside, but they are engaging in a religious enterprise inside
A Christian is one who has Christ stirring within him through the Spirit and who thus becomes restless and has no choice but to serve God
A religious person, on the other hand, is one who initiates his service to God, desiring to do many things for God
When you calm down in this way, the Lord will have the opportunity to let you know little by little how to act and how to submit to Him
In your heart you will sense the Lord's heart's desire; then you can continue to fellowship with the Lord and be moved by Him further
From the first day Paul met the Lord, he learned a lesson, realizing that all the things he did formerly were merely religious activities
The Lord's way is a great and broad expression, but as we follow the Lord, we will gradually understand it in our experience
Please remember, it is not by our aspiring to be Moses that we can be Moses, nor is it by our aspiring to be Paul that we can be Paul
The Lord said, 'Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself; sufficient for the day is its own evil'
To speak is to attempt to solve the problem; if he is reasonable and agrees to back down, you should give him three dollars
The Lord may use a very wonderful way to lead someone to escape persecution, but He may use persecution to kill someone else's naturalness
If a difficulty were to befall you today, it would be useless to complain that it was caused by a certain person
Our fear should be that we would depend on ourselves, on others, or on methods and thus break our fellowship with the Lord
Once God's word is spoken, the Holy Spirit speaks God, life, and His word into you, along with repentance, faith, and prayer
On the second level, however, the speaking may be carried out with the exercise of the spirit and through the spirit
As the brother is speaking in this way, his spirit moves so that not only his voice but also his spirit enters into people
Once a word spoken with the spirit enters into a listener, there is always a power that enables him to submit without his own effort
After they believed in Jesus, however, they were inwardly compelled to consecrate themselves and give up their future
Question: In recent days many religious activities and even many heretical and confusing things have happened in the church of God
From the very beginning of the two thousand years of church history, the church has had these kinds of problems
What Paul said does not mean that he approved of such a situation rather he showed that he was not walking on the way taken by his opposers
Religious confusion has not come in only today; rather, when the church began two thousand years ago there was already confusion
Before the departure of the first generation of apostles, the situation of the church had already become corrupted because of human weakness
On the other hand, those who had unclean hearts and impure motives had their own way apart from the Lord's way
In the beginning of the fourth century the church on the earth had evolved into the situation of the Roman Catholic Church
As early as the fourth century, under the new Roman government there was already a group of believers who rose up to protest
These believers purely followed what was recorded in the New Testament and walked in the footsteps of the apostles
In every age in the past two thousand years there were many who loved and feared the Lord and who saw that they belonged only to Christ
We should not call ourselves by the name of Wesley nor should we call ourselves by the name of Luther we should use only the name of Christ
In the last two thousand years there has always been a group of Christians who desire no other name but the name of Christ
If you show people your photograph, they may not know who you are, but once you give them your name, they immediately know who you are
In the Old Testament, Proverbs 18:10 says, 'The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; / The righteous man runs into it and is safe'
For this reason, when we were raised up in China over twenty years ago, our meetings were called meetings in the Lord's name
How can we know the way of the Lord's testimony, and what should our attitude be toward those who take another way?
We accept both the Old Testament and the New Testament and we accept all the words of the Bible including every sentence verse and chapter
When we examine a Christian group, first we must use the name as a test, and second we must use the Bible as a test
In terms of the Bible, the Presbyterian churches do not measure up; in terms of themselves, they have added something more
We cannot emphasize anything that is less than the truth in the Bible nor can we emphasize anything that is more than the truth in the Bible
Since they do not have the life of Christ, we cannot partake of their bread, nor can we say that their so-called communion is in Christ
If they consider themselves independent, they become a sect by declaring their independence from all the other churches
No matter how right you are, how good your ideas are, or how effective your methods are, the ground has already been taken by others
Perhaps some of the brothers and sisters in Taipei would fight for me, saying, 'How can the brothers treat Brother Lee this way?
He is truly a child of God and our brother, but he is standing on the wrong ground, which we can neither acknowledge nor participate in
Question: We have the heart to serve God, but our condition and qualifications are insufficient; what should we do?
We know that Paul was a very talented leader who could have done something great in the world yet he worked with his own hands to make tents
When the Lord made provision for him, he did not need to make tents, but when there was no provision, he humbly made tents as his livelihood
Although we do not have the call of Saul of Tarsus or Peter, please realize that God calls us in the same way that He called Saul and Peter
Apparently, the Lord's calling of us might not have been in the same way as His calling of Saul or Peter, but we have sensed the Lord's call
For now, it does not matter whether it was great or small and whether this call was strong or weak; what matters is only that it was clear
We are the ones who suffer, who are dealt with a little more, beaten a little more, and put under pressure a little more
Conversely, everyone who was pure in heart in following the Lord bowed his head at the end of his course and thanked and praised the Lord
If we desire to be worldly people, we should be worldly people absolutely; if we desire to be Christians, we should be Christians absolutely
When you sense in your spirit that God wants you to be broken in a certain aspect, you need to accept His breaking
When you are touched on this side, you roll to the other side; when you are touched on the other side, you roll to this side
Regardless of the light you have received, you can always roll away with a 'nevertheless' and then roll back with a 'but'
Some saints have been before the Lord for many years but have never been dealt with and have never submitted themselves
It seems that they really mean business to take the Lord's way, but whenever they encounter a demand, they roll away
We have only a small fear of obeying wrongly and thus offending God; our great fear is that if we obey wrongly, we might have sufferings
Answer: Many Christians have the question of how to know whether a feeling is given by God or a leading comes from God
In other words, before it becomes His leading, the sense that God gives us in our spirit must become our understanding in our mind
We can see that sometimes our thought is simply our thought but at other times our thought is the result of Gods feeling passing through us
The sense that God gives is from our spirit and goes through the understanding of our mind to make it a spiritual mind
Wherever your circumstances arrange for you to be, you should simply remain there and not be concerned with whether or not it is right
Someone who is wrong in principle but right in reasoning may be compared to a blind cat that catches a dead mouse
To be right in principle means that in our heart we want only God and that we therefore obey any feeling that comes from God
Before the Lord Jesus came to the earth, man's knowledge concerning God could be compared to drawings of cakes on paper
We must see that grace and reality are one and that there is no difference between a living of grace and a living of reality
After frequently having this kind of struggle and exertion you will gradually come out of this stage and enter into the stage of spontaneity
Gradually, as a person practices to ride a bicycle, he spontaneously rides faster and faster and more and more steadily
When you come out of the struggling stage and enter into the stage of living by a spontaneous law you will be living in grace and in reality
The question you should ask is: How can one come out of a life of struggle and self-effort and enter into a living of spiritual spontaneity?
The answer to this question is that you need to have all your spiritual struggles interwoven with life and joined to life
The Spirit, together with the Word, touches and enlightens him, enabling him to speak for eight days consecutively
That which requires effort is a gift; however, that which does not require a second thought but rather comes out spontaneously is a ministry
The Bible says that as Moses was educated in the palace in Egypt, he was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians
Many young brothers and sisters today, however, have been saved, revived, and called before graduating from university
In the future this world-loving believer will not go to hell, and in the meantime he has a university education and a Ph
No matter how you try to persuade them, they will always tell you to do your own accounting and let them do theirs
For those believers who plan to live in the world, studying in a university is not a problem but rather has many benefits
There are even some people who believe in Jesus after hearing a gospel that includes salvation and success in the world
Another kind of person who has no difficulty studying in a university is a believer who consecrates himself absolutely
If God gives him permission to study, he studies diligently; if God does not permit him to study, he stops his studying
If God allows him to become successful in his studies, he is successful; if God does not allow him to be successful, he is not successful
On the other hand, he also feels that if he does not consecrate himself absolutely, he will be troubled within
To those who consecrate themselves absolutely, nothing is a suffering because they consider everything as God's arrangement
He chose to be illtreated with the people of God considering the reproach of the Christ greater riches than his position and future in Egypt
When we go to a store to buy something, we always count the cost, considering whether it is too expensive or whether it is worth the price
Question: If our consecration is due to the church's arrangement, does this arrangement represent spiritual authority?
In other words, the church's arrangement should be but a spiritual confirmation of whatever the Holy Spirit is doing in you
On the other hand, you should not care only for the church's arrangement without asking the Lord what His will is
Even if the churchs arrangement is wrong as long as your heart is to submit to the Lords authority you will still learn a valuable lesson
In order for you to progress, there is an authority in you that causes you to lose your opinions; it causes your self to be broken
When someone who is not spiritual makes the arrangement, we find ourselves unable to submit; our self comes out immediately
Some people are truly unclear and therefore can decide only according to what the environment or the church says
Of course, this is the right thing to do, but from the standpoint of your spiritual condition, this is not so good
From the time man fell and sin entered into the world, God told man to eat meat and kill animals as sacrifices
God says that, in principle, redemption requires the killing of animals, but Satan says that we should not kill animals
The religion created by Satan teaches moral cultivation, which depends on works; therefore, this religion advocates vegetarianism
Christians depend only on the blood of Christ for the forgiveness of sins ; based on this, Christians eat meat
Religion discourages people from eating meat and encourages people to eat only vegetables; this is Satan's idea
If these two kinds of persons are praying in the same room, when we enter the room, we will sense a chaotic situation
Answer: The Bible says that we should not drink any kind of blood except our Lord's blood because only the Lord's blood can save us
For these meetings we should unconditionally submit ourselves to the Lord, open to the Lord, and allow the Lord to freely move and lead us
We also need to be led to pray, whether in the meetings or in private, for a certain one or a few individual saints
We are looking to the Lord that He would lead us in this matter; therefore, we should pray specifically for this
Concerning the Lord's work, we do not want to initiate any kind of movement or stirring up; that is the world's way of doing things
We do not wish to follow the way of the worldly people, and even less do we wish to initiate any work by ourselves or stir up any matter
We must once again answer His call and say before Him Lord we are willing to place our lives and our futures unconditionally in Your hands
If He cannot work thoroughly in this matter, regardless of how much we pray and hope, He will still have no way to go on among us
After Isaiah saw the Lord, he had a desire before the Lord, and for this he beseeched the Lord to send people out to speak and work for Him
On the day of Pentecost approximately one hundred and twenty were praying for the Lord's kingdom and looking to the Lord
The Lord did not choose or call people outside this group, nor did He thrust out or send others to work for Him
After they prayed before the Lord, the Lord's burden and commission fell upon them, and they picked up this burden without any excuses
We cannot expect that the Lord will choose others outside of us; this is not in keeping with the principle in the Bible
In terms of the churches in the countries of Southeast Asia today, Manila is the center; it is an important place
When the spread reached a certain extent, Antioch was gained, and only then could there be a spread to the Gentile places
Church history shows that the Lord's work was able to spread in all directions only after He had completely gained Rome
If the church here does not allow the Lord to gain it thoroughly, the Lord's work will not have the way to spread much
We need to ask the Lord to give us a definite leading concerning the spread of His work in the Philippines, a country of islands
May the Lord grace us so that some among us will rise up, receive this burden, and go to the different parts of the Philippines
Some may go to the Chinese and others may go to the Filipinos for the preaching of the Lords gospel and the producing of the Lords churches
There are already meetings in all these places, but they need to be strengthened, and the Lord's work needs to be formally initiated
In our prayers we need not only to pay attention to these four main matters but also to see that within them there are many detailed items
People in the world are all earning money for their family, doing business for their children, and making plans for their own future
Of course, we deeply believe that if the Lord performs a miracle, He can work things out, but the Lord must use man
If there is merely a gospel work but not the administration carried out by the elders, there is no way for a church to become strong
If the elders' administration is not proper, the work ahead will be easily shaken and dragged down, and there will be problems later on
If the administration in the churches is strong locality by locality the work ahead will not be dragged down but rather will be strengthened
If there are problems in Taiwan, we will not be able to go forward; we will only be able to take care of the existing churches
Such young people must be raised up by the Lord as a group willing to be led trained and have a part in the coordination of the Lords work
Such people all have the heart to pursue spiritual things, the burden to consecrate themselves, and the desire to serve the Lord
May the Lord have mercy on us that in these days we would pray for these nine points, praying and waiting on Him again and again
We look to the Spirit of the Lord to move freely and work particularly so that our meeting will be filled with Him
In our gathering at this time we do not want to encourage any of you to do something, nor do we want to propose something
Rather, we have a burden before the Lord and desire to come before God with all the saints to wait and fellowship together
Perhaps He desires to entrust us with the burden of spreading the work so that we will spread His gospel in every part of the Philippines
Perhaps He desires to give us an even broader commission to spread His work in every country and region of Southeast Asia
We are simply looking to the Lord to manifest His desire and have His own way among us to attain the goal that He wants to attain
We have clearly seen that for God's plan in eternity past to become His accomplished goal in eternity future, it must pass through man
When the Lord ascended two thousand years ago, He wanted the disciples to preach the gospel in the whole inhabited earth
Although twenty centuries have passed, until today the gospel has not been preached in the whole inhabited earth
For the past two thousand years it has seemed that the Lord is not omnipotent; many times it seems that there are things He cannot do
God is willing but man is unwilling God desires to move but man would not move God desires to spread but man does not think it is necessary
It seems that it has started, but then it stops; it seems that it has begun running, but then it slows down again
The church in Manila has been here for over twenty years, yet until this day the gospel has not gone forth from us very much
From Genesis to Revelation the entire Bible shows the principle that no one ever seeks out God; rather, it is God who seeks out man
The reason God desires to gain man is that He loves man; the reason He loves man is that He desires to gain man
The Lord Jesus came not only to be the Savior to save sinners but even more to be the Bridegroom to marry His beloved bride
What God loves the most is that man can be His counterpart, His companion, being of the same mind as He and walking with Him
The God who created and redeemed man is the universal Bridegroom, and the bride is the man whom God created and redeemed
God needs man; He needs to gain man as His counterpart, as one who is of the same mind as He and is willing to be His co-worker
If the Lord cannot gain a group of people in the Philippines, His gospel and work will have no channel on earth
We live before Him and in Him, and at the same time He has found a way, a channel, and a bridge in us for Him to be lived out through us
Conversely, if we are all closed toward God, ignoring God, not answering God, and putting God aside, God will have no way to advance
In the Bible those who served God usually not only prayed but also fasted, and it was during these times that the Lord appeared to them
May we all receive the burden to pray, opening our spirit to the Lord so that the Holy Spirit can find a channel
At the same time, we must give the Holy Spirit absolute freedom and remove all the hindrances so that our spirit can be uplifted
Since this is the case, we need to consider what influence God has on our life and what His relationship is to us in our living
The Bible shows that the relationship of God with man is so crucial that any time man leaves God and does not have God he will have problems
The meaning of being independent from God is that one loses God in his living; he loses his relationship with God in his life
If we do something in this way, no matter how well we handle the matter, God considers it to be a sin because we are independent from Him
Man did something by himself; there was no element of God, no relationship with God, and nothing of God's influence
If it is done with the element of God, in a relationship with God, and under God's influence, it will definitely be good and proper
Many times something may appear to us to be good on the surface, but actually it has the element of sin within it
If we are put in a slightly higher position, we become proud; if we are put in a slightly lower position, we complain
If others treat us with pride, we are not able to handle it; if others treat us with humility, we still are unable to bear it
Anyone who drives a car knows that for the car to go faster or slower, there is the need for the driver to regulate the car
If a husband and wife do not have God's balancing and regulating, their marriage relationship will be both unpleasant and dangerous
Those who contact these poor saints do not sense a flavor of deprivation but smell the fragrance of God within them
Rich people are extravagant, indulge in pleasure, and waste their money because they are empty and do not have God as their inner regulation
Because they belonged to God, they brought this matter before the Lord to inquire whether God was happy with their plans
After they had prayed a little before God, they immediately felt that what they were planning to do was excessive
Whenever we encounter something unpleasant, we must bring it before God; then we will immediately experience God coming in to balance us
It was summertime, and after we had used our strength to climb up to the top of the mountain, we were covered with sweat
The cart did not have brakes, and although the man pulling the cart tried to stop it, he was not able to do so
If Christians do not allow God to be their center, they will go to an extreme when they encounter joy or sorrow
If the food tastes good, they complain that there is too little; if it tastes bad, they complain that there is too much
The only way is to turn to God and wait awhile, allowing Him to balance us whenever we are about to lose our temper
Even in trivial matters in our living, such as our attire, we should have God within us regulating, balancing, and passing through us
If the way we dress is before God, our dress and attire will be balanced and able to benefit others and cause them to be blessed
Sometimes our fashionable attire, which we think is very attractive, actually causes others to feel uncomfortable and uneasy
On one hand, this young woman was very sad, for she had truly been touched; on the other hand, she was very angry
She went home venting her anger and crying, and she prayed, 'O God, You do not look at the outward appearance; You look at the heart'
If a person is balanced by God, whether in joy, anger, sorrow, or delight, his living will be smooth and relaxed
When he had arranged the furnishings in his new house, he invited his elderly father to come and inspect the situation
If the element of God is in our determination, we will require whatever we do, even the furnishing of our house, to have God in it
Even though a person may be joined to many good things, if God is not balancing him inwardly, his situation will be very dangerous
If a Christian has God as his center, his manner and attitude will be normal and proper, and his actions and conduct will be appropriate
Conversely, if we do not take God as the center in our occupation, we can potentially harm ourselves, our society, and our country
At least once we should pray to God thoroughly, offering ourselves completely to Him and allowing Him to be the center of our life
He has been saved to the extent that he is not only saved within, but even his face expresses God's salvation without
All the brothers and sisters who have attended the recent training should realize that spiritual matters are not shallow and simple
We should not be proud because of what we have learned; rather, what we have heard and learned should cause us to be humble
In addition to this, we should be lowly before those whom we serve, accommodating ourselves to them in every matter and in every aspect
We should absolutely be lowly and accommodating toward others, and we should humble ourselves and not become proud because of what we know
In serving the church we should lower ourselves and not be proud in anything, but we should never lower our moral character
Wherever the Lord has arranged for us to serve, we should serve singleheartedly, serving the saints and the sinners
We must come to know our position in the coordination with the saints; we must come to know the order among the saints
After coming to know the order and learning who is above us, we must immediately pray and place ourselves under that person's hand
Those who serve as authorities should take the matter seriously, and those who are under authority should submit to it from their heart
Whether we have served in the church for one, two, three, or many years, we still must learn not to serve in a random way
On the other hand, we should be led by the Lord to see which brothers and sisters particularly need care and contact at the present time
We need to determine whether they are suitable for the preaching of the gospel, for serving as deacons, or for the ministering of the word
Regardless of whether our service is in ministering the word or visiting people, we should all serve in a well-planned way, not aimlessly
We should all pray before the Lord properly that each one of us can find our part in the work and faithfully do our part
In this way we will have good results, whether we serve in edifying the saints, in visitation, or in the gospel
If, however, we have much learning and experience and we need all our time to minister to others, then undoubtedly we should serve full time
In deciding whether or not you should hold a job, you should not act individualistically but should be in fellowship
If all the brothers and sisters feel that you should serve full time, and you also feel the same way, then you should serve full time
If even one of these three requirements is not met, you should hold a job, but this should not change your burden or your service
If we are clear that the Lord does not want us to hold a job, we should drop our job and go on boldly in faith to serve the church properly
One situation is that some serve the Lord full time, and another is that some do business properly for the Lord's work
Another situation in between the first two is that some do not need the supply of others but they do not have much capacity to supply others
In this matter we do not want to have any definite arrangements, and even less do we want to have any kind of organization
