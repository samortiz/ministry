   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>T. Joram Begetting Uzziah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 1:8 says, "Joram begot Uzziah."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Compare this record with 1 Chronicles 3:11 and 12, which say, "Joram his son, Ahaziah his son, Joash his son, Amaziah his son, Azariah" who is Ozias or Uzziah 2 Kings 15:1, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew omitted three generations which are found in 1 Chronicles Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This must have been due to the evil marriage of Joram to the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, which corrupted his descendants 2 Chron 21:5-6; 22:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ahab was the king of the northern kingdom, and his wife Jezebel was a wicked woman who was fully related to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because she was one with the Devil, she corrupted her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They brought forth a daughter, and Joram, one of the kings of Judah, married her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This woman taught Joram to worship idols, to be one with the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus their family was corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Exodus 20:5, three generations of Joram's descendants were cut off from the generation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Exodus 20:5 says that anyone who forsakes God and worships idols corrupts himself and will suffer God's curse for three or four generations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, three generations of King Joram were cut off from the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here we must learn a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we would be associated with Christ, we should never be involved with anything related to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is a jealous God and He will never tolerate idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>U. Josiah Begetting Jeconiah</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew 1:11 says, "Josiah begot Jeconiah."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Compare this record with "the sons of Josiah...the second Jehoiakim...and the sons of Jehoiakim; Jeconiah his son" 1 Chron 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One generation Jehoiakim was omitted from the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This must have been because he was made king by Pharaoh of Egypt and collected tax for Pharaoh 2 Kings 23:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because he was so closely related to Egypt, he was excluded from the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Egypt represents the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From these two records we see that anyone who is related to idols or associated with the world will be excluded from the generation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>V. The Captives to Babylon</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who were carried away to Babylon as captives Matt 1:11-12 were indirectly related to Christ through their descendant Joseph's marriage with Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even these captives are included in this sacred record of Christ's genealogy because they had an indirect relationship through Mary, the mother of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>W. Jeconiah</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jeconiah was not reckoned as a king in this genealogy because he was born during the captivity and was carried away as a captive 2 Chron 36:9-10, Jehoiachin is Jeconiah .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the prophecy of Jeremiah 22:28-30, none of Jeconiah's descendants would inherit the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All of his descendants were cut off from David's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Christ had been a direct descendant of Jeconiah, He would not have been entitled to the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although Jeremiah 22:28-30 says that all the descendants of Jeconiah are excluded from the throne of David, the next chapter, verse 5, says that God will raise up a branch to David, a King who will reign and prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This Branch is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This prophecy confirms that Christ will be the descendant of David, although not a direct descendant of Jeconiah, and will inherit the throne of David.</S>
