   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO BE GOD'S VESSEL A. Removing Hindrances and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Emptying Out Oneself</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God desires to gain man so that He can put Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God desires to have such a vessel that can contain Him and express Him here and now.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This may sound very simple, but actually it is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To pour water into a glass is simple because the glass has no will, emotion, or inclination of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you want to pour water into it, it will not object.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you do not want to pour water into it, it will not complain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if you want to pour water into me, it will not be a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because I am a living creature; I have a will, an emotion, preferences, inclinations, choices, a mind, and imaginations, not to mention the many sinful and evil things that are within me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even for us who are serving God, there are so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the case of the unbelievers on the street, it is difficult to have God put within them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the case of us who are serving God, it is likewise difficult to have God put within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore we must empty ourselves, obey God, and consecrate ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Fellowshipping with God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and Walking according to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The meaning of consecrating ourselves to God is not to work for God, but to become God's vessel, and to allow God to fill us up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From morning to evening, are you led by the Holy Spirit in everything you do?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times, we have good prayers in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But soon after that, we find ourselves doing more than a few things contrary to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you measure these things according to the letter of the Bible, these things may not constitute very serious mistakes, but your conscience will condemn you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A voice within will tell you that you have not turned to God enough, that you have not been godly enough, and that you have not obeyed Him enough.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you want to love the Lord, there is no need for you to beg, to fast, or to pray for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The simple thing to do is to receive the Lord into you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not Christians in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are Christians in an inward way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are not Christians according to the biblical teachings and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are Christians according to our inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are such Christians, we will surely touch God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you fellowship with God, you will become God's vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the time, God will fill you up and will shine His light through you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No doctrine can be our way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The most important thing for us to do is to be a vessel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All that God wants is to gain some people who will live before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Zeal, love, and emotional sentiments are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only one thing is useful: to take care of the feeling within moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>C. Not a Result of Teaching,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>but a Result of Living</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, Brother Hwang may hit Brother Hsu on the face one day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps Brother Hsu does not strike back.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you ask him why, he may tell you that the Bible teaches him not to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he says this, he is not a first-class Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should be Christians not by teaching, but by living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Confucius taught people to honor their parents and to love others, but that kind of honoring and love comes out of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today, we do not eat because others teach us to eat, but because we have a taste for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For you to eat rice today is not a decree of the government, but a choice based on your taste.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you ask me why I am speaking on this subject tonight, I will tell you that it is not the Bible that tells me to speak this way, but the inner feeling that tells me to speak this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more I speak this matter, the more I feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the New Testament, there are many passages with the little word "in" in them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many outsiders do not understand what this word means.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I only wish I could go to the streets and shout to people, "I have God in me!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not touch me, for I have God in me!"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man is God's vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's work today is to put Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is God's purpose.</S>
