   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some believe that even in the New Testament some trace of the distinction between oikos and oikia still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They would say, and in this way they may be correct, that oikos in 2:16 has a somewhat broader meaning than oikia in 14:2.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As used in 14:2, oikia may have a more narrow, purified sense than oikos.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should remember that before the Lord spoke about the Father's house, Judas, the false one, had left.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the house in 14:2 is something pure, for it is related to the divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the house, the church, is pure and does not include any false disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is purely the multiplication of the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certainly the many grains of wheat produced by the unique grain do not include any tares.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Judas was a tare, and this tare was eliminated before the Lord spoke the message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the Lord was multiplied in a pure way to become many grains, and among these grains there are no tares.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now all these grains are being blended together to become one loaf, and this loaf is Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Body of Christ, there cannot be any foreign elements.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If Judas had remained, he would have been a foreign element in this organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But such a mixture could not be permitted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father's house is pure, and the grains produced by Christ as the unique grain constitute a pure multiplication of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The important point we are making here regarding oikos and oikia is that by the time the New Testament was written these words were used as synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, it is very difficult to find any distinction between them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, those who insist in holding to the concept that the Father's house in 14:2 denotes a heavenly mansion cannot rightly claim that the fact that different Greek words are used for house in 2:16 and 14:2 proves that oikia in 14:2 refers to some kind of dwelling place in the heavens, whereas oikos in chapter two refers to God's house, the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No, both oikos in 2:16 and oikia in 14:2 refer to the dwelling place of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GLORIFICATION, FRUIT-BEARING, AND THE BIRTH OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen that as the multiplication of Christ, we are His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to John 15:8, the Father is glorified when the branches of the vine bear fruit: "In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why is it that God the Father is glorified when we bear much fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason the Father is glorified through our bearing of fruit is that in fruit-bearing there is the manifestation of God as life from within us, and this manifestation is the Father's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The divine glorification is also related to the birth of the new man in chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The bringing forth of this new man covers a long span of time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This delivery, which is in resurrection, is the multiplication and glorification of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The full definition of this glorification is covered in the five and a half chapters from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the Lord prayed in chapter seventeen, He presented Himself to be arrested, judged, sentenced, and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Gospel of John, the Lord's death was His going away, and His resurrection was His coming to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through His going and His coming, He produced the many grains of wheat, and these grains are His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this glorification the Body is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Body is the Father's house, the Father's house is the vine, and the vine is the new man to express God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the Lord was resurrected, He appeared to the disciples and breathed on them 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way the disciples received Him as the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the pneuma the Lord entered into the disciples and remained with them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to chapter twenty-one, the Lord was even with some of the disciples when they were fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Gospel of John there is no record of Christ's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But Acts, which is written from another angle, speaks clearly of the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John's Gospel we see that the resurrected Christ remains within us essentially to be our life so that we may live by Him to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through this fruit-bearing we continue the Lord's multiplication and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the continuation of the glorification of Christ in the church life.</S>
