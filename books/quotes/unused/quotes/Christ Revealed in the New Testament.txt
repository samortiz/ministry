The following messages were given by Brother Witness Lee in May of 1984 at a Chinese conference in New York City
He is a God-man, in whom divinity was added to humanity, that is, in whom the essence of God was added to the essence of man
The second item of the outline says that the Creator of the universe, the unique God of the heavens and the earth, is the Triune God
In recent years we have investigated and studied the matter and have found out that the word 'trinity' comes from Latin
He said that most theologians in America do not use this term anymore because it is too deep and is too difficult to clarify
Matthew 28:19 clearly says the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but the three have only one singular name
Although the Triune God has the distinction of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, still They cannot be separated; there is still one God
Item five says that He lived and moved according to the Spirit of God and also worked and fought by the Spirit of God
Once the sinner repents to the Father, he is brought back in the Son to the Father, and the Father receives him with His loving hand
Often we say that Jesus Christ died for us, yet we do not realize that the One who died for us is the Son with the Father by the Spirit
It was not just Jesus Christ who died for us; rather, it was the whole Triune God who died for us in the human flesh
Not only so here it does not say that this is the blood of Jesus the Son of Man rather it says that it is the blood of Jesus the Son of God
His unlimited divinity has made the redeeming efficacy of the human blood that He shed both eternal and unlimited
The efficacy of the blood of Jesus the Son of God is universal, eternal, and it is not limited by time, space, or function
He walked into death boldly and without hesitation, and He also walked out of death boldly and without hesitation
The Lord Jesus said, 'Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
Item eleven says that this last Adam who died and resurrected passed through death and resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit
John 20:22 shows us that after the Lord's resurrection He came in the midst of His disciples to breathe into them
He has the essence of God, yet He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years in humanity for God's economy
Finally, He was resurrected from death to become the pneumatic Christ to enter into us who believe in Him, to be our life and essence
In this way we enjoy the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, in us to be with us all the time as our everything
Although the Bible is not for us to reason with, but is rather for us to see, we need to see it without any colored glasses
Many times, although man has all three of the above matters, he looks into the pure, clean word of God with a pair of black glasses
It is through revelation that we can understand with a pure mind and an open spirit the deep truth concerning the Triune God
He said that in the Old Testament, God was the Father; in the New Testament in the Gospels, the Son came, and the Father ceased to exist
For this reason there are three modes of God: the mode of the Father, the mode of the Son, and the mode of the Spirit
When we come to the Gospels, we have seen that while it was the Son that came, He came with the Father and by the Spirit
The Son said that He was never alone because the Father was with Him and He was in the Father and the Father was in Him
He lived and moved by this Spirit, and He worked and fought also by this Spirit for the fulfillment of the Father's divine economy
From His conception, through His birth, and through His living on earth, the Holy Spirit was in Him as life; this is the essential aspect
He worked and cast out demons by this Christ for three and a half years, until He died on the cross, when the Christ left Him
Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called, But now the Holy Spirit art; The Spirit is Thine other form, Thyself to dwell within our heart
In the aspect of God's economy, after the Lord Jesus' baptism, the Holy Spirit was upon Him as His power for three and a half years
In God's existence there are not three successive steps because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are coexistent from eternity
Item number one of the outline says that this pneumatic Christ who is in resurrection breathed Himself as breath into the believers
In His flesh the Lord Jesus could only be among the disciples being with them physically He could not be in them to be with them invisibly
After His death and resurrection, He became the Spirit and, as breath, He could be breathed into them to be with them eternally
By John 20:22, after He breathed Himself as breath into the disciples, He was in them, and He was with them in an invisible way
For this reason, the Lord Jesus stayed with them for forty days to train them to get used to this invisible presence
Acts 1 says that after His resurrection the Lord appeared to His disciples for forty days, speaking to them concerning the kingdom of God
Item number three says that as far as God's essence is concerned, He was still with the disciples by being in them
By the Holy Spirit in them essentially, one hundred and twenty people were able to pray earnestly in one accord for ten days
Item number five says that from now on, those who believe in Him are filled outwardly with His Spirit of power
On the other hand, when you are immersed in the pool, the water does not fill you inwardly, but you are filled by the water outwardly
To be 'full of' the Spirit is a condition of the believers after having been filled inwardly by the Holy Spirit
Both being 'filled' inwardly and 'full of' are for life and are essential, while being 'filled' outwardly is for work and is economical
The Lord Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit's conception, having the Holy Spirit as His essence for His existence
After fifty days, at Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out upon them to be the Spirit of power; this is economical and is for work
At the same time, he can receive the economical Spirit as his outward power to equip him for the Lord's work and testimony
The outward baptism of the Spirit is economical and is for work; the drinking in of the Spirit is essential and is for living
To be saved does not mean merely to be forgiven of sins; nor does it mean merely to be delivered from perdition
Through calling on the name of the Lord, we will receive the essential and the economical Spirit and will receive it even more abundantly
He is also outside of them as the Spirit of power to be preached and propagated by them as His continuation and spread on the earth
In this way we become His continuation and spread and are made His Body to spread His kingdom and to build up His church
Not only do we have to let Christ abide in our hearts, but we also have to let Him make His home deeply in our hearts
We have often allowed Him to stay only in the living room, not giving Him the liberty to go into the other rooms
Has not the Bible said that Christ has ascended on high and is seated at the right hand of God with glory as His crown?
Romans 8:34 says that Christ has been raised from among the dead and is now at the right hand of God, interceding for us
They will be brought into true fellowship with the Lord and will be able to enjoy the overcoming life of Christ
Item number one of the outline says that Christ, the last Adam, passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
The last Adam, which is the Lord Jesus, has passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
In verse 9 we see that this Spirit of life is the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, who is also Christ Himself
He spreads from our spirit to the most important part of our soul, which is the mind, that our mind would also have life
Once at Pentecost and once at the house of Cornelius, God baptized both the Jewish and the Gentile believers into one Body
Item number four goes on to say that this Spirit also becomes the ink with which the all-inclusive Christ is written into us
The more this Spirit writes within us, the more Spirit we will have within, and the more Christ will be expressed
In this way we can enjoy the riches of the Triune God-the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
Not only is Christ living in us, He has to be formed in us, with the result that we would live to God by Him as the Spirit
In this compound Spirit is divinity, humanity, human living, the death on the cross, His resurrection, and His ascension
Not only is He the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit of Jesus; He is even the Spirit of Jesus Christ
At Pentecost when Peter stood up, it was by the economical Christ that he was filled with the power of the Holy Spirit
Today He desires that we cooperate with Him to live Him express Him preach Him and propagate Him that we may accomplish Gods eternal purpose
On the other hand, He is the High Priest in the heavenly tabernacle making intercession for us that we would be saved to the uttermost
On the one hand, the seven Spirits are out from the eternal One, and on the other hand, they are of the redeeming One
His eyes are as a flame of fire searching the churches and, at the same time, supplying all the churches' needs
At the end of every epistle, it says that these words are spoken by the Spirit to the churches and 'he who has an ear, let him hear'
To eat of the tree of life, to partake of the hidden manna, and to dine with the Lord are all matters of enjoying Christ
The tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast in the good land are all types of the rich enjoyment of Christ
Not only so, He will come to take over the earth and will descend in glory to claim the whole earth for His kingdom
Every golden lampstand supports the seven eyes of the Lamb as the seven lamps, shining forth as the testimony of Jesus
These seven lamps who are the seven Spirits in this age will become the lamp which is the Lamb in the new heaven and new earth
Item number eight says that the seven Spirits are the lamps of fire in this age, executing God's New Testament economy
Today in the church age, the seven Spirits are the seven lamps for the shining, activating, and executing of God's New Testament economy
It is by God being in the Lamb that They can sit on one throne because chapter twentyone says that God is the light and the Lamb is the lamp
Today the church is in a dark and confusing age, and Christ is the all-inclusive, sevenfold, intensified Spirit
If we would turn every word that we read into prayer, the words will be in us as the supplying Spirit and the shining light
By pray-reading the Lord's Word and enjoying the supply of the Spirit this way, we will be filled with the Holy Spirit and full of light
The New Jerusalem is the ultimate expression of the church and is built of three kinds of material: gold, precious stones, and pearls
The New Jerusalem bears the nature of God the Father the result of God the Sons redemption and the work of transformation of God the Spirit
The New Jerusalem, composed of these three persons, becomes God's eternal habitation, with God in it as its source
As the One sitting on the throne, He is the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, from whom flows the river of water of life, which is the Spirit
We have the Father as the source, the Spirit as the flow, and the Son as the life supply to meet all the needs of the entire city
By then, the New Jerusalem will have become the full expression of the Triune God, expressing Him forever in eternity future
