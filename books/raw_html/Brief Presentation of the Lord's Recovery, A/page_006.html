<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE RECOVERY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING CHRIST</H2><P>The second major item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In Eternity, Christ Being<br>the Word of God and God Himself</H2><P>In eternity, Christ was the Word of God and God Himself (John 1:1). He was not only the Word of God, but He was also God Himself. John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." The Word was not only with God, but the Word was God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In Time, Christ as the Word of God<br>Becoming Flesh to Be a Man and to Tabernacle<br>among Men, Full of Grace and Reality</H2><P>In time, Christ as the Word of God became flesh to be a man and to tabernacle among men (John 1:14), full of grace (God for men to receive as their enjoyment) and reality (God to be realized by men as their reality).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ Being both the Complete God<br>and the Perfect Man, Possessing<br>the Divine Nature and the Human Nature As Well,<br>to Be the Embodiment<br>of the Fullness of the Godhead</H2><P>Hence, Christ is both the complete God and the perfect man, the Triune God and the tripartite man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature as well, to be the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9).</P>
