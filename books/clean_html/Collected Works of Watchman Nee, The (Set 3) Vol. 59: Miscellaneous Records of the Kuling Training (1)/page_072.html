<h2 class="head1">A DEPUTY AUTHORITY MUST NOT TRY<br />TO UPHOLD HIS OWN AUTHORITY</h2><p>A deputy authority must not try to uphold his own authority. If you think that you can demand obedience, that your position, gift, or power justifies such a demand, you are not qualified to be an authority. If your disposition is such that you want others to obey you, you are not qualified to be an authority; you are not the type of person who can receive submission from others. The result of rebellion, no matter where it occurs and no matter whom it is directed against, is the overturning of God's authority, not a challenge to man's demand. If you are challenged as a deputy authority, you have to realize that others are not offending you; there is no need for you to jump up in defense of yourself. They are offending the authority whom you represent. In reality they are rebelling against God's authority. Whenever rebellion occurs, you should uphold God's authority and grieve for its neglect. As for you, there should be no feeling of personal offense. Whether an offense is directed against you or not, the ultimate challenge is against God's authority. As for you, you must be willing to be set aside. Although the apostles played a leading role in God's work, they were not afraid of being offended in the matter of authority; their prime concern was upholding God's authority. You should never be concerned with rejection. You should have no personal expectation of your own; you are here to uphold God's authority. If anyone has offended you, you should say to yourself, "I am merely a deputy authority; I am also ignorant in many areas."</p><p>If anyone offends God's authority, this offense has nothing to do with me personally; I merely acknowledge the anointing's presence. Except for the fact that God has placed His authority upon me, I have no desire to assume any authority of my own. Others do not have to submit to me. Even when others submit to me, I know that it is because God's authority is upon me. At the same time, when I find God's anointing resting upon a person, I will submit to him. The two hundred and fifty leaders among the Israelites offered incense to God; they sinned and were judged and destroyed. But what happened to the censers? They were not destroyed. God ordered that they be hammered into plates and used as a covering for the altar, because the censers were sanctified already (Num. 16:36-38). This does not mean that the brass of those censers was different from the brass of any other kind of censers. If there is any difference at all, the difference lies in the fact that it was touched by God. Is there anything we have which has not been received from God? If there is any difference between us and others, it is because God's authority is upon us. Other than this authority, we are no different than anyone else. Philemon was the same as Onesimus, and Aquila and Priscilla were the same. Can we say that all masters are better than their servants? Can we say that all fathers are better than their sons? Can we say that all husbands are better than their wives? Why then does God want servants to obey masters, wives to obey husbands, and children to obey parents? He wants this because this is the order of authority He has arranged. This is unrelated to whether or not a person is good or bad. It is God who has ordained everything.</p><p>No deputy authority is self-appointed. I do not choose to be an authority myself. Every one of us has to know that authority is from God. There is no authority that is not from God. If someone obeys us, we have to know that this happens because God has ordained it. The same principle applies to our submission to authority and our acting as the authority to others. All authority is appointed by God. It is a gross mistake for us to think that we are an authority by ourselves or to try to establish ourselves as the authority. It is wrong for any brother to recommend himself as the authority. We should not uphold ourselves. We do not have any intrinsic authority within ourselves. All of man's authority comes from outside of him; God is the One who has appointed him to be the authority. If there is any authority in us, this authority should merely lead others to obey God's authority in us; it should not demand that others obey us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BASIS OF DEPUTY AUTHORITY&mdash;OBEDIENCE</h2><p>Everything about a deputy authority hinges on the kind of obedience he renders to other authorities above him. We must not have any craving to be a deputy authority or any expectation of others obeying us. We should only expect to obey others; obedience should be our very nature. If we are not obedient, we will not feel peaceful or comfortable within. The obedience I am speaking of here is different from the obedience spoken of in other places. Elsewhere obedience is spoken of in a shallow way because the speakers have not touched God's authority themselves. This obedience only touches men; it is not directly linked to God's authority. No matter where we go, there is plenty of opportunity for us to obey and submit. There should be an inner longing within us to look for objects of submission. Love, mercy, and meekness should be our very nature; so should obedience. If a person does not have the opportunity to express his love, he feels unhappy. The same can be said of obedience. Within us there is a longing to submit to others, and as soon as we find the object of our submission, we are relieved and happy. This is to walk according to our very nature. Unless we can express this very nature of obedience, we cannot be entrusted with any authority.</p>
