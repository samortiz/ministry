   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN A WORD OF EXPLANATION CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Date: November 18, 1935, 3 p.m.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Chuenchow</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not too easy to speak about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may need ten days to cover the subject and still not be finished with it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I can only speak a little because of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This does not mean that the Bible only speaks this much about this matter, but I can only make a few miscellaneous remarks here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I cannot go into in-depth research now.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We will continue to pray while we study and ask the Lord to grant us more light along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE OUTPOURING OF EVIL SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning the outward manifestation of the outpouring of the Spirit, many people marvel at extraordinary phenomena.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the past eight or nine years, I have studied this matter and discovered that there are, indeed, strange phenomena recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But extraordinary manifestations are not necessarily a proof of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The scriptural proof of this is in 1 Corinthians 12:1-3.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 1 mentions spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word gifts is italicized to indicate that this word does not exist in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul was not speaking about spiritual gifts, but about pneumatekos, or spiritual inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Men like Govett, Pember, and Panton all agree that it should be translated as being related to spiritual inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This refers to extraordinary acts performed by a person who is possessed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The words led away in verse 2 refer to a sorcery-like spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the original language, it refers to some extraordinary and uncommon leading and seduction; it is supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul wanted the Corinthians to be informed concerning the matter of spiritual inspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we will consider the difference between the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the outpouring of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul did discuss the outward manifestations of these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He understood them, but he did not talk about them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul did not talk about them, yet we have to pay attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is difficult to differentiate the two by their outward manifestations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although they outwardly appear to be the same, there is a big difference inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OUTPOURINGS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BEING THE WORDS SPOKEN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The main difference between the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and that of evil spirits is in the words that are spoken rather than in the gestures of the body or the attitude of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First Corinthians 12:3 says, "No one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether or not a person has received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit can be discerned by the words he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The meaning of the last part of verse 3 is that one can only say that Jesus is Lord when he is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is something that cannot be feigned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a man is not in the Holy Spirit he cannot say that Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who cannot say this have received the outpouring of the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can use this method to test and examine those who say that they have received a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who can say that Jesus is Lord have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who cannot say that Jesus is Lord have received the outpouring of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you ask someone this question, they may walk away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is suspicious.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if a man can say, "Lord, I am not worthy; this is Your grace," he is still in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must not be alarmed by extraordinary phenomena.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If an inspiration is common and ordinary, it is no longer a spiritual inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who have the inspiration of the Spirit are those who have the Spirit in them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As such, they are surely different from ordinary men.</S>
