TO PARTICIPATE IN GOD'S LIFE</H2><P>First, as the God-men we have the divine right to participate in God's life. John 3:15 tells us that everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus will have eternal life. Eternal life is the divine life, the life of God. We are human beings, but we can have God's life. We were created in God's image and God's likeness but without God's life. Through regeneration we have been graced by God with His divine life. Through regeneration He has put, has dispensed, His life into our being.</P><P>Colossians 3:4 speaks of "Christ our life." Since Christ is the embodiment of God, for Christ to be our life means that God is our life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TO PARTICIPATE IN GOD'S NATURE</H2><P>As God-men we also have the divine right to participate in God's nature. Ephesians 1:4 says, "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy." Here we see that God chose us in Christ with a particular purpose&#151;to make us holy. Holy means not only sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything common. God is holy, but we are common. Only God is different, distinct, from all things. Hence, He is holy; holiness is His nature. God intends to make us holy even as He is holy (1 Pet. 1:15-16). To be holy is to participate in God's holy nature. Having chosen us to be holy, God makes us holy by imparting Himself, the Holy One, into our being, so that our whole being may be saturated and permeated with His holy nature. For us, God's chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of God's divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Thus, we may participate not only in God's life but also in God's nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. TO PARTICIPATE IN GOD'S MIND</H2><P>Because we have become God-men through regeneration, we also have the right to participate in God's mind. This means that we, who are human, can have a divine mind. Philippians 2:5 says, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." We need to let Christ's mind be our mind. In this way we may have Christ's mind.</P><P>Ephesians 4:23 says, "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind." The spirit here is the regenerated spirit of the believers, which is mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God. Such a mingled spirit spreads into our mind, thus becoming the spirit of our mind. The more the mingled spirit penetrates our mind, saturates our mind, and possesses our mind, the more our mind becomes like God's mind. This is to make His mind our mind, and this is to participate in God's mind.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Incarnation, Inclusion, and Intensification &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
