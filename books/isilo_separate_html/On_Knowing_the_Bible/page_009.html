We will also consider when it was written and how it was accepted after being written. Although these are only some facts, they are intimately related to us as Christians.<h2 class=head1>I. BEFORE THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Without the Written Revelation of God</h2><p>In the first 2500 years of human history, there were no written revelations of God. There were only His verbal instructions, such as His instructions to the forefathers, including Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In Genesis we see that before the Bible was written, God often appeared to the forefathers and gave them verbal instructions.<h2 class=head2>B. There Being Instructions Handed Down through Oral Tradition</h2><p>Before the Bible was written, although there were no written revelations of God, there were verbal instructions handed down from generation to generation by the fathers. This fact can be proved from inscribed stone tablets discovered in Egypt and Babylon. In 1901, a black pillar was discovered in Persia on which were inscribed some of the laws of the ancient times. Some of them were similar to the Law of Moses, yet it was inscribed five to six hundred years before the time of Moses. This proves that before the Bible was written, among ancient civilizations, there were verbal instructions of God handed down through their forefathers.<h2 class=head2>C. The Ancient Languages</h2><p>If we want to know how the Bible was written, we need to know about the alphabets and languages used by the ancient civilizations.<h2 class=head3>1. Akkadian</h2><p>Before the flood, it is not known what language man used. According to historical research, the earliest language spoken by man after the flood came from Akkad in the northwest region of ancient Babylon and is called Akkadian. The three terms, &#8220;Adam,&#8221; &#8220;Eden,&#8221; and &#8220;Sabbath&#8221; in the book of Genesis chapter two are probably Akkadian and not Hebrew. Akkadian was originally made of lines. These lines were drawn into wedge shapes. Eventually the writing developed into the cuneiform script. This script was used until approximately two thousand years before Christ, about the time of Abraham.<h2 class=head3>2. The Babylonian Writing of the Tribe of Shem</h2><p>From about two thousand years before Christ, the Babylonian writing of the tribe of Shem replaced Akkadian. We believe that this is the origin of the Aramaic language that came later. This kind of writing was used until approximately six hundred years before Christ, at the time Nebuchadnezzar ruled in Babylon.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
