   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The gifted ones being the joints of the life supply in the organic Body of Christ, the other members being the different parts in this organic Body; the two coordinating to build up the Body of Christ organically.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this message, we shall see how the organic Body of Christ needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The growth of the organic Body of Christ is the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the New Testament, there are some mysterious points that are easily missed by readers of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are points that are difficult to grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, in the book of Ephesians Paul revealed the thought concerning the fullness of Christ as the Body of Christ, which is the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he spoke of the church, he said that it is the Body of Christ Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a very profound term.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter four of Ephesians, Paul used another profound word, "the fullness of Christ'' v. 13 . He said that the fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This expression is fully a matter of the eternal and divine life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 10:10 the Lord Jesus said that He came that the sheep may have life and have it more abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most Christians know that life is for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is our life for the purpose that we would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, there is nothing wrong in this realization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Christ enters into us, not only is He life to us to save us, but He is also making us the church through this saving life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not an organization, but an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a matter of outward things, but a matter of an inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church can be compared to the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Outwardly speaking, the human body is composed of all the different organs and members.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It may look like an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, every part of the human body is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the church is not an organization, but an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Look at my ten fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only is every finger joined to me; each one has an organic relationship with me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All of them have a circulation and a fellowship with the blood of the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The whole body is a living organism that is full of the activities of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The wooden stand before me is different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is composed of pieces of wood as an organization; there is no life in them.</S>
