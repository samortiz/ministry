In the coming days many brothers and sisters will have to leave their jobs. In Shanghai we have asked two sisters and two brothers to do this. Brother Hsia Hsi-ling has been working in the customs department for many years. We are asking him to leave that job. In addition, perhaps twenty to thirty brothers and sisters will also have to hand themselves over. Perhaps we will need fifty or sixty brothers and sisters to do this. If they give up their jobs and offer themselves up full-time, their support will be on the shoulders of the brothers who are holding jobs. During the past twenty years, we have not mentioned the matter of money. This platform can testify for me concerning this. But today we are going into business as partners and preaching the gospel as partners. For this reason, the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should work conscientiously, and they should do their best to make money as well as to save money.</p><p>Today we stand on a different ground, and that is why we are not afraid to say something and do something. Today I can pass around my hat to ask for money for a brother. If some have misunderstood what we have said and are no longer willing to offer up everything, you can claim back your consecration slip from Brother Witness after the meeting. There is no need to be shy and no need to be ashamed. We do not force anyone to do anything. But when the brothers come together to discuss matters, and when a decision has been reached, you cannot draw back. Today we are not asking you to be frugal to the extent that you will suffer in your physical health. We are not asking for one-tenth, one-half, or one-hundredth. We are asking you to offer up all that you have except what you need. If you make ten million dollars a month, and you need all ten million, you do not have to offer a cent. If you make only eight million, the church will gladly give up two million to make up enough to meet your need. But if you make eleven million, you can only keep the ten million that you need. You have to offer up the remaining one million. If you make a hundred million, then ninety million will have to be offered up. If you do not do this, you owe these brothers who are giving up their jobs something. We have to learn to bear the responsibility of the gospel together with the brothers. Only by doing this will the gospel spread, and only then will we be able to go on in the way before us.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR THINGS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><p>Concerning the future of the work, there are a few things that we have to pay attention to. In order for God's work in China to be carried out properly, four things are indispensable. The first is that strong messages need to be delivered in the local meetings. The second is that the literature work needs to spread. The third is the need to perfect the young people. The fourth is the need for joint conferences everywhere yearly. If any of these four things are lacking, our work will not be covered adequately. Shanghai and Foochow should maintain very strong message meetings. Then when a person wants to be perfected, he has to come to the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR SUITABLE MEETING HALLS<br />IN DIFFERENT PLACES</h2><p>Furthermore, we need suitable meeting halls. Brother Miao said that he has been to many places and that in no place is the meeting hall as bad as the one here in Shanghai. In the winter it is cold, and in the summer it is hot. When someone gives a message, the audience is spread out over seven or eight different places. The listeners cannot see the speaker, and in some places they cannot even hear the speaking. We have to build a meeting hall that can seat three thousand immediately and that can hold another two thousand if we add another level to it later. In total we need a place that can seat five thousand.</p><p>Many people have been stirred up in Nanking already. Hence, Nanking also needs a meeting hall. In addition, we have to consider how to maintain a strong message meeting in Nanking. Foochow also needs a meeting hall. Presently, the meeting hall in Foochow is very hot in summer, and the windows are on the roof. What the brothers and sisters have offered up in these days is not enough to take care of these three meeting halls.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THE MAGAZINES</h2><p>Before the war we published an average of eighteen thousand copies of The Christian every issue. At its peak we were publishing twenty-one thousand copies. The publication of one magazine alone requires seven hundred million dollars. This is only one magazine. There are three other kinds of magazines. Do not think that it is a simple thing to put out a magazine. As far as an individual is concerned, it is an embarrassing thing to ask for money. But here we are not afraid of misunderstanding. Every month we need much money.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_121.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_123.html">Next</a> </body></html>
