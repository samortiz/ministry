   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING OF HIS FULLNESS, AND GRACE UPON GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 1:14 and 16 say, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us full of grace and reality .For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ came, He was God becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Christ came in time into the human race, He was God tabernacling and dwelling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ dwelt among men, He was full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now Christ has become the Spirit to dwell in us; therefore, we have received the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not that we have received only something, but we have received of His fullness, even grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To receive "of His fullness" and "grace upon grace" is not only to receive of His fullness but also to receive it with grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We praise and thank the Lord that we do not receive only a little, but we receive of His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, we receive not only of His fullness, but we also receive it with grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does it mean to receive of His fullness, and grace upon grace?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let me give you an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, as you are now receiving this message, you may say, "This message is really good; I praise and thank the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yes, you have received some supply, and you can count that as your receiving grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, I cannot say that you have received of His fullness, and grace upon grace, because you still may have some reservation within you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may think that I am too much to say this, but in effect you may be receiving "grace under grace."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why I am so repetitious and why I use many words so that the "film" in the "camera" within you can be sensitized to such an extent that you will keep receiving without reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is to receive of His fullness, grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to receive all that Christ is in fullness and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>ENJOYING THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we receive of His fullness and grace upon grace, that is, when we receive unreservedly and unconditionally, then we experience the Spirit and enjoy the riches of Christ as our bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How is it that the riches of Christ can become our supply?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is by Christ becoming the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ had to become the Spirit of reality for you to receive of His fullness and grace upon grace; the riches of Christ can now become your supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The riches of Christ are indescribable and immeasurable; therefore, the supply of the Spirit must be bountiful, all-inclusive, and inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit supplies you with whatever you need.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is all that you need and desire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of reality in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The bountiful supply of the Spirit of reality is the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The unsearchable riches of Christ are already there; when we receive of them in full and grace upon grace, His riches become the bountiful supply in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The riches of Christ are to be enjoyed by us and are to supply our needs that we may become His fullness!</S>
