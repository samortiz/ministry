   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S CREATION BEING ACCORDING TO A SCHEDULE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s creation is based on a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The phrase there was evening and there was morning is used repeatedly in the record of God s creation Gen 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This refers to a schedule in God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God did not use His almighty power as an excuse to not keep a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God did not create the heavens and the earth and then relax and wait for a good mood to create the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If God s creation occurred in such a casual manner, how many days would it have taken Him to create all things?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read the Bible carefully, we will acknowledge that the first One who kept a schedule was our God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the almighty One, but He is not loose or careless in regard to time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He created according to a precise schedule of six days; moreover, these days were evenly divided into evening and morning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every evening includes twelve hours, and every morning includes twelve hours.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s work of creation was done according to a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our efforts to keep a schedule cannot match God s ability, because He is able to redeem every second.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One of the primary requirements of the training is that people would be in their seats five minutes prior to the scheduled time of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This speaks of our need to keep a scheduled time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some people think that it is easy to arrive on time, but this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although we desire to arrive five minutes early for the meeting on the Lord s Day, we often arrive late.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The training surely has helped because often fewer than twenty, and sometimes no one, arrive late to a meeting now.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The trainees are not late because they must follow the training s schedule, not their own schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a trainee was able to set his own schedule, he would change the meeting time from nine o clock in the morning to ten o clock in the morning so that he could sleep longer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The training also set a rule that whoever arrives late three times will be dismissed automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, all the participants in the training dare not arrive late; they come to meetings in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even traffic conditions are not an excuse for arriving late.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though it takes thirty minutes to get to the meeting under normal traffic conditions, there is always the possibility of encountering a traffic jam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the trainees learn to leave their homes earlier in case they encounter a traffic jam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a need for guidelines and limitations because our human nature is so degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A schedule provides us with some of these needed guidelines.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God relied upon a schedule in His creation, and even the things He created follow a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, human beings are born after nine months of pregnancy according to a schedule, and the harvesting of fruit is according to a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These schedules are set by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He does not allow freedom to produce chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The universe exists because God s creation operates according to a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the earth did not orbit the sun according to a set schedule, it would be impossible to sustain life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The universe has order because God has set a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are God s children, and as imitators of God Eph 5:1 , we should have a schedule related to all matters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without a schedule, time slips away.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to redeem the time, we must have a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Young people often work unceasingly without rest, but when they are finished with their work, they want to sleep unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such a pattern of work will not lead to success.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>People who are successful schedule their time for working, eating, exercising, and resting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is the same with spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to read a set number of chapters or verses in the Bible at a set time in order to maintain this necessary spiritual practice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not read a large number of chapters when we are happy but nothing at all when we are unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>AN ILLUSTRATION OF BEARING FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>ACCORDING TO A SET TIME THE VINE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since we love the Lord, we should keep His laws.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Gospel of John, the Lord likened Himself to a vine and us to branches 15:1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to God s law, a vine bears fruit according to a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I was small, the courtyard of our house contained a small vineyard, and I was able to watch the grapes grow throughout the year.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After several years I realized that the vine produced fruit according to a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In spring the vine would sprout, flower, and produce grapes at nearly the same time every year.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today we are branches in the vine, the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, our ability to bear fruit is unrelated to our mood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should bear fruit according to a set time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is a mistake to rely on mood, and it is not enough to know about truth and life if we do not have a schedule for bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must repent of this and pray.</S>
