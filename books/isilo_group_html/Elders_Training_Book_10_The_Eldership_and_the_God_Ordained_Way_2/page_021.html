To be in the Triune God as our oneness, we need to be sanctified, that is, we need to be separated from being mixed with the world. If we would practice the genuine oneness, we must realize that the world must go. We cannot be mingled with the Triune God and at the same time remain in a mixture with the world. Therefore, we must be separated from being mixed with the world, so that we can be holy unto the Triune God to have a pure mingling with Him. This pure mingling is the oneness. If we desire to realize the genuine oneness, we must be separated from the mixing world unto the sanctifying God through the reality of His sanctifying word.</P><P>In addition to being separated from the world, we need to be kept from the evil one (v. 15). When we were mixed with the world, we were captured by the evil one. Thus, we need to be sanctified from the world and to be kept from the evil one unto the Triune God. Then we will be freed and purified to be mingled with the Triune God, that is, to practice the genuine oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Through the Reality of the Word</H2><P>The oneness of all the believers in Christ is through the reality of the word, that is, through the reality of the processed Triune God conveyed in His sanctifying word (John 17:17). Without the Triune God as the content, the word would be empty. The New Testament shows us clearly that the truth, the word, and the Triune God are one. The word is the truth (v. 17), and the truth is the Triune God (John 14:6; 1 John 5:6b). Hence, the word that is the reality contains the Triune God as its content. To be sanctified by the reality of the word is to be sanctified by the Triune God Himself. The Triune God is the very content of the sanctification. By this we can realize what the nature of this genuine oneness is.</P><P>The genuine oneness, which is the mingling of the Triune God with the redeemed humanity, has three aspects. The first aspect is the oneness in the Father's name by His divine life, and the second is the oneness in the Triune God by His sanctifying word. The first aspect concerns the source and the element of the oneness, and the second concerns the standing of the oneness. If we are in the world and under Satan's hand, we cannot practice the oneness. To practice the oneness, we must be separated from the world and kept away from Satan's hand.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 10: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (2) &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
