   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE LORD BEING A HARD MASTER Scripture Reading: Matt 25:14-15, 24-29; 1 Pet 4:10-11; Rom 12:1-2, 11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before God, a Christian needs to pay attention to growth in life and usefulness in service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are two important matters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>VIRGINS AND SLAVES</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Matthew 25 there are two parables: the parable of the ten virgins and the parable of the master distributing talents to his slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The parable of the virgins is related to life, whereas the parable of the talents is related to service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we live before the Lord, we love Him, pursue Him, follow Him, fellowship with Him, and await His return; in this respect we are all virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to chapter 25, the ten virgins have two characteristics: first, they have oil in their vessels with their lamps v. 4 ; second, they go forth out of the world of darkness to meet the bridegroom v. 6 . Spiritually speaking, a believer should be full of oil, the Spirit, and apart from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should be those who are going out of the dark world to meet our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The parable of the talents is related to our need to be slaves who are faithfully serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are a virgin to the Lord on the one hand, and we are a slave to the Lord on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are a virgin-slave.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to our life, our love for the Lord, and our relationship with Him, we are a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to our service to the Lord and our commission from Him, we are a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should receive His commission faithfully, because He has delivered His possessions to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>RECEIVING A REBUKE FOR BURYING OUR TALENT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The master gave talents in varying amounts, one receiving five talents, another two, and still another one, with the talents being given according to each one s ability v. 15 . In the church we can certainly see this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every person has a different spiritual ability before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some have a greater capacity, and the Lord entrusts more to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Others have less capacity, but the Lord still entrusts something to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Still others have little capacity, but the Lord, nevertheless, entrusts a little to them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the amount that the Lord entrusts to each differs, the principle of being faithful to the Lord applies to all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a believer is entrusted with five talents, he should be diligent and faithful to gain five more talents; if he is entrusted with two talents, he should gain another two, and if he is entrusted with one talent, he should gain another talent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord is very fair.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If those who are entrusted with five talents gain another five talents, they will receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If those who are entrusted with two talents, however, gain another two, they will receive the same reward.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord s reward of being set...over many things is the same for both the one who received five talents and the one who received two talents vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His reward does not differ even when the slaves who were entrusted with different amounts gained different amounts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that the Lord does not care about how much has been entrusted to us or how much we have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He cares only about our faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, our faithfulness should not come short of what has been entrusted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as we are faithful to the fullest degree, our reward will be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this parable the one who received only one talent was the one most in danger of receiving the master s rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When those who receive one talent see others receiving two talents and even five talents, they often think that they cannot do very much with only one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, they hide their talent by not using it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The slave with one talent thought that his master was a hard man, one who reaps where he did not sow and gathers where he did not winnow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Consequently, he hid his talent in the earth in order to not lose it, and he was not faithful to use it vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After a period of time, the master returned to settle accounts with them v. 19 . We all should know that the Lord will indeed return and that we will need to give an account to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This parable shows how the Lord will settle our accounts with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The slave who was given five talents came to settle his account joyfully and said to the Lord, Master, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents v. 20 . The Lord said, Well done, good and faithful slave.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Enter into the joy of your master v. 21 . On earth today the Lord has entrusted us with only a few things, but in the coming kingdom, the Lord will entrust us with many things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The slave who was given two talents also came, and his situation was the same as the one with five talents.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, he received the same appraisal and reward from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, when the slave who was given one talent came, he said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow v. 24 . In effect, he was saying to the master, You are a hard man because you demanded much even though you did not give me much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is wonderful that the master did not deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He did not say, You are completely mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not a hard man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, he said, You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore you should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>26-27 .</S>
