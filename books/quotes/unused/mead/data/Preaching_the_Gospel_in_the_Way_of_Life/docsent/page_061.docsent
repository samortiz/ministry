   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Testimony of a Missionary</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first Presbyterian missionaries who went to China had a real love toward those poor Gentiles, and they had a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That love and testimony convinced the people, and through that, the door for the gospel was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Otherwise, it would have been too hard to open the door among the poor, conservative Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One story is the most inspiring.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time, no doors for the gospel were open.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The missionaries could not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The people made a corporate decision that no one in the whole village would open his door to any of the foreign missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever a foreign missionary came to the village, a gong was beaten to warn of his coming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then all the people closed their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not one person in the whole village would come out of his home until the gong was sounded again because the missionary was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One dear brother, who was a missionary, studied the situation and began to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The people would close their entrances and wait for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The brother would stand beside a door, and when someone would open it to see if the foreigner had gone, the brother would put a stick into the door.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He would push the door until he was half through it, and then regardless of what the people inside did, he would push all the way through.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In China in the early days, almost every home had a grinding room with a millstone to grind the wheat and corn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was a hard task since there was no power in those homes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If someone was rich, he would use a horse or mule to do the work, but if he was poor, he would do the grinding by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The missionary studied this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After coming through a door, he would right away run to the mill to do the grinding work for the people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The whole family would pay no attention to that poor fellow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They said, "If he is willing to do the hard work for us, let him do it."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brother would continue to grind without stopping for several hours, almost for the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That touched the heart of the people in the family, especially the older generation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The grandfather would come and give him a cup of water and say, "Drink it."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The missionary would thank him and drink it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then he would keep on grinding.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That truly touched them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was because of this that the older generation was opened to the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They would say, "Please sit down and have a rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How old are you?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From where did you come?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was through this that the doors were opened one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are other such stories that are truly inspiring.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would impress you that there is no easy way to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a grain of wheat is to bear fruit, it has to fall into the earth, die, and be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the life will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Almost everyone, especially in this country, knows something about Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot win people in a light way or easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, we have to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to win people at a certain cost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to pay a price for our relatives, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must pray for them and testify the Lord Jesus to them, giving them a real testimony in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is the need of a testimony in life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This kind of testimony cannot be built up in one or two days.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It requires a certain period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As students in school, we have to build up a testimony day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then after a few weeks or months the way will be prepared to bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the most prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way, not only will people be brought to the Lord, but they will also be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I say again, this is not merely the preaching of the gospel but also the imparting of life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to be balanced, we must have a life of preaching.</S>
