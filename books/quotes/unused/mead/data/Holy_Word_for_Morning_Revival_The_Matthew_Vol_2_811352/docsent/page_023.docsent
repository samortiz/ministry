   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 9 DAY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 12:38-42</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>39 But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>40 For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>41 Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something 1 more than Jonah is here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>42 The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus proceeded to tell the Pharisees the significance of the sign of Jonah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 40 He said, "For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was to be a very meaningful sign to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The heart of the earth is called "the lower parts of the earth" Eph 4:9 and Hades Acts 2:27 , where the Lord went after His death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections, the section of torment and the section of comfort Luke 16:23-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The section of comfort is Paradise, where the Lord went with the saved thief after they died on the cross Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, heart of the earth, lower parts of the earth, Hades, and Paradise are synonymous terms, referring to the place where the Lord stayed for three days and three nights after His death and before His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Lord's conversation with the Pharisees, suddenly another sign appeared: the sign of Solomon v. 42 . Christ, as the Son of David, as the King, is more than Solomon the king.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Solomon built the temple of God and spoke the word of wisdom, and to him the Gentile queen came 1 Kings 6:2; 10:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This too was a type of Christ, who is building the church, making it the temple of God, and is speaking the word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To Him the Gentile seekers turn.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This type, and that in verse 41, indicate that Christ, whether as the Prophet sent by God or as the King anointed by God, would turn from Israel to the Gentiles, as prophesied in verses 18 and 21.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to history King Solomon preceded Jonah the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But according to spiritual significance, Jonah came first, as recorded in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This too shows that Matthew's record is not according to the sequence of history but according to the sequence of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to doctrine, first Christ had to die and be resurrected; then He would build the church and speak the word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ's death and resurrection are the real sign to this generation, to both the Jews and the Gentiles 1 Cor 1:22, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>418-420</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>41 1 The Greek word for more, occurring also in v. 42, means better in quality and larger in quantity; hence, more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ, as the Prophet sent by God to His people Deut 18:15, 18 , is more than Jonah the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jonah was the prophet who turned from Israel to the Gentiles and was put into the belly of the great fish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After remaining there for three days, he came out to become a sign to that generation for repentance Jonah 1:2, 17; 3:2-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was a type of Christ, who would turn from Israel to the Gentiles and who would be buried in the heart of the earth for three days and then be resurrected, becoming a sign to this generation for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
