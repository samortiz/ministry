   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 12:12-14 we see two main things: the Spirit and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Body actually comes out of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>. We, as the many members, have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body, and now we are all drinking of this one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Body has come out of the one Spirit, and now the Body is drinking of this one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CARING FOR THE PROPER UNITY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am burdened that everyone in the Lord's recovery would see the Spirit and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christianity has missed the mark because it does not care at all for the Body, nor does it care for the Spirit in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many have talked about the Spirit, and since World War II there has been much talk about the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, the believers do not care for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we care for the Body, we must care for the proper oneness, the genuine unity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is one Head and one Body, one Christ and one church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Body does not refer to a group of believers who come together for a specific purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That is a social gathering, not the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we speak of the Body, we must have a deep sense of realizing that the Body is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Body is not only one in a locality, but one in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are in a division, not caring for the oneness of the Body, we do not know what the Body is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>RELIGION VERSUS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this message I would first like to say a word concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many among us have come to see that religion is not something positive, but I am concerned that some still have a wrong understanding of what it means to be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many of those who would tell others that they are too religious are not clear themselves regarding what religion is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Religion is something related to God and to the service and worship of God, yet having nothing to do with God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although a certain thing related to God may be very good, it is religion as long as it is not related to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Take the example of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you pray to the Lord without praying in the Spirit, your prayer has nothing to do with the Spirit and hence is something of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same is true with studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If your reading and study of the Bible have nothing to do with the Spirit, they are a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be religious is not a matter of doing things in a particular way or of being old as opposed to being young.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be religious is to do something for God apart from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The best thing done for God becomes a religion if it has nothing to do with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am burdened that all those in the Lord's recovery may be clear about what religion is.</S>
