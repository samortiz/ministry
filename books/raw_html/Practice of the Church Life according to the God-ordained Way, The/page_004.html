<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Mingling of the Processed and<br>Consummated Triune God with the Believers<br>as the Unique Body in the Universe</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with the believers as the unique Body in the universe (Eph. 4:3-6). In November 1991 I gave six messages on "The Intrinsic View of the Body of Christ," which were later published as a book by that title. In those messages I spoke on the high and deep view of the Body of Christ in the first four chapters of Ephesians. The content of those messages shows that in one sense I do have a certain amount of understanding concerning the Body of Christ. However, in some senses, I must say that even today I still do not know the Body of Christ.</P><P>In his earlier ministry in China, Brother Nee spoke a great deal on the normal Christian life. In 1938 he went to Europe. He stayed mainly in England, but he also visited Denmark, Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Some of his messages spoken during that time were compiled by Angus Kinnear to form the book The Normal Christian Life. After returning to China in the summer of 1939, he gathered us for a conference. In that conference his emphasis was on knowing the Body. Brother Nee continued to speak on knowing the Body of Christ until 1942. Immediately after those three years, a turmoil rose up in the church in Shanghai that caused Brother Nee to be unable to minister for six years.</P><P>During the period of Brother Nee's speaking on knowing the Body, he conducted a four-month training. In every meeting he asked one of the trainees to give a testimony concerning how he came to know the Body of Christ. Nearly everyone was exposed by him for their inadequate knowledge of the Body.</P><P>The Epistle of 1 Corinthians speaks first concerning the Body in chapter twelve. Then, in chapter fourteen, Paul used an interchangeable term, the church. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul did not use the term the Body of Christ; he spoke only of the church (vv. 4-5, 12, 19, 23, 28, 33-35). The Body of Christ is somewhat abstract and far away to our senses. The church, however, is practical and near to us. The church as the Body of Christ can be built up only by prophesying. Merely to preach the gospel to get people into the church does not build the church as an organism. At the end of the synoptic Gospels&#151;Matthew, Mark, and Luke&#151;the Lord commanded the disciples to go and preach the gospel (Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:46-49). But in the Gospel of John the Lord told the disciples to go forth and bear fruit (15:16). Bearing fruit is for the building up of an organism. This involves not only getting people saved but also bringing them into the Body of Christ.</P><P>Ephesians 4:3-6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one Father. This depicts a mingling of the Triune God&#151;the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father&#151;with the church as the Body. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are divine, but the Body is human. Four parties are mingled together: the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father (three parties on the divine side) and the Body (one party on the human side). What is depicted in Ephesians 4 is not three-in-one but four-in-one&#151;one entity comprising the Spirit, the Lord, the Father, and the Body. These four are mingled together to be one entity. This entity is a marvelous consummation. In the whole universe there is such an entity: the Triune God&#151;the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father&#151;mingled with a group of men. This is the church as the Body of Christ.</P><P>If the Triune God were not mingled with this Body, it would be a corpse, not a body. But because the Triune God is the life element to this Body, it is not a dead corpse but an organic entity, an organism. In order to build up such an organism, we must be able to prophesy. Even today our prophesying is still not very much in the nature of prophesying, but very much in the nature of a testimony or in the nature of giving a word of exhortation. To prophesy is to convey the divine element into people. When we read Paul's fourteen Epistles, we sense that in every page there is the dispensing of life into our spiritual being. Thus, Paul's writing was a prophesying.</P>
