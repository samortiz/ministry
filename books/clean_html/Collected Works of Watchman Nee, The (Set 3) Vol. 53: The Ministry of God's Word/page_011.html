<p>We must always bear in mind the meaning of the ministry of the word. The ministry of the word means the outflow of God's Spirit in His divine word through man. It is not the independent release of God's Spirit in His word but the release of His Spirit in His word in conjunction with man. This is the significance of the ministry of the word. It is something that contains God's word as well as man's ministry. God's word is present in this utterance and so is man's ministry. God's word first comes to man. Man's ministry is then added to this word. The two are released together. If there is only God's word without man's ministry, we do not have the release of His word.</p><p>Some people think that they can successfully transmit God's word as long as they pick up a few phrases here and there. However, it is never that simple. The ministry of the word is a combined flow; it is not a single flow. A single flow will not work. God does not operate this way, because this is a fundamental contradiction to the principle of the ministry of the word. We must realize that God's word cannot be released without man's word; He has to use man. As far as our disposition and nature are concerned, we are stubborn, defiled, and rebellious. It is easier for God to use a donkey than it is for Him to use us, yet He still prefers man. In His ministry of the word and in the release of His word, God has a desire for man's element to be involved. God has chosen man to release His word. We must remember that God's word is present only where there are ministers of the word. Without ministers of the word, we cannot have God's word. God must secure ministers before He can release His word; without ministers, there cannot be the word. We will be hoping in vain if we expect God to release His word without providing proper ministers for Him. God's ordained way is to put His word first into ministers, those who have experienced the dealings of the Holy Spirit. We all agree that God's Spirit is in His word. But His Spirit is also in us. In other words, God's Spirit is both in His word and in the ministers. God's Spirit is within the word. But if only this word is released, His Spirit will not do anything. He will only work when the word resides in and is combined with the ministers. The seven sons of Sceva tried to cast out demons in the name of the Jesus whom Paul preached, but they could not cast them out. Not only did the demons remain, but they even prevailed over two of the sons (Acts 19:13-16). The sons had the right words, but the Spirit did not do anything. It is not enough simply to speak the right words. There is also a need to be proper persons, proper ministers. God's Spirit must first join Himself to the ministers. Then the living water will flow as His Spirit is released through the word.</p><p>Let me repeat: God's word does not operate independently; it is expressed through human elements. Man is the channel, the channel of God. It is impossible to try to overturn this principle by presuming that God's word alone is sufficient and that there is no need to consider man's condition. Without the operation of God's Spirit behind His word, the word will be a useless, empty shell. The crucial issue today is the ministers. The focus is on the ministers. The ministers must have the Spirit. God's Spirit must accompany His ministers before the word will become effective. As a consequence, the fundamental problem is with the ministers of the word. The ministry of the word is not merely a matter of the word. If one emphasizes the word without emphasizing the ministers, what he has will not be the word. Such a word will be a loss, and it will not be a ministry.</p><p>The problem today lies entirely with the ministers. There is no scarcity of vision, light, or God's word. The problem today is that God cannot find proper ministers. Many times God's light ceases to be visible to others when it is put into our mouth. Many people speak about the Holy Spirit in their messages, but others do not touch the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, they touch the flesh. Many people speak about God's holiness, but others do not sense any holiness in them. They only touch a frivolous spirit. Some speak about the cross on the platform, but others can sense that they have never passed through any dealings. There is not even a trace of the cross in them. Some like to speak of love, but only temper, rather than love, is expressed through them. All of these cases speak of a basic problem&mdash;something is wrong with the ministers. If all the preaching on this earth today were in the principle of ministry, the church would be very rich. It is unfortunate that there is very little of God's word despite all of the preaching! This is the basic problem in the church today. Without ministers, there is no inspiration and no revelation. With many people, the more they preach, the further their speaking is from being an inspiration, from being the release of any light, and from being qualified to be called revelation. The problem is with the preachers; they are not the ones whom God can use. God cannot use such men, yet He does not want to speak alone. This is a problem. He has the word, yet He does not want to release this word by Himself. He does not want to be the minister of the word; He wants man to be the minister of His word.</p><p>Brothers, God will not speak by Himself. If ministers cannot speak His word, what will be the condition of the church? The church is desolate, poor, and in ruin because human elements have not come up to the standard of God's word. If God can find a person who has been dealt with by Him, who is broken, and who is prostrate on his face, God's word will flow through him. We are looking all the time for God's word, but He is looking all the time for men whom He can use. We are looking for God's word, while He is looking for ministers.</p><p>If we are unwilling to be dealt with, we will not be able to work for God. We must not think that such dealings are optional. We should not presume that, after hearing a certain number of messages, we can release the same word. No! If a person is not proper, his message will not be proper. Man can hinder God's word. The Holy Spirit is not released through the word alone. When God's word comes to us, we must be free from all hindrances. We must be broken, and we must bear the mark of the cross. Our spirit must be a smitten spirit. God can only use such persons, and the Holy Spirit will only flow through such persons. If the Holy Spirit is locked within us, the hindrance and frustration is our outer man, our emotion, and our temperament. When such things are present within us, surely God's word cannot flow through us. Even if we deliver a wonderful sermon, in reality it is nothing but words, teachings, and doctrines; there is not the word of God.</p><p>God's word has to penetrate our whole being&mdash;our feelings, our understanding, our heart, and our spirit. It has to flow in and out of us; it has to be identified with us, and then it must be released from us as a result of grinding, crushing, and pressing. If our emotion is misaligned, if our mind is impaired, or if our understanding, heart, and spirit are even slightly off, we will damage God's word. Not only will our word be flawed, but the church will suffer as well. We will damage God's word and affect the church. This is the way of the ministry of the word, and this is where our problem lies. We have to learn to allow God's word to pass through us without any hindrance or contamination. If God is merciful to us, we will find light in this matter.</p>
