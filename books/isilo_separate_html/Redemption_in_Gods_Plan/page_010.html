<p>God commanded man, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (Gen. 2:17). The result of eating the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is that man has a record of sin before God, a nature of sin, and death (Rom. 5:15).</p>
<p>The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death. This is seen first with the deadening of man&rsquo;s spirit, then the death of man&rsquo;s body, then the suffering of man&rsquo;s soul in Hades, and finally the second death of man&rsquo;s spirit, soul, and body (Rev. 20:14; 21:8). When Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his spirit was immediately deadened toward God (Eph. 2:1), and later his body also died (Gen. 5:5). Furthermore, if a person is not saved, his soul will be tormented in Hades after he dies (Luke 16:23), and his whole being will suffer the second death in the future.</p>
<p>Before man fell, his spirit was not deadened, and he had the capacity to fellowship with God and understand the things of God. After man fell, his spirit was deadened and lost its function of fellowshipping with God and of understanding the things of God. As soon as sin entered into man, his spirit was deadened even though his body was still alive. Outwardly, a person may appear to be living, but inwardly he is dead (Matt. 8:22). Then in due time his body will die. If he is not saved, his soul will be tormented in Hades, and eventually his entire being will suffer the second death (Heb. 9:27; Luke 16:23; Rev. 20:14; 21:8). This is truly a serious and dreadful consequence!</p>
<p>The Bible says that the wages of sin is death and that through sin, death entered the world (Rom. 6:23; 5:12). Death follows sin. Wherever there is sin, there is death. Man has sin and therefore cannot escape death. The Bible also says, &ldquo;Sin reigned in death&rdquo; (v. 21). This means that sin causes man to die. Sin has entered into man and reigns in man. Death now reigns over man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil involves evil, death, and the knowledge of good and evil. Hence, when man ate the fruit of this tree, he received death and a knowledge of good and evil. On the one hand, his spirit was deadened and lost its function of understanding the things of God. On the other hand, his eyes were opened to know good and evil. Prior to the fall, man was able to understand the things of God even though he did not have a knowledge of good and evil. But after man fell, his spirit was deadened and lost its function of understanding the things of God. Instead, man acquired the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>Initially, man lived by his spirit before God, was governed by God, and did not have the problem of good and evil. When man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his spirit was deadened toward God, and he could no longer be governed by God. Instead, the knowledge of good and evil entered into man to control him. As a result, man lives by the knowledge of good and evil and is accountable to the knowledge of good and evil. Man no longer lives by his spirit, and neither is he accountable to God alone. Man lives according to good and evil instead of living according to God. Man knows about good and evil, but he is not able to understand God.</p>
<p>Even though man has acquired the knowledge of good and evil and is able to know good and evil, he cannot refuse evil and do good. The knowledge of good and evil caused man&rsquo;s spirit to die. Instead of enabling man to refuse evil and do good, sin causes man to do the evil that he does not desire to do (7:19). Before man fell, he did not know good and evil, but he still lived out good; now that man knows good and evil, he does evil instead of good because of sin. Those who know good and evil still commit many evils. The more knowledge man has concerning good and evil, the more capable he is of doing evil. The knowledge of good and evil is actually evil. The knowledge of good and evil cannot prevent man from living in evil and doing evil.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Cast Out of Eden</h2>
<p>As a result of the fall, man was cast out of the garden of Eden (Gen. 3:22-24). Eden is the dwelling place of God. To be cast out of Eden is to be cast out of God&rsquo;s presence. The holy and righteous God cannot allow filthy sinners to live in His presence. God created man so that man would live in His presence and fellowship with Him. As a result of man&rsquo;s sin and fall, God cast man out of the garden, His presence, and man could not fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL PARTICIPATING IN ONE MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h2>
<p>When Adam sinned and fell in the garden of Eden, all mankind was included. Because Adam was the first man, he represents mankind and is the head of mankind. Therefore, when Adam sinned, all mankind, including those who were living and those who were not yet born, was affected by his sin. When he sinned, all mankind, which he represented, sinned. His sin was the sin of mankind. This is the reason Romans 5:18 speaks of one offense being unto condemnation to all men.</p>
<p>Adam is the forefather of all mankind. Hence, when he sinned, all his descendants were involved in his sin (cf. Heb. 7:9-10). His sin involved all mankind. When sin entered into Adam and constituted him a sinner, sin entered into mankind and constituted all men sinners. Hence, Romans 5:19 says, &ldquo;Through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners,&rdquo; and verse 12 says, &ldquo;Through one man sin entered into the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fall of Adam was the fall of mankind. We all participated in Adam&rsquo;s fall. In him we fell together with him. We fell before we were even born. We did not need to wait until we committed a sin to become sinners. We were born sinners because we sinned in Adam. In Adam we sinned, and we were constituted sinners before we were born. We were born fallen sinners.</p>
<p>A brother once said that he had been a sinner for more than forty years, because he was in his forties. He also said that he committed his first sin in Shan-hsi, because that is where he grew up. I told him that although I was only in my forties, I had been a sinner for six thousand years and that I committed my first sin in the garden of Eden. This is the truth. Nearly six thousand years ago we sinned in Adam in the garden of Eden. When Adam sinned six thousand years ago, we sinned, and when Adam sinned in the garden of Eden, we sinned. Adam&rsquo;s sinful act was our sinful act because we were all in Adam.</p>
<p>Since Adam&rsquo;s fall is our fall, the consequences of his fall are also ours. As the descendants of Adam, we all participate in the five consequences of Adam&rsquo;s fall.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
