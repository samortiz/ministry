   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven" v. 2 . This word was probably a shock to the paralytic and to those who had brought him to the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But much to their surprise, the Lord Jesus told the paralytic that his sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As fallen human beings, our basic problem is our sin, even our sins.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of sin, the situation of fallen mankind is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of sin, everyone has been corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because all the problems of mankind are the result of sin, sin must be dealt with if people are to be restored to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need Christ as the Forgiver of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the day we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him, our sins were forgiven. a. As the Son of Man</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, the Lord Jesus ministered as a Physician, not as a Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A judge's judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician's healing is according to mercy and grace.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>None of us would have been qualified, selected, and called to be the people of the heavenly kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus forgives our sins and also heals us in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As sinners, we are sick absolutely, for we are sick physically, spiritually, morally, and mentally.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But Jesus, the Forgiver and the Physician, is able to heal all our sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As our Physician, the Lord heals us mainly in our spirit and in our soul, not mainly in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The tax collectors and sinners in Matthew 9:10 were not physically sick; they were spiritually sick.</S>
