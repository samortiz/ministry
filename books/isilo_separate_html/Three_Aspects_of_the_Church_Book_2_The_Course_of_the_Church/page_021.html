<p>We need to be pure in heart, but we also need to pray to the Lord. It is not enough to have a pure heart; we need to pray as well. Prayer means that we reject and do not rely on ourselves in spiritual matters, in church affairs, and in matters related to the work and serving the Lord. Prayer also means that we are not for ourselves but for the Lord and that we do not follow our own will but the Lord&rsquo;s will. To pray to the Lord means that we are afraid of our own will and seek only the Lord&rsquo;s will. Suppose a brother preaches the gospel with a single motive and a pure heart, but instead of praying earnestly before preaching the gospel, he relies on newspaper ads and other human methods. This shows that he has not learned lessons before God and submitted to Him. His view, ideas, thoughts, concepts, opinions, and methods have not been swept away by God. He has not handed himself over to the Lord and learned to seek the Lord&rsquo;s will. This kind of person will have difficulty coordinating with others in the service. Thus, we must be pure in heart and pray to the Lord.</p>
<p>A pure heart seeks only God, and prayer implies that there is nothing of the self. Prayer means that we allow the Lord to do everything according to His way and not according to man&rsquo;s opinion. If we do things out of ourselves by human methods, opinions, and power, we have no need of prayer. This is similar to the fact that when we ride in a car, we do not need to walk. Whether we can find those whom the Lord has raised up to be our companions depends not only on the purity of our heart but also on whether we have stopped all the activity of the self. Have we stopped our ability, cleverness, methods, and wisdom? Do we submit ourselves to the Lord and seek His leading, or do we insist on our opinions? If we want to push our opinions through, we do not need to pray; if we want to submit ourselves to the Lord and seek His leading, we need to pray.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 2:22 says that we need to &ldquo;call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; Our focus is on calling on the Lord and having a pure heart. Anything added to our physical body from the outside cannot become one with our body. In the same principle, if we are ones who pray to the Lord out of a pure heart, we cannot be joined to someone who does not. This is not a question of sectarianism. If we call this sectarianism and try to join with ones who do not pray out of a pure heart, God will condemn us, because He condemns any mixture. The pure in heart and those with an impure heart, those who rely on the Lord and those who do not rely on the Lord, and those who are led by the Lord in their work and those who work by their own methods should not be mixed together. No mixture is approved by God.</p>
<p>In Exodus 32:26, after the Israelites worshipped the golden calf, Moses, as God&rsquo;s representative, said, &ldquo;Whoever is for Jehovah, come to me.&rdquo; Then the Levites separated themselves to Moses. God never tolerates mixture among His children. Cleansing ourselves from the vessels of dishonor as mentioned in 2 Timothy 2:20-21 is a matter within the church. In the desolation of the church we need to cleanse ourselves from the vessels unto dishonor who are within the church. In order to be vessels unto honor, we need to reject the dishonorable ones; we must cleanse ourselves from them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping in Life</h2>
<p>First John speaks concerning the desolation of the church. The desolation mentioned in 1 John involves those who go beyond the teaching of Christ in their preaching and thus become antichrists. The Holy Spirit deals with this problem through John&rsquo;s Epistle. John uses the fellowship of life to correct this error of the desolation. First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us.&rdquo; We can be one and be in fellowship because we have the fellowship of life. Whoever does not have the fellowship of life is different from us and cannot be in fellowship with us.</p>
<p>First John 2:19 says, &ldquo;They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out that they might be manifested that they all are not of us.&rdquo; We know those who are of us because there is fellowship between them and us; some go out from us because there is no fellowship between them and us. In 1 John 2 we see that some went out from the apostles because they were not of the apostles. They were not of the apostles, because the apostles had the life of Christ, and they did not. They were Christians without the life of Christ. Because they did not believe that Christ had come in the flesh, they did not have the eternal life. Thus, they could not fellowship with or be joined to the apostles. The joining is the eternal life mentioned in 1 John 1. As believers, we are joined to the apostles because we all have the same eternal life, and the apostles are joined to God and to His Son.</p>
<p>In the desolation of the church the basis of our joining with anyone who calls himself a Christian is the inner fellowship of life. Without the fellowship of life there cannot be any joining together. John says that saved Christians cannot have fellowship with those who do not believe in Christ as the Son of God. Since they cannot fellowship, they must go their separate ways.</p>
<p>We may have the thought that if we allow those with whom we cannot fellowship to go their separate ways, it will result in more divisions. I am not encouraging the brothers and sisters to divide; rather, I hope that we will see that in the desolation of the church, relationships among the believers are a matter of fellowship. Regardless of outward similarities, if there is no fellowship of life between two people, they cannot be joined. We should not argue with others about doctrines; we need to learn to live in the eternal life and to sense whether or not fellowship is possible. A very courteous brother once exhorted me not to divide from others. However, I asked him, &ldquo;When you stay with these ones for a long time, how do you feel inwardly?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;When I am with them, I do not feel comfortable inwardly. Nonetheless, the Lord tells us to be one and that we should bear the cross.&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;If you are happy about bearing this cross, then bear it; however, what will the result be? Can you rescue such ones and cause them to know God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>God never intended for us to be involved in this kind of oneness during the desolation of the church. Others do not do this, and neither can we. If we want to accept others, why not accept the Catholic Church? There are many saved ones in the Catholic Church; if we go with them to burn incense and kiss the feet of idols, we might gain some of them. Why should we be particularly gracious to a certain group of Christians and bear with them? The oneness has been destroyed, and God has not told us to restore it. On the contrary, He wants us to cleanse ourselves from dishonorable vessels. I am not encouraging the creation of divisions; however, we need to pay attention to the inner fellowship of life during the desolation of the church. When life cannot flow through, we should not force it.</p>
<p>We stand before the Lord whom we serve, and we have no intention of drawing anyone to be with us. Such a goal should be condemned; it is low and shameful. Since I have been in Taiwan, I have said, &ldquo;You can meet wherever you choose as long as it is beneficial to you.&rdquo; As long as there is the fellowship of life, any gathering is suitable. If we bring people to our meetings but do not bring them into the fellowship of God&rsquo;s life, whatever we do is accursed. Many of us know each other in a deep way; if one among us takes a different way, I would be hurt in my emotions because I am a man. However, in my spirit, I would say, &ldquo;Lord, although my brother is taking a different way, as long as he can gain something of You, I just worship You.&rdquo; I especially beseech the brothers never to say to anyone, &ldquo;It is best that you come here to meet with us.&rdquo; This is foolishness. We should never play politics in our dealings with people; rather, we should exhort them to meet where they can receive help. Our hope should not be that people would come to our meetings; rather, our hope should be that we could touch the fellowship of life. We do not bring people to know us but to know the Lord. We do not bring people to enter into our meetings but to enter into the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>It is better for people to go elsewhere and gain God than to meet with us to merely increase our numbers. In a sense, the increase is not important; what really matters is whether or not we touch the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>The fellowship of life is crucial during the desolation of the church. If we are in a place in which we can fellowship, sense the Lord&rsquo;s presence, obtain the supply, and cause others to receive grace, be enlightened, and be saved, then that place is suitable. We should learn to take this approach during the desolation of the church. We cannot have our own choice, and we must learn to live in and to sense if others are in the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>If we live in the fellowship of life, we will be able to supply those whom we meet, and they will be able to obtain the supply from us. Furthermore, we must learn to obtain the supply from others. We need to supply others with life, and we need to receive the supply from them; this is to fellowship in life with one another. It is not a matter of outward doctrines but a matter of the inner life. We must learn to live in the fellowship of life before we can discern whether others are in it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Anointing</h2>
<p>First John 2:27 speaks of the anointing, and the context indicates that this word is related to being separated from antichrists. John tells us that there is a group of people called antichrists (v. 18) and that we should deal with them by the anointing. It is not enough to speak of fellowship; in addition to fellowship there must be the anointing, that is, the anointing of the Holy Spirit who teaches us all things. We cannot work with some people, because we do not have the inner anointing when we are with them. This is not a matter of doctrine or oneness; it is a matter of the anointing and is spontaneous. I do not go to other Christian groups to preach, because when I am with those groups, I do not have the anointing. I feel released and have much to say here because I have the anointing. If I did not have the anointing, I would be restricted. Thus, wherever the anointing is, there we may go; otherwise, we should be limited.</p>
<p>We can clearly see in the Epistles that the focus during the desolation of the church is not on doctrinal issues but on nature and motive. We need to pay attention to our conscience, to the fellowship of life, and to the anointing. The anointing is the operating of the Holy Spirit, which causes us to sense God&rsquo;s presence and feel watered, fresh, bright, and living. We must do everything by discerning the anointing. In the desolation of the church we should not decide which Christians to meet and work with based on doctrinal considerations. Our conscience must be clear, and our heart must be pure. In nature we must be vessels unto honor. We must also learn to reject the natural man and the flesh by receiving the dealing of the cross in order to live before God. Only when we meet these conditions will there be no ground in us for the desolation of the church; then we will be able to pass the test and be approved by God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
