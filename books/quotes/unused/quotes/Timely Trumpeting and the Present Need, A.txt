Although some have ventured to study this matter since then, eventually all have given up for lack of a way to practice it
If we are to build up the organic Body of Christ, we must have the meetings of mutuality as recorded in 1 Corinthians 14:26
When the whole church comes together, 'each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
We will consider the administration by locality of a local church and the organic building up of the Body of Christ
Since we began the practice of the new way in the Lord's recovery, saints in different localities have paid much attention to the matter
Because of geographical separation and the differences in race and language, the reactions to this matter are varied
According to my observation, this is all due to an inadequacy in the basic understanding concerning the apostles
Formerly they were captured by Satan but through His death and resurrection Christ has captured these ones from the capturing hands of Satan
By His resurrection life, Christ has constituted them gifts and has given them as gifts to His Body for its building up
What an apostle needs is revelation concerning the central point of God's New Testament economy, which is Christ and the church
In Pauls case we also see this one indispensable qualification of an apostle he must receive the revelation concerning Christ and the church
Under this kind of gospel many of us were brought to confession, repentance, believing into Christ, and salvation
To be an apostle, a person must first receive the revelation of God's New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church
He must be able to preach the gospel of Christ and lead those sinners predestinated and called by God to Christ to be saved
Of course, he himself must know how to lead, shepherd, teach, and oversee first before he can teach others to do the same
He must be able to define doctrines, expound the truth, and perfect the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ
Is that church to be led then only by the elders, while the apostles keep their hands off and have nothing more to do with it?
Of all that the apostles do, the first thing is that they endeavor to visit and strengthen the churches that they have established
Because of it, they went up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and the elders and try to solve the problem in a conference
Because of a contention, the two separated from each other, and Paul chose Silas and went out to strengthen the churches
In 1 Corinthians 4:17 we also see that Paul sent Timothy to the church in Corinth to remind them of the apostle's ways in Christ
If the apostles are to take their hands off and stop being involved with the affairs of the church, how can they perfect the saints?
In 2 Corinthians 11:28 Paul himself said that he bore the pressure upon himself 'daily, the anxiety for all the churches'
In addition to all the tribulations, persecutions, and sufferings, Paul had the anxiety for all the churches daily pressing upon him
Let us look at a few portions from Watchman Nee's books The Normal Christian Church Life and Church Affairs concerning the matter
The apostles are there to help the elders of a local church so that the elders would know how to manage the affairs of the church
The direct management of a church lies in the hands of its elders; the apostles manage the brothers only through the hands of the elders
If you have time to read these Epistles, you will see that Paul charged Timothy and Titus to work together with the elders in the church
Rather, after you have appointed elders in a locality, you need to observe how they go on and you need to help them
Paul did not leave Titus in Crete and Timothy in Ephesus and tell them to return after they established elders
Not only do the apostles have the duty and authority to appoint the elders, they also have the duty and authority to remove them
Paul said to Timothy, 'Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses'
In the book Church Affairs, we have a paragraph on 'The Church Listening to the Elders and the Elders Learning to Listen to the Apostles'
When there were brothers who did not respect the elders and problems occurred, the letter of accusation by two or three was sent to Timothy
Through the gospel of Christ the apostles led the sinners to salvation and brought them in, thus raising up the church
For this reason, it is obvious that the church should respond to the work of the apostles and have fellowship in the work of the apostles
In the New Testament we can see frequently that wherever the Apostle Paul went, he went in the fullness of the blessing of Christ
Christ, the grace in the fellowship, and the sharing in the fullness of the blessing of Christ, all follow the apostles everywhere they go
If a local saint or a local church cuts off its relationship with the apostles, it will lose God's blessing and grace
In both the previous message and in this message we are covering a matter that is neglected by most Christians
To us they now seem new because what we have seen and inherited is in contradiction to the practices of traditional Christianity
After the new things stay in our hands for a long time, they become old to us as well, and we do not treasure them anymore
Their situation is like that of those who confuse the capital letters G and C some may consider these letters to be more or less the same
In the last message we pointed out the six levels of relationships revealed in Ephesians 4:8-12 and in other portions of the New Testament
On the second level these gifts which are the apostles the prophets the evangelists and the shepherds and teachers function in the Body
It must be uplifted further; it must match Ephesians chapter four in the matter of the perfecting of the saints
The goal is the perfecting of the saints so that everyone may have a part in the building work of the Body of Christ
The gospel and truth that he preached was not learned from men nor taught by men, but came directly from the Lord's revelation
He was trained according to the strictness of the law of the fathers at the feet of Gamaliel and was zealous for God
Rise up and go into Damascus, and there it will be told you concerning all things which have been appointed for you to do'
For this reason, he was not an apostle constituted directly through the Lord's revelation, but was one perfected by others through learning
Peter, John, and Paul did not learn from anyone else, and not one of them was under another's leadership; they were all on equal standing
Those apostles produced by the Lord's directly appointed apostles are led and directed by those who produced them
According to the record of the New Testament, Timothy and Titus were always under Paul's leadership and direction
Those apostles who are perfected by men also work in the churches raised up by the first two kinds of apostles
As a result, they and the saints whom they have perfected are completely one in the ministry's work of building up the Body of Christ
The first item in the service of the church is the preaching of the gospel and the saving of sinners by every member
As soon as a person is saved, there should be someone to meet with him, care for him, and nourish him in his home
All that is needed is someone who will pick up the burden to do it, not in an organized way, but in an organic way
Lastly, we bring this new one to the larger meetings of the church, where he can function to build up the Body of Christ
According to my observation, although the church in Taipei is on the right track and is taking the new way, much is still not organic
Strictly speaking, all these things should be taken up spontaneously and organically by the brothers and sisters
We must be recovered to such an extent that the number of serving ones equals the number of brothers and sisters
From the Head, Christ, through the gifted members, and then through the elders to the perfected saints, we arrive at the local churches
In this message we will cover the administration of a local church by locality and the organic building up of the Body of Christ
Administration by locality is related to the local church, and the organic building up is related to the Body of Christ
If you put the seven golden lampstands together, you can never differentiate them one from the other unless you number them
We cannot find one word related to the administration of the church that has the sense of political administration
Church administration is different from political administration just as family administration is different from governmental administration
Between the father and the mother, the children, the brothers, and the sisters, there is a full blood relationship which is of life
In Ephesians 1:19-22 we are shown that all of Christ's attainments in His resurrection and ascension are for the church
If the state-federated government of the United States is used as an illustration of the churches, it puts the church in a political realm
When the elders came, Paul told them that the Holy Spirit had set them apart as bishops, or overseers, of the flock
The word 'elder' refers to the person, while the word 'bishop,' or 'overseer,' refers to the ministry, the work
After we are saved and begin to love the Lord, and even after we have become elders, within we are still full of organizational thoughts
For the elders to shepherd is an organic matter, while for them to lord it over others is an organizational matter
These few do not have to wait for the arrangement and organization of the elders; instead, they can just go out to preach the gospel
After a while, the zeal cools down, and as more friction comes in among the saints who serve, the number drops
The Body of Christ is universal, with its practical building up being carried out in the various local churches
Without the practical, local building, the building up of the Body will be a term only; it will not be a reality
There is no such thing as having one kind of teaching in one place and another kind of teaching in another place
As a result, the churches that were produced, though different in affairs and practices, were the same in nature and form
After they have digested the food, they will be able to produce milk for supplying and nourishing the flock under their care
The organic building up of the Body of Christ is fully a matter of the growth of the saints in the divine life
For this reason, the elders and co-workers have to take the lead to grow in the divine life, that the Body of Christ may be built up
There seems to be some edification of the believers, but in reality there is not much building up of the Body of Christ
The big meetings with only one person speaking and all the rest listening will never develop the organic function of the saints
In order to recover the meetings of mutuality of 1 Corinthians 14, all the brothers and sisters need a revival
It is a law in God's creation that every twenty-four hours the sun rises anew, bringing with it a new beginning
If we do not have a daily revival and would not live an overcoming life, we cannot hope to have the meetings of 1 Corinthians 14:26
As soon as we make a mistake, we confess, ask for the Lord's forgiveness, and are restored to the overcoming life
In everything, whether great or small, they must seek the growth in life, and they must seek to grow up into the Head, Christ
As a result, everyone will be able to do the same work of the New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ
The gifted ones continue to perfect the saints until all the members that constitute the Body of Christ arrive at three things
The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience
Our growth in life is a growth into the Head, Christ, but our function in the Body of Christ comes out from Him
Every joint of the supply' denotes the gifted ones, while 'each one part' denotes the different members of the Body
When all the gifts and all the members are fitted and knit together in this way, the Body will grow unto the building up of itself in love
Next, we bring them to the small group meetings, where they are enlightened, taught, and led by the light of the truth
Once you are perfected you should turn around to perfect other brothers and sisters in the same way by speaking to them on a onetoone basis
If every one of our co-workers and elders faithfully fulfills their function in this way, each can help at least five to six others
Particularly here in Taiwan, the elders of the churches and the co-workers should pick up the burden to seek a fresh revival
What we need today is this kind of renewal in the inner life as opposed to a renewal in outward actions or expression
All the co-workers with the elders should trumpet this call in all the places, awakening all the saints to go to bed early and rise up early
No matter how busy we are or how important other things are, we must put them aside until we have a touch with the Lord
Leviticus 6:12 tells us that 'the priest shall burn wood on it every morning and arrange the burnt offering on it'
In such a living, we fellowship with the Lord, walk with Him, and abide in Him, and thus become one spirit with Him and live Him out
Only with the proper feeding can there be the proper perfecting, and only then can the saints be equipped and perfected
Such a child should go to school to receive his education, but that does not mean that the parents no longer supervise the child
When a child is sent to school to receive a proper education, he must still have a good family to match his training at school
As soon as we hear of anyone sick or of anyone encountering problems, we must be concerned for him, pray for him, and go to visit him
The impact that this little bit of concern, prayer, and visiting affords is far more powerful than ten messages
Although the long messages are nice to listen to, they are far inferior to the care we can give to others in their daily lives
At the same time, the expression of love which flows out from the serving ones will become the example for the ones served
When a mother loves her child, the love expresses itself spontaneously in her living and becomes an example to the child
The meetings with only one speaking and all the rest listening do not have the mouth-to-mouth feeding or the face-to-face teaching
The purpose for this change is that all the saints may be perfected and that they all may become useful persons
At present, in the church in Taipei there are four thousand people attending the weekly bread-breaking meetings
If all these ones were perfected and everyone could do the work of the co-workers and elders, the situation would be marvelous
The elders among us have mostly been involved with the arrangement of affairs, such as the setting of meeting times
If we only have preaching and do not have this care and concern, the words preached will have only a limited effect upon people
After we care for people in this way, when they come to listen to us, the words they hear will have twice as much effect on them
After a message, if we would go and talk to the people, the results would be twice as great as our present results
If we merely preach without contacting people, the results will be half as great, and our words are liable to be empty and impractical
If a church has three elders and each contacts people every day, in a year's time they will be able to contact all the saints many times
We have to do our best to contact them, to be concerned and care for them in love, and to strive to help and shepherd them
Outwardly, we will not have the facade of a big meeting to show off, but actually, hundreds and thousands will be cared for
