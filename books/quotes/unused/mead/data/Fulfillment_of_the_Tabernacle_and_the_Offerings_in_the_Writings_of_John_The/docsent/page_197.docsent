   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONENESS IN THE FATHER'S NAME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The oneness revealed in John 17 is the oneness in the Father's name.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 11 says, "I am no longer in the world, and they are in the world; and I come to You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Holy Father, keep them in Your name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The oneness spoken of here certainly is not any kind of social unity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, this is something of the divine name.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible, especially in the Gospel of John, the name denotes a person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the Father's name is actually the Father Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you call a person by name, that person will respond.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you call a person by his name, you expect a certain response, a certain kind of action.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 17:11 to be kept in the Father's name is to be kept in the Person of the Father through His action.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today the Father is active in building up His house on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How does He build up His house, the church?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father builds His house in His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His name, that is, in His Person, the Father is now actively building His house, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason there is so little oneness among Christians is that too few are in the name of the Father, in His Person and action, in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, nearly every believer lives and acts altogether in his own person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is difficult to find Christians who live, act, and work in the Person of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The result of believers living and acting in their own person is division.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the source of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Divisions are the result of the opinions and character of certain ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Divisions also come as a result of a person's own action, an action that is not in the name of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We in the Lord's recovery should not be Christians living in our own person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, we should be those living in the Person of our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the only begotten Son of God, the Lord Jesus did not come in His own name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 5:43 He said, "I have come in the name of My Father."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though He is the Son of God, He did not come in His name, but He came in the name of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to 10:25, the Lord's works were done in the name of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus never did anything in His own name.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He came and worked in the Father's name; that is, He acted in the Father's actions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should follow the Lord to live and act in the Father's name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we live in the Person of the Father and act in the Father's action, the result will be oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if we live and act in our own person, we shall have division.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as a believer lives in his own person and acts in his own action, he himself becomes a division.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose there are three hundred believers in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If all these believers live and act in their own person, there will be three hundred divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oneness is first a matter of being in the name of the Father, of being in the Father's Person and action.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to have such a oneness, not only must our opinion be terminated, but even our own person must be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to have oneness, we should not live in ourselves or act in our own action.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, we should all live in one Person in our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can live in the Father's name because we have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 17:2 says, "Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because we have the Father's life, we can live in the Father's Person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, if we did not have His life, we would not have the ability to live in His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as we live by the Father's life, we live in His Person and act in His action.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The result of such a living is oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to have a oneness that does not fluctuate, we need to be in the name of our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, if our oneness is a matter of having the same opinion or believing the same doctrine, this oneness will not last.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today you may hold a certain opinion or agree with a particular doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But after a period of time your opinion may change, and your understanding of that doctrine may also change.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, the oneness that depended upon opinion and doctrine will fluctuate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The oneness among most Christians today is a fluctuating oneness, a changeable oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I can testify that the real oneness, the oneness we have been experiencing in the Lord's recovery, never changes, never fluctuates, because this oneness is the oneness in the Father's Person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are one in the Father's Person, life, and action.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What a wonderful oneness!</S>
