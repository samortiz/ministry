<p>In Book V, we have primarily these two Psalms concerning Christ, Psalms 110 and 118. These Psalms are at the highest peak. We must worship God for them and thank Him that we have not only Psalm 110, but 118 as well. Without Psalm 118 the record concerning Christ would not be complete. The kingship is for the building, the priesthood is for the building, the victory is for the building, the fighting is for the building, and Christ’s coming is also for the building. If we have only Psalm 110 without Psalm 118, we simply have the means without the goal. Psalm 118 tells us the goal: the goal is the building.<p>Psalm 118:23, “This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.” What is the Lord’s doing? The Jews put Christ upon the cross; they crucified and buried Him, and then they went back to sleep. They thought that everything would go on then as usual, having put that “troublemaker,” Jesus, to an end. But then the news suddenly came that He was alive again and that the tomb was empty. He was resurrected and ascended into the heavens, and on the day of Pentecost He proclaimed through His apostles that the same Jesus whom they had crucified was honored by God the Father, raised, exalted, and made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:32-36). The house of Israel was made to know that God had made the stone whom they had rejected the head of the corner. This is the Lord’s doing. The resurrection, the exaltation, the setting of Christ at the right hand of God and making Him the chief cornerstone is the Lord’s doing. It is marvelous in our eyes! Did not the Jewish people bury Him? Yes, they did; but now He is at the right hand of God. It is the Lord’s doing. Hallelujah! Verse 24 continues: “This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” The day referred to in this verse is the day of resurrection. The Lord’s day is the resurrection day. We must rejoice and be glad on this day. Sunday after Sunday, Lord’s day after Lord’s day, we can do nought else but rejoice and be glad.<p>This Psalm concerning Christ does not end here; we still have some additional wonderful verses. Verse 26: “Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.” Who is this? It is Christ as the coming Messiah; He is the One who will come in the name of the Lord. This verse has been fulfilled once, when Christ entered the gates of Jerusalem while He was on earth. At that time the people laid their garments before Him and shouted, “Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!” (Matt. 21:9). But following that, in Matthew 22, the Jewish people rejected Him; and the Lord said unto them, “Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord” (Matt. 23:39). In other words, He said, “Now you reject Me, but one day you will receive Me.”<p>Psalm 118 closes by indicating how, out of the praising house of the Lord, the blessing comes to the people: “We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord” (v. 26). Then, with the praises, a sacrifice is brought to the altar: “God is the Lord, which hath showed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar” (v. 27). Lastly, a final note of praise is sounded: “Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his mercy endureth forever” (vv. 28-29).<h2 class=head1>PSALM 119—THE LAW BECOMES THE TESTIMONY</h2><p>Now we proceed to Psalm 119, where the saints praise God for the law as God’s testimony, a type of Christ. Psalm 119 is the longest Psalm, with 176 verses. It is divided into twenty-two sections, each of eight verses, and each beginning with a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Now we have a problem. After all the preceding 118 Psalms, we have another Psalm about the law. The law is still here. But if you compare Psalm 119 with Psalm 1, you will see a great difference. The concept of the Psalmists, as we have mentioned, was greatly influenced by the law. But because they lived in such intimate communion with the Lord, they afforded Him an opportunity to utter something within their utterances, not according to their own concept, but according to His. In Psalm 119 the same principle applies. The author of this Psalm was one hundred percent immersed in the concept of the law, but within His utterance there is the utterance of God.<p>All the verses indicated at the beginning of the chapter show the difference between this Psalm regarding the law and Psalm 1. In Psalm 119 the law is called the testimony, not only the commandment. The testimony here is in the plural number—“the testimonies.” The testimonies really mean the law. They are the testimonies of God. The law is the testimony of God; it is much more than a collection of commandments for us to keep. The law is a definition, an explanation, a testimony, showing us the kind of God we have. Hence, in this sense, the law is the testimony as a type of Christ, for Christ is the expression of God, the full revelation of all that God is. In Psalm 119 the word “testimonies” is used twenty-three times, once in the singular number. This indicates that the Spirit within the Psalmist is emphasizing Christ. The Psalmist’s intention was to speak about the law, but the Spirit within him emphasized Christ. Christ is the testimony of God. All the verses we have referred to in this Psalm tell us how the Psalmist appreciated the testimonies, loved the testimonies, and rejoiced in the testimonies. The words of the testimonies were so sweet to him. They were not merely some commandments to keep, but the testimonies of God as an enjoyment to possess. They were not a burden, but a delight to the Psalmist. They were a lamp unto his feet, and a light unto his path.
