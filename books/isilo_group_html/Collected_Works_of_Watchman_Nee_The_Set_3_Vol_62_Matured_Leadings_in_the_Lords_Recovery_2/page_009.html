The saints have inward needs, and the church cannot ignore these needs. It has to take care of these needs immediately. In addition to the light which God has shown us through His servants, we have to pay attention to the spiritual needs within the brothers and sisters, because all these needs speak of God's work within them. If the elders ignore these needs, they are ignoring the heavenly vision and will receive severe chastisement (cf. Amos 2:11-12).</p><p>The elders have to be more sensitive and perceptive to the feelings of the brothers and sisters. God often grants us stronger lights through the brothers and sisters. For this reason, the elders have to care for the needs of the saints as much as they care for their own needs. If they do this, they will not offend the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The elders must open up their hearts all the time. They should bear the saints on their shoulders and upon their hearts, inquiring of God on their behalf. (The breast has to do with the heart, and the shoulders have to do with strength.) We have to give our heart and strength to the brothers and sisters. We should bring them to God and seek for light this way. When they have a burden from the Holy Spirit, we should not annul this burden. When the elders hear that a young person has a burden for the gospel or a desire to do something, they should immediately bring the matter to God and inquire of Him concerning such a desire. We do not know how much we have limited God today. He is waiting for us. It is not we who are waiting for God. I hope that the elders will take heed to all the flock (Acts 20:28).</p><h2 class="head2">Making Proper Arrangements for Practical Affairs</h2><p>The elders must not only bear the responsibility for the spiritual service of the entire church before God but must bear the responsibility for the practical affairs as well. For this reason, the elders must be able to make good and proper arrangements of all the practical affairs. They must realize that practical affairs can be a great means for God to accomplish His work or a great hindrance to frustrate His work. The more works there are and the heavier the responsibility of the work is, the more there is the need for proper arrangements. This is like riding a car through hills and valleys; one passes over hill after hill to reach his destination. The car can be a means or a hindrance. If the elders control the car well, God's work will move speedily forward, and it will reach its destination.</p><p>Today in Christianity, an organization may have three thousand, ten thousand, even twenty thousand names on its roll, but only three to five hundred actively serve. Few people participate practically in the services. The general number of the church can increase, but if the serving ones do not increase in number, the church will soon reach its maximum capacity. It will be unable to grow any further. If the water from a big river is channeled toward a hundred gallon barrel, it can only hold that much water. The rest will drain away and be wasted.</p><p>Arrangements of practical affairs increase our capacity for God's grace. The more arrangements the elders make with regards to practical affairs and personnel assignments, the more opportunity they will provide God to work among them. Some may say that the elders should at most only make arrangements in services, in spiritual directions, and in prayer, but not in personnel assignments. Actually, personnel assignments are more important than the arrangement of practical affairs. God's work is carried out mainly through human beings. This is the reason the elders must perfect men and train these men to handle affairs properly.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Thorough in the Management of Affairs</h2><p>The elders must not only make arrangements of practical affairs but must be thorough in managing these affairs. As a responsible brother, your mind and concepts have to be clear and quick. Some people are too spiritual in their thoughts. They think that as long as they pray for the saints, it matters little how they arrange the chairs. This is absolutely wrong. The elders must be quick to turn. We are not yet living in the New Jerusalem. There are still many things that need to be done in the church life. These things need to be done properly. The more thorough and complete the execution, the better off we are. Many times the elders come up with an idea; this idea calls things not being into being. I can testify that I bother people all the time; I am a bad man to many. You have to come up with something to do even when there is nothing to do, and you have to demand that these things be done thoroughly. Those who cannot handle things properly cannot expect to work for God. Do not think that you can work for God simply by giving a few messages. That is very far from the goal.</p><p>Those who cannot manage things cannot work for God. Only those who can manage can work for Him. Those who are sloppy in managing affairs are sloppy and inaccurate in studying the Bible. If you are not accurate in the way you arrange chairs, you will be inaccurate in the way you expound the Bible. Brother Chang Yu-lan rebukes people to their face many times. He is good at finding faults in others. If you tell him that your mistake matters little, he will tell you that it only matters little if you are the only one in the world that is serving. You have to consider how many people are following behind you and how many brothers and sisters are looking at you. Perhaps a little mistake on your part will cause five hundred souls to be kept away from salvation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
