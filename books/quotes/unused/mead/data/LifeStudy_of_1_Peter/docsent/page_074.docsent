   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR CHRISTIAN LIFE AND ITS SUFFERINGS 6 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 3:14-22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to 3:14-22, a section that speaks of suffering for righteousness by the will of God, as Christ suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although this portion is included in the section on Christian life and its sufferings, it actually speaks concerning Christ s death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These verses involve two major problems that have been debated over the years, one problem related to Christ s death and the other regarding baptism in relation to His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>SANCTIFYING THE LORD IN OUR HEARTS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 14 and 15 say, But even if you suffer because of righteousness, you are blessed; and do not be afraid with fear from them, nor be troubled, but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, being always ready for a defense to everyone who asks of you an account concerning the hope in you, but with meekness and fear.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are terrified and troubled by persecutors, it will appear that we do not have the Lord in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, in suffering persecution we should show others that we have Christ within us as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is to sanctify Him, to separate Him, from the false gods, not degrading Him to be as the lifeless idols.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The hope spoken of in verse 15 is the living hope of the inheritance of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a hope in our pilgrimage today for the future, not a hope of objective things, but a hope of life, even eternal life, with all the endless divine blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fear mentioned by Peter in verse 15 is a pious fear, a holy fear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peter speaks of fear a number of times in this Epistle because the teaching of this book concerns the government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In sufferings that come from opposition and persecution, we should sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word sanctify in Greek means to set apart, to separate from things that are common.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to make something particular and even outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our suffering of persecution, we should make Christ particular; we should show that He is magnificent, absolutely different from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sanctifying Christ as Lord in our hearts is not a matter of outward activity to set Him apart from what is common.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is an inward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts means that when we are under persecution, we have the Lord in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we allow the Lord to be the Lord in our hearts when we suffer persecution, we shall express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This expression spontaneously will sanctify Christ and set Him apart from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are timid and fearful when suffering persecution, the Lord will not be sanctified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What a shame that would be to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It will appear as if we do not have the Lord in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we suffer persecution, others must realize that we have Christ within us as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if we are timid and fearful, others will think that we do not have anything within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They will have the impression that we do not have the living Lord in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if we are bold, sanctifying the Lord in our hearts and expressing Him in our faces, others will realize that we do have something within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is to sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have told you before of a story I heard concerning a young woman who was martyred during the Boxer Rebellion in China.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This particular incident took place in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of the Boxer movement, all the businesses in the city were closed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A young man who was learning a certain business did not dare to open the door of the building where he was.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peeking through a crack in the door, he saw the Boxers parading down the street.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He heard the crying and shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He saw some of the Boxers, with swords in their hands, threatening a young woman.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She was sitting in a wagon that was carrying her to the place where she would be martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although the Boxers surrounded her, shouting, crying, and threatening, she was not afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Her face was glowing, and she was rejoicing in the Lord and praising Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That young man was deeply impressed by what he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>An unbeliever at the time, he decided then that he would learn about the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He thought to himself, If this is nothing more than a Western religion, why is this young woman not frightened by the threatening and the shouting?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why is she not afraid of death?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why is her face glowing, and why is she rejoicing?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This young man did not then realize that she was praising the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later he believed in the Lord and became a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Long after that, when he became old, I met him in my home town, and we enjoyed a pleasant conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He told me the story of what he experienced that day in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That young woman who was martyred during the Boxer Rebellion truly sanctified Christ as Lord in her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The glow on her face, the rejoicing, the praising all this was an expression that the Lord was in her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Spontaneously, she sanctified Christ as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Her sanctifying Christ in this way influenced that young man to believe in the Lord.</S>
