   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WAYS TO DISPOSE OF MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RECEIVED FROM THE LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are also six ways to take care of money received from the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we can remember the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, we can remember individual brothers and sisters or individual workers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Third, we can spend it on the local needs of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fourth, we can take care of the needs of other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fifth, we can take care of the needs of the work in our own region.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sixth, we can take care of the needs of the work of other regions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>WAYS TO DISPOSE OF MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>RECEIVED FROM THE REGION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are also six ways to take care of money received from the regions of work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, we can use it on the poor within the region.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second, we can use it on individual workers within the region.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Third, we can take care of the need of the work in the region.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Fourth, we can take care of the need of the work in other regions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fifth, we can take care of the churches within the region.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sixth, we can take care of the churches in other regions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In handling the distribution of funds, we have an opportunity to experience God's guidance and the Spirit's discipline in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This exercise requires faith, love, and the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every worker must continue to look to the Lord and must continue to exercise faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The personal walk of faith, which we spoke of in the past, is still necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in addition to this individual faith, we also need corporate faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Individual needs must be met by individuals alone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the church or the work to take care of such a need would only damage the faith of the individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As to my personal needs, as well as the needs of the work directly under me, such as the expenses of this training, I will never receive anything from the local churches or the work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In handing over one's possessions, we would like to see the matter conducted properly in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While we do not want anyone to exhibit his consecration, we do want men to testify of their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church does not dictate how the brothers and sisters should dispose of their wealth; it can be done according to any of the above six ways.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This refers to the brothers and sisters who have handed themselves over to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to have a proper testimony in this matter, we need witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A believer acts for the purpose of testimony and fellowship, not for boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is like the Lord's death; it was not a boasting, but a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Worldly men, however, die for their friends for the purpose of boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Gospels the Lord said that we should not let the left hand know what the right hand is doing, but by the time of Acts things had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There must be a proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, one does not publicize his acts with a loud gong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our acceptance of the Lord and our faith in Him are mysteries, but baptism is a concrete step we take.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When something is concrete, it is certain, like cement mixed with water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Love is abstract, but marriage is concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A person may experience a change in a hidden way, but when we ask this person to stand up to testify, his change becomes certain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Personally, I am disinclined to ask others to stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If anyone encourages men to stand up, however, I certainly have no objection to this exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Any concrete or "mechanical" act is sure and trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spiritual things cannot remain spiritual; they have to become concrete and "mechanical."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may say that we are following the example of 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, but who knows how much we have offered up and how much we have held back?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one makes an audit of our account, and no one is there to be our accountant.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The best thing for us to do is to make a public confession.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once we make a public confession, we turn our action into something concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people are visible when they walk in but become invisible when they walk out.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our Lord, however, came visibly and left visibly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is wrong to walk in visibly and walk out invisibly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to pay attention to the "mechanical" side of things, not merely the spiritual side.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we take care of the "mechanical" things, we make our actions concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For the sake of testimony in the conscience, we should make public confessions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In summary, we have to see that the love of mammon and our service to it is the root of all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a man tolerates mammon, it will be easy for him to indulge in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Wherever mammon is, there is pride and greed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must be delivered absolutely from the influence of mammon.</S>
