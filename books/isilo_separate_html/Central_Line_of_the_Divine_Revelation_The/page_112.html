By Being Renewed in Our Inner Man Day by Day</H2><P>Another way to enjoy the all-inclusive Christ is by being renewed in our inner man day by day (2 Cor. 4:16). Today we stress the matters of being revived every morning and of overcoming every day. However, Paul's word is that we must be "renewed day by day." We must not merely overcome; we must also be renewed. Daily our outer man is decaying, is being consumed, and our inner man is being renewed. This renewing of our inner man is of the Spirit within our spirit. This also is a way to enjoy Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>15. By Being Renewed as the New Creation in Christ</H2><P>Another way for us to enjoy Christ is by being renewed as the new creation in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). Formerly we were the old creation in Adam. Because we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ, we are now a new creation in Christ. This transfer is not only outward but also inward. The inward transfer is the renewing. We are being renewed from the old creation into the new creation. The New Testament uses the word renew quite often (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23; Col. 3:10; Titus 3:5). If we are to experience the renewing of the mind, the renewing in the spirit of our mind, the renewing of the new man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, we must be renewed in our inner man day by day. All these aspects of renewing are for us to enjoy Christ as the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>16. By the Fellowship of the Spirit<br>in the Enjoyment of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>We can enjoy Christ as the Spirit also by the fellowship of the Spirit in the enjoyment of the Divine Trinity. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." The grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit are all for our enjoyment. God's love is embodied in Christ's grace, and Christ's grace is dispensed by the fellowship of the Spirit. Today as we are in the fellowship of the Spirit, we participate in the grace of Christ and enjoy the love of God. This enjoyment of the Divine Trinity is altogether in the fellowship of the Spirit, which is in our spirit. Therefore, we must learn the lesson either to remain in our spirit or to come back to our spirit. We must learn not to be absent from our spirit. If we find ourselves away from the spirit, we should do our best to come back to the spirit. In our spirit we meet the Spirit of fellowship. By the fellowship of this Spirit we participate in the enjoyment of the Triune God in every way. This enjoyment is the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_111.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_113.html">Next</a> </body></html>
