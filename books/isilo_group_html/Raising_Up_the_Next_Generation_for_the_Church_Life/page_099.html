AND PRAYING DESPERATELY</h2>
<p>Our testimony needs to be strengthened. The saints who are wandering outside are scattered and not enjoying the riches of our family. They are truly like the prodigal son who could not find even carob pods to eat (Luke 15:13-16). But in the Father&rsquo;s house, in God&rsquo;s house, which is the church, the food is plentiful. Therefore, we must be compassionate toward them and bring them home to enjoy the riches in the Father&rsquo;s house with us.</p>
<p>Before going out, we need to pray thoroughly. I can absolutely testify to the effectiveness of prayer. In 1932, when the Lord raised up the church in Chefoo, I could see the effectiveness of our prayer every day. The Lord would bring people in ways that were quite wonderful. We have to believe that our concern matches the Lord&rsquo;s concern on the throne; in fact, His concern has touched us to be concerned for others. Thus, we must receive a burden to pray. In the beginning we may not know the names of the ones who need to be restored. We may only know that there are forty to fifty thousand who need our prayer. We can tell the Lord, &ldquo;Remember these saints.&rdquo; I believe that if two to three thousand pray daily, the Lord will hear our prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF VISITING</h2>
<p>Visiting dormant saints needs much consideration. If we do not do it properly, we will drive them further away. If our visiting will only drive them further away, it would be better not to visit them. When saints ask me what they should do when they visit, it is difficult to give a specific answer because I have found that my ways do not always work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A PRAYING AND LEARNING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Consider the example of boxing. A teacher may teach boxing in the classroom in one way, but when it comes to the actual boxing match, the teacher&rsquo;s instructions may not work. In a boxing match, one has to make adjustments according to the actual situation. Consequently, the most important matter in visiting is to have a praying and learning spirit, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, only You can restore this one.&rdquo; None of us can do this in ourselves. Those with no experience will certainly face difficulties, but even those with experience cannot rely on what they have learned in the past, because every person&rsquo;s situation is different. We must look to the Lord, praying, &ldquo;Have mercy on me. I can do nothing. Give me the wisdom and the words I need to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELYING ON THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>As we seek out the saints, we must rely on the work of the Holy Spirit. I truly believe that my return to the meetings was altogether the work of the Holy Spirit; it was the Holy Spirit who brought me back. The work of the Spirit is likened in Luke 15 to a woman who lights a lamp to seek a lost coin. The Holy Spirit is able to shine upon the saints with the Lord&rsquo;s word and is willing to search for them until they are found (vv. 8-9). (<em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery, Book 4: The Increase and Spread of the Church,</em> pp. 162, 163-165, 165-166, 172)</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOVE BEING THE MOST EXCELLENT WAY</h2>
<p>The end of 1 Corinthians 12 reveals that love is the most excellent way (v. 31b). How can one be an elder? Love is the most excellent way. How can one be a co-worker? Love is the most excellent way. How do we shepherd people? Love is the most excellent way. Love is the most excellent way for us to prophesy and to teach others. Love is the most excellent way for us to be anything or do anything.</p>
<p>The church is not a police station to arrest people or a law court to judge people, but a home to raise up the believers. Parents know that the worse their children are, the more they need their raising up. If our children were angels, they would not need our parenting to raise them up. The church is a loving home to raise up the children. The church is also a hospital to heal and to recover the sick ones. Finally, the church is a school to teach and edify the unlearned ones who do not have much understanding. Because the church is a home, a hospital, and a school, the co-workers and elders should be one with the Lord to raise up, to heal, to recover, and to teach others in love.</p>
<p>Some of the churches, however, are police stations to arrest the sinful ones and law courts to judge them. Paul&rsquo;s attitude was different. He said, &ldquo;Who is weak, and I am not weak?&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:29a). When the scribes and Pharisees brought an adulterous woman to the Lord, He said to them, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&rdquo; (John 8:7). After all of them left, the Lord asked the sinful woman, &ldquo;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;No one, Lord.&rdquo; Then Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you&rdquo; (vv. 10-11). Who is without sin? Who is perfect? Paul said, &ldquo;To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:22). This is love. We should not consider that others are weak but we are not. This is not love. Love covers and builds up, so love is the most excellent way for us to be anything and to do anything for the building up of the Body of Christ. (<em>The Vital Groups,</em> pp. 74, 75)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>We need to have this kind of love and go to tell all the dormant ones who think that the church condemns them that the church does not condemn anyone. Rather, the church wants to see all the dormant ones come back. If they all would come back, I would weep with tears of thanksgiving to the Lord. The Lord can testify for me that I do not condemn anyone. We have no qualification to condemn anyone. Without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we would be the same as the dormant ones. Therefore, we must love them. It all depends upon love, as the wise king Solomon said, &ldquo;Love covers all transgressions&rdquo; (Prov. 10:12). We love people. We love the opposers, and we love the top rebels. I really mean it. We love them and do not hate them. Who am I? I am not qualified to condemn or to hate. Am I perfect? Even the prophet Isaiah, when he saw the Lord, said, &ldquo;Woe is me, for I am finished! / For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell&rdquo; (Isa. 6:5). Who is clean today? If we criticize people and say something bad about them, we are not clean. (<em>A Word of Love to the Co-workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord,</em> pp. 32-33)</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOVE BEING THE GREATEST</h2>
<p>Love is not jealous, is not provoked, does not take account of evil, covers all things, endures all things, never falls away, and is the greatest (1 Cor. 13:4-8, 13).</p>
<p>The elders need to realize that in their shepherding, they have to cover others&rsquo; sins, not to take account of others&rsquo; evils. Love covers all things, not only the good things but also the bad things. Whoever uncovers the defects, shortcomings, and sins of the members of the church is disqualified from the eldership. Our uncovering of the members under our eldership, our shepherding, annuls our qualification. Love also endures all things and never falls away. First Corinthians 13 concludes by saying, &ldquo;Now there abide faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.&rdquo; (<em>The Vital Groups,</em> pp. 71, 72)</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_098.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_100.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life &nbsp; pg 99</div><br></body></html>
