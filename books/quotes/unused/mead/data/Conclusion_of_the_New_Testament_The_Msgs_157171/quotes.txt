[2]  1 Having Been Regenerated into the Kingdom of God
[3]  Likewise, if we did not have the divine life, the life of God, we could not enter the kingdom of God.
[4]  a Having Received of God's Divine Power All Things Relating to Life and Godliness
[5]  In verse 5 Peter urges us to supply bountifully in our faith virtue.
[6]  What the divine power has given us in verses 3 and 4 is developed in verses 5 through 7.
[7]  We must have this knowledge developed in our virtue.
[8]  We have entered into the kingdom through regeneration John 3:3, 5 , but we still need a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ through growth in the divine life 2 Pet 1:5-11 .
[9]  a In the Heavenly Nature of the Kingdom People
[10]  Those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens are poor in spirit, they mourn for the present situation, they are meek in suffering opposition, they hunger and thirst for righteousness, they are merciful toward others, they are pure in heart, they make peace with all men, they suffer persecution for righteousness, and they are reproached and evil spoken of.
[11]  The spirit here refers not to the Spirit of God but to our human spirit, the deepest part of our being, the organ for us to contact God and realize spiritual things.
[12]  In verse 8 the Lord goes on to say, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[13]  Our spirit is the organ to receive Christ John 1:12; 3:6 , whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows Matt 13:19 .
[14]  For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be poor in spirit, empty in our spirit, that we may receive Christ.
[15]  b As the Salt of the Earth to Restrict Its Corruption, and as the Light of the World to Enlighten It
[16]  In speaking of the believers' influence upon the world, the Lord Jesus tells us that we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world vv.
[17]  d Doing Righteousness and Contacting God in Secret, Not Making a Show of It
[18]  Matthew 6:1-18 concerns the righteous deeds of the kingdom people.
[19]  The Lord says, "Take heed not to do your righteousness before men to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you surely have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens" v. 1 . Man's flesh, seeking to glorify itself, always wants to do good deeds before others to be praised by them.
[20]  But those believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, who live in an emptied and humble spirit and walk in a pure and single heart under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, are not allowed to do anything in the flesh for the praise of men, but must do all things in the spirit for the pleasing of their heavenly Father.
[21]  As we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we shall deal with ourselves more than with others 7:1-12 .
[22]  Those believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, corporately experiencing the dispensing of the divine Trinity, will take the way which leads to life and will take the words of Christ as the ground for their living and work to do the will of the Father to build up the church for the corporate expression of the Triune God.
[23]  In this message we shall cover some further matters related to the believers' experiencing the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God.
[24]  Today the believers live the kingdom life in the church, for the church is the kingdom of God in this age Matt 16:18-19; 1 Cor 6:10; Gal 5:21; Eph 5:5 .
[25]  Finally, living the kingdom life in the church requires that we live joyfully to God in the Holy Spirit.
[26]  If we are truly living the kingdom life, we shall be joyful with God, praising Him.
[27]  In Matthew 5:10-12 the Lord Jesus said that His believers suffer persecution for the sake of the kingdom.
[28]  The kingdom of God is the church life, and the church life is a realm of the enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ. b In Endurance
[29]  Shortly before Paul was martyred, he had the assurance that the Lord would bring him into the heavenly kingdom.
[30]  The heavenly kingdom is the kingdom of our Father Matt 13:43 , the kingdom of the Father Matt 26:29 , the kingdom of Christ and of God Eph 5:5 , and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 2 Pet 1:11 , which will be a reward to the overcoming saints.
[31]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 44
[32]  In the foregoing messages we saw that, in the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God.
[33]  In this message we shall begin to see that the believers experience this dispensing corporately also by living in the church. b.
[34]  In the first preaching of the New Testament gospel people were told to repent because the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near Matt 3:2; 4:17; 10:7 .
[35]  This meant that the time had come for God to dispense Himself as life into people.
[36]  The gospel brings God as life, and this life is the kingdom.
[37]  Because the kingdom is the reality of the church, according to the New Testament revelation, we cannot live the church life apart from the proper kingdom life.
[38]  Christ as life is the essence, the substance, for us to live a proper life so that in this life we may be built up with other believers to bring in the real church life, which is a glorious expression of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.
[39]  The first stanza of Hymns, #841 speaks of Christ as our life for the building of the church:
[40]  Let us consider the type of Adam and Eve in more detail.
[41]  According to the book of Genesis, God did not create man and woman at the same time and in the same way.
[42]  In the previous message we saw that as the spontaneous issue of our experience of the dispensing of the divine Trinity, we have the kingdom life, and the reality of the kingdom life is the content of the church life.
[43]  Therefore, to say that we live in the church means that we live in the dwelling place of God and in the family of God. a The House of the Living God
[44]  b The Pillar and the Base of the Truth
[45]  In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul tells us that the church of the living God is "the pillar and base of the truth."
[46]  As the pillar which bears the truth and the base which upholds the pillar, the church testifies the reality, the truth, of Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.
[47]  When a church grows in Christ with the growth of God Col 2:19 , it will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on earth and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world.
[48]  Matthew 18:17 reveals that the believers are to obey the church.
[49]  The church revealed in Matthew 16:18 is the universal church, the unique Body of Christ, whereas the church revealed in Matthew 18:17 is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality.
[50]  The believers not only obey the church Matt 18:17 and meet with the church 1 Cor 14:23a, 26a but also serve in the church.
[51]  In the church some brothers serve as deacons Phil 1:1; 1 Tim 3:8 and some sisters serve as deaconesses Rom 16:1 .
[52]  If we are those who experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by living in the church, we shall function in the church meetings.
[53]  Furthermore, according to the context of the entire book of 1 Corinthians, a book which speaks of Christ as the wisdom and power of God and the deep things of God, and of the church as the Body to express Christ and as the means to carry out God's administration, the proper tongue-speaking should be concerning Christ and the church. e With an Interpretation
[54]  The psalm should be the praise of God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life.
[55]  To grow in the church is to have the genuine growth of life, which is the increase of the element of God, the increase of the stature of Christ, and the expansion of the ground of the Holy Spirit within us.
[56]  The increase of the element of God means that more of God Himself is blended into us, is gained by us, and becomes our element.
[57]  The more we love Christ, seek Christ, and allow Christ to live in us, the more the stature of Christ increases within us.
[58]  As we live in the church, we love all the brothers; that is, we love one another.
[59]  10 Forgiving the Brothers and Forgiving One Another in the Church
[60]  In the church life the believers forgive one another.
[61]  Referring to Christ, the cornerstone, Paul in Ephesians 2:22 says, "In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit."
[62]  In 3:12 the Lord says to the church in Philadelphia, the recovered church, "He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name."
[63]  The believers may overcome the degradation of the church by the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God.
[64]  The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God, because they are ranked among the Triune God in Revelation 1:4 and 5.
[65]  Immediately, the Lord went on to speak again concerning the kingdom, saying to Peter, "I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in the heavens" v. 19 . Here the Lord was indicating that He would give to Peter the keys of the kingdom of the heavens so that he might open the door for people to come into the kingdom in order that the Lord may build them into the church.
[66]  In the following chapters the church is brought in.
[67]  The first mention of the church in Acts is in 5:11.
[68]  The first step of the believers' living in the Body of Christ is to be baptized in one Spirit into one Body.
[69]  As the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism and in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, be this one Body.
[70]  The believers of Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into Christ, the death of Christ Rom 6:3 , the name the Person of the Triune God Matt 28:19 , and the Body of Christ.
[71]  Today we are not only in the Triune God, in Christ, and in the death of Christ we are in the Body of Christ, the church.
[72]  3 Being Constituted of Christ to Be His One Body
[73]  As believers in Christ, we are being constituted of Christ to be His one Body.
[74]  In Greek Christ here is "the Christ," referring to the corporate Christ, composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as its members.
[75]  8 Through Transformation by the Renewing of Their Mind, Not Conformed to This Age, to Know the Will of God
[76]  Romans 12 indicates that after our body has been presented to the Lord for His Body, we need to be transformed in our soul by the renewing of the mind so that we may prove the will of God, which is to have a body for Christ produced out of the organic union.
[77]  In verse 2 Paul says, "Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect."
[78]  9 By Being Burning in Their Spirit, Not Slothful in Zeal, to Serve the Lord as a Slave
[79]  The believers practice the Body life also by functioning in different gifts.
[80]  Finally, the believers live in the Body of Christ by living a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love Rom 12:9-10, 12-21 .
[81]  1 By Putting Off the Old Man with Its Corrupted Living in the Lusts of the Deceit
[82]  The believers put on the new man by putting off the old man with its corrupted living in the lusts of the deceit.
[83]  3 According to God in His Image Who Created the New Man in Righteousness and Holiness of the Truth
[84]  Because the new man has been created in Christ and with Christ according to God, the new man bears the image of God.
[85]  4 Having Christ as All the Members and in All the Members, Leaving No Room for Race, Religion, Culture, or Social Status
[86]  After referring to the new man in Colossians 3:10, Paul goes on to say in verse 11, "Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all."
[87]  In this message we shall see that in the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately also by wrestling against the Devil and his spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies Eph 6:10-20 . e. Wrestling against the Devil and His Spiritual Forces of Evil in the Heavenlies
[88]  2 Putting on the Whole Armor of God to Stand against the Stratagems of the Devil
[89]  In Ephesians 6:11 Paul says, "Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the Devil."
[90]  To fight the spiritual warfare we need not only the power of the Lord but also the armor of God.
[91]  3 Praying in Spirit and Watching in All Perseverance for All the Saints and the Apostles
[92]  The believers wrestle against the Devil and his spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies not only by being empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength and by putting on the whole armor of God but also by praying in spirit and watching in all perseverance for all the saints and the apostles.
[93]  In Ephesians 6:18 Paul says specifically that we are to pray in our spirit, that is, in our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.
[94]  We have seen that, in the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God, by living in the church, and by living in the Body of Christ.
[95]  The believers experience the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity in various other aspects, including serving and worshipping God, working and laboring for the Lord, not loving the world, overcoming Satan, fighting the good fight, running the course of the race, being profited by all things in their circumstances and environments, having the best attitude toward others, and watching and praying.
[96]  In the New Testament serving God is actually the same thing as worshipping God.
[97]  Referring to the kingdoms of the world and their glory, the Devil said to Him, "All these will I give You if You will fall down and worship me" v. 9 . The Lord Jesus answered, "It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve" v. 10 . Here we see that to worship actually means to serve.
[98]  2 In Their Spirit in the Gospel of God's Son
[99]  The believers not only serve God in their spirit but also serve Him by the Spirit of God.
[100]  In Philippians 3:3a Paul says, "We are the circumcision, who serve by the Spirit of God."
[101]  Hence, the Lord's word in John 4:23 and 24 about worshipping God the Spirit in spirit and reality means that we should contact God the Spirit in our spirit, instead of in a specific place, and through Christ, instead of with the offerings, for now, because Christ the reality has come, all the shadows and types are over.
[102]  Finally, in serving and worshipping God the believers should have no confidence in their flesh.
[103]  By contrast, Paul says strongly that we who believe in Christ serve by the Spirit of God, boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
[104]  We have seen that the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity in serving and worshipping God.
[105]  First Corinthians 15:10 indicates how Paul worked and labored for the Lord by His resurrection life and power: "By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me."
[106]  Grace, mentioned three times in this verse, is actually the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit v. 45 to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection.
[107]  Our labor for the Lord in His resurrection life with His resurrection power will never be in vain, but will result in fulfilling God's eternal purpose through preaching Christ to sinners, ministering life to the saints, and building up the church with the experiences of the processed Triune God as gold, silver, and precious stones 1 Cor 3:12 , and will be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous 1 Cor 3:14; Matt 25:21, 23; Luke 14:14 .
[108]  3 Preaching Christ as the Gospel to Sinners by Preaching the Word
[109]  As they work and labor for the Lord, the believers preach Christ as the gospel to sinners by preaching the word.
[110]  Acts 5:42 says that the apostles did not cease "bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ," that is, they did not cease preaching Christ as the gospel.
[111]  5 Ministering Christ as Life to the Saints with the Nourishing Words of the New Testament Faith
[112]  In 1 Timothy 4:6 Paul says, "Laying these things before the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have closely followed."
[113]  A minister of Christ does not mainly denote a minister who belongs to Christ but a person who ministers Christ to others.
[114]  A minister of Christ is one who serves others with Christ, ministering Christ as Savior, life, life supply, and every positive thing.
[115]  6 Shepherding the Saints as the Flock of God according to God, That Is, according to God's Nature, Desire, Way, and Glory
[116]  In Acts 20:28 Paul says to the elders in Ephesus, "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood."
[117]  The main responsibility of the elders as overseers is not to rule over the flock but to shepherd the flock, to take all-inclusive tender care of the flock, the church of God.
[118]  Shepherding the flock of God requires suffering for the Body of Christ as Christ did Col 1:24 .
[119]  In this message we shall see that the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the matters of not loving the world and of overcoming Satan the Devil. c.
[120]  2 Not Loving All That Is in the World the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eyes, and the Vainglory of Life
[121]  The world in verse 15 denotes an evil, Satanic, anti-God system that is constituted of the things created by God.
[122]  4 Not Conformed to This Age the Present Part of the World
[123]  Revelation 12:11 also tells us that we can overcome Satan because of the word of our testimony.
[124]  In this message we shall consider two further aspects of the believers' experience of the dispensing of the divine Trinity: fighting the good fight and running the course of the race. e. Fighting the Good Fight
[125]  In particular, it is to fight for Christ as the embodiment of God and for the church as the Body of Christ.
[126]  3 For the Faith Once for All Delivered to the Saints
[127]  In 1 Timothy 6:12a Paul says, "Fight the good fight of the faith," and in 2 Timothy 4:7c he says, "I have kept the faith."
[128]  Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens as the Son of God Heb 1:5 and the Son of Man 2:6 , as the appointed Heir of all things 1:2 , the anointed One of God 1:9 , the Captain of our salvation 2:10 , the Sanctifier 2:11 , the instant Helper and constant Succor 2:18 , the Apostle from God 3:1 , the High Priest 2:17; 4:14; 7:26 , the Minister in the true tabernacle 8:2 with a more excellent ministry 8:6 , the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant 7:22; 8:6; 12:24 , the Executor of the new testament 9:16-17 , the Forerunner 6:20 , the Author and Perfecter of faith 12:2 , and as the great Shepherd of the sheep 13:20 .
