Sadly, there is a problem: once a person comes, his heart comes, and his ways of doing things also come with him
If man does not contain God, there is no meaning to his human existence because man was specially created for God's use
Proverbs 20:27 says, 'The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all the innermost parts of the inner being'
The soul is the true 'I' and what the psychologists refer to as the metaphysical being-something that can be felt but not touched
When we were saved, we used our heart and spirit to receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior, and the Lord's Spirit came into our spirit
They can do this by restraining his hands and feet, not allowing him to resist, and then injecting the medicine into him
The couple said, 'If God had not given us this child, we surely would not have been able to have one by ourselves'
It was at this moment that a believer came to them and said, 'In the past you only wanted the child that God gave you but not God Himself
When the child was about to be put into the coffin, his mother was crying and said that she wanted to be put into the coffin with him
If God wants to work in us but we do not cooperate with Him, He will use some ways to make us willing to cooperate with Him
If Christians are willing to allow God to work in them, the first thing they have to do is to turn their heart to God
The elderly sisters desire the Lord, but many also desire their children, and many also desire to find a good wife for their son
If we say that they do not love the Lord, we do them an injustice, but if we say that they love the Lord, we do the Lord an injustice
Some people have half of their heart turned to God, while other people have their heart completely turned away from God
When a veil is put on someone's face, it covers his eyes, but when the veil is taken away, he is able to see the light
When the heart of the Corinthians was turned away from the Lord, the veil was still on their heart; their turned-away heart was the veil
Whenever the veil was taken away and their heart was turned to the Lord, the Corinthians would receive God's shining
The reason man does not receive God's shining is not because God does not shine, but because there is a veil and a covering within man
Even the pursuit of spirituality can replace God and become a covering of the light, causing one's inner being to be without light
When a person is not pure, it is often the case that although he loves the Lord, his love for the Lord is superficial
He does not realize that his love for his face instead of the Lord becomes a covering, hindering him from receiving the light
Whenever someone comes to him, without the other person saying anything, he knows his background merely by 'touching' him
When we want to speak something to him, within us we first have to weigh, to measure, whether or not he is able to receive our word
If while we 'weigh' him, we sense that he will not be able to receive our word, then it is better not to say anything
When others receive praise, we have a certain kind of feeling; when we receive praise, we have another kind of feeling
When the veil is not taken away, there is no light, but once the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away
Once our heart turns to the Lord and desires the Lord in a single and pure way, we become a person who is pure in heart
One who is pure in heart does not covet anything in the world; neither does he covet anything in the spiritual realm
Once a person who loves to boast begins to do so, his inner being has no freedom because the Lord Spirit is bound within him
We all can testify that we do have a particular feeling inside of us when we love money; we feel bound and oppressed within
When we open our mouth to pray, others will know that there is something wrong with us-the Lord within us is not free; He is bound in us
If we are willing to turn to the Lord, who has been bound within us, we will immediately receive freedom and be full of light
When people point out their mistakes, they are not only unwilling to admit them, but they also provide many excuses
Everyone should have these feelings within, but eventually due to their continual practice of arguing, their inner feeling is lost
Even when we do something reasonable, we should not fight for it, because even our 'reasonableness' has a little bit of the self in it
As long as we have light and feeling within, we should accept the breaking and the dealing that comes from this light
We also serve the Lord fervently, but there is no light or reality in our serving, and we do not know why we are serving
We live the so-called spiritual life day by day without any fresh spiritual vision and our inner being seems to lack something
His inner being is always clear and certain about the direction of his serving and the move of the Holy Spirit
Not only does he know the direction of the move of the church, but he also knows God's purpose for the church on the earth
We all have the feeling within us, yet often we are not willing to receive the breaking that comes with the feeling
If we feel uneasy or confused in a certain area, this is where we need to receive light and breaking from the Lord
Once a person is saved and becomes a Christian, he should know what steps he needs to take to progress in the Christian life
Although they listen to messages, read the Bible, and attend meetings all the time, they still have not made any progress
Even though they may understand Genesis 1, Matthew 1, and many teachings in the Bible, they do not understand the way of the Lord
In the same way, we are like the cup; if we are not willing to allow the Lord to cleanse us, the Lord cannot do anything with us
One day the Lord came; His gospel reached us, His voice entered into our heart, His Spirit sympathized with us, and we were saved
The problem is here: although we allowed the Lord to 'pick us out of the trash,' we have never allowed Him to make us clean and fresh
Today when we receive the Lord and 'put His blood on us,' the judgment of God and the wrath of God pass over us, and we are saved
Immediately following the Feast of the Passover, the children of Israel kept another feast, which is called the Feast of Unleavened Bread
The children of Israel kept the Feast of the Passover in the evening on the fourteenth day of the first month of the year
The beginning of the Feast of the Passover could also be said to be the beginning of the Feast of Unleavened Bread
Once we are saved and we keep the Feast of the Passover, we also should keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread immediately
A teenager's mind may be very clean and pure, but once he goes to high school, he may begin to read romance novels
Some people say that movies are good and that they can be very helpful if they are used for educational purposes
It is true that in some aspects movies may be quite useful, but unfortunately, in these days people misuse movies
Many times although the movie itself is good, due to the improper environment in which it is viewed, many problems arise
After the children of Israel kept the Feast of the Passover, they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread right away
Today many Christians keep the Feast of the Passover, but there are very few who also keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread
We all sat there singing and praising God, but there was a calendar with an improper picture on it hanging on the wall
If they give them to their classmates, they are not doing their classmates a favor; rather, they are doing them harm
Nearly all of their wives were saved, yet their houses were filled with either mah-jongg games or Chinese dominoes
If you have already smelled the stinking odor of mah-jongg, you do not need to ask people whether or not you should play it'
Finally, they went back, spread this word amongst one another, and gathered together all their mah-jongg games
If we are willing to go to the Lord and check with ourselves completely, we will find that our entire being is full of leaven
He said, 'This young man has stolen three pounds and eighteen shillings from his master and even until now he has not returned the money
Many Christians have no problem with their salvation, but they have never dealt with all their unrighteous possessions
If we want to follow the Lord in a serious way, we should deal with all the idols, the ancestral tablets, and the stolen things in our homes
We need to let Him enlighten us and show us if there is anything in our homes in our being or in our surroundings that is unpleasing to Him
After one sister believed in the Lord she felt very unpeaceful when she recalled all the times that she had been hard on her daughterinlaw
We should not be careless or excuse ourselves in these matters; rather, we should carefully purge out all the leaven
He must deal with every situation that is improper in the eyes of the Lord and every matter that is condemned by the Lord
He should not only deal with the outward things, but he should confess to the Lord, from deep within, all his inward sins
He may have many outward problems that are condemnable, but his inward problems and his inward evil far exceed his outward problems
His outward problems are related merely to behavior, but his inward problems are related to his mind, opinion, and even more, to his self
Inside of man there are sin, iniquity, and darkness, but outwardly these things may not seem to be expressed at all
Much of man's outward behavior is condemnable, but his inward evil is many times more deserving of condemnation
We all confess that the Lord Jesus is our Savior, but until today we still may not have confessed all our inward sins before God
Of course, this word is not false; a person can be full of sins but still not have any sense that he is sinful
Before a person meets God, he thinks that he is good, but once he touches God, immediately he realizes that he is wrong
Many doctors say that under strong enough light and a powerful microscope, everything a person sees will look dirty
There are at least four things in us which are unclean: our upper lip, our lower lip, our tongue, and our throat
One day when we are truly enlightened by God, we will see that there is no other part of our body that sins more than our lips
When someone really touches God, he will immediately see that he does not have only a few individual sins but piles upon piles of sins
One day he became sick and began to suffer from several diseases: high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, and so forth
One day he became really desperate and started to consider, while lying on his bed, what kind of person he was
The more he thought about himself the more he found himself good the more he assessed himself further the more he still found himself good
He opened the Bible read a little and suddenly he discovered that something was wrong in his beingsomething that he had never found before
His three friends told him that he must have sinned before God but Job did not agree and wanted to argue with God to see where his sins were
One who has never touched God or seen the light, even though he is filthy and unclean, does not have any feeling of filthiness
One day Augustine suddenly had a feeling and asked himself why he was living in debauchery and not turning to God
It seemed that before he began to confess, there was not much sin, but the more he confessed, the more severe and abundant the sins became
Even though he had already confessed everything, he still felt that even the regret in his confession needed to be forgiven by the Lord
Many people do not have any problem with their salvation, but it is questionable whether or not they have ever had a thorough confession
Once they pray, they immediately sense that they are sinful, and the more they confess, the more they find themselves full of sins
Another kind of person, after fellowshipping with the saints, feels that he should go to God and be enlightened by Him
The father then may take out a mirror and ask him to look at his dirty face, and the child would go to wash his face
He will stay this way until the day when God shines on him and shows him his sinful condition, and he begins to confess his sins
In addition, this feeling toward his corruptness, evil, and wrongdoing will keep him coming to God for His shining and cleansing
Even if we have decided to do a certain thing and then God shines on us, we should not do it; rather, we should confess our sins
If a Christian wants to grow in life, two things are essential: He must confess his sins thoroughly to the Lord and deal with his sins
The confession of sins focuses on what is on the inside while dealing with sins focuses on what is on the outside
To confess sins is to tell God the condition of one's heart and to confess to God all the sins that one feels inwardly
The inward confession of sins plus the outward dealing with sins-the two combined together-are a complete experience
If so, every single message we hear will be profitable to us, and every verse of the Bible that we read will be a supply to us
We can see that in addition to confessing and dealing with our sins, consecrating ourselves to the Lord is of great importance
The more we believe in God, the more we realize His existence; and the more we believe in Him, the more we sense His presence
If we ask someone who worships Buddha whether Buddha is lovely or not, he will say that he has never thought about this
These two things were competing for this person-the Lord was competing from within while the cards were competing from without
It is not a matter of 'knowing,' because knowing is just a matter of our mind; rather, it is a matter of 'feeling'
While committing the sin, he may, on the one hand, enjoy the pleasures of sin while, on the other hand, still feel that the Lord is lovely
On the one hand, we do like lustful things, fashion, and clothing, but on the other hand, we feel that the Lord is truly lovely
After someone is saved, if he wants to have a rich experience of the Lord, the first step he needs to take is consecration
For our prayers to be answered faith is of vital importance however those who have never given themselves to the Lord cannot have much faith
If a Christian does not have light within him, this shows that inwardly he is still somewhat turned away from God
All children of God should be filled with the Holy Spirit, and it should be easy for them to receive the filling of the Holy Spirit
It is not man who waits for God's grace, but it is God who is waiting for man to receive Him as grace day by day
If after a period of time he feels that his past consecration was not thorough enough, he should consecrate himself thoroughly a second time
The more he consecrates to the Lord like this, the more he will touch the Lord and the more he will be gained by the Lord
If we present ourselves to God in this way, the result will be that we know the well pleasing and perfect will of God
No one had ever told her that she should not wear that dress, and she had never read in the Bible that she should not wear such a dress
After her consecration when she had taken the dress out of her closet, within her she felt that she should not
After she left the house, she had the feeling that she should go back into the house, but she still did not understand why
While she was walking, her inner being was arguing with her, 'You could wear this dress in the past but not today
When she arrived at the entrance of the meeting hall, the urging within her to go home made her very uncomfortable
After she came back to the meeting hall in another dress, the meeting that day was enjoyable to her in an unprecedented way
Once our heart turns to God, we will immediately have God's feeling and know what is of God and what is not of God
By doing this, he will have the Lord's presence within, and he will be able to have fellowship with the Lord and to have the Lord's feeling
May He save each one of us from being one who merely listens to doctrines and cause us to be those who walk on His way with a turned heart
Ephesians 4:19 also says, 'Who, being past feeling , have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness'
If the saints are willing to take these three things to the Lord and practice them in a serious way, they surely will have progress in life
These words are only guidelines; only when the saints seriously walk the way of the Lord will these words be profitable to them
People who know God should know that before the fall of Adam, man lived before God and had no need of the conscience
Although candlelight is weak, it is not without function; when the sun has set, the candlelight starts to function
Since man fell and left the face of God, God was forced to use the conscience as His representative in enlightening man
The first dispensation is called the dispensation of innocence; it is the time when man received direct ruling from God
At this time the dispensation of law began, and man started to be penalized if he disobeyed the laws of the nation
The fourth time we stole candy, our heart did not beat any heavier than normal because our conscience did not have any more feeling
At that point it seemed that to steal candy was nothing; the only thing we feared was being caught by our parents
He lives this way because God has already saved him from living by human rule and has caused him to live by his conscience
Many people are truly saved, but sadly, many Christian wives still deceive their husbands and tell lies in front of their children
You just calculate an approximate amount and then add a little more as long as your conscience does not condemn you then this is good enough
He went back and calculated the amount, signed a check, wrote a sincere letter, and told the electric company the whole story
Shortly after this, a brother who ran an electronics store went to the electric company to talk with someone concerning a few matters
The brother testified to the accountant what had happened, and the head accountant was deeply touched when he heard it
At that time traveling from Nanking to Shanghai was very convenient there was a direct train that went back and forth between the two cities
Most rebellious and lawless people first disobey God, then disregard their conscience, and third, defy the law
She said that it was not a problem to pay the money back, but she did not know how to calculate the amount or how to return the money
If he does not deal with his conscience, his Bible reading will be tasteless and his gospel preaching will be powerless
All the saved ones have to pass through this stage of dealing with their conscience if they want to go further on the way
Our conscience is like a window and our being is like a room; the light that the room receives must pass through the window
Originally, there is no light inside of us but only darkness, but our conscience is like a window which allows the light to come in
Before we are saved, our conscience is like an extremely dirty window smudged with putty through which no light can penetrate
Once we are saved, the Holy Spirit enters into us to enlighten us, causing our inner being to be full of light
The wonderful thing is that before we wipe the window we do not know how dirty it is so the more we wipe it the dirtier it seems to become
One who desires to proceed on the path of God's life must deal with his conscience, because conscience and faith go together
Once we have a problem with our conscience, faith is gone, and once there is a hole in our conscience, faith leaks away
Timothy 119 says Holding faith and a good conscience concerning which some thrusting these away have become shipwrecked regarding the faith
If we have a feeling when we tell a lie for the first time, we should carefully deal with it and not allow it to pass away
If we do not, then after three or four experiences like this, the feeling in our conscience gradually will be lost
If we do this again and again, we will have no further feeling in our conscience; our conscience will become deadened
The conscience of many people is not a living conscience but a deadened conscience because telling lies has become their habit
A Christian will not be able to genuinely pray after he has lied, neither will he be able to genuinely pray after he has lost his temper
Some people say that they have seen Christians who have lost their temper but were able to pray immediately afterwards
If we confess our sins before God and deal with our sins before man, our inner being will be without sins and our conscience will be pure
We do not need to encourage people to be enthusiastic, because enthusiasm in blindness does not profit anything
If we want to follow God in life to walk on the way ahead of us, we must follow Him and fulfill His principles
If we want to serve and touch God we must always have the presence of God within us and we must be full of light and have faith all the time
As long as we thoroughly deal with our conscience, we will be able to walk on this path in a straight and proper way
Timothy 1:5 says, 'But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith'
Ephesians 4:19-20 mentions, 'Who, being past feeling , have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness
The demand of God and the grace of God are not incompatible with one another; rather, they are complementary to one another
Those who have studied physics should know that in this universe there are two different forces: centripetal force and centrifugal force
The reason why many things do not fall to the ground is that both centripetal force and centrifugal force are functioning together
Conversely, if there is only the watering of the rain without the shining of the sun, the plants will not be able to grow
If a Christian only receives God's grace and love without fulfilling God's demand, he definitely will not grow well
A proper Christian is neither careless nor does he do things in an incomplete way; rather, he thoroughly deals with his conscience
A person who confesses and deals with his sins, consecrates himself to God, and deals with his conscience will certainly receive more grace
Without the grace of God we have no way to fulfill all these demands, and if we do not fulfill the demands, we will not receive more grace
By the grace of God, we are able to fulfill God's demand; by the grace of God, we are able to deal with all sins
The building of this organization had caught on fire, and everyone tried his best to steal things from the company
When we are dealing with our sins, we have the presence of the Lord, and after we have dealt with our sins, we know more of the Lord
The more we know and experience grace, the more we will deal with our sins, and the more we receive grace, the more we will grow
In the beginning, man fell from the face of God to the conscience, and then from the conscience to human government
Those who live according to their conscience are not in the highest category of people, but they are comparatively good people
Husbands are afraid of being caught by their wives, while the wives are afraid of being caught by their husbands
Children are afraid of being caught by their parents, while the parents are afraid of being caught by their children
All those people who are merely afraid of man-the police, the judge, or the military police-are the lowest and most fallen people
Now, if we are children, we do not violate our family rules, and as ordinary people, we definitely are law-abiding people
A Christian who wants to live before God should experience God's salvation at least to the extent that he lives according to his conscience
Whatever is forbidden by the conscience is actually forbidden by God, and whatever is not pleasing to the conscience is not pleasing to God
Whatever is condemned by the conscience is condemned by God, and whatever is censured by the conscience is, in fact, censured by God
We have to carefully obey our conscience to deal with all the things that are condemned, censured, or forbidden by it
Once we come under the ruling of our conscience, we are immediately delivered from living under man's rule, and we live before God
At the end of the lunar year she wanted to buy something, not because she was following the world's custom, but because she had a need
Since she was serving the Lord full-time without receiving any salary, she did not always have money in her hand
He realized that the lunar new year was approaching and that if he remitted the money to her, it would arrive too late
The conscience is not necessarily God's speaking to us directly, but it is His speaking to us through our conscience
When this sister prayed, how could a co-worker who lived a few provinces away know that she needed one hundred and twenty Chinese yuan?
We have to know that many people may be right according to right and wrong, but nevertheless they may be wrong before God
You may say that this is very complicated and wonder how a person can be wrong related to right and wrong yet right related to the spirit
In terms of right and wrong, the wife may have been right; however, in terms of their persons, the brother was the one who was still right
Many times when we are before our conscience and before God, we have a feeling which goes deeper than right and wrong
If man does not receive God's shining to live according to his conscience, it will be hard for him to learn to know life
The first parable is about God's sending His slaves to work, and the second parable is about God's calling his people to enjoy
In the first parable God demands something of man, while in the second parable man receives everything from God
When God dealt with man according to the law, during the dispensation of the law, there was a particular situation with a particular result
In the following dispensation, when God deals with man according to grace, there is a different situation with a different result
It is not that the law was wrong, but that owing to the weakness and wickedness of man, man could not do anything good
The Lord shows us in the first parable that although God repeatedly asked man for fruit, He did not receive any fruit
We have to look to God to show us the principle of grace that we may see that everything is ready and has been prepared by God
In the dispensation of grace it is God who makes everything ready and prepares everything; man simply needs to enjoy
We already know that a person who wants to grow in life before God must confess his sins and deal with his sins and conscience
Also, Hebrews 9:14 tells us that we have to deal with our sins in order that we may serve the living God with a pure conscience
Did we not say that only the law demands things of people and that grace is all about enjoyment without any demand?
On the surface it seems that all these matters are demands, but in fact, in the New Testament everything is grace, absolutely grace
These two commandments-one in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament-are apparently the same, but actually they are not
It seems that the Old Testament and the New Testament are saying the same thing, and it is hard to tell the difference
Have we ever considered why in the Old Testament God wanted man to honor his parents, to be holy, to love Him, and so forth?
Man has no way to please God, and none of man's good behavior can meet God's requirements or be acceptable to God
To be more specific, the Lord's word here was not a command but an indication, showing man the way to receive more of God's abundant grace
After a person is saved, he has to confess his sins, deal with his sins and conscience, and consecrate himself to the Lord
By coming to the Lord in this way, we will see how much the power of God and the abundant grace of Christ can do in us
The Old Testament causes man to see his inability, while the New Testament is the way God opens His grace to man
Whenever we bring all these commandments and demands to God, He immediately opens the way to transmit His supply to us continually
Those who practice coming to the Lord in such a way will be blessed and will receive the bountiful supply from the Lord
God's demands in the New Testament, however, are not meant to be fulfilled by man alone but are meant to be fulfilled by God Himself
Whether this heart is strong or weak, all the saved ones do have such a heart, unless one never thinks about God or seeks God
Many times, however, because we do not desire Him that much, He has to use some winding ways to turn us back to Him
Although there are many things that are lovely, when they are compared with You, You are the most glorious One
God cannot do much in a person who has never allowed God to work in him and does not feel that God is loveable
As soon as a person rises up to love God, a problem will appear right away-this person will try his best to please God
It sounds very strange to say that we ask people to help us but that we do not want them to use their own strength
If someone asks you to help him to do something but does not want you to use your strength, this will be very hard for you to do
It would be very troublesome to you if this person wants your heart, but he does not want your wisdom or your way
We want to love God and please God with our own strength according to our own view and in our own way however God does not want any of this
In response, God not only will not help us, but He will worsen our environment to suppress us and cause us to be unable to do anything
It is because we have a heart to love God that He raises up the environment in order to break our effort and all of our methods
After she prayed such a prayer, her family situation became chaotic, her husband's temper was worse, and her children were naughtier
At this moment, we will live before God, and at this time, God will show us the glorious fact that apart from the Lord we can do nothing
At this time, we will praise and thank the Lord from within, and we will tell the Lord, 'Lord, You are my life, and You are my power'
The power of God is Christ, but in our experience several steps are needed for Christ to express His power from within us
After he was married, he was not able to read the Bible or fellowship with God properly because he had a problem before God
If he did not go to the meetings, his inner being would disagree, but if he went to the meetings, his inner being would be discouraged
In this way, Christ Himself is not expressed, and there is no way for Christ to be expressed as our life and power
Every time we make a resolution to please God, we have to realize that what follows will always be discipline, failures, and bankruptcy
For Christ to gain ground in us and be expressed through us, we have to allow our strength, our methods, and our wisdom to be broken by God
It is because man has too much strength, too many ways, and too much wisdom that Christ does not have any ground in him
A person who serves the Lord must be dealt with in these three matters, or there will be a lack in his service
The Bible tells us that man is the center of the universe , and that without man the purpose of God cannot be accomplished
God has a great deal of work that He desires to do in the universe, but He must gain the cooperation of man to accomplish His work
God's heart desires that man would love Him, but man's heart always loves something other than God, something that he should not love
If we read the Bible in a serious way, we should know that God's first demand on man is his heart, and second, his love
From the very beginning until the end, God just wants man to be for Him, and God desires that man would love Him with his heart
Some people love God so much that just hearing the name of God causes them to feel like they have received an electric shock
The secret of love is that you do not do things according to your own intention and will but according to his intention and his will
Today many people love the Lord and are zealous for the Lord, but their good intentions have never been broken by the Lord
The life and work of every fallen man is always directed by his thinking, and if his thinking is strong, it becomes his opinion
One brother however says that the gospel drums should be beaten in his way and if others do not accept his opinion he will not come again
The service of the church does not depend on the accomplishment of tasks but on the perfecting of the person who serves
We all need to receive God's dealing while we are in time so that we will be the kind of people that God desires
If this is the case, you not only do not know how to do things, but you do not even know how to conduct yourself as a proper human being
If we do something well, but people insist on saying that we did not do it well, our flesh will immediately be expressed in our temper
Before we ask a person for help, he does not have any opinions; however, once we ask him for help, all his opinions will come with him
While the Lord was in the house, those who took the temple tax came and asked Peter, 'Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax'?
The Lord told him to take the first fish that he caught, to take a stater out from its mouth, and then to take that to pay the tax
In the Old Testament, King David felt that he should prepare a sanctuary for God since he himself dwelt in a house of cedar
He set the Ark of God upon an ox cart, brought it out of the house of Abinadab from Baale-judah, and carried it to the city of David
When they had gone six paces David sacrificed an ox and a fatling girded himself with an ephod and danced with all his might before Jehovah
After the Lord was resurrected, He manifested Himself to Peter at the Sea of Tiberias and said to him, 'Do you love Me'?
Before he had said in a bold way that he would not be stumbled, yet he was stumbled three times in a single day
On that day at the Sea of Tiberias, the fact that the Lord asked him three times, 'Do you love Me,' really has a special meaning
At the Sea of Tiberius the Lord came in person to touch Peter's heart, and once the Lord's love came, all Peter's natural power was gone
