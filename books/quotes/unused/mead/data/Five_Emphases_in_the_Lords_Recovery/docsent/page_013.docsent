   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Dying an All-inclusive Death</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Jesus passed through human living for thirty years, He ministered for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then He went to the cross on Calvary to die an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By that death He terminated the old creation Col 1:20 , He crucified the old man Rom 6:6 , and He took away man's sin John 1:29 and sins 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He also judged Satan and Satan's world John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before His death, the entire universe had become old and was filled with all these negative items.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But through His unique death He cleared up all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the positive side, He was broken on the cross to release the divine life that was concealed within Him John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the cross He was pierced, and out came blood and water 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The blood symbolizes redemption, and the water symbolizes the flowing life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, He cleared up the whole universe through His redemption, His redeeming death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, He released the divine life within Him so that He might impart this life into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Accomplishing Three Main Items in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After His death He remained in Hades for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then He walked out of death and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His resurrection He accomplished three things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Becoming the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, through His resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before His resurrection He was the only begotten Son of God John 3:16 , the unique Son of God, but His humanity had not been brought into the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before His resurrection, He was the only begotten Son of God with divinity, but then He became a man with flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the Son of God in eternity past, He had only divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He had only the divine nature, not the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through resurrection His humanity was "sonized."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is now the Son of God with humanity and divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through His resurrection He sonized His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was the Son of God before His resurrection, but He was not yet the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His resurrection He was begotten of God to be the firstborn Son of God among many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Producing Many Sons of God</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In His resurrection He produced many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the second accomplishment of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to 1 Peter 1:3, God regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His resurrection was a great birth, a great delivery, in which He made all of us, His believers, the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I once read of someone who had seven children by one birth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But by the resurrection of Christ, millions and millions of children were born.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His resurrection He became the firstborn Son among many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to 1 Peter 1:3 we were born again about two thousand years ago when Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were all born in the same delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Jesus Christ was delivered as the firstborn Son, we were delivered as the many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In resurrection we all were born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Becoming a Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In His resurrection, Christ also became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the third accomplishment of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was the unique God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a man He died on the cross, was buried, and remained in Hades for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then He entered into resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today He is God, He is a man, and He is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is such a wonderful person!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The biography of Christ is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of God being a man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God being a man has been consummated in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, the Spirit who gives life is the aggregate of God plus man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He became a life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into our being to be our life and to remain within us as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We know that Jesus has come into us, but we need to realize that the story of this Jesus who has come into us is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was God in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then about four thousand years after the creation of man, He came into the womb of a virgin and was born of this woman to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God was linked with man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He lived thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, was buried for three days, and came out in resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the life-giving Spirit is the aggregate of God becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today He is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
