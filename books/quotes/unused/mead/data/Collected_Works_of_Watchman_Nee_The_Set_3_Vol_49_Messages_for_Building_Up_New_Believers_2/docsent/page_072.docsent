   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IF ONE NEEDS TO BE MARRIED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>YET CANNOT FIND A BELIEVER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a real problem; it is not an imaginary one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we can only say that there is no teaching in the Bible concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we need to touch Paul's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul wished that the widows would remain single if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But then, he also wished that the widows would marry those who are in the Lord v. 39 . Therefore, widows can remarry if there is the need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to this principle, we can say that the best thing for a brother to do is to marry a sister in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If it is not possible to do this, it is best if he does not marry at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, if he must marry, we still would be happy to see him marry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if the other party is an unbeliever, we still would like to see him marry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we say this, we are not advocating, as the world says, "Choose the lesser of two evils."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are saying that we would rather see a person commit a sin against God's government rather than a moral sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If by not marrying I fall into sin, I commit a moral sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I marry an unbelieving woman, I commit a sin against God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are two types of sin; one is moral sin, and the other is sin against God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please bear in mind that moral sin is more serious than sin against God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a brother needs to marry and he cannot find a sister, the best thing for him to do is stay single.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if he must marry, we should let him marry even if it means marrying an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you marry an unbeliever, you need to have your eyes open and realize that serious problems lie ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is particularly hard for a believer to marry an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The hardship is greater than that of an unbelieving couple in which one becomes a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A husband or wife who becomes a believer after being married may encounter hardship, but many times the Lord will bring him through.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, a believer who marries an unbeliever will face many difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to warn him ahead of time, and he needs to open his eyes to the hardships ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a person marries an unbeliever, we must warn him of another thing: He should be careful not to be carried away.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has to remember that he is marrying an unbeliever, and if he is careless, he will be easily led away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, those who are married or engaged have to be careful as well, but those who are considering marriage should exercise even more care.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, they need special protection, preservation, and prayer, so that they will not be carried away by the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you have no choice but to marry an unbeliever, you must also lay down the terms clearly beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need to tell the unbeliever, "I have already believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I will not force you to believe, but you cannot interfere with my faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must give me absolute freedom in this respect."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You need also to bring up the question of children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"You must give me the freedom to lead our children to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I want my children to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not want them to worship idols or to be conformed to the world."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you emphasize this point enough, perhaps you can get by with this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I will speak a few words to the more mature brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you see a new believer struggling with such a problem, you must be very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not open the door too wide.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not allow him to arbitrarily marry an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the other hand, do not close the door too tightly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not keep him away from governmental sin while exposing him to moral sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is better to let someone fall into God's governmental hand than to let him fall into moral sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have something more to say about this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have many young brothers and sisters in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most of the problems in finding a spouse arise when too many saints have too many expectations concerning the background and status of others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A brother who has a higher social status does not want to marry a sister with a lower status, and the reverse is also true.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today there is no lack of brothers and no lack of sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the question of status has caused many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I think this question would be easily solved if the brothers and sisters would change their concept about occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It would be easy for sisters to marry if they did not belittle brothers who are farmers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It would also be easy for brothers to marry if they did not belittle sisters who are farmers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today we look down upon occupations which God honors and exalt occupations which men worship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is what makes things complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today we have no lack of sisters and brothers, but we do not have many matching pairs according to status.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since the matter of status is a worldly consideration, we need to have a complete turn in our concept concerning occupation in order to solve this problem.</S>
