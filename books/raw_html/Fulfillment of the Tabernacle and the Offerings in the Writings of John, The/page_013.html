<h2 class=head2>D. Books of Mysteries</h2><p>John’s writings are books of mysteries because his Gospel, his Epistles, and his Revelation all speak of divine things, and divine things are mysterious. Everything related to divinity is a mystery. God Himself is mysterious. It is extremely important that we see the mysteries in this universe. If we do not see these mysteries, we are blind. All the mysteries are related to divinity. In the Gospel of John, in particular, we see the mysteries of the divine Person and the divine work of Christ.<p>In the Epistles of John we see the mysteries of the divine life within the believers. The mystery of the divine life includes the fellowship of the divine life, the divine anointing, the divine birth, and the divine seed. As those who have received the divine life, we participate in the fellowship of the divine life. This fellowship is a mystery. We also have within us the divine anointing, the divine birth, and the divine seed. All these matters are mysterious.<p>In the book of Revelation we have the mysteries of Christ as the life supply to God’s children for His expression and as the center of the divine administration of the Triune God. In Revelation the veil is open so that we may have a view of the divine administration. In this book we can see the universal “White House.” Even now, Christ, the Lamb on the throne, is the mysterious Administrator, the mysterious center of God’s universal administration. At this very moment, Christ is carrying out God’s administration.<h2 class=head1>II. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><h2 class=head2>A. A Book of Signs</h2><p>The Gospel of John is a book of signs, not of miracles. In Matthew, Mark, and Luke we read of miracles. But in the Gospel of John the word miracle is not used. Instead, this Gospel speaks of signs. For example, the changing of water into wine is called the beginning of signs (John 2:11).<p>A sign is a symbol with a particular significance. All the figures in John’s Gospel are signs. John 1:1 says, “In the beginning was the Word.…” The Word is a sign. Some teachers of the Bible would argue that the Lamb and the Dove may be signs, but that the Word is not a sign, because it is a title of Christ. Revelation 19:13 says that His name is called The Word of God. I would reply that every name is a sign. A street sign, for example, bears a name. Also, on the street we have signboards, and signboards bear names. Why are these boards not called name-boards instead of signboards? The reason is that a name is a sign. In John 1:42 the Lord Jesus told Simon that he would be called Peter, a name that means a stone. This indicates that the name Peter is a sign that Peter is a stone. The same is true in principle of the Word being a sign.<p>The Gospel of John is a book of signs signifying the divine Person, divine things, and divine matters. It is rather easy to see how the signs are related to the divine Person. However, the divine things in the Gospel of John may be somewhat puzzling. What are the divine things in this Gospel? The divine things include the divine life, divine light, divine grace, divine truth, divine glory, divine authority, divine children, divine food, divine water, divine breath, the divine vine, divine oneness, and divine building. These are the divine things in this book.<p>What are the divine matters? One divine matter is divine enlightenment. Divine light is a thing, but divine enlightenment is a matter. Other divine matters are regeneration, resurrection, reproduction, sanctification, building up, and glorification. In the matter of divine reproduction, one grain of wheat produces many grains. Sanctification is a matter, whereas holiness is a thing. Building up is the procedure, the action, of the building work. Eventually, in John 17, we have both sanctification and glorification. In this chapter the Lord Jesus prayed, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You” (v. 1). Therefore, in the Gospel of John we have the divine Person, the divine things, and the divine matters.<h2 class=head2>B. The Prologue of the Entire Book</h2><p>Chapter one is the prologue of the Gospel of John. In this prologue we have the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the Dove upon the Lamb, the stone, and the house of God. The Word is the defined God (vv. 1-2). The tabernacle is the defined God mingled with humanity to be His own dwelling place among men (v. 14). The Lamb of God is the representation of all the offerings for the solving of the problem of sin between man and God so that man may enter into God, enter into the tabernacle (vv. 29, 36). The Dove upon the Lamb is the Redeemer becoming the life-giving Spirit so that God may enter into man to be his life that man may be regenerated, transformed, and built up with the divine life to be the house of God (v. 32). The stone signifies the natural man as clay transformed into precious stone for the building of God’s house. The house of God is the building up of the transformed believers as stones to be the enlarged Christ as the house of God, the gate of heaven, a ladder that brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven (v. 51). All these signs are wonderful. With the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house we have the extracts of chapter one of John’s gospel. Hallelujah for the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house!
