   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION FORTY-TWO CONCERNING RECONCILIATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does the Bible teach concerning reconciliation?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Should man be reconciled to God or God be reconciled to man?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us consider 2 Corinthians 5:18-20: "But all things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation; namely, that God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and has put in us the word of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These verses show us one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a common misconception that if a person wants salvation, he must desperately plead until God changes His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the Bible does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is not a God of hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no problem on His side.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man tends to think that God's heart is very hard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, he feels compelled to constantly plead for pity and forgiveness, fearing that God will change His mind toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This concept comes from a lack of understanding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"But all things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Consequently, if a man thinks that God initially hated him and that he must plead, confess, repeatedly cry, and offer much penance before God can forgive him, he is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, God is reconciling man to Himself through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Christ was on earth He represented God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did everything for man with the purpose of expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ's love toward man on earth expressed God's love in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ultimately, God prepared a Savior for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He died on the cross and was punished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, God has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is at peace with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He has no problem with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How He deals with us is altogether contrary to our thought.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"And has given to us the ministry of reconciliation."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ministry of the apostles is to persuade man to be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man thinks that he must entreat God for pity and love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is totally ignorant that God loves man to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God longs for man to be reconciled to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the apostles preached in order to beseech men to be reconciled to God; they never pleaded for God to be reconciled to man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How did God reconcile us to Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By "not accounting their offenses to them."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ by not accounting our offenses to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This verse says that the apostles beseeched on behalf of Christ that we would be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They did not ask God to be reconciled to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man thinks that God is not willing to be reconciled to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, God commissioned us to beseech men to be reconciled to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The command we receive from God is to beseech men on His behalf that they be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not need to plead with God; we need to beseech men to receive what God has bestowed on them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man does not need to pitifully pray to God; he only needs to believe and accept what Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Does not God hate sin?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God no doubt hates sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if any man receives the Lord Jesus Christ, God will forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we have to be careful to not be misled to think that there is hate in God's heart toward man.</S>
