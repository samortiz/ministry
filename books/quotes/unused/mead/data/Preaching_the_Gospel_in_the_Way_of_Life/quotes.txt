[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California in the Spring of 1965.
[3]  Chapters One through Three were spoken in preparation for a gospel meeting, Chapter Four is the message given in the gospel meeting, and Chapters Five and Six are the fellowship given to the newly saved believers.
[4]  CHAPTER ONE HOW TO HELP PEOPLE TO BE SAVED Scripture Reading: Acts 10:43; Eph 1:7; Acts 13:38-39; John 3:16, 36; 5:24; 6:47; Rom 10:9-10, 13; Acts 16:31 BEARING THE BURDEN FOR PEOPLE'S SOULS WITH A PRAYING SPIRIT
[5]  This not only means that we have to spend time to pray; even more it means that we have to always bear the burden in our praying spirit, looking to the Lord and touching the throne of authority, that the Lord will move in the hearts of those people for whom we have been praying.
[6]  We believe and hold on to some things in the Scriptures without any feeling, but we do not believe in other things in the Scriptures; we will not hold on to them until we have the feeling.
[7]  Now we come to a very important point how to help people to be saved.
[8]  We cannot save people, but we can help people to be saved.
[9]  Only the Lord Himself can save people, but we can help people to receive the Lord, to accept the Lord and accept salvation.
[10]  It is needless to say that we must have a real love and concern toward the sinners; if we do not have love and concern for sinners, our work is over.
[11]  Suppose then, that we do have this love, this concern, and we pray for sinners and exercise our faith to participate in the power from on high, not paying attention to our feeling.
[12]  Following this, we have to tell people that if they are going to receive Christ as the living One, they have to make a thorough confession.
[13]  No doubt, we must tell them that their sins have been borne away by Christ and forgiven by God.
[14]  Besides showing people forgiveness of sins, justification by faith, and eternal life, we need to show them verses that tell them they are saved.
[15]  The best verses for this are Romans 10:9 and 10, which say, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation."
[16]  We must help them to pray to "close the deal"; we must help them to realize that Christ is the living Spirit, that they have to receive Him by opening their heart and their spirit; and we need to help them with some practical verses.
[17]  Helping the Saved Ones to Offer Themselves to the Lord
[18]  After we help them to this extent, we must help them to offer themselves to the Lord, to consecrate themselves.
[19]  CHAPTER TWO PREACHING THE GOSPEL WITH CHRIST'S AUTHORITY AND THE LIVING WORD Scripture Reading: Matt 12:28-29; 28:18-19; Rom 10:6-9, 13; 1 Cor 12:3
[20]  Matthew 12:28 and 29 say, "But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
[21]  I have the burden that we would realize what our ground is to preach the gospel.
[22]  It is not merely the ground that we love sinners or that we feel that there is the need for materials for the building up of the church.
[23]  I have noticed that the attitude of policemen in this country is always good.
[24]  I have been in this country at least twice before, and now I have been here for more than three years.
[25]  According to Romans 10:6 through 8, while we are preaching Christ, this kind of preaching becomes the living Spirit.
[26]  We have to tell people that Christ today is all-inclusive.
[27]  We must have the assurance that we are ministering Christ to people, and this Christ whom we minister to others is the all-inclusive One.
[28]  If we preach a living Christ, the Holy Spirit will honor our preaching, and the word that we speak will become the Spirit and life to others.
[29]  There is no doubt that we need love and a real concern for sinners, but going out to preach the gospel is mainly a matter of faith.
[30]  If we do not believe, if we have even a little bit of doubt about the Scriptures, we lose the ground of faith, and the enemy, the devil and the demons, will know.
[31]  We must learn to exercise faith to believe that we have been saved, we have ascended to the heavens, and we have been entitled with all that Christ has attained and obtained.
[32]  I believe that after we preach the gospel, many praises will go to the Lord, saying, "Lord, we thank You not only for the preaching, not only for the sinners being brought to Your Body, but for us, that we ourselves have learned so much, that we have been dealt with so much, that we have been built up so much, and that we have learned to know the spiritual world and all the devilish wiles."
[33]  Before a meeting for preaching the gospel, we must find the way to contact the person or persons for whom we have been praying, either by phone or face to face, and on the day before the preaching, we should confirm that he is coming.
[34]  If we mean business, we will not break our fast in the morning; we will keep our fast in order to pray.
[35]  FINISHING THE WORK WITH THE UNBELIEVERS IN ONE DAY
[36]  In order to do the work of inviting people in an effective way, we have to care for the matters above.
[37]  We need to command the Lord, contact people, and pray and fast; then on the day of preaching we have to go to bring people, spending what we have to, even at a cost.
[38]  If possible, after the preaching we should also have lunch with the friend we invited.
[39]  After the message, we have a short time to close the meeting by singing hymns or a chorus and by asking people to make a decision for the Lord.
[40]  Then right away after that, the brothers and sisters have to contact two or three, or at least one person, to care for them.
[41]  CHAPTER FOUR A GOSPEL MESSAGE Scripture Reading: Eph 2:11-12
[42]  Ephesians 2:11 and 12 say, "Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, those who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands, that you were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world."
[43]  I would like to impress you with these three short phrases: apart from Christ, having no hope, and without God.
[44]  OUR SPIRITUAL THIRST AND HUNGER BEING SATISFIED ONLY BY GOD IN CHRIST
[45]  Regardless of how much wealth you gain, what kind of degree you obtain, and what kind of position or rank you attain, if you do not have Christ within, there is a real thirst and a real hunger within you.
[46]  CHAPTER FIVE THE PERSON AND WORK OF CHRIST FOR OUR SALVATION Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14, 18; Isa 9:6; 1 Pet 2:24; Isa 53:6; 1 John 5:12; Acts 10:43
[47]  Not all those who hear the preaching of the gospel make the decision publicly to receive the Lord, but they still may have a heart for the Lord.
[48]  Through their further contact with the saints, we may learn that they indeed have been saved.
[49]  Second, these verses show us that the Word is God Himself.
[50]  Many people, even Christians, often have a wrong thought, supposing that Christ is a separate person from God.
[51]  We have to realize that God is in Christ, and Christ is one with God.
[52]  We must also know the purpose for Christ's death on the cross.
[53]  First Peter 2:24 says, "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose bruise you were healed."
[54]  If you believe in Christ, you have Christ, and when you have Christ, you have the life.
[55]  Contacting Christ with Our Human Spirit by Speaking to Him
[56]  TAKING THE WORD OF THE SCRIPTURES FOR THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION
[57]  You also need to be confirmed by the word of the Scriptures.
[58]  If you recognize the person of Christ and that Christ died to bear your sins, and if you receive His salvation and pray and open yourself to receive Him, then you need to know according to the word of the Bible that you are saved.
[59]  I would ask you to realize the above five points: who Christ is, what Christ did for you, the salvation prepared for you, the proper way to partake of this salvation, and the full assurance of this salvation in the Bible.
[60]  In the previous message we saw that in order to receive Christ as the Savior, a person must first realize who Christ is; that is, he has to know the person of Christ.
[61]  Second, he needs to know the work of Christ, what Christ has done for him and for what purpose Christ died on the cross.
[62]  Everything related to us has to be turned: our study, schooling, marriage, family life, relationships with friends, relationships with relatives, spending of money, clothing, thinking, decisions, motives, intents, and every other thing.
[63]  Everything related to us within and without must be turned to God.
[64]  Believers also need another kind of confession, not only the confession of sins but the confession of the Lord.
[65]  From now on you must confess, you must tell others, that you belong to the Lord.
[66]  Romans 10:9 says, "That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."
[67]  You must also receive the Holy Spirit, be filled with the Spirit, and be baptized in the Spirit.
[68]  As the third Person of the Triune God, the Holy Spirit is the very transmission of God to you.
[69]  In order to receive Christ, to receive God, you have to receive the Holy Spirit.
[70]  When we preach the gospel, we have to preach to such an extent that we tell people, "You are entitled to receive the Holy Spirit."
[71]  Acts 1:8 says, "But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth."
[72]  Philippians 1:5 says, "For your fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now," and verse 27 says, "Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel."
[73]  In these past years we have seen many people who pay their attention to the inner life and the light of truth, but they neglect the church life.
[74]  There are not only the two aspects of life and light; we also need the other three aspects: the Body, the service, and the gospel.
[75]  I speak the truth that you can never have a living group of Christians serving the Lord in an adequate way without these five aspects to balance them: life, light, the church, service, and ultimately preaching.
[76]  In order to do this, we have to be filled with Christ, we have to have light, we have to be in the church, and we have to be functioning members.
[77]  The new ones who come in will bring in more new ones.
[78]  It is in this way, the way of the church preaching the gospel, that people will be brought in. Then after they are brought in, they will do the same thing we do in the same way.
[79]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE FELLOWSHIP UNTO THE FURTHERANCE OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Phil 1:5-6, 12, 18-20, 27
[80]  In the books written by the apostle Paul, only Philippians speaks in a particular way concerning the preaching of the gospel.
[81]  Through this prayer we can realize that God's intention is that a local church would have the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel, not only for one period of time but continually, until the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, until He comes back.
[82]  There are a number of matters in these verses that I am burdened to pass on to you so that you may put them into practice.
[83]  When we live by Christ, in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ, we have love for one another, and this mutual love becomes a strong testimony.
[84]  When we express Christ, when we live out Christ, and when Christ is expressed through us, there is the preaching of the gospel.
[85]  We cannot bring anyone to the Lord merely by good fortune.
[86]  We need to learn Christ as our patience that we may continually fight the battle to preach the gospel.
[87]  This will be a real test of our prayer life.
[88]  Matthew 24:14 says, "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come."
[89]  Verses 19 and 20 of chapter twenty-eight say, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[90]  THE GOSPEL BEING A LIFELONG MATTER OF LIVING AND LABORING IN THE LORD
[91]  Learn to fellowship with the Lord and to live in, by, and with the Lord.
[92]  Then in this way, if we have the desire to cooperate with the Lord, He will open the way.
[93]  THE GOSPEL IN OUR DAILY LIVING BEING AN ITEM OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY
[94]  I believe that among us the Lord will recover mainly four items.
[95]  First, we must learn to experience Christ in the spirit in a living way.
[96]  We must know Christ not in mere teachings nor in the gifts, but in life the inner life and our daily life in the spirit.
[97]  OUR LABOR BEING NOT A HEAVY BURDEN BUT OUR NORMAL DUTY
[98]  We are limited by time because we are not full-time workers in the gospel.
[99]  However, if we practice to find the proper way, we can improve our way.
[100]  I hope we all would learn the best way, not to be too heavily burdened with the work, but to do our work as a duty.
[101]  The book of Philippians shows us that the church in Philippi was a church that always bore the gospel as their responsibility.
[102]  If we read this book carefully, we will see that the first chapter tells us Christ is life within us that we may live by Him and live Him out.
[103]  At the end of this chapter, he speaks of striving together fighting as one, not individually but shoulder to shoulder along with the faith of the gospel v. 27 . In verses 18 through 21 Paul says, "What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truthfulness, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice; yes, and I will rejoice; for I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.
[104]  We have to abide in Christ, live with Christ, and live out Christ, and we have to be built up together as one in love.
[105]  NOT HAVING A MOVEMENT BUT ABIDING IN CHRIST AND BEING BUILT UP TOGETHER
[106]  I look to the Lord that we all would not expect anything in a miraculous way.
[107]  Rather, we all must pray, fellowship with the Lord, and learn to abide in Christ, to be built up, and to be one in Christ.
[108]  This kind of preaching will be a part of our life, a part of our living, and a part of the church life.
[109]  The proper way to have the church life today is the way of life, to know Christ inwardly, to know our flesh, our self, and the natural man through the cross, and to learn to abide in Christ and live by Christ, not by ourselves.
[110]  Never be frustrated, never be confused, never challenge yourself, and never be challenged by others.
[111]  I say boldly that the way of miraculous preaching is the wrong way.
[112]  The right way for the church to be built up is the way of life, and the right way for the church to preach the gospel is also the way of life.
[113]  I look to the Lord, and I hope that one day the church here will have not only a formal gospel preaching, but that gradually people will be brought into the church not mainly through that kind of preaching but through the daily living of the believers.
[114]  COORDINATING AND BEING BLENT TOGETHER TO CARE FOR PEOPLE
[115]  In the past we learned that preaching the gospel in the church is a very good means for us to be brought together, to be fitly framed and mingled one with another.
[116]  HELPING PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE THE LORD'S SALVATION THROUGH REPENTANCE AND FORGIVENESS OF SINS
[117]  Question: A man of about eighty years old came to our gospel meeting.
[118]  Then if we have more time, and if we have only this one person in our hands, we can help him further and work on him for the Lord.
[119]  CHAPTER ELEVEN BEING A LIVING TESTIMONY FOR THE INCREASE OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 3:25-30; 12:20-26, 32-33; 15:1-5, 7-8, 12, 16-17; 17:21-23
[120]  We all must cooperate to carry out the burden of these messages in prayer.
[121]  THE BRIDE OF CHRIST BEING THE INCREASE OF CHRIST
[122]  John 3:25 through 30 say, "There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purification.
[123]  And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.
[124]  You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him.
[125]  In these portions of the Word there is the real preaching and outreach of the gospel.
[126]  First, we must point out that the real meaning of the outreach of the gospel is the increase of Christ.
[127]  In our gospel preaching have we ever had the thought that we are bringing people to be part of the bride of Christ, that we are bringing people for the increase of Christ?
[128]  The more I remained with the Lord considering these messages, the more I felt from the Lord that the dear brothers and sisters must be helped to realize that the real gospel preaching is the increase of Christ, and the real outreach of the gospel that brings people to Christ is to compose the bride of Christ.
[129]  GENUINE PREACHING BEING A LIFE OF CRUCIFIXION AND RESURRECTION TO MANIFEST CHRIST
[130]  As we have said, John 12 shows us the way for Christ to be increased.
[131]  We often speak of verse 24, but most of the time we think that this verse applies only to Christ as the one grain.
[132]  THE COMMISSION OF THE GOSPEL BEING TO REPRODUCE CHRIST FOR HIS INCREASE
[133]  John 15 shows us how the many grains are built up together as a corporate increase.
[134]  In chapter twelve we see the way to produce the increase, and in chapter fifteen we see the way of building.
[135]  This verse says, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you."
[136]  According to John 15, if we mean business with the Lord, the Father will prune, cut, and purge us.
[137]  I am somewhat reluctant to say this because I do not want to disappoint you or scare you away.
[138]  BEING BUILT UP IN LOVE AS A TESTIMONY TO THE WORLD
[139]  John 15:12 says, "This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you," and verse 17 says, "These things I command you that you may love one another."
[140]  Verses 21 through 23 say, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me." When we come to chapter seventeen, we all have to humble ourselves.
[141]  This book does have the commission for gospel preaching, but it has it in another way, not in the way of activity, movement, work, or crusade, but in the way of a life always under the pruning of the heavenly Husbandman, always abiding in the Son of God, always praying for certain persons to be brought into the reality of the increase of Christ, and always loving the brothers regardless of their condition or situation.
[142]  We are now in the process of the Lord's recovery.
[143]  In order to have Christ increased with persons, we must live a crucified life, imparting Christ all the time, not merely bringing people to Christ, but imparting Christ to people, transforming people into the parts of the bride of Christ.
[144]  The writings of the apostle John are classified into three groups.
[145]  If we do not know the way to preach the gospel revealed in this book, and we only know the way mentioned in the first three books, the result of our preaching will leak away, because there will be nothing to mend and keep the result.
[146]  If we are truly growing and have growth, we need to practice at least four things.
[147]  Regardless of how spiritual we are and what kind of spiritual attainment we have made, even if we are as experienced as the apostle Paul, we still need to care for people by preaching the gospel.
[148]  We have to go to the Lord to consider all the people surrounding us relatives, neighbors, friends, schoolmates, colleagues, and others, not only the people whom we know locally but also those we know who are far away.
[149]  Second, along with our prayer and preaching, we must have a testimony in life.
[150]  The first Presbyterian missionaries who went to China had a real love toward those poor Gentiles, and they had a testimony.
[151]  That love and testimony convinced the people, and through that, the door for the gospel was opened.
[152]  BEING BUILT UP AS LIVING MEMBERS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[153]  The third thing we must practice is to be built up.
[154]  We must be able to show to the whole universe, especially to those for whom we are concerned, that we are living members of the Body of Christ.
[155]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN BEARING THE RESPONSIBILITY TO FEED SPIRITUAL CHILDREN Scripture Reading: John 21:14-17; S. S. 1:2-8
[156]  In the Song of Songs there is a seeking one, representing a believer who not only is saved but to some degree is trained and dealt with by the Lord.
[157]  The main point in this message is the word feed.
[158]  We need something with which we can feed others, and we need to know the way to feed others.
