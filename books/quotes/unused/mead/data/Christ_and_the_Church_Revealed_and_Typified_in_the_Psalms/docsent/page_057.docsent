   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PSALMS 81 TO 83 GOD'S INTENTION AND SATAN'S PLOT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalms 81 to 83 tell how Christ will judge and inherit the earth, and how the enemy desires to take God's habitation in possession.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I must repeat again that the Psalms are written in the style of poetry, and for this reason it is really difficult to understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that by this time the Psalms have become a different book to many of you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You thought they were merely a source of consolation, but now you see in them Christ, God's dwelling place, the house and city of God, and the way God will gain the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to understand the Psalms we must enter the heart of the Psalmist and get into the spirit of all the seeking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the spirit of the saints, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, was uttering something.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot just read the Psalms in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is why we have spent so much time to see what is in the heart of all the Psalmists and what is hidden in all the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is nothing but Christ and the church as the house and the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not be frustrated or troubled by so many verses and sayings in all the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Years ago in my home province, certain types of crystals were mined from the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I had seen these beautiful stones on the market for years, but one day I was shown their original condition in the form of a large, rough, and ugly stone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then I was shown, after a cut was made into the very heart of that ugly mass, a crystal, so transparent, colorful, and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the outside there were many unsightly layers, but after these were removed, a beautiful crystal appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Psalms there are many verses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would not say that some are ugly, but that many of these verses do not seem so meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet we need them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, Psalm 78 is a very long Psalm concerning the failure, unfaithfulness and dishonesty of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many times when I was young, I grew tired of reading that passage of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I thought it would be far better to shorten it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But within that Psalm, there are at least these four verses, verses 65, 66, 68 and 69, which are as crystals.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 65 says that one day the Lord awoke as one out of sleep, as a mighty man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 66 says that He smote all His enemies; verse 68 says that He chose Judah, the mount Zion; and verse 69 says that He built His sanctuary like high palaces and stable as the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are the crystals.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not be frustrated and troubled by all the other verses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must go through them until we hit all these significant verses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Psalms 81 through 83 there are not many crystals, but there are two points which indicate that God's intention is to inherit the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 82:8 says, "Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a crystal verse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's intention is to possess the earth through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then in Psalm 83, verse 12, the enemy says, "Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By putting these two verses together and comparing them, we see that God's intention is to inherit the earth, and Satan's plot is to take the houses of God in possession.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Could you see the subtlety?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here is the struggle that has arisen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With whom will you stand?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With God for the earth, or with Satan to take over God's dwelling places?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's intention is to give Christ His right position throughout the local churches and then, through the churches, to take over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan knows this, and so his goal is to take over God's dwelling places and thus withhold the earth from God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But, according to Psalm 83, God will surely do something to show His enemies that He alone is the most High over all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"That men may know that thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the most high over all the earth" v. 18 . We have full assurance in these last days that God is going to defeat all His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regardless of how much desolation the enemy has wrought, regardless of how much he is still working to damage the local churches, God will defeat him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day through the local churches the whole universe will know that God alone is the most High over all the earth.</S>
