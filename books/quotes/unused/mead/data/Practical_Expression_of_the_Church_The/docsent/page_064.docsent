   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A TESTIMONY OF LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter, we stressed that the content of the church is life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But how can we prove life except by love?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we have a conference and training, I do not trust much in my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is simply the best time for the brothers from so many different places to come and taste the love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would prefer to hear the visitors to Los Angeles say that they did not get much help from the ministry, but, oh, what hospitality and love they experienced among the brothers and sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need a church life full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When others come, they should sense the reality of love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not just a matter of ministry, but the reality of life expressed in love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is marvelous to have such a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We thank the Lord that He has been gracious to us in this matter, but we need more.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A strong testimony is a testimony of love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not have much trust in anything but love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the dear ones who are in the Lord's recovery should never have much respect for any gift or ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not have much trust in anything but love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we will see churches full of life and strength, without too much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what we need in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reality of the unity mentioned in Psalm 133 can only come out of love, not out of any ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more ministries we have, the more divisive elements and dissenting opinions we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have learned this by suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You do not know how much we have suffered by inviting good speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It did not help the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, I cannot tell you how much damage it has caused.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord has proved that the real need for building up the local church is love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we want to love, we must have our concept absolutely uprooted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I fear that we still have the concept that we need more ministries, teachings and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This concept must be uprooted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All we need is love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Love will bring in the building up of a marvelous church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>ETERNAL LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Knowledge shall vanish away, prophecies shall fail, and tongues shall cease.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only love remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the ministries and gifts will pass away, but love will remain for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do believe that in eternity many of us will remember the days spent in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Though eternity will be much better, still we will recall these days of love in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the real building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Love never fails, and love builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is not much need of good speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be patient in going on by the Lord Himself as love in life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will see the church gradually build itself up in love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The real expression of the local church life is life, and a church full of love is a church with a long life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the so-called churches built up by ministries and gifts are short lived; it is not long before they are divided.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the church that is built up by love never ends.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nothing can divide it, damage it or touch it because of love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Love is the strongest bond.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My burden in this chapter is just to tell you that nothing but love can edify or build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Where, I ask, is a church built up by teachings or gifts?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not care for theory, but for the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Teachings, gifts or knowledge have never worked, but Christians are still trying them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have wasted years and years, but they are still trying.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord be merciful to us that we may be willing to be delivered out of this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All we need is God in Christ expressed as love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only this can build up the church.</S>
