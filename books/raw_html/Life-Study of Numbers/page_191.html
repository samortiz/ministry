<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Lust of God's Chosen<br>and Redeemed People</H2><P>Numbers 11:4b-15, 31-35 speaks of the lust which came directly from God's chosen and redeemed people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Remembering the Egyptian<br>Food, Which Suited Their Lust</H2><P>Numbers 11:5 says, "We remember the fish we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic." Here we see that God's people remembered the Egyptian food (the worldly taste), which suited their lust. God's people were lusting for the worldly taste.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Abhorring the God-given Manna</H2><P>In verse 6 the people went on to say, "Now our soul is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna before our eyes." This indicates that they abhorred the God-given manna, which is a type of Christ as the bread of life. This manna was very tasteful. However, it had a heavenly taste, not an Egyptian taste. Instead of liking the heavenly taste of the God-given manna, the people abhorred it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Everyone Weeping at the Entrance of His Tent</H2><P>According to verse 10, everyone was weeping at the entrance of his tent. They wept because the food they had was not according to their taste.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Anger of Jehovah<br>Burning Greatly over Them, and Jehovah<br>Striking Them with a Severe Plague</H2><P>The anger of Jehovah burned greatly over the people (v. 10b), and He struck them with a severe plague (v. 33).</P>
