<p>After the problem of the Jewish religion was resolved, Paul and Barnabas immediately went out to the Gentile lands to preach the gospel. The problem of outward religion had been solved, but now they encountered an inward, subjective problem&mdash;Barnabas and Paul could not be in one accord (vv. 35-41). Barnabas wanted to take Mark to visit the brothers, but Paul felt it was not suitable, and an argument arose between them. Their argument was the work of Satan. The spread of the church was greatly damaged because Barnabas and Paul could not be in one accord.</p>
<p>This pattern has been repeated many times in church history. As the church spreads, it first meets outward difficulties. This is the evil plot of the enemy. The spread of the church is the building up of the Body of Christ; if the church does not spread, the Body of Christ cannot be built up and God&rsquo;s eternal plan cannot be completed. The record in Acts shows that Satan follows the Holy Spirit. As the Holy Spirit works to spread and build up the church, Satan follows to damage the Spirit&rsquo;s work of spreading and building up the church. Satan first raises up opposition to the gospel, and then he raises up opposition to the apostles. Nevertheless, the Gentiles received the gospel, and churches were established in Gentile lands.</p>
<p>Next, Satan instigated some from Jerusalem to bring Jewish thought, law, circumcision, and ordinances into the churches in Gentile lands. Despite Satan&rsquo;s attack, the Holy Spirit continued to work. When religious ordinances were limiting the spread of the church, God first sent Paul to Jerusalem and won a victory. Later, He raised up an army to destroy Jerusalem. Not long after this outward problem was resolved, there was a difference of opinion between Barnabas and Paul. When brothers who are co-workers have a difference of opinion, the spread of the church is limited.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say who was right in the contention between Barnabas and Paul, but from that time forth Acts does not record anything regarding Barnabas. This indicates that the responsibility for the error was mainly with Barnabas. Regardless, we should be warned both of problems within and of problems in our environment. Satan works in our environment to damage the spread of the church, and he also works among us to damage the building up of the church.</p>
<p>The contention between Paul and Barnabas weakened the spread of the church. These two apostles, who had been working together, were now separated; Barnabas took Mark and went west to Cyprus, and Paul took Silas and went north to Syria and Cilicia (vv. 39-41). We must read this portion of the Bible very carefully in order to discover the thought of the Holy Spirit. Paul wanted to stay in Asia Minor where he had labored previously, but the Holy Spirit forbade him to remain there (16:6). Paul considered going to Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them (v. 7). For the sake of the spread of the church, the Holy Spirit gave Paul a vision calling him to Europe. After Paul saw the vision, he crossed the sea from Asia Minor to Macedonia (vv. 9-12). Thus, the church spread from Asia Minor to Europe and turned south to the cities of Athens and Corinth (17:15; 18:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Old Concepts</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Paul&rsquo;s Old Concepts in His Second Journey</h2>
<p>Acts 16:6-12 indicates that even Paul had problems within. The Holy Spirit wanted him to go out to spread the church, but he did not understand the leading of the Holy Spirit. As he vacillated between going forward or going back, a dream came to him in the night telling him to go to Macedonia in Europe (vv. 9-10). This illustrates a common problem among the Lord&rsquo;s workers. Once workers come to a place for a time and settle down, they do not want to move. At times like these, unwanted circumstances always happen. For example, if I were in charge of my movement, I am afraid I would still be in northern China today. However, God&rsquo;s hand moved me step by step. Old relationships, old affections, and old inclinations keep us from going to another place; they make us unable to move. This is because we do not have any vision. When a worker goes to a place, he tends to become set and settled. This is not an easy problem to solve.</p>
<p>At the end of Acts 15 there is the problem between Barnabas and Paul; in Acts 16 there is a problem within Paul. The spread of the church encounters difficulties at each step. If Paul had not been subdued by the Holy Spirit, the church could not have spread to Europe. We cannot merely read the black and white words of the Bible. When we read Acts 15 through 17, we must look to the Lord for light to see how the church spread. For the church to spread, the bondage of the Jewish religion, human opinions, and the self with its old concepts must be broken.</p>
<p>The spread of the church often encounters these three problems. The first problem is outward, the second is between the workers, and the third comes from the self and old human feelings. The church should have spread to Europe much sooner, but these problems delayed its spread. The final problem in the spread of the church is the self. If we stay in our old feelings and relationships, the spread of the church will be delayed indefinitely. To break out of the self, we need a vision. When we break through, the church spreads. This is true even today.</p>
<p>Dead ordinances, human opinions, and the old feelings of the self stop the Holy Spirit from breaking through and restrict the spread of the church. If the Holy Spirit breaks through these three problems, the church will spread. In the early days, the church spread to Europe and gained a foothold there because the Holy Spirit broke through in these three areas. The Holy Spirit broke through religious regulations and ceremonies, and He broke through dead letters, human opinions, and human feelings. We must look to the Lord for light so that He would have a way in us. Then He will give us ample opportunity to spread His church to distant lands.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
