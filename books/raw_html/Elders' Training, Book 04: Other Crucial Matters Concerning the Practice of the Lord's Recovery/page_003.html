<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>CONCERNING THE USE OF REFERENCE BOOKS AND OTHER WRITINGS</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>I believe we have seen in a sufficient way that we need to help the saints to get into the full knowledge of the truth. In this chapter I want to begin to fellowship concerning the use of the reference books and other writings.<h2 class=head1>CHURCH HISTORY AND CHRISTIAN WRITINGS</h2><p>The church has been existing on this earth for over nineteen hundred years. Even from the first century, immediately after the time of the apostles, writings began to come out. Luke 1:1 indicates that there were more than four who wrote an account of the Savior’s earthly life. There were also many epistles written besides what we have in the New Testament today. Eventually, however, only four of the gospels written by the earlier saints were chosen to be in the Bible and only a certain number of epistles were chosen out of many epistles. This shows us that even the writings in the first and second century were not all quite accurate for the study or the knowing of the truth. This also helps us to realize that we cannot follow the so-called Christian writings without any discernment.<p>The so-called church fathers also wrote many things after the passing away of the early apostles. The writings of the church fathers have become a big field in much of today’s theology. The church fathers’ writings plus the councils with their creeds turned the church into Catholicism, and the papal system was fully established by the end of the sixth century. The papal system stopped the councils and the creeds because from that time onward whatever the pope said was the final word.<p>This kind of situation issued in what historians call the Dark Ages, which lasted about one thousand years. During this time the Bible was locked up and was not allowed to be read by the laymen. This period of the Dark Ages compelled some of the Lord’s faithful ones to reconsider the situation. This was the beginning of the Reformation, which actually started before the time of Martin Luther. None of the reformers actually intended to leave the Catholic church. Their intention was just to correct, to adjust, and to bring back at least some basic truths. History tells us, though, that Luther and most of the reformers had to leave the Catholic church, and according to the political situation of that time most of them went along with the formation of the state churches.<p>Since the Reformation, many books were published which are all considered as Protestant writings. This also opened the door to give the freedom to all Christian writers. Whatever they liked and felt burdened about, they were free to write. More books came out by the state churches and by the private churches such as the Baptists, the Brethren, the Presbyterians, the Moravian Brothers, and then the Methodists. Throughout church history a great many books were written. Nearly no other field in human culture has so many thousands of different publications as in the field of Christianity.
