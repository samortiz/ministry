The difference between the power of Christ and the person of Christ can be illustrated in relation to redecorating a house
The prayer in chapter 1 concerns the power of Christ; the prayer in chapter 3 concerns taking Christ as our person
Some think that the phrase a spirit of wisdom and revelation in 1:17 refers to the Holy Spirit, but this is not correct
Satan will utilize trivial things to hold her in bondage, causing her to linger in the considerations of her mind
The more she thinks about her husband's faults, the more she will feel justified in criticizing his words and actions
After calling a few times, she will turn from her mind to her spirit, and she will forget about her husband's condition
If she stays in her mind when she comes to a meeting, she will be as silent as a person who is buried in a tomb
While it is easy for husbands and wives to be abrasive in their dealings with each other, the same is true for parents and children
He will rise above the power of money, be transcendent over money, subdue the influence of money, reign over money, and come to the meetings
The church is produced by the resurrected Christ, the transcendent Christ, the subduing Christ, and the ruling Christ
The way to be delivered from this conflict is to allow the cross to deal with our soul-life, that is, with our old man
When we are strengthened with power into our inner man, the Lord will not only manifest His power but also make His home in our heart
Christ's making His home in our heart is not a matter of experiencing His power but a matter of taking Him as our person
Although this is not equal to His making His home in our heart, it is better than forcing Him into a small corner of our living room
When the Lord nudges a new believer within concerning the purchase of an item, he can easily ignore the Lord and give no ground to the Lord
The Lord's making His home in our hearts means that He makes His home in our mind, emotion, will, and conscience
In addition, she can open and close her windows as it pleases her, and she can turn the lights on or off as it pleases her
When she gets married, however, her husband becomes her person because the two become one under the headship of the husband
When we do this we will be joined with all the saints in coordination and apprehend the breadth length height and depth of Christ with them
When we take the Lord as our person, we will experience Him with all the saints and discover that He is without limit or measure
When we take Christ as our person, we are not only brought into the church, but we will also live in the church and have the church life
We are one person, because even though we are many in number, there is only one person in the church-the Lord Jesus
If the person of the church in Los Angeles is based on being either white or black, there surely will be trouble and division in the church
When Christ is our person and we live by Him, the life in our spirit enters into our mind and rules in our mind
Over the past two thousand years the inward nature and outward appearance of the church have changed completely
Today the church is equated with organized Christianity, but organized Christianity does not reflect the Lord's desire
Give us peace, be with us, and bless us so that we will not have any sickness and so that our heart may be full of peace and joy
Enable the brothers and sisters to love one another, to come to the meetings regularly, and to have a regular morning watch'
He told us not to ask about what to eat and drink or what to put on but to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness
A woman who receives a free pair of scissors when she purchases a sewing machine does not need to ask how much the scissors cost
If we seek God's kingdom and His righteousness, all that we need related to food, drink, and clothing will be added to us by the Lord
It is a shame that our prayers cover only our needs for food, drink, and clothing but not the Lord's desire for the church
In order to participate in the living Body of Christ, our prayers should match the apostle Paul's prayer in Ephesians 1
Similarly, many people say that God does not exist, because they are not using their spirit to substantiate God
Just as we need to use our eyes to see and our ears to hear, we need to use our spirit to touch and contact God
We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to know the church thoroughly and to see the church clearly
In today's Christianity there are many denominations, and all of them claim to be legitimate representatives of the church
God cannot inherit vessels that are merely earthen; He can only inherit earthen vessels that have been transformed
If a woman's complexion is not fair, she can put on some powder, and if her complexion is not radiant, she can put on some rouge
If the operation in our being does not stop, we will experience the surpassingly great power that operated in the Lord Jesus
When these four aspects are manifested-resurrection power, transcending power, subduing power, and ruling power-the church is produced
We need this fourfold power because it is easy for us to be troubled and deadened by many things related to our living
If all the brothers and sisters had a strong spirit, nothing in our family life or church life would keep us from saying, 'O Lord!
The church that comes out of this fourfold power is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all
The power of God operated in Him to raise Him from the dead, resurrecting and delivering Him out of the condition and realm of death
If we are deadened and subdued by our environment, by people, by things, or by events, the church cannot be manifested
Those who go to the moon must depend upon rockets, but we can reach the third heaven with the resurrection power of Christ
If we touch and enjoy the Lord in the morning and throughout the day, even ten thousand televisions could not keep us from the meeting
If we do not experience the resurrection power of Christ, the church will not be expressed through us, even if we come to the meetings
On the one hand, we may say Amen in the meeting, but on the other hand, we may be thinking about a television program
A sister may come to the meeting but still be thinking about a fashionable dress that she saw in a department store
In Paul's first prayer we see our need for a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to enter into the church and to know the church
God created our spirit as an organ for us to contact Him, but is our person related to our body, our soul, or our spirit?
Once the Lord Jesus enters into a man's spirit as life, his spirit is no longer merely an organ but also an inner man
Before a believer is saved, his person is in his soul, but after being saved, there is another person in his spirit
When we are a guest in someone's home, we all prefer to be in a room alone rather than to share it with another person
We do not like to share a room with another person, because when there are two persons, there will be two opinions
Even in small matters such as opening or closing a window, it is not easy for two people to be in agreement with each other
Even though the person of our soul has been crucified and must be denied, the function of our soul has been preserved
The life of the soul needs to be killed, but the faculties of our soul-the mind, emotion, and will-have to be renewed
Being crucified with Christ does not mean that we no longer use our mind or that we no longer express any emotion
Rather, it means that the corrupted life in our soul, our old man, has been crucified in order for the faculties of the soul to be renewed
When we call, 'O Lord,' we can deny our soul-life and utilize it as an organ to express our renewed mind, emotion, and will
After the Lord's resurrection operates in her, however, she may quickly forget about the Lord and even put Him aside
In order for Christ to make His home in our hearts, He has to enter into our conscience, mind, emotion, and will
Those from northern China should take Christ as their person, and those from southern China should also take Christ as their person
When Christ is our person, the church will be one, and there will not be any problem for us to live the church life
These ordinances created enmity between the Jews and Gentiles, but Christ abolished the ordinances, which created the enmity, on the cross
Being a man is related to one's person and personality, whereas a body is merely an organ that serves as a vessel
Beginning with the Reformation and especially for the last two hundred years, many Christians have spoken of the church as a vessel
As a golden lampstand, the church is a vessel to contain God so that God may express Himself through the church
The lampstand depicts how the church contains God and expresses God, but this depiction does not touch the matter of life
In recent years the Lord has shown us in the Bible that the church is not only a vessel or merely the Body but also the one new man
An organ by itself is not a person, because it has no personality, but a man is a person because he has a personality
When a wife subjects herself to her husband, she should take her husband as her person and subject herself to him in love
When she goes to buy things, she does not buy according to her preferences; rather, she always takes her husband's taste into consideration
If a wife were to care for her husband according to her husband's taste rather than her own, she would be the best wife in the world
Husbands are often bothered by the 'care' they receive from their wife, because this 'care' is according to their wife's taste
The church must not experience merely the power of Christ and the life of Christ but also the person of Christ
The Lord has not returned because the Bible reveals that His desire to return is related to His being a Bridegroom rather than a Judge
The presence of so many opinions in the church proves that we have not taken Christ as our person so that we can be a proper bride for Him
If we do not take Christ as our person, the Chinese and those who are not Chinese will not be able to get along
When this happens, we will not preach the gospel, study the Word, or pursue the growth in life merely because it is our preference
When the Lord brings us to the point that He is our person, we will experience more than just His power and His life
If we go on in this way in the Lord, we will see the sweet oneness of the church, and we will have no opinion and no expression of the self
Our being quiet in a meeting should be the issue of the Lord Jesus being quiet, not because it is our preference to be quiet
When the church reaches the stage of taking Christ as her person and is prepared as a bride, the Lord will return immediately
We should not think that taking Christ as our person is the same as enthroning Him as our King or submitting to Him as our Head
Often when we say, 'O Lord, You are the Head and the Lord,' He is not very happy because we are still not focused on His desire
If out of love we would reject our person and take Him as our person, we would not only follow the Lord but inquire of Him
Further, we will be renewed in the spirit of our mind, having put off the old man and having put on the new man
In this renewed spirit of the mind we will put off our former manner of living and put on the life of the new man, the church
In His aspect of being three, the Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the realization
Although we can receive and speak of this sequence using the plain words of the Bible, it is difficult to give a detailed explanation
We should not be troubled when we hear that the infinite God is a mystery, because even human beings are a mystery
Humans are composed of three parts-spirit, soul, and body-which encompass both our outward visible form and our inward invisible life
From the standpoint of man's relationship with God, as soon as we touch the Spirit, we receive the Triune God who enters into us
Ordinarily, when we think of someone being sent, we think that the sender remains apart from the one being sent
The Greek word para, translated 'from,' means 'by the side of,' implying 'with'; hence, it is, literally, 'from with'
The Father is expressed in the Son so that he who has seen the Son has seen the Father; moreover, the Father is working in the Son
The Son did not do anything according to His own desire; He did everything according to the desire of the Father
The Son became flesh, passing from infancy through childhood into a man who was thirty years old when He began to minister
According to 1 John 1:2, the Word of life, who was with the Father, has been manifested, and we have seen, heard, and touched Him
He bore our sins in His physical body, and He shed human blood to redeem us from our sins and to wash away our sins
In the flesh through His incarnation the Son removed our sins, and in His resurrection He baptized us in the Spirit
The Son is life so that people may have life; He is also the bread of life so that those who eat Him will live because of Him
He not only takes away our sins and baptizes us in the Spirit but also enters into us as life so that we may have life
We are not only the many grains and the flock; we are also the bride waiting for the Bridegroom to come and marry us
On the one hand, we are already married to Him, but on the other hand, we are waiting for Him to come and marry us
The Son died, shedding His blood, for the redemption of sins and flowed out as living water, even as the Spirit
The Father is in the Son, and the Son became the Spirit for us to drink so that He may become the living water flowing out of us
All those who believe into Him and have Him as life are joined as one in the Triune God and are joined to the Triune God as one
It is horizontal because we, the many believers, are one; it is vertical because we, the many believers, are one with the Triune God
We worship God, who is Spirit, by this Spirit and with reality, that is, with the Christ whom we have experienced
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three-in-one God; He is one God, yet He is Father, Son, and Spirit
In 4:14 He said that He would give us living water that would become in us a fountain springing up into eternal life
In 7:38-39 He spoke of living water flowing out of the innermost being of those who would come to Him and drink
The branches of a grape vine cannot be used to make furniture; if they do not bear fruit, they are totally useless
Rather, our work is to help people so that inwardly they will let Christ win, be subdued by Christ, and let the Spirit grow
As such, we will be full of His abundant life and will flow out this life; such a flowing out is fruit-bearing
The Gospel of John, however, shows that we can enjoy Him as a person and touch Him through the Word and the Spirit
Word in Greek signifies the full definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, it is God defined, explained, and expressed
John 36 says That which is born of the Spirit is spirit and 424 says God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit
When we have a normal experience of His words, we will have His manifestation, and He and the Father will come to make an abode with us
If we allow the Lord's word to operate in us, His word will cleanse us, and if we abide in Him, His words will abide in us
The initiation of life begins with the Spirit, but the word is needed for the growth, spread, and expansion of life
Some have said mistakenly that we only need to call on the Lord's name, that we do not need to listen to messages or read the Bible
We do not reject the practice of ministering the Word; rather, we reject only messages that do not supply life
If the Lord has mercy, the churches in every place should receive several messages every week that are living, strong, and fresh
All day long we should eat the Lord's Word, because the Lord Himself is the Word, and His words are spirit and life
It is one thing to understand the food that we eat for breakfast, but it is another thing to eat and digest the food
All the words in the Bible are constant; however, when the Lord repeats a constant word to us, it becomes an instant word
We still have the Holy Spirit in us, but our touch with the Lord is gone, and we even feel shameful before the Lord
As we head toward our home, it will seem almost as if we were flying, because we sense the comforting presence of the Spirit
In our experience the Lord will become another Comforter, bringing us the fresh taste of the Holy Spirit as our enjoyment
It is a special blessing to know the Lord as another Comforter and have His manifestation by keeping His words
Further, we will be practically one with the Lord, because He will be our person within, and we will be His manifestation without
It is easy to call on the Lord's name, but the greatest test is how we deal with the Lord's word when it comes to us
His constant commandments are found in the Bible, whereas His instant commandments often consist of only one word, no
He will gain ground in our being, manifest Himself to us, and make an abode with us so that we will grow in life
The reality of love in its nature and substance is the Triune God who indwells us and who is realized in us as the Spirit
A new moon is the new beginning of a month, which is merely a shadow; however, the Lord as the life-giving Spirit is our real new beginning
The Sabbath is also a shadow, but the body, that is, the substance of the Sabbath, is the Spirit who indwells us as our rest
Everything is a shadow, but the reality, the body of all the positive things, is the life-giving Spirit who indwells us
To experience the person of the Lord is the deepest experience and also the most complete, tender, and sweet experience of Him
According to our experience in similar circumstances, we try to bargain with the Lord so that we do not have to obey Him
When a sister has to discipline a disobedient child, she should open to the Lord and learn to take the Lord as her person
Although this seems quite good, it would be better if she took her husband as her person and only went to the store if he was going
There is a great difference in taste in these two ways; the first way results in bitterness, but the second way issues in a sweet feeling
If a sister truly took her husband as her person, there would be no bitterness and complaining, and everything would be sweet
Verse 23 says, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
When the Lord comes with the Father in this way He is able to make His home in us rather than merely visit with us for a moment of enjoyment
The Holy Spirit is in our spirit, and our spirit is in our body; hence, our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit
Concerning the experience of the growth in life, we have spent decades trying to find a short route but with only limited success
Your dear husband may seem like a difficult cross to bear, but if you receive this situation from the Lord, you will receive life from it'
Sometimes however a husband and wife will argue over what she should wear because the wife likes a particular dress but the husband does not
Since taking Christ as our person is the reality by which we live and for which we work, we will also worship God according to this reality
In these days we do not need old religion, old doctrines, old ways, or old ordinances; we only need Christ as our person
As long as we learn to live in the spirit, taking Christ as our person, we will reach the stage of living Christ
Chapter 1 covers the initiation of the church, and chapters 2 through 6 cover the practical living of the church
In a similar manner, it is one thing to begin a marriage with a wedding, but it is another thing to live a married life
In the book of Ephesians there is a revelation of both the initiation, the beginning, of the church and the living of the church
Even though a human has power that comes from life, a human is superior to a machine because he has a personality in addition to power
As an organ, our spirit needs wisdom and revelation, but as the inner man, our spirit needs to be strengthened
As an organ, our spirit needs the power of Christ, but as the inner man, our spirit needs the person of Christ
Even though wives would prefer that their husband follow their every instruction, their husband is not a machine; he is a living person
When we experience the power of Christ through our spirit as an organ, the issue is the church as the Body of Christ
When we experience the person of Christ through our spirit as the inner man, the issue is the church as the new man
We should be like caterpillars who turn into butterflies by putting off the old man and putting on the new man
Many brothers and sisters, however, put on the new man only in a partial way, retaining some aspects of the old man
With other brothers and sisters, however, there is an expression that indicates that the likeness of a 'butterfly' is truly being manifested
Many saints can testify of their experience of Christ, but most of their testimonies are related to experiencing the power of Christ
Of asking for healing, we will speak to the Lord in order to know His desire and intention for us during our time of illness
One sister recently testified that her child was sick and crying continuously, so she called out to the Lord, and her child was healed
Later, if her child becomes sick again, her calling out to the Lord may not result in the manifestation of His power
The Lord's lack of a response to her requests for healing is related to His desire that she experience His person
With her faith strengthened, she should now seek and accept the Lord's feeling in regard to the situation of her child's illness
We all want our children to be well behaved, respectable, smart, and well educated so that they bring honor to us
The Lord took His time to go to Bethany because He wanted to train Martha and Mary to take Him as their person rather than commanding Him
When the Lord came to the tomb and asked for the stone to be taken away, Martha said, 'Lord, by now he smells'
He was weeping for the foolish people, for their foolish speaking, and for their not taking Him as their person
In the beginning of our Christian life we will experience the Lords power but as we go on He will train us to experience Him as our person
At this time we will also know the sweetness of His love, which surpasses all knowledge, and be filled unto the fullness of God
We will see what it means to be in the church life and to have the living of the new man with Christ as our person
God's way of salvation is not according to our thought, and His desire in His salvation is beyond our natural comprehension
When we receive the Lord, we not only receive His salvation through His vicarious death on the cross and many other blessings
The extent to which Christ is our person in our experience depends on the extent to which we give ourselves to Him
At such a time we may write a 'check' for an even larger amount, but we again ask the Lord to cash only ten percent of it
Once an animal was offered it could not be exchanged or substituted indicating that once a sacrifice was offered it belonged to God forever
Even if a consecrated person tries to delay the payment of his 'check,' the Lord will find a way to receive payment
In God's salvation He has given Himself to us; however, if we are to enjoy Him, we have to give ourselves to Him
The more we give to the Lord, the more we will enjoy Him; the less we give to the Lord, the less we will enjoy Him
In Christianity consecration is often understood as presenting ourselves to God in order to do something for Him
Consecration does not involve our doing anything for God; consecration means that we give ourselves to the Lord
For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself; for whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord
His speaking was based on our consecration to the Lord; that is, it does not matter whether we eat or do not eat certain foods
If someone asks us why we do not eat a certain food, our answer should be that we do not eat it because the Lord is not eating it
If someone asks us why we eat a certain food, our answer should be that we eat it because the Lord is eating it
According to the Chinese mindset, when a woman is married, she marries herself off to her husband; that is, she gives herself to her husband
Before she is married, she belongs to her parents, but on the day of her marriage, she gives herself to her husband, and her name is changed
The best marriage, however, is one in which the wife gives herself to her husband, and the husband gives himself to his wife
It seems as if the Lord is moving very slowly here, but actually, it is our cooperation with the Lord's move that is slow
Year after year we renew our consecration to the Lord with a new 'check,' but we continue to not allow Him to fully cash our 'checks'
While they are in college, many young people are able to make spiritual progress, but some fail to advance after they graduate
It is possible to come to meetings year after year and even to serve the Lord but still have not been gained by the Lord
Even though we have given many things to the Lord, we may still be holding back something of ourselves from Him
Even though everything we do and everything we have may be for the Lord, we still have not given ourselves to Him
The extent to which a husband can be the person in a marriage depends on the extent to which a wife gives herself to him
In Romans Paul uses the matters of eating and regarding a certain day as a test to see whether we have given ourselves to the Lord
If we say that we have given ourselves to the Lord, can we be beside ourselves if that is what the Lord is doing?
In verse 13 Paul says, 'Whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you'
Sister Wang not only believed in a 'foreign religion'; she was beside herself for the Lord, even preaching the gospel in the streets
Nothing that her parents could say changed her mind, and one day, she announced, 'I am going now to preach Jesus'
Consequently, the extent to which we enjoy the Lord's person depends upon how much we have given ourselves to Him
The extent to which He is lived out from us depends entirely upon the extent to which we give ourselves to Him
Since Christ died for us, Paul says that we who live may no longer live to ourselves but to Him who died for us and has been raised
He is a different person because he no longer lives according to his old man and instead takes Christ as his person
When we give ourselves to the Lord and take Him as our person, old things pass away and all things will become new
It is difficult to know whether we are truly absolute, but if we feel that we are not absolute in a certain matter, we must deal with it
Even though the source of his problem was present thirty years ago, he encountered an environment that exposed the problem only recently
We may feel that we have given everything to Him but have no realization that we are still attached to a 'father,' a 'wife,' and a 'nephew'
When we follow the Lord, everything that we reserve for ourselves will be manifested sooner or later and become a source of problems to us
These problems arose along the way only because he had not dealt with these matters clearly when he departed from Ur
Similarly, we may have consecrated ourselves to the Lord, but our consecration contains countless reservations
We do not need to give ourselves to Him because we are useful, but rather because we are not useful in ourselves, and we need to be reduced
Although women are considered to be weaker vessels according to the revelation of the Bible , they are still whole and complete persons
At the time of marriage God wants every wife to hand herself over to her husband and begin to live by her husband and no longer by herself
It is hard to understand why He would create two heads when He only wanted one, but this is how He manifests His wisdom
God indeed created man and woman, each with their own head, and sometimes a woman is even wiser and smarter than a man
Although women will typically cover their head during a wedding, very few keep their head covered after the wedding
The more her head comes out, the more the marriage will lose its sweetness and even become a source of friction
Even if we were the most capable persons, God would still want us to give ourselves to Him and take Him as our person
The thought that we should give ourselves to the Lord when all our capabilities have been brought to nothing does not reflect Gods intention
The relationship between a wife and her husband provides many opportunities to either take or not take someone else as our person
If she takes her husband as her person, she would not be bothered if he said no or if he told her that she needed to wait
If we rely on the Lord only to do things for us, we will limit our experience of Him to knowing His power but not His person
Even if she is smarter than her husband, she should be willing to hand herself over to her husband and take him as her person
A married sister should take her husband as her person, but this often is difficult when the husband is not proper in every regard
As such, He is more than able to be a proper Husband to us, and we will not suffer any loss if we take Him as our person
In Exodus 20:6 the Lord said that He will show 'lovingkindness to thousands of generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments'
For a person who genuinely loves the Lord and takes Him as his person, outward, material losses often are a great gain
In 2 Corinthians 4:7 Paul speaks of having a treasure in earthen vessels so that the excellency of the power might be manifested
When we take the Lord as our person, we will not be influenced by outward things, and we will be unaffected by outward circumstances
Paul had obtained Him in part but not in full, so he pursued to lay hold of that for which he had been laid hold of by the Lord
The extent to which Paul laid hold of and enjoyed Christ depended on the extent to which he allowed Christ to be his person
You should love the Lord and give yourselves to Him rather than worrying about your future related to education, marriage, and jobs
The second step is to take Christ as your person, and the next steps are the same unto eternity, that is, to take Christ as your person
Although he was imprisoned for a period of time, his persecutors eventually released him because they did not know what to do
In Matthew 25 there are two parables: the parable of the ten virgins and the parable of the master distributing talents to his slaves
When we live before the Lord we love Him pursue Him follow Him fellowship with Him and await His return in this respect we are all virgins
Although the amount that the Lord entrusts to each differs, the principle of being faithful to the Lord applies to all
His reward does not differ even when the slaves who were entrusted with different amounts gained different amounts
In this parable the one who received only one talent was the one most in danger of receiving the master's rebuke
The slave with one talent thought that his master was a hard man, one who reaps where he did not sow and gathers where he did not winnow
On earth today the Lord has entrusted us with only a few things, but in the coming kingdom, the Lord will entrust us with many things
Twenty years ago Taiwan was not stable; many people who had fled from the mainland were in turmoil, and they were without possessions
The political situation is stable, the society is prosperous, and everyone has the desire to make money and live in a nice house
If possible they would fill every day before and every day after the Lords Day including the Lords Day with things for their entertainment
Some co-workers also say, 'I dare not serve in Taipei because it is too difficult to work with the older saints
He said, 'You knew,' meaning that it was true that He was a hard man, but that since the slave knew, he should have worked more diligently
The work there is so easy, and the brothers and sisters all welcomed me,' we will all shake our heads in disbelief
If every brother and sister in a district were like the apostle Paul, there would be no need for some to bear responsibility
If the condition of a district is dead but becomes full of life after you go there and serve for three months, it would be so good
The simple ones, those who accepted whatever was assigned to them and went to wherever they were sent, received the Lord's blessing
Some brothers and sisters with low self-esteem think that they are completely useless because they seemingly have no gift or ability
Even if they did not gain someone who was genuinely saved, at least those who did not believe would have heard the gospel
The Lord may not give some the capacity to give a message, but He has given everyone a mouth with which to preach the gospel
If everyone who hears this word would rise up to preach the gospel, we would be able to lead one thousand people to salvation next year
At the same time, in the aspect of service, we are slaves of the Lord, who must be faithful with what He entrusts to us
He first speaks of presenting our body, then of being transformed by the renewing of the mind, and finally of being burning in spirit
Some have presented their body; that is, they attend every meeting and participate in various aspects of service
They pray, read the Bible, and fellowship with the saints, and they also help with cleaning, ushering, and visiting
After we have presented our body and have been renewed and transformed in our mind, we still need to be burning in spirit
If we say that we have a heart to love the Lord but are busy every day of the week, our body will not be presented
If we are very busy but agree to set aside half an hour a week to serve the Lord, we are presenting our body for half an hour
In order to fish for men we need time; we cannot merely shout and declare in the meetings that we are fishers of men
When Paul says that we should present our body, the first implication of his word is that we should set aside our time
There are seven days in a week, and we should set aside four hours a week to preach the gospel and care for the saints
There are many different kinds of people in the church, and according to our nature, we all have some peculiarities
To put off the old man is to put off the fashion of this age; to put on the new man is to put on the church life
No saint who is fashionable can serve God in the church, because this fashionableness is just the devil in disguise
If we have been teaching in a school for two years and our school has not caught a 'Jesus-epidemic,' we must not be proper Christians
If you are a normal Christian, the colleagues in your office would be infected with a 'Jesus-germ' after only a few months
Some have taught in a school for four years, but their students still do not know that their teacher believes in Jesus
We have the divine life and we should supply this life to others that is we should impart this life as germs so that others will be infected
We need to exercise in the matter of our meetings; this does not mean attending the meetings but knowing how function to in the meetings
In the Gospel of John, the Lord said that we are branches of the vine and that we should go forth to bear fruit
Of course in regard to these ways the indispensable point is our need for prayer in order to mention their names before the throne of grace
Chapter 15 is on bearing fruit by preaching the gospel, and chapter 21 is on feeding the lambs by taking care of the young, tender saints
In other words, we have the bearing of fruit in John 15, but we do not have the feeding of the lambs in John 21
In this portion the Lord responded to Peter's answers three times, and He emphasized different things each time
Similarly, in His first response He used the word lambs, the second time sheep, and the third time sheep again
As they grow, however, they need shepherding; that is, they need to be instructed and taught to perform some tasks
We could ask the elders to take care of them, but there are only a dozen or so elders and more than ten thousand saints in Taipei
The elders suggested that we establish districts and let responsible ones in each district care for the saints
The situation in the church today is that there is neither feeding nor shepherding, and the church life is maintained only by the meetings
Our 'plates and bowls' are quite good, but there is no 'food or soup' in them, and even when there is some food in them, it is not tasty
Formerly the saints in Hong Kong were divided into several districts but due to certain circumstances they all had to come together to meet
Since this required that the saints spend more time to travel to the meeting hall, the saints had difficulty coming to every meeting
Now they meet on the Lord's Day from ten thirty in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon, that is, for four and a half hours
A small group consists of five people, two small groups form a medium group, and two medium groups form a large group
Before the meeting they print an outline of the message and ask the saints to pray-read the verses; then they speak what they have digested
In addition to being supplied with living messages, we should stir up the habit of pray-reading spiritual books in small group meetings
In this way we will not merely have a living spirit and a strong service but also a clear understanding of the truth
Although we may respond that we want to be members of the Body, it is not too much to say that we prefer to be club members
While members of the Body do not have any individual freedom, the members of a club can enjoy a great deal of freedom
His experience confirmed that coordinating with the saints and other elders is the most difficult thing for an elder
When the Lord Jesus was living on earth, the question of who among them was the greatest rose up among the disciples in Luke 22:24-26
In chapter 20 of Matthew a similar situation of contention was triggered by the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee
When she came to the Lord Jesus, she asked Him to say that her sons would sit on His right and on His left in His kingdom
In the coordination of the church, the matter of position, such as who is greater or lesser and who is higher or lower, must be dropped
In our physical body the question of whether the eyes are greater than the eyebrows is not even a consideration
We may have a concept that the eyebrows are greater because they are above the eyes, but this is not an accurate concept
Considerations of who is above and who is below or who is higher and who is lower come from the abyss; they have no place in the church
We must completely drop any natural concept concerning position in which someone is higher and others are lower
In the church there are many practical matters that need to be taken care of; hence, there is a need for administration
Some saints have an attitude that when a certain brother becomes an elder, he should be treated differently and honored by all
Our honoring of an elder, however, should be pure; it should not be based on the thought that he is in a higher position as an elder
We need to drop the concept of position so that there is no thought among us that certain ones are 'officials'
We should not have the thought that the elders, co-workers, or responsible ones are capable of doing everything
One person, for example, may say that we should take Highway 1, but another suggests Highway 2, and still another proposes Highway 3
Some routes are shorter, while others are longer, and some routes are easier to navigate, while others are more strenuous
The brothers should be willing to follow the one who has been given the responsibility for arranging the chairs
Without submission, one brother may insist that the seats face each other, while another may insist that the seats face the podium
Such a critical attitude confines the Lord into a small corner of our being, and it is not possible for the Lord to be our person
In the church the way that something is done is a secondary matter; the primary matter is whether others touch life in the church
The rearrangement of the chairs may seem to be a waste of time and energy, but in terms of life, it is not wasteful at all
Even if the elders would ask him to rearrange the chairs once again, it can be done in a way of submission that brings in much life
If you wanted us to arrange the chairs so that they were facing each other, you should have said so in the first place
When we love one another in oneness, unbelievers will know that we are the Lord's disciples and that the Lord was sent by God
The enjoyment of the Lord's life is for the church, and we can enjoy the Lord's bountiful life only in the church
We have observed one thing over the years when a person is in the church he is blessed but when he leaves the church he loses the blessing
These brothers and sisters belong to the church, but by not being on the ground of the church, they have lost the nature of the church
When we speak of leaving the church, we are referring to leaving the ground of the church and losing the practical living of the church
Often what they said sounded reasonable, even to the point that others could not clearly discern the situation
After a period of time, however, it became evident that the Lord was not with them, because they lost the Lord's blessing
It is hard to regard these results as chance occurrences, because they have been repeated in many places over the years
Certainly, we are human beings with the element of the old creation, and more often than not, we make mistakes
In Matthew 18 the Lord spoke about a matter related to the church: If a brother sins against us, we should go and try to recover him
If he refuses to hear us, we should go with one or two more, and if he refuses to hear them, we should tell it to the church
If he refuses to hear the church, the Lord said, 'Let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector'
In the Lords speaking however He did not say anything about spirituality neither did He speak about fearing God pursuing Him or loving Him
In His mercy the Lord has caused us to know the church, highly regard the church, respect the church, and hear the church more and more
According to Acts 12:5, when Peter was in prison, 'prayer was being made fervently by the church to God concerning him'
If we take actions by ourselves that limit the ability of the church to support us through prayer, this is a sad and pitiful situation
If we have a problem with the church and are divided from the church, we will have no part in the confirming that is to the churches
Recently, we have been blessed to see that Christ is our person, and we have been full of rejoicing concerning this matter
May the Lord have mercy on us and keep us forever on the ground of the church and in the practical church life
Paul did not say that the elders should shepherd the saints; he said that they should shepherd the church of God
The last book of the Bible is Revelation, which is the Lord's last word, and this book was written to the churches, to seven local churches
In this book a specific charge to the churches is repeated seven times He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches
In order to properly hear someone's speaking, we must stand in the right position and face the proper direction
If, as a result of such an attitude, a young saint leaves the church, he may still be able to shout, jump, and preach the gospel
On the surface it may seem as if only two people are going out to preach the gospel, but actually the whole church is going out
If a large number of them believe in the Lord, the next generation of Taiwanese-speaking people will become believers
Beginning from this year, it should not be surprising if the church in Taipei gains ten thousand students in two years
Once the work of the students produces fruit, the young saints can work with the children so that the number of children increases
Our eyes need to be enlightened; we need to see that it is worthwhile to put all our resources into this matter
