   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SEVEN THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW COVENANT 3 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:7-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:12-17 Paul speaks of the triumph and effect of the apostolic ministry; in 3:1-6, of its function and competency; and in 3:7-11, of its glory and superiority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we shall see, verses 7 through 11 show the inferiority of the glory of the Mosaic ministry, the ministry of law, a ministry of condemnation and death, and the superiority of the apostolic ministry, the ministry of grace, a ministry of righteousness and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The former was through glory temporarily; the latter remains in glory forever.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After speaking of the triumph and effect of the ministry of the new covenant, Paul goes on to speak of the function and competency of that ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The function is to inscribe living letters of Christ, and the competency, the qualification, is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The writer of these living letters is actually not Paul; the writer is the very God who has been constituted into Paul s being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, God is not only the writer; He is also the ink, the substance or element, of what is written.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that God is writing Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The result of this writing is a constitution of the Triune God into His people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the writer is God, the writing substance is God, and the issue, the result, is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may take writing with a ballpoint pen as an illustration of how God writes Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First a pen is filled with ink.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then it is used for writing certain words on paper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not the pen that actually does the writing; it is the ink, the substance which fills the pen, that does this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nothing of the pen is put on paper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, it is the substance of the ink that is inscribed on the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, the writing on the paper is a composition, a constitution, of the ink.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the same principle, the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is both the writer and the writing substance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the writing of living letters of Christ, the Spirit is the substance that is inscribed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this message we come to the glory of the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The writing substance is inward, but the glory is outward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The writing element is hidden, but the glory is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, the glory is the shining out of the hidden substance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once again, we may use electricity as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The element of electricity flows into a light bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This element is the substance of the light that shines from within the bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the shining of the light is the glory of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, with electricity there is both the essence, the element, and the shining out, the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul s writing concerning the ministry of the new covenant is in a good sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First he shows that the new covenant ministry is triumphant and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This ministry is triumphant because Christ has triumphed and gained the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is triumphant also because the apostles have been captured and have become submissive to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the early apostles were conquered, subdued, and captured by Christ and became very submissive to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their preaching was a sign of their submission.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consider the example of Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How rebellious he was against the Lord Jesus, against the churches, against God s administration, and against God s New Testament economy!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But even though he had been so rebellious, he was conquered, subdued, and captured.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then he became so submissive to Christ that he had no problems with God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, wherever he went, he preached the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This preaching was a strong indication that he had become submissive to God s government and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul, therefore, became a submissive captive of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His submission was an expression of Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every captive in Christ s triumphal procession is a proof of Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This procession celebrates the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the apostles were marching in this procession, they could say, Jews and Gentiles, look at us and realize how triumphant Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was Paul s concept in 2:14.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As he passed through Ephesus, Troas, and Macedonia, he was in Christ s triumphal procession.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today, God is also leading us in a triumphal procession to celebrate Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all are captives in this procession.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ has conquered us, subdued us, and made us submissive to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The ministry of the new covenant is not only triumphant it is also effective.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is so effective that to some it results in life unto life, and to others, in death unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, this ministry is a matter of life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we have emphasized, the function of the ministry of the new covenant is to write, even to inscribe, living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And the competence of this ministry is the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The glory of this ministry is its shining, its expression.</S>
