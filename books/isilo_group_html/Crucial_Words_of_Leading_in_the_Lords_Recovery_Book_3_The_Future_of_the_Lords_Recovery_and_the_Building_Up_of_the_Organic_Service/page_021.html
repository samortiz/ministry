<p>Today in every sector and profession in the world there is much progress. This is especially true in technology where there are rapid changes; for example, the computer is becoming more widespread. However, for the past thirty or more years there has been no real progress in Christianity.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, however, the Lord has been pouring forth light. Recently a very influential Christian publication printed an article that said that the best way to read the Bible is to pray-read it. This terminology was invented by us. A book was recently published in Chinese that said that the best way to study the Bible was the &ldquo;life-study&rdquo; method. The Life-study is our publication.</p>
<p>In 1932 Brother Nee began to put out publications that influenced almost all the seeking Christians in China. The publications especially influenced the young people who had a strong desire for knowledge and whose hearts were stirred up to study the truth. I can testify that Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages were influential because the light in them was clear, and they were full of the life supply. As a young believer, over a period of time I bought many books in order to study the truth, but I later threw them away one by one. In 1962 I went to America, and the next year my family came bringing several boxes of my books. As I organized the books, I looked them over and threw away five big boxes of books. I kept only the books that had been helpful to me, and those were the ones by Brother Nee.</p>
<p>In 1949 I was led by the Lord to move from mainland China to Taiwan. For a period of almost two months, I stared at the ceiling and sighed because I was disappointed with the outward environment. Then one day the Lord caused me to see that even though the outward environment was disappointing, there were three to five hundred brothers and sisters who had moved to Taiwan from the mainland. So I decided to take a train trip from the north of the island to the south in order to visit all the saints and the local churches. After the trip I felt that there was work to be done. On August 1, 1949, we held our first conference in the meeting hall of the church in Taipei. That was the beginning of the work in Taiwan. By the end of the year, the number of saints in Taipei increased from thirty to nine hundred.</p>
<p>Due to a need to print hymnals for the saints, we established the Gospel Book Room, and I began writing in my home. We first put out a gospel hymnal and then <em>Hymns,</em> volume 2. Following this we published <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</em></p>
<p>More than one year later, I went to work in the Philippines for a few months. When I returned in 1951, I felt the need to put out a periodical, so we began to publish <em>The Ministry of the Word</em>. We have put out this periodical for a total of thirty-three years. It is hard to find any publication in Christianity that was published for twenty consecutive years, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have been publishing <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> from 1951 until today, 1984. For the first seven or eight years I wrote articles and did the editing. Later another brother joined me in the work. When I went abroad, the editorial responsibility fell onto his shoulders. In the beginning I helped him polish some articles, but in a short time he was able to handle all the work. All the brothers in Southeast Asia know that most of the churches rely on <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> for their spiritual supply, especially for the supply of light.</p>
<p>I went to America in 1961. In 1963 I realized that there was a need, and so I began to put out a periodical in English called <em>The Stream.</em> I also established the Stream Publishers to print books in English. By the second half of 1963 we felt the need to have a hymnal in English. Therefore, I labored with the brothers in America to select about eight hundred of the best Christian hymns that had been written throughout the centuries. We also added over two hundred of our own hymns, and we translated approximately thirty hymns from our hymnal in Chinese. The hymnal we compiled had one thousand eighty hymns.</p>
<p>The American brothers who helped me were good in English, and they understood music and the proper use of words. They made sure that the songs I wrote in English had proper rhyme and that they fit the meter. Because the hymns from Christianity are short in the truth concerning Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church, most of the two hundred fifty hymns written by me were on these topics. Thus, we can say that our hymnal in English was a great help in laying a foundation for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in America.</p>
<p>This hymnal is highly regarded by Christians in America. Some Christians say that in the two hundred years of American history they do not know of a collection like it. A person who spends several years to study this hymnal will attain a certain level of theological knowledge even if he does not study theology. Even the table of contents, with the different kinds of hymns and their categories, shows that the theological knowledge contained in the hymnal is quite rich.</p>
<p>When I returned to Taiwan in 1967, I felt that the Chinese hymnal needed to be revised, so some Chinese-speaking brothers helped me to arrange the hymns according to the hymnal in English. Hence, the numbers of the hymns in Chinese correspond with those in English, but the Chinese hymnal does not have all the songs that are in the English. We put out the hymnal in English not merely for ourselves. We did it to show the Christians in America that we understand the truth, that our theology is comprehensive and balanced, and that we have included the best hymns from various groups. However, when we published the hymnal in Chinese, we felt that there was not the same need, so we simply collected more than six hundred hymns. Now the hymnal in Chinese contains more than seven hundred eighty hymns.</p>
<p>We began the literature work in America in 1963. More than ten years later, in 1974, we felt that if we wanted the work in America to continue spreading, Los Angeles was not an appropriate place for us, and we began to look for a place to move to. We eventually moved to Anaheim. At that time Anaheim was a newly developing city in Orange County with a population that was mostly Caucasian, and there were only three to five thousand Chinese people. During these past ten years, the number of Chinese immigrants in Orange County has increased. There are now close to thirty thousand Chinese people living in Orange County.</p>
<p>We found a piece of land in Anaheim that was two and a half acres; an acre equals 43,560 square feet, so we had a total of 108,900 square feet. We did not spend much money to acquire the land. We built a two-story meeting hall on the property with an area of more than 26,000 square feet on both levels. We saved about 1.3 million dollars in contractors&rsquo; fees, because brothers from many different localities came and offered their time to build the hall. Moreover, many young people gave up six months of their schooling to help. We built the hall in the first half of 1976, and approximately seventy to eighty brothers offered their time in this way. The local brothers and sisters came in the evenings to help us build. Hence, we were able to build the hall in about six months. This is how the Lord gave us a large meeting hall.</p>
<p>After we moved to Anaheim, we began to hold two trainings every year, one in the summer and one in the winter, to expound the New Testament. We also began a new translation of the New Testament, which included footnotes. Every summer and winter I spoke thirty messages during each training. This winter it will be exactly eleven years since we began the trainings, and we will have held twenty-two trainings. The last book will be the book of Acts. By the end of December we will also have finished the translation and footnotes for the twenty-seven books of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. Due to this work, I could not spend much time visiting the churches to care for them. For every six months, I spent three and a half months translating the Recovery Version and writing footnotes. I had two helpers: one to write down what I dictated and the other to help me read the reference books. These three and a half months were also spent in preparation for the semi-annual trainings. I would spend an average of four to five hours a day writing. This schedule was the Lord&rsquo;s grace, because such a work is very strenuous. We have done this for eleven years in order to finish the study of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The Recovery Version of the New Testament is not merely a new translation of the New Testament; it also includes rich footnotes. The Life-studies, which are based on the text, footnotes, and cross references of the Recovery Version, were released as messages. During every training I released thirty messages, but when we edited them for publication, we added more content so that there are forty to fifty messages for every book. At present, the Life-study of the New Testament lacks only the book of Acts. We first printed the fourteen Epistles of Paul in nine volumes, and by the spring of next year, the rest of the New Testament Life-studies will be printed in eight more volumes. Thus, the Life-study of the entire New Testament will comprise a total of seventeen volumes.</p>
<p>Beginning next summer, I have a burden to speak on &ldquo;The Conclusion of the New Testament.&rdquo; We may spend two or three trainings on the conclusion of the New Testament. This will complete the Life-study of the New Testament. I truly believe that this will be a foundational supply to the saints with a heart to pursue the truth, especially to the young people in every locality who love the Lord and are willing to pursue the truth.</p>
<p>Even though Christianity has not published any spiritual books of weight for the past thirty-nine years, the Lord has released many riches among us. We received many riches when Brother Nee was alive, but the light we received in the Life-study messages has become even brighter. For example, the light of the truth in Mackintosh&rsquo;s <em>Notes on the Pentateuch</em> cannot compare to the light in the Life-studies of Genesis and of Exodus.</p>
<p>More than forty brothers and sisters serve full time in the Living Stream Ministry in America and in the Taiwan Gospel Book Room to supply printed materials, videotapes, and audiotapes to the saints. In addition, about forty volunteers serve in America on a regular basis. Our publication work requires many people to carry it out. This work is a great strengthening for the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<p>The meeting hall in Anaheim is more than twenty-six thousand square feet, and most of the first floor is used by the ministry office. In the ministry office in Irving, Texas, most of the first floor is used by the printing section. All our publications are printed in Irving and distributed to the churches in America. One large truck of books goes out every month to the East Coast. This is entirely the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. His light keeps shining on us. For the last two or three years this light has been focused on God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;the Triune God dispensing Himself into us to produce the Body of Christ. This is a high revelation. Even large denominations in Christianity lack knowledge concerning the Body of Christ. However, the Lord has brought us to such a high level.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord's Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
