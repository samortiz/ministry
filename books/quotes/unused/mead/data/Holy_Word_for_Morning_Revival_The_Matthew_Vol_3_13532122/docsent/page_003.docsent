   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 11 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 14:1-5, 10, 13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and because of this these works of power are operating through him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4 For John had been saying to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>5 And though he desired to kill him, he feared the crowd because they held him as a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>10 And he sent men and beheaded John in the prison.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>13 And when Jesus heard this, He 1 withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place privately.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And when the crowds heard of it, they 2 followed Him on foot from the cities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 14:1-13 we see the rejection by the heathen tetrarch.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Politics is always alongside religion and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Matthew's presentation, after the rejection by religion and natural knowledge, there is the rejection by politics.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Herod the tetrarch represents the rejection by politics.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the basic principle of 14:1-13.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Herod had John the Baptist beheaded in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 12:24 the Jewish religious leaders, representing the entire nation of the Jews, rejected the heavenly King to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This forced Him to forsake His natural relationship with them 12:46-50 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then in 13:53-58 He was rejected by the Galileans also.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now in chapter fourteen, Matthew, in his arranging of events according to doctrine, unveils to us how Gentile politics treated the King's forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was evil and full of corruption and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To this point Matthew has given a full picture of the Jews', the Galileans', and the Gentiles' rejection of the ministry of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter fourteen we see the darkness, rottenness, and injustice in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our eyes need to be opened to see that in religion there is no welcome to our heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Neither is there a place for Him in natural knowledge nor in today's rotten, dark politics.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this generation there is no place for the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Religion, culture, and politics are all one in rejecting the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How I thank the Lord for the record in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you read the chapters prior to fourteen, you will see the deceitfulness in the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You will also see that natural knowledge has caused great damage to people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, you will see the rottenness and darkness in Roman politics, which was the leading political system on earth at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But even in the best political system there is nothing but rottenness and darkness.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>13 1 Because He had been rejected by the people in religious, cultured, and political circles, the heavenly King departed from them and withdrew to a deserted place privately.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that thenceforth He would hide Himself in a deserted place, in a place without culture, away from the religious, cultured, and political circles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did this by means of a boat, implying that He would do this through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because He has been rejected by the civilized world, the Lord, through the church, has always hidden Himself in a realm without much culture, away from religious and political circles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>13 2 In spite of the rejection by all kinds of people, there were still a large number of people who followed the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They did this by leaving their cities.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was not that the King came to their cities to visit them, but that they left their cultured cities to follow Him in a deserted place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through all the centuries the true followers of Christ have left cultured spheres to follow their heavenly King outside the cultured world.</S>
