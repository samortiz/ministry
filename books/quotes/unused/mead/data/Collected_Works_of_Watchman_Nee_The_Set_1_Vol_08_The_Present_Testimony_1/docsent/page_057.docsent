   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SURRENDER OF THE WILL Issue No. 17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are two aspects to our union with God: one is a union in life, and the other is a union in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our union with God in life refers to receiving the life of God at the time of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just as God lives through the Holy Spirit, we also, henceforth, live through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a union in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We share one life with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What expresses this one life is the will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The union in the will is something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The meaning of a union with God in the will is that we have only one will with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two unions are related to each other and are not independent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But here we will only speak of the union in the will; other matters are beyond the scope of our discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The union of the new life is spontaneous, because this new life is just God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are some problems related to the union in the will, however, because the will obviously refers to our will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After our regeneration God is seeking a union between our will and His will day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our will is not fully joined to God, salvation has not yet been fully accomplished; man is not yet in full harmony with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only does God desire that we receive His life, but He also desires that we be in union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The will is absolutely ours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If our will is not in union with His will, then we are not in union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we read the Bible carefully, we will find a general principle concerning all sin: sin is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We perish due to the sin of Adam, and we are saved through the obedience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Formerly we were sons of rebellion, but God wants us to be children of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, rebellion is agreeing with our own will, while obedience is submission to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God saved us so that we would deny our will and be joined to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Believers today often commit a great mistake here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They think that spiritual life is simply a matter of happiness in their emotion and knowledge in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They diligently seek after all kinds of feelings and biblical knowledge; they think that these things are most excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the same time, they accomplish many good, great, and important works according to their feelings and thoughts, thinking that these works will be most pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Little do they realize that God does not require believers to feel or think anything; He only requires believers to be joined to Him in their will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He desires to see believers wholeheartedly seeking after what He is after and willing to do what He says.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without the believers' unconditional surrender and willingness to accept the whole counsel of God, all of their so-called spiritual living is superficial, no matter how much holiness and joy they feel, and no matter what strange teachings they obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All visions, dreams, voices, signs, zeal, work, activities, and labor are outward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If believers are not resolved in their will to finish God's course, everything else is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are joined to God in our will, we will immediately cease from all activities that originate from our self.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that we will no longer have any independent acts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To our self we have become dead, and to God we have become alive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This does not mean that we will act for God according to our impulse or ways.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It means that we will move as a result of God's moving and that we will be delivered from all activities of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words we have changed our center and starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Formerly, all of our works were centered upon our self, and all activities originated from our self.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now everything belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God does not ask about the nature of the things we initiate; He only asks who initiates them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God does not care for anything that is not completely free from the self, no matter how good it may be.</S>
