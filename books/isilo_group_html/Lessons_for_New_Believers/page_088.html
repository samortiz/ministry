<p>Third, we must see that our fellowship with God is the fellowship between two spirits, that is, the mutual fellowship between the human spirit and the divine Spirit. God Himself is Spirit, and we have a spirit in the depths of our being. When these two spirits commune with each other, there is fellowship. Thus, the meaning of fellowship is that we use our spirit to fellowship with God, who is Spirit. If we cannot see this point, it will be difficult for us to practice fellowship with God.</p>
<p>In the beginning when God created all things, He created man with a spirit so that man would have an organ within to contact God, who is Spirit. God created the cattle, the sheep, the birds in the air, and the fish in the sea, but He did not give any of them a spirit because He did not intend for them to contact and receive Him. But when God created man, He wanted man to be a vessel so that He could enter into man. God wanted to be in man just as water is in a cup. In order for God to be in man, man must receive Him. In order for man to receive Him, man must have an organ; otherwise, it would be impossible for man to receive God even if he were willing. Therefore, when God created man, He formed a spirit within man as an organ for man to receive Him. This can be compared to God making man with a stomach because He wanted man to receive food. With a stomach, man can receive food. The stomach receives food, and the body receives the nutrients from the food. In this way the food also becomes the constituents of the body. In the same way, since God wanted man to receive Him as the constituents of his life, He created man with an organ, and this organ is the spirit. Just as the stomach within man is for receiving food, the spirit within man is for receiving God. Just as man needs to use his stomach to receive food, man also needs to use his spirit to receive God.</p>
<p>John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; To worship Him means to contact Him and have fellowship with Him. Therefore, for man to contact God and fellowship with God, he must be in spirit and exercise his spirit. We must worship God who is Spirit in our spirit. We must use our spirit to contact God who is Spirit. Only in this way can our spirit have genuine fellowship with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Condition of Fellowship<br />
between the Two Spirits</h2>
<p>What is the condition of fellowship between the Spirit and our spirit? We must see this from the aspects of feeling and need. We will first speak concerning feeling. When a person first hears the gospel, the speaker may say that everyone is sinful and give one illustration after another so that he is without excuse. Being rational, he can only nod his head and say, &ldquo;This is right. Everyone is sinful, and I also am sinful.&rdquo; However, the fact that he continues to sin without losing any peace proves that the word of God has not touched his spirit, though it may have convinced him in his mind. Hence, there is no reaction in his spirit. As far as his spirit is concerned, he is dead and has not touched the Spirit of God. Therefore, although he confesses his sinfulness in his mind, reasoning, and logic, he still sins as before. When he hears the gospel again, and again hears that he is sinful, he may have a sense that is deeper than merely an acknowledgment of being sinful. Such a sense will cause him to feel regret, be sorrowful, and repent bitterly. Then something deep inside him will cause him to stay away from his former sins. This is God the Spirit touching his spirit. When our spirit begins to contact the Spirit, we will condemn ourselves and feel sorry about our sins. We will be convicted of our sins and may even weep and repent. This is the first condition of the contact between the Spirit and our spirit.</p>
<p>Before our salvation we may have talked loosely. When we wanted to rebuke others, we rebuked them, and when we wanted to boast, we boasted. Moreover, we may have felt good after rebuking others and been delighted after boasting. But once we are saved, if we want to rebuke others or boast as in the past, there is an inward sense that touches and restrains us. Sometimes this sense is so strong that it seems as if it is an electric shock, and we can no longer rebuke others or boast. This is not the result of someone admonishing us to speak politely and no longer use filthy words, and it is not the result of being encouraged to be humble rather than proud. Instead, something has touched our deepest part; the divine Spirit has touched our human spirit. This is a condition of the contact between the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</p>
<p>Let us consider a more detailed example. Before we were saved, we may have bought whatever we wanted, because we were very free with our money. However, now that we are learning to live before God, we have another experience. When we are about to buy some nice clothes, an inward sense may forbid us, and we cannot purchase the clothes. This forbidding is the issue of God&rsquo;s Spirit touching our spirit. This is a condition in which the Spirit contacts our spirit. In the normal Christian life, this feeling is present whether we are working, studying, or having recreation. This condition shows that our spirit is touching the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>The aspect of need is also present within us from the time we are saved. Even though a person may be rich, educated, and have a good family life, he may still feel unhappy and dissatisfied. After listening to a gospel message, there is a sense of joy and sweetness within him. Furthermore, thinking of the Lord Jesus fills him with an inward sweetness. Whenever the Lord&rsquo;s name is mentioned, he senses its loveliness and preciousness, and deep within there is an indescribable satisfaction and pleasure. What is this? This is the Lord Jesus as the Spirit visiting him and touching his spirit. At this point it becomes impossible for him not to think of the Lord and impossible for him to forsake the Lord. This is because the Lord has reached him as the Spirit and visited him.</p>
<p>Although others may have a different experience, the principle is the same. A person may be encouraged and led by others to pray before being saved. Before he prayed, he was indifferent, but as soon as he prays, he feels inward satisfaction, joy, comfort, and support. He also senses that his problems are solved. This is not a psychological reaction or an illusion; it is the issue of the Spirit of reality entering into his spirit to touch his spirit. This also is the condition of the Spirit touching our spirit.</p>
<p>I have never heard of a religion that results in such a condition when one believes. No religion can produce this condition in man&rsquo;s spirit, because religions restrain people with regulations and cannot give people the salvation of the Spirit. The gospel we heard, however, does not restrain by regulations; rather, the living Spirit Himself becomes our salvation. This living Spirit is our Lord and our God. Whenever God visits us, reaches us, and touches us in our spirit, the joy, satisfaction, rest, and comfort within are unspeakable. The satisfaction of our needs is an indication that our spirit has touched God&rsquo;s Spirit and that the Spirit has contact and fellowship with our human spirit.</p>
<p>I believe that we now have some understanding of the matter of fellowship with God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_087.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_089.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lessons for New Believers &nbsp; pg 88</div><br></body></html>
