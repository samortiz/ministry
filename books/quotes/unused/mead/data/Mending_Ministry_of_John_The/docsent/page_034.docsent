   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE REACHING OF THE ANOINTING Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:20, 27; John 7:38-39; Exo 30:23-25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The anointing is another mysterious matter revealed in John's first Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In previous messages we have covered the matters of life, fellowship, and mutual abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we come to the anointing, which John tells us we have received 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word itself is a verbal noun and is used metaphorically.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE ANOINTING IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To understand biblical metaphors we must look to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because spiritual things are abstract and therefore hard to comprehend, God in the Old Testament used many pictures, shadows, and types to portray their meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a biblical principle we need to be aware of.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit of God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His Spirit is abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, to portray Him oil is used as the visible type.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When someone was anointed as king to rule over God's people or as prophet to speak forth for God, he was anointed with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this visible means the invisible Spirit of God was signified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Another principle in the Bible is that of first mention.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first mentioning of a matter indicates the principle of that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When was oil first used for anointing?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was when Jacob was escaping from his brother and on his way to his uncle Laban's Gen 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At night he dreamed of a ladder reaching to heaven and heard God's word of promise vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Upon awaking, he "took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And he called the name of that place Beth-el" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Bethel means the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The oil poured upon the stone, then, is related to God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a thing is anointed with oil, it is associated with the building of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the children of Israel were led out of Egypt and brought to Mount Sinai, they received the vision of the tabernacle and how it was to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then in Exodus 30, when the tabernacle was almost ready to be built, God told Moses how to prepare the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This ointment was to be used to anoint the whole tabernacle, as well as the furniture, the utensils, and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The purpose of this anointing was the maintaining of the house of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God charged Moses to make a compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was not to use olive oil alone; four spices were to be compounded with it, making the oil an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Bible students generally recognize that the oil is a type of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can we explain, though, these four spices which were added?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why was there a need for the oil to be compounded with them?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE FOUR SPICES</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are the four spices in the anointing ointment, together with the amount and their meaning:</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Myrrh</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>500 shekels</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>death</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Cinnamon</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>250 shekels</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>sweetness and strength</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>of Christ's death</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Calamus</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>250 shekels</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Cassia</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>500 shekels</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>power of Christ's</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Myrrh in biblical typology is commonly known to signify death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Cinnamon, a flavorful spice still used in cooking, speaks of the sweetness and strength of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Calamus, a reed that grows out of the mud high into the air, is a picture of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Cassia, which was used in ancient times as a repellent especially for snakes, signifies the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All these spices are compounded into the anointing ointment; that is to say, to the Spirit of God are added the death of Christ, the sweetness and strength of that death, His resurrection, and the power of that resurrection.</S>
