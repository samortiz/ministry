<P>Now let us read Colossians 2:2-3: "That their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ, in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden." In Christ, who is the mystery of God, are hidden all the treasures of spiritual wisdom and divine knowledge.</P><P>Verses 8 through 10 say, "Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ; for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority." For someone to carry you off as spoil is to take you away as his prey. To be made full in Him is to be filled up with all the divine riches. The Living Bible, a paraphrased edition, says in verse 10, "You have everything when you have Christ." If we have Christ, we have everything.</P><P>Verse 19 says, "...holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God." The nourishment, the supply, comes from the joints, and the knitting together comes from the sinews. In the Body there are the supplying joints and the uniting sinews. But all of this comes from the Head through the members of the Body. The supply and the knitting together issue in the growth of the Body, which depends on the growth of God, the increase of God's element, in the Body.</P><P>Colossians 3:4 speaks of "Christ our life." Then 1:27 says, "To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." Christ is our life within us today, and Christ is our hope within us for the future. He is everything. Colossians 3:11b says, "Christ is all and in all." I do not think that anyone can fully comprehend this phrase. But we all need to announce, to declare, and to proclaim that Christ is all and in all.</P><P>Now I would like us to read one more verse&#151;Ephesians 1:10: "Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him." The Greek word for economy means household government or administration, and derivatively, administrative dispensation, arrangement, plan, or economy. The economy that God, according to His desire, planned and purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times.</P><P>I would like to ask, "Is our body upholding our head, or is our head upholding our body?" When I was young, I had the thought that the body upholds the head. But one day I realized that it is the head which upholds the body. If our head were cut off, our body would collapse. This proves that the head upholds the body. This is an illustration to show us that Christ as the Head upholds His Body. God has been working through all the generations and is working today that Christ might head up all things, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth. Christ is the Head. Eventually, He will head up the whole universe. This shows us again that Christ is everything.</P>
