Chapter three speaks of regeneration through water. This water is for burying the old man. In chapter four the Lord says, "But the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" (v. 14). This water is the gushing forth of God's life within man. When we received the Lord, His life entered into us. This is like putting a fountain within us. When we received the Lord's life, we were joined to the fountain of life. In chapter seven the living water is not only in us, but it also has become rivers of living water. It flows out of us into others and supplies others with life and satisfies their thirst. God is not satisfied with us only having His life; He wants His life to flow out of us.</p><p>Miss Barber was such a person. As soon as others touched her, they touched life. If you sat down and fellowshipped with her for a minute or two, you would feel life flowing out of her. If a person with life sits beside you, his very presence will bring life to you. Today God is seeking people into whom He can dispense Christ's life more and more so that they can supply others with His life. Life needs channels, and God wants men to be the channels through which His life can flow to others. May the Lord gain us so that we can have a life-supplying ministry and supply others with life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
