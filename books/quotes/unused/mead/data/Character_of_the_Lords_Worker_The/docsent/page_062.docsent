   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another big problem of a subjective person is that he cannot receive any guidance from God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has no way to know God's guidance, and he is completely ignorant of His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every subjective person is as far from God's will as the north pole is from the south pole.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is impossible for him to know God's will, because he does not match the qualifications of those who are God's followers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It takes a pliable and diligent man with a listening ear to receive guidance from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God's word comes to such a man, he acts upon it immediately without any subjective views of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Balaam's heart erred because it was inclined towards riches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He became subjective in his judgment, and he insisted on his judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why Balaam prayed to God again and again until God told him to go.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a man's mind is set, it is hard for him to understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must learn to walk in God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must realize that God's will often requires that we stop immediately, or it may require that we march immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We often have planned out the whole journey, only to find that the Lord wants us to stop immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the Spirit of the Lord tells us to stop, are we willing to stop?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A subjective man will not stop.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A person who has learned to listen to God is not subjective in any way: He will go forward when God commands him to go forward, and stop when God tells him to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not think that this is a simple thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A subjective man cannot readily go forward when God tells him to go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, once he has picked up momentum, it is hard for God to stop him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is where our problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A strenuous effort must be made to push forward those who are subjective, and once they start moving, no one can stop them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not the way of the instructed, who are pliable in the hands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God tells them to move, they move.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God tells them to stop, they stop.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are the only ones who will receive guidance from God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people will not move until they receive harsh chastisement, and once they move, they never stop.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They go on in the same direction continually.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has to stop them forcefully with His strong hand before they will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their subjectivity prevents them from knowing God's will, much less carrying out His will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Abraham's offering up of Isaac we get a beautiful picture of a man who was not subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If Abraham had been a subjective man when God asked him to offer up Isaac, it would have been difficult for him to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He would have had many things to say.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He would have reasoned after this fashion: "I had no son before.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The possibility of having one never even occurred to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I thought that Eliezer was enough.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was God who wanted me to have a son.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I did not have a thought of a son and neither did Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was all God's idea.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now that He has given me a son, why would He want me to offer him for a burnt offering?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, a subjective man would have had every reason to reject this demand!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Abraham was so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even such a demand presented no problem to him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He believed that God could raise his son from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As he stood by the altar and raised the knife to slay his son, God prepared a ram which he could offer instead of his son Gen 22:10, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If Abraham had been subjective, such a demand would have presented a new problem to him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He would doubtless have been bewildered and would have wondered how he could be told to do one thing at one moment and just the opposite the next moment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But Abraham did not think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was not subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With some people, it is difficult for them to get on the altar, and once they are on the altar, it is more difficult for them to get down.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They spend years getting on the altar, and once they are on it, they insist on remaining there until they die.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A subjective man will act according to his own will even when he is trying to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even God cannot stop him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A subjective man is forced into obedience, and his obedience is many times the result of self-effort.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He cannot be turned around no matter how hard others try.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's will and commandment may direct him to take back what he has given, but he cannot.</S>
