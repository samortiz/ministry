Every chapter of this epistle ends with the coming of the Lord. The last verse of chapter one says, &#8220;Await His Son from the heavens&#8221; (v. 10). This is the coming of the Lord. At the end of chapter two, verses 19-20 say, &#8220;For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at His coming? Are not even you? For you are our glory and joy.&#8221; The last verse in chapter three says, &#8220;So that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints&#8221; (v. 13). Chapter four ends clearly with the subject of the Lord&#8217;s coming: &#8220;Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words&#8221; (vv. 17-18). Finally, 5:23 says, &#8220;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;<p>Every chapter ends with the coming of the Lord because this is a crucial matter in this book. In chapter one the writer talks about the Christian walk; then he encourages the believers with the coming of the Lord. Then, in chapter two Paul teaches us about the fostering of the believers, and he ends this section with the coming of the Lord as an encouragement. Chapter three is the same in principle, and in chapter four Paul gives comfort by speaking about the coming of the Lord Jesus to the saints who had lost some of their hope. Again in chapter five Paul encourages the saints by the coming of the Lord Jesus. First Thessalonians is a book of encouragement by the coming of the Lord. In his earliest epistle Paul uses the coming of the Lord to encourage the believers to go on.<p>No doubt all those Christians were encouraged by Paul&#8217;s word. They may have exclaimed, &#8220;This is glorious! The Lord is coming. Everything is for this, so let us forget about everything else.&#8221; Bible teachers agree that after Paul&#8217;s first epistle, certain others took advantage of this opportunity to say that the Lord Jesus would come back very soon, even after only a few days. It seems that such ones spoke the same thing as the apostle Paul, but in actuality they did not. Although the apostle used the Lord&#8217;s second coming as an encouragement in his first epistle, some people misused it. Therefore, the second epistle was written to balance them.<h2 class=head2>The Balance in the Second Epistle</h2><p>Second Thessalonians 2:1-2 says, &#8220;Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, that you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.&#8221; This suggests that after Paul&#8217;s first letter, others who seemed to agree with the apostle wrote to say something extreme about the Lord&#8217;s second coming. The news concerning this must have come to the apostle, who then wrote the second epistle to adjust, correct, and balance the believers.<p>Verses 3-8 continue, &#8220;Let no one deceive you in any way, because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or an object of worship, so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth, saying that he is God. Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I said these things to you? And now you know that which restrains, so that he might be revealed in his own time. For it is the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating, but only until the one now restraining goes out of the way. And then the lawless one will be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of His coming).&#8221;<p>If we read this word carefully, we can realize that it is a correction, a judgment, and a balance for the extreme teaching. The believers had been encouraged by Paul&#8217;s word concerning the coming of the Lord, but they were pushed too far. No doubt, the Lord Jesus will come back, but there is still the need to be balanced. Throughout the centuries Christians have made many mistakes concerning the Lord&#8217;s coming simply because they neglected to be balanced. On the one hand, we must believe and admit that the Lord Jesus is coming quickly, but on the other hand, we need to realize that prior to the Lord&#8217;s coming a number of events must happen. Unless these things transpire first, it is impossible for the Lord to come back. This is the balance.<p>Our hope as Christians is the second coming of the Lord Jesus, but some people believe in the Lord&#8217;s coming in an unbalanced way. According to the history of the church, people have said many foolish things concerning the Lord&#8217;s second coming because they neglected the second aspect, the aspect that certain things must first be fulfilled. However, there are also many believers who overstress the second aspect when they study the different signs related to the end times. The second coming of Christ is a big subject and to study it requires much time. I studied the different schools concerning the second coming and the rapture. I studied the Brethren teachings and those of G. H. Pember and D. M. Panton. The Brethren especially spent a great amount of time studying the signs. I was with the Brethren for seven years and studied the signs with them. I heard more than one hundred messages concerning the seventy weeks in Daniel 9. They always spoke of the seven weeks, the sixty-two weeks, and the last week divided into two halves of three and a half years, or forty-two months, or one thousand two hundred sixty days. Even until today I can remember all those details. Because of these teachings, however, many have become lazy. They can sleep well and rise late, being sure that the Lord Jesus cannot come back yet because all the signs have not been fulfilled.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
