<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ<br>in the Father's Name by His Divine Life</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>In the Father's Name</H2><P>The oneness of the Body is the oneness of all the believers in Christ in the Father's name (John 17:2, 6, 11). To be in the Father's name is to be in the Father's person, for in the New Testament, the name always denotes the person. Thus, to be in the Father's name is to be in the Father Himself. In the sense of the New Testament, the Father always bears the denotation of the source of life. The father of a family is the source of the life of that family. In John 17:11 the Lord prayed that the believers would be one in the name of the Father. To be one in the Father's name is to be one in the very source of the divine Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>By the Father's Divine Life</H2><P>This oneness is also by the Father's divine life and with the Father's divine nature. Since we have the Father's life, we also have the Father's nature, for the nature always goes along with the life. We have the Father's person as the source of the genuine oneness, and we have the Father's divine life with His divine nature as the very element of this oneness. These are the intrinsic contents of the oneness of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ<br>in the Triune God through Sanctification<br>by the Reality of the Word</H2><P>The oneness of all the believers in Christ is in the Triune God through sanctification by the reality of the word (John 17:14-21). In the portion of His prayer in verses 14-21, the Lord referred to the word and to the truth. The word sanctifies, and the truth sanctifies. Thus, the word and the truth are one. The word contains and bears the truth. This word, which is the truth, sanctifies God's redeemed people from the world (v. 17) and keeps them from the ruler of the world, the evil one (v. 15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>In the Triune God</H2><P>In John 17:21 the Lord prayed, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us." The word Us here refers to the Triune God. This shows that the oneness of the believers is in the Triune God, which means that the believers are mingled with the processed Triune God. The believers could not be one without being mingled with the Triune God. Hence, the Triune God is the very base and element of our oneness.</P>
