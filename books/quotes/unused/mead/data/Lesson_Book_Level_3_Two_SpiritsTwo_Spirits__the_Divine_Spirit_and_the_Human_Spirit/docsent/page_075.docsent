THE TRIUNE GOD A. Revealed in Romans Eight</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit that we are referring to is the Spirit; that is, it is the Triune God who has been processed and has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Look at Romans 8:9, and you will see the reference to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Notice that God, Christ, and the Spirit are all mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet this verse is not making a doctrinal statement; it is dealing with our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Contrary to the way Christianity presents it, the Trinity is not a doctrine for us to subscribe to.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need God to be triune in order that we may experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God, Christ, and the Spirit are all in our experience.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To see the Son is to see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Son speaks, it is the Father who is working.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Two are inseparable.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The term triune means three in one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From one side there are three; but from the other side they are one, because they cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Notice the three terms Paul uses in Romans 8:9 and 10.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He says the Spirit of God dwells in you; that without the Spirit of Christ you are not of Him; that Christ is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why does Paul use three terms to refer to the same One?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is because this One has three aspects: the aspects of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit.</S>
