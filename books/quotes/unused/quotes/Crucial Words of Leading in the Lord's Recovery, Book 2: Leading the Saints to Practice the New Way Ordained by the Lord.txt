While people are busy toiling in the world, You have separated us, even rescued us, from the world and put us into Your name
Lord, although our gathering is on earth, we sense that we are in the heavens, because the heavens are open to us and are even with us
We ask You to unveil us to see Your mystery, which has been hidden throughout the ages and is still hidden to many today
May our sky be clear, and may our mind and intention be upright and be a straight way through which You may freely pass
Confirm the fact that You are one spirit with us, vindicate Your way, and in every aspect put Your enemy to shame on the earth
We have experimented in every stage and step related to the practice of the new way, the way that is ordained by the Lord
We hope that, by the Lord's grace, through our discussion and review all the churches will accept the results that we have obtained
Those who read the Bible usually pay much attention to the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Whether such a decree can be carried out without hindrance depends almost entirely upon the local administration
The Bible reveals that the elders as a group are indispensable in the church life, and our experience also confirms this
If the elders are spiritually rich, the church is spiritually rich; and if they are spiritually poor, the church is also spiritually poor
If the condition of the elders is high, the church will be high; if the condition of the elders is low, the church will be low
Although this aspect is briefly touched upon in the record of the age of Noah, it is addressed in a superficial way
Although elders are spoken of in the Old Testament, this does not mean that they cease to exist in the New Testament
Knowing the Bible is not an easy matter; one should not simply repeat what others say but must study the Bible carefully
The heavens, the earth, God, the promise of the gospel, and many other items are found in both the Old Testament and the New Testament
In Galatians 3:8 Paul clearly says that, even as far back as at Abraham's time, God announced the gospel to Abraham
God announced the gospel to Abraham in Genesis 12:3, saying that in Abraham all the families of the earth would be blessed
When we read the Bible, we must learn to know the principles and the facts and to see that God's intention is consistent
From Genesis to Revelation, from eternity past to eternity future, God's intention has been consistent and has never changed
There are some particular considerations and needs that are reflected in the various procedures, dispensations, and ages
The first thing spoken of in the Old Testament in regard to God's administrative arrangement among His people is God's kingdom
The ephod was attached to the breastplate, on which were twelve precious stones, each representing a tribe of Israel
An English typewriter contains keys for the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet, and the combination of these letters is unlimited
In the Old Testament there was an eldership related to carrying out God's administration and a priesthood related to ministering God's word
Every saved person in the New Testament is a priest , and the elders are simply the more mature and experienced ones among the saints
An elder must be one who has rich experiences of life in regard to spiritual matters and must also be mature in life
We have the set law, the New Testament, which is composed of twenty-seven books containing over two hundred chapters
In the Old Testament, elders and priests were separate; in the New Testament, these two groups of people have become one
Sometimes when an elder encounters a great difficulty, he thinks that it would be better for him to quit and discontinue his service
To wear the letters on the breast is to love and care for the brothers and sisters and to remember them in one's heart
The boat could not be anchored along the shore because the water was too shallow; thus, a sampan carried the passengers to the boat
Mothers make wonderful priests because they not only bear their children on their shoulders but also hold them in their bosoms
When mothers enter into the presence of God to read the condition of their children, they become very clear about their children
It seems that they are forced to be elders, and they feel deeply that it would be best if they could break away from being an elder
Being a priest is not a matter of being young or mature; as long as a person is born into a priestly family, he is a priest
There is no requirement in regard to the life and age of a priest, but an elder must be mature and experienced in life
If it were the building of an organization, it would be organizational, but the building of the Body is organic
Some medical doctors focus their studies on the ear, nose, and throat; some focus on the blood; and some, on the eyes
Since my doctor was a surgeon who specialized in cataracts, he was not able to handle the problem of a retinal detachment
Those who are younger nitpick and more easily blame the doctor for being ignorant in regard to a particular matter
In regard to an organism such as the human body, doctors may spend their entire life studying yet never fully understand it
It is difficult for the elders to administrate the church, because the church is an organism, not an organization
In the matter of leading people to salvation, it may be difficult for us to know whether a person has touched the Spirit
Sometimes we have seen a person who seems to experience a dynamic salvation; once he is saved, he removes all the idols from his house
Some may have thought that birds brought in the tares, and others may have said that the wind blew tares from one field into another field
In the same way, at the time of baptism we have absolutely no way to know who among the newly saved ones may be tares
If we think that someone has not been saved, we can give him a nutritious 'shot' by ministering life to him the following day
We need to see that the church is an organism and that everyone in the church is directly a part of this organism
Some people, on the contrary, meet regularly after they are first saved, but one day, because of an offense from an elder, they stop coming
Strictly speaking, elders must spend much time to study and know the Bible, thereby allowing the truth to enter into them
They must do so because they are elders in local churches, and every local church is a unit that upholds the truth of God
At that time nearly every church on earth encountered great turmoil because of those who were zealous for Judaism
Although these ones believed in the Lord, they continued to teach people to keep the law and to be circumcised
They were very strong in promoting these teachings; thus, they became a problem in churches throughout Jewish and Gentile lands
Just as the apostles are important, the elders are equally important; elders function in cooperation with the apostles
On the other hand, if the apostles and elders do not follow the Holy Spirit, their administration will be paralyzed
Only in such a situation can the administration be complete and whole, being neither disintegrated nor paralyzed
Since he cares for and takes the lead in the local church, he is one on whom every eye gazes and at whom every finger points
If a mother knows how to teach her children, one can be sure that their education will be carried out in a good way
Within the Life-studies there are over twelve hundred messages, each message containing an average of ten pages
If this is the case, the elders will not be able to answer the saints properly when they have questions in regard to their reading
The Life-studies can truly supply the brothers and sisters, give them light, and provide them with the life supply
It seems that in their living there is only one bookthe Biblewhich they may read when they have time and set aside when they run out of time
Although this way may seem slow, we must remember that it is better to be afraid of standing still than of being slow
The newly saved ones among us will then be influenced and edified by this practice and enter into the Life-studies with us
The reason that Taiwan can accomplish so much and reach such a high standard is due to its high level of education
Neither should we rely on chance, thinking that since we have now taken the new way and have changed the system, all things will be revived
If we do not see results for several years, we may assume that the new way does not work and does not bear results
To grow a fruit tree, a farmer needs to spend a few years cultivating it in a proper way; then in due time it will bear fruit
In this kind of living the first and foremost emphasis is that the elders need to take the lead to learn and speak the truth in the churches
To speak in a meeting, we must speak loudly and with the proper cadence so that people can understand us; this is related to teaching
We also need to have the mind of a prophet; that is, we need to receive more light, revelation, and supply from the Life-studies
There is a need for the brothers in the different localities, that is, the elders in the local churches, to do this themselves
For this reason, they bear a great and extremely important responsibility to learn the truth and to be apt to teach
There are two aspects in regard to laboring in the word: on one hand, you need to learn; on the other hand, you need to teach
To shepherd people is to nourish people, to render some supply, to cherish them, and to help them and teach them to solve their problems
If the elders read and enter into the Bible, the saints will be able to tell and will follow the elders in reading and entering into it
The last point is an encouragement to all the elders, which is that those who aspire to the overseership desire a good work
A school can be successful if it formally divides up the classes and hires teachers to teach systematically day after day
We do not need much help from the outside because we have the Bible, a Bible that has been opened to us, and many spiritual publications
In regard to the number of those attending the Lord's Day meeting, we have not experienced much increase for the past twenty years
Prayer: Father, be gracious to us that we may treasure Your holy ministry and touch Your throne of grace with our spirit
Lord, grant us Your visitation so that we may not waste our time or squander Your grace but may become priests and living stones
Many people can preach the gospel, preach the word, and edify others, but in regard to taking the lead, they are helpless
It is not a small matter for someone to take the lead in a locality where saints have been raised up to meet as the church
The teaching required of the elders is not general but specialized; otherwise, there would not be the need for labor
If the elders in the church want to teach the brothers and sisters, they must spend time and effort to labor in God's word
Those who speak from the podium need a certain degree of labor, but the elders' teaching of the saints requires even more labor
They cannot be divided into different grades, such as first and second grade, as is done in an educational system
It may be quite easy for a brother to manage a brothers' house, but it is not easy for him to care for the brothers' house
To care for someone is to look after him, to serve him, be concerned for him, teach him what to do, and give him what he does not have
If the meeting hall is well furnished with tables, desks, and chairs, it is not that easy for people to walk around
In other words, the shepherding one must provide tender care so that the one being cared for has a feeling of warmth
If we are able to speak something appropriate to him and minister life to him, our shepherding will calm him down
Sometimes we genuinely desire to comfort others and we may think that we are comforting them, but the outcome may be exactly the opposite
It is said that in a certain locality, the brothers and sisters tremble when they knock on the door of the elders' room; this is wrong
For the elders to become patterns of the flock implies that elders are also sheep, except that they are the head sheep
When the saints recognize the elders as the head sheep, they will simply follow the elders however the elders lead them
We can tell our neighbors that we live nearby and would like to visit them, get to know them, and speak with them about the gospel
Those saved in this way will naturally do the same thing that we do, because they will see this pattern from the time they are saved
When we read these high truths to people, they will see what the Bible says concerning God's will, honoring one's parents, and the true God
When we open the Bible, we may read a portion from Proverbs, Psalms, or the Gospels, all of which are good and profitable to people
After reading with them, we need to ask them how they feel about what we have read and let them share what they have gained
We often have an erroneous concept that what we speak is too deep and that people cannot understand it when they first hear it
If there is no spread or multiplication in a church, this indicates that there must be a reason; hence, we must have a problem
The problem is that we are too influenced by our background and our old ways and are thus unable to 'jump' out of them
Especially those who have joined the full-time training need not consider too much but should simply advance step by step
In the training during a twentyfour hour day apart from eating resting and sleeping the trainees spend all their time pursuing the truth
In a twenty-four hour day, other than doing some community work in the evening, they can take advantage of the rest of their time
Books are currently published in over ten languages, including French, German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Portuguese
When he published The Christian, Brother Nee had the subscribers pay a dollar per year, which was to be used by the work
Even if there are some portions that you do not understand, you can all come together to discuss and learn from one another
No matter how busy the elders may be, they need to spend at least ten minutes each day to read the Life-studies
In one year they will have read at least one hundred and twenty messages, which is one-tenth of the twelve hundred messages
In this way they will be able to stand up to speak and minister to the saints in the small groups and district meetings
Of course, the elders in every locality have the accomplishment of standing for the Lord's testimony by maintaining a certain situation
If the elders are rich in truth and have an adequate measure of life, they will be useful and be a blessing to the church
According to the principle of Gods creation when the day dawns it does not stay bright forever it remains bright for twelve hours at most
The promises are available, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is within us, and the One who empowers us is with us; these are all for us to apply
We should have this kind of attitude and have such a transaction with the Lord; we should not remain in our old way
Some elders are relatively young; it is not appropriate for them to continue to serve as elders according to the old way
Today in Taiwan, however, Buddhism is greatly propagated; their books can be found everywhere, in big streets and in small alleys
All the aggressive activities of other religions should be a warning to us that we are losing out to them on the island of Taiwan
We should not remain in the old way; rather, we should endeavor to advance and not try to find an excuse for ourselves
The elders and co-workers must be on the alert, rise up, pursue the truth earnestly, and bear fruit so that their function can be manifested
Since we earnestly desire to be spiritual, we must seek that we may excel in the gifts for the building up of the church
When we read, we need to be prepared to minister something for three to five minutes in the district meeting on the coming Lord's Day
We should not speak aimlessly; rather, we should share what we have enjoyed in our reading of the Life-studies over the past six days
The purpose of the change in system is so that everyone would rise up and stop sleeping peacefully when they sense that there is a need
Many have slept peacefully year after year, behaving as if there is no difference between the old system and the new system
When we practice prophesying, we must bear in mind that to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord
We all need to see that prophesying is for the building up of the church, the building up of the Body of Christ
The second thing they need to pursue is the growth in life unto maturity; they must first have the experiences of life themselves
These materials will be produced from the knowledge of the truth and the growth in life; these are the basic factors
Only these two factors-the knowledge of the truth and the growth in life-are able to produce gold, silver, and precious stones
Throughout history, the revivals brought in by the Pentecostal movement were all short-lived because of the shortage of life
A brother who is a medical doctor said that he washes his hands over twenty times a day because he contacts at least ten patients a day
No matter how perfect a person may think himself to be, if he does not confess his sins, his living is a failure
The degree to which we confess our sins is the degree to which we are forgiven, cleansed, and able to receive the Holy Spirit
We can pray unceasingly by calling on the Lord unceasingly, regardless of time, place, or what person or matter we are facing
We now come to a practical point; that is, the elders need to lead the saints to practice the way ordained by the Lord
We must spend time and effort to fellowship and study these four points thoroughly so that we can carry out the new way practically
The elders in every locality should gather the saints together to fellowship and pray specifically regarding every item and every point
In other words, if one hundred saints are meeting as the church, at least forty, preferably fifty, would be involved in the new way
Of course, our greatest hope is that more than half the saints would be involved in visiting people in their homes
For this reason, we need to gather all the saints together in order to fellowship and to pray much regarding taking this way
Going out to visit people in order to preach the gospel and lead home meetings for the perfecting of the saints requires us to pay a price
As far as the practical situation is concerned, it will be a great loss if the church meetings continue to lack in the ministry of the word
In any case, the future of the church is promising; however, the question is whether we are all willing to be in one accord
Often the important personnel in prominent, large-scale firms and factories need to work beyond the scheduled time
In the past few years of experimenting we have discovered several factors that are important and effective in regard to preaching the gospel
If every team gains an average of one person each time they preach the gospel, they will gain two hundred eight people within one year
When a person engages in business, teaching, or a profession, he cannot succeed if his labor is inconsistent and intermittent
Sometimes the Lord may be merciful to us and give us a son of peace, one who has a very good response, at the first door we knock on
Since a home meeting has a fixed time and place, the saints simply need to join themselves to those who have been door-knocking
The doorknocking saints can introduce their brothers and sisters to the new ones by saying These are our brothers and sisters in the church
If possible, within the first month we should have ten home meetings with the new ones; we may visit them every three days for ten times
Based on these figures, if we are consistent, we will reap a hundredfold increase; that is, we will double our number within one year
After people have been visited and baptized, there is no other way that will cause them to grow in life as steadily as the home meetings
We need to let the saints know that if they do not go out to visit people, they can still participate; we are in one corporate move
Those who stay behind to pray need those who visit the new ones, and those who visit the new ones need those who stay behind to pray
Other ways to preach the gospel do not require as high of a price; this way surely requires paying a high price
In this way everyone will gradually be on the right track, and the way that God has ordained will become the atmosphere among us
If all the churches work hard in this endeavor, this practice will certainly become our 'family tradition' within a year
The churches in the different localities can set the time for the prayer meeting and home meetings according to their particular need
If we are more diligent, even more people will remain; the percentage of people who remain altogether depends upon our diligence
In our concept and even in our practice of the church life, we unconsciously place the gospel in a low position
Some may regard life more than truth, and others may regard truth more than life, but very few regard the gospel more than life or truth
Although the gospel is listed last, it is neither for life nor for truth; rather, truth and life are for the gospel
Without truth, there is no life; without life, there is no gospel because the gospel is a matter of fruit-bearing
During these ten centuries, some pursued the Lord, but for the most part, they remained hidden and unknown in history
In preaching the truth of justification by faith, Luther was truly a hero; he testified of this truth and did not fear death
When he faced the matter of the church, he was weak and powerless; eventually, he was protected by a German prince
To be exempted from paying the church tax, one has to obtain permission by filing a special application, stating the reasons
Every British citizen, even if he is not of British descent, can become a member of the Anglican Church upon obtaining British citizenship
Another group of brothers realized that the church must be administrated by a presbytery, a group of elders, appointed by God
After the private churches, a number of brothers appeared and grew in number until the appearance of the Moravian Brethren
Germany, in particular, persecuted those in the private churches and prevented them from gaining a foothold in northern Europe
In Saxony, in the south of Germany, a brother named Zinzendorf opened up his estate and took in many believers
Together, they made progress in the practice of the church life but did not fully recover the practice of the church life
Later most of the Moravian Brethren immigrated to North America, the newly discovered continent, and spread the Lord's testimony there
A century later, the Brethren, a well-known group that included brothers such as John Nelson Darby, were raised up
There are not only state churches and private churches, but out of the private churches, prevailing groups of brothers were raised up
These brothers were of two different stages an early stage including the Moravian Brethren and a latter stage involving the British Brethren
In addition to state churches, private churches, and the two stages of the Brethren, a few further situations emerged
The mystics were in the Roman Catholic Church and were a reaction to the Reformation, which Luther initiated against the Catholic Church
As a result, those who loved and pursued the Lord in the Catholic Church rose up to pursue the inner life and forsook the outward forms
After the passing away of Brother Austin-Sparks, the inner-life movement ceased to exist and came to a complete end
Regarding the inner-life movement, there was a side branch, that is, the renowned Keswick Convention, held in England
If we had been born in the era of the Three Kingdoms in Chinese history, we would have lived our whole life in ignorance
What people say about us today, whether good or bad, may not be reliable; we need to wait for history to evaluate us
Whether in China, Europe, or America, everyone knew that the Brethren were famous for their knowledge of the Bible
In the meantime, Brother Nee withdrew with the national government to Chungking, which was far from the war front
People did not have to work for a week; instead, they ate, drank, played, made merry, and watched operas all day long
At that time all the saints, whether brothers or sisters, whether young or old, were mobilized and went out in groups to preach the gospel
Celebrating the new year was a great thing; the preparation of food alone required a tremendous amount of time
On New Year's Day, we had a gospel meeting in the morning and a second gospel meeting in the afternoon; there was no meeting in the evening
Whenever the children saw that someone was ready to kneel down and pray, they would immediately pass a prayer mat to that person
The church preached the gospel in this way for a year, and as a result, people were baptized continually over a period of about six months
After having some fellowship with this elderly brother for a period of time, his concept concerning the Sabbath was adjusted
In terms of numbers, they had at most two hundred people on the Lord's Day and less than one hundred on other days
The Presbyterian Church was always active in the gospel, whether by visiting the villages or spreading the gospel within the community
Brother Luan was from the northeast; it was there that he contacted the Far East Missionary Society and became a member
Jessie Penn-Lewis; hence, although they appreciated Brother Nee's writings, when they discovered that he quoted part of Mrs
When he preached the gospel, there were often several thousand people listening to him, and people were saved by the hundreds
Truth, life, and the gospel must be twined together as a threefold cord; only then will our gospel preaching produce lasting results
The Bible says that no one can serve two masters; it does not require us to drop our jobs, but if we have a job, we should budget our time
Through years of observation, we have seen a great number of people throughout the world wasting all of their time in the world
Some people buy a new car every year; in the end, in order to buy a new car every year, they must work to the point of exhaustion
If we blindly pursue and are particular in our taste regarding these items, we will continually fall into a snare
If our Lord is real and the words in the Bible are also real, we need to consider how we will face the true and living Lord
Rather, one day, this master returned: 'Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them'
If the Lord has led us to do so, we will be able to settle our account to Him when we stand before His judgment seat in the future
We should exercise moderation in the matter of our children's studies and in many other things related to our living
We should live properly and take care of our children's education properly, but in everything we need to exercise restraint and set a limit
In other words, as long as we have food to sustain our life and clothes to cover our bodies, we should be satisfied
We will soon have a training for the working saints, and our principal burden is to speak this word to the young saints
It is absolutely right for us to have an occupation, but we should never fall into its temptation or be ensnared by it
We need to see that everything related to our occupation such as making money promotions and attaining high positions is a big temptation
People in the world, whether they are going to school or holding a job, all aim for one thing-to gain a place in society
We cannot deny that society today is very competitive, and living in it, we must compete, yet we should also know when to stop
Consequently, the brothers have asked me, 'Should we wait until all the changes are made before we send it for printing'?
The future depends on how we make the comparison and choice; we need to consider what is worth all of our time and even our whole life
Besides the more than four thousand who meet on the Lord's Day, there are over six thousand who meet in other meetings
The more we stay away from a task, the less there is to do, but the more we get into it, the more there is to do
Perhaps, other people may think that our way of preaching the gospel is superior, but inwardly we sense that we still have a long way to go
The reason that we are somewhat flourishing today is that the Lord's recovery has the truth, and our truth has the proper ground
If, as full-time serving ones, the elders want to be 'presidents,' 'deans,' or 'department heads' in the church, this is wrong
The time required to take care of these new ones depends on the actual situation; all of these matters take time
In the past, group meetings were established through arrangements made by elders, but it does not have to be this way
For the group meetings we do not need any kind of regulation or form; rather, we should do everything according to environment and need
We need to be flexible with the time and lead them gradually to be consistent; sooner or later, they will be on track
Those who take the lead in the group meetings need to exercise to direct the meeting, that is, to bear the responsibility for the meeting
On one hand, we should not control the brothers and sisters, and on the other hand, we need to learn to 'direct the rudder' in the meetings
To direct the content of a small group meeting requires having something of the Lord's word to minister at every time
When people come to our meetings, we need to inject them with the 'medicine' they need so that they may be supplied and healed
If there are 'germs' within them, we need to consider all the more how to inject them with the proper 'medicine'
All the brothers and sisters should diligently learn how to take care of home meetings and lead group meetings
We all need to realize that this is not merely a matter of directing the meetings but also a matter of doing it well
Personal testimonies and fellowship concerning actual situations are very beneficial to the attaining of this goal
They can handle everything in the house, including cooking and taking care of children; they are famous in northern China
If in the church life a new group is produced every six months, such a group will need an elder as capable as a Canton maid
Once a district has this kind of elder, it is finished, but if a district has an elder who is like a Canton maid, it will be successful
In short, we will surely gain people by going out to preach the gospel, provided that everyone labors diligently
In order to keep the new ones after we gain them, we need to lead them to establish home meetings and join group meetings
Without this kind of elder, the meetings will be lacking, but with this kind of elder, the meetings will definitely be rich
The most crucial point that we want to fellowship in regard to the district meetings is that we should exercise to function in the meetings
Elders and coworkers should be the head sheep who take the lead to function in the meetings of the whole church and in the district meetings
Every meeting lasts approximately one and a half hours, and there is plenty of time and opportunity for the saints to function
These meetings should not be the same as our meetings in the past in which one person spoke and everyone else listened
The functioning of the saints has become more widespread, and the ratio of saints who speak has increased to roughly forty percent
Based on the actual situation, the most important aspect in serving the churches is to open one's mouth and function in the meetings
Whether in group meetings or in district meetings, we all need to open our mouth; opening our mouth will always be of benefit
As a result of our continuous speaking and promoting, the atmosphere of functioning in the meetings has already undergone a big change
Through this, we realized that Peter's proficiency in Greek could not compare with Paul's or even with James's
We should not think that someone who speaks with a local accent is ordinary and unable to be a prophet; this kind of thinking is not correct
The Bible says, 'Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation'
Corinthians 14:1 says, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy'
At the end of the chapter, he charged the Corinthian believers again, saying, 'So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying'
In verse 12 he was even stronger, 'Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church'
At that time, the Greeks were very superstitious, and according to history, people in Corinth were superstitious to the uttermost
Paul told the Corinthian believers that they were not involved with the unique Spirit but with various spirits
Penn-Lewis warned the believers in her writings that to speak in tongues might invite in evil spirits and bring in Satan's attack
At the beginning of 1900, the Pentecostal movement came from England to the United States and began in Massachusetts
Although they joined the movement, in the end they saw that some matters in the Pentecostal movement were not according to the truth
The Pentecostal movement went even further to claim that if a person did not speak in tongues, he was not regenerated
Of all the missionaries who came to preach in China, those from the Christian and Missionary Alliance were the best
Today the best Christian group in Hong Kong is the Christian and Missionary Alliance; their headquarters are in New York
Regardless of its origin, by the time the Pentecostal movement reached northern China, it indeed involved evil spirits
Prophesying is the most excelling gift, but not in reference to foretelling, tongue-speaking, or interpretation
From now on, we must prophesy more in the meetings; especially the young full-time trainees must all practice to prophesy
The Spirit who indwells our spirit desires that we speak for God; that is, the Spirit is mingled with our spirit to speak for the Lord
God and we are tied together; if we do not move, God will be limited, and it will be difficult for Him to do anything
According to our observation, Taiwan does not have much problem in this regard, and the situation is rather simple
We must avoid giving tediously long prophecies; otherwise, we will occupy too much time and take away the opportunity for others to function
According to our experience, especially in the initial stage of the practice of prophesying, three to five minutes is sufficient
Elizabeth's speaking was the most simple and probably did not exceed two minutes, yet it was an excellent prophecy
When we prophesy in the meetings, we need to be familiar with God's written word, include our experience, and have an instant inspiration
The words spoken by Elizabeth, Zachariah's wife, and by Mary prove that they too had spent much effort studying the Old Testament
If there were thirty thousand people on the earth doing nothing but studying the Bible every day, it would be marvelous
When this group of people would meet together, every one of them would be able to prophesy, and the effect would be immeasurable
Today in the process of changing the system, we must be on the alert while directing the rudder of the meeting
The Lord has revealed this way to us, and if we take it, every group meeting and district meeting will be enriched
We must labor over the Lord's word, grasping every opportunity to redeem the time and get into the riches in the Lord's word
We need to practice unceasingly so that we can quickly learn to speak the Lord's word in the meetings with a rich content
Whether we are a brother or a sister, we should prepare ourselves to prophesy in the district meetings on the Lord's Day
If we consider Mary as an example, we will realize her familiarity with the Old Testament required human effort
If we waste time doing other things, we will not be right with ourself, and even more we will not be right with our parents
We not only need to be familiar with the Bible, but we also need to thoroughly know the outlines and footnotes of every book
If the majority of us have this kind of spirit, what is within us will be manifested outwardly when we come to the meetings
It was not the saints' responsibility to call hymns and pray, much less to speak; their responsibility was simply to sit and listen
After over thirty years of listening, we became numb, and a tradition of not speaking became established among us
In the past, we did not have the opportunity to do this, but now we have been given the opportunity in the district meetings
Although many have seen this outcome, no one has called out loudly to overturn the degraded tradition and let the saints rise up to function
Matthew 5:18 says that until heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or one serif will pass away from the Lord's word
Corinthians 1426 says Whenever you come together each one has a psalm has a teaching has a revelation has a tongue has an interpretation
If we are wise, we should not adopt a wait-and-see attitude; rather, we should all endeavor and strive together
Even if the 'mountain road' is difficult, we will be able to push the car uphill if several hundred are in one accord
The responsible ones need not be in a hurry to prophesy; they can save their prophecy for the end and give priority to others
We are serving the churches; if we receive this burden, the meetings in all the churches will not be a problem
We believe that this prayer will reach Your throne and that our desire will touch Your throne, the throne of Your authority
Lord, we pray that You would be with Your church and remember that this is Your recovery; this is the way that You have led us to walk
As long as we are willing to practice the new way according to the leading that we have received, blessing and success will come to us
The new way enables many to learn and make progress in the matter of prophesying, and this progress is unlimited
We should not respond to an excellent testimony by thinking that we need to find an even better way of doing the same thing
Besides these five thousand, there were perhaps more than ten thousand who stayed home without anyone taking care of them
We particularly look to the Lord that He may lead the elders and co-workers to find a way to carry out this matter
A brother testified that he was saved and baptized in 1949 when the church in Taipei began having gospel marches
Every time he walked past Ren-ai Road and saw hall one of the church in Taipei, he would linger outside too embarrassed to enter
A few days prior to that visit, he had a thought within him that he desired to come back to the church but did not know how to do so
Another part of our family also needs care that is the thirtyeight thousand who were baptized through our doorknocking during the training
We cannot be sure that all of these thirty thousand are truly saved, but at least two-thirds of them are saved
May the church in Taipei be blessed by God to receive the burden to visit these ones consistently, beginning from today
We all need to endeavor to accomplish this; the elders, in particular, should bear this burden and consider this as their goal
At the same time, we should consider that door-knocking is one of many ways to preach the gospel and that it is the most effective way
We should use any means that can bring people to salvation, but it seems that door-knocking is the most effective way
If from now on we go from strength to strength and continue to increase, the rate of increase will be beyond estimation
If we do it properly and if we are all diligent, the newly saved ones will be raised up within a year to function in the same way
In Christianity there is a long-held concept of revival that exists not only within the Pentecostal movement but also among fundamentalists
We should not follow the old way rather we need to go into peoples homes with the gospel the Lord the Bible truth grace love and salvation
The Bible shows that when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He fed five thousand at one time and at another time four thousand
The record in the Bible shows that both through the Lord Jesus directly and in Acts people were saved in a quick way
At that moment Paul called out with a loud voice and told the jailer not to harm himself because the prisoners had not escaped
It seems incredible that some may have seen the bodily-resurrected Lord Jesus, yet they were not completely gained by the Lord
In the Gospels the Lord Jesus frequently traveled in Galilee, and He gained a group of people including Peter, James, and John
Because they were gained directly by the Lord Jesus, they were used by Him to bring the one hundred twenty saints together
In the land of Judea, however, due to the lack of such a group of people who were joined and built together, not many were brought in
Peter, James, and John were the most useful helpers of the Lord Jesus, but even they did not bring in someone from Judea or Jerusalem
After a person is saved, we not only need to have meetings with him in his home, but we should also bring him to a group meeting
That turning away was not physical or geographical, because Paul was in a prison in Rome when he wrote 2 Timothy
Their turning away from him was in regard to the truth in the ministry; all who were in Asia rejected Paul's ministry
In Romans and Galatians, Paul says that the law has been abolished; in 1 Corinthians, he also says that knowledge will be rendered useless
By the sixth of seven days Paul must have felt inwardly pained and must have been praying for the Lord to rescue him from this temptation
When the son of Paul's sister heard this, he told Paul and the commander, and Paul was rescued from that tribulation
Paul could not be sent to Jerusalem, which was Jewish territory; rather, he had to be sent to Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire
After this group of people were scattered, Acts does not clearly indicate how strong and prevailing the testimony became
In Acts 61 there was a dispute over the daily dispensing causing a conflict between the Jews who spoke Greek and the Jews who spoke Hebrew
From his Epistles, we see that Paul preached the truth, dispensed and ministered Christ to people, and established churches
After the preaching of the gospel, we need to maintain continual contact with people; the more contact there is, the better it will be
At most, there should be fifty or sixty people in a district because it is difficult to take care of anything above this number
Although our testimonies in all the districts of the churches may be good, the content of the meetings is not rich enough
If the speaking is rich in the church meetings, especially in the district meetings, the content of the meetings will also be rich
Some speak with the help of a 'cane,' using Truth Lessons, Life Lessons, or the Life-studies, all of which are helpful
There are different ways to tie a knot; just as it is not simple to tie a knot, it is also not simple to conclude a meeting
While testimonies may be helpful to the saints they do not adequately nurture the saints because they do not contain much of the Lords word
The concluding word must have the truth as its basis; such a word imparts truth into the saints so that they feel solid within
At that time he clearly said we should not stop this kind of meeting, because we were not able to find an adequate substitute for it
If the meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen had been stopped, we would not have known how to meet
Our change in system in these past few years is based upon our repeated study and exercise to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26
In verse 1 Paul says, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy'
If a saint can prophesy only when the Holy Spirit is poured out upon him, there is no need for him to desire earnestly to prophesy
Speaking in tongues usually occurs while someone is praying, and the Holy Spirit suddenly descends upon him, causing him to speak in tongues
Mary must have been especially familiar with the Old Testament because her prophecy quotes from the Old Testament extensively
On the day of Pentecost Peter, James, and John observed the Lord's word and taught others concerning what the Lord had commanded them
In Acts 5:42 we see that the apostles taught wherever they were, whether in the temple or in the homes, and they 'did not cease teaching'
Timothy 3:7 says that there are people who though always learning are never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth
To come to the full knowledge of the truth requires our learning; our learning should enable us to know the truth
If we want to speak in the meetings and exercise the gift of prophesying, we need to have a certain amount of learning
Fifty years ago, we thought that a person would be able to speak whenever there was an outpouring of the Holy Spirit
Because of this, some Bible translators in the past translated prophesying as 'speaking the word as a prophet'
In order to speak the word, a person must learn the word; without learning the word, a person has no way to speak the word
Hebrews 5:14 says, 'Who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil'
As long as some people have the Bible in their hands, they can skillfully link Hebrews to Matthew and then link Matthew to Romans
Those who are learned in the Lord's word need to commit what they have learned to those who will be competent to teach others also
In short if we want to learn to prophesy in the church we need to labor on the Lords word and learn how to speak for God and speak forth God
We are considering before God how to train the elders in regard to leading and speaking so that all the elders may be apt to teach
If we were able to train one thousand elders to be apt to teach, it would be an easy task to gospelize the whole island of Taiwan
Experience tells us that it is somewhat easy to serve and to lead people, but it often takes great effort to teach others
In the same principle, in order to teach others to be prophets, to speak for God, we must first labor on the Lord's word
At the very least, the elders need to give announcements in the meetings; thus, it is necessary for them to learn to speak in the meetings
Seminary students are required to take a class concerning methods of preaching, which teaches them how to preach
In other words, since they are elders, they must speak, and they must speak in a way that people can understand
Now that we know the importance and necessity of speaking, we should all the more encourage the saints to learn and to exercise
The result of our exercise over the span of a few months and years will have a great impact on the building up of the church
There is one point that we need to pay attention to; that is, while we usually compose with a pen, we must now compose with our mouth
When speaking of forgiving others, he used an illustration of people burying a dead dog but leaving the tail above the ground
Stanza 4 says, 'Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, / To me, to me, / As Thou didst bless the bread / By Galilee'
Everyone who seeks to prophesy, who seeks the Lord's word, should learn of the spirit and attitude demonstrated in this hymn
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
According to history, the apostles came out of the background of Judaism and were able to quote long poems from Psalms
Every Israelite was required to have something to offer to God, whether an ox, a sheep, pigeons, barley, grain, or fruit
They were required to prepare the produce properly, bring it to Mount Zion, and offer it in the outer court of the temple
If we labor on the good land by cultivating the land trimming the orchard and rearing the oxen sheep and pigeons we will have a rich harvest
For several hundred years, the wind has continued to blow over the land of Palestine and there has been little rain
He was an important leader who introduced significant literary reforms in China in the early part of the twentieth century
Hu Shih sought for the improvement of vernacular Chinese; thus, the only thing he found in the Bible was progress in vernacular Chinese
If a person is not right, his heart too will not be right, and as a result, neither his pursuit nor his goal will be right
The prophets need the revelations in God's word, and the teachers who present a teaching also need the riches of God
After keeping the Feast of the Passover, the children of Israel kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread in which they ate unleavened bread
In the New Testament the Lord Jesus also spoke regarding leaven, saying, 'Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees'
Not everyone can expound the Bible, because the Bible is not an ordinary book to be read and understood by anyone according to his own taste
We need to instruct people concerning the ordinances, principles, and statutes in God's Word; this will constitute a good prophecy
If we want to help people to see this principle of God, we should never do anything that wrongs another person
Prophesying and teaching require us to be persons who know God, enjoy God, and know God's ways, God's rules, and God's principles
When we speak, we will enable others to realize that God is full of lovingkindness, full of forgiveness, and abounding in grace
Genuine teachings come from our labor in God's word; nevertheless, this differs from studying hard in school as a student
It does not matter whether the being of a student studying in school is right or not; his results will be fine as long as he studies hard
Even if a student is a thief, as long as he spends time to study hard before an examination, he will be able to earn a good score
His person disqualifies him from speaking concerning God's ways, because God's ways are righteous and therefore will not permit any stealing
The requirement concerning revelation is even higher, because a revelation is God making known the intent of His heart
Intimate counsel carries a sense of revelation indicating that if we want to receive Gods revelation we must be those who draw near to Him
A person may be familiar with the Bible and adept in linking together verses in the Bible, yet he may not have any revelation or light
At the same time, in the southern part of Germany Count Zinzendorf opened his estate to the Lord's believers because of his love for Him
Because the Bible is the revelation of the mystery of God, our application of these principles will preserve us from straying off
If we want to prophesy in such a way, our person must not only be right, but our spirit must also maintain close fellowship with the Lord
According to my observation in 1946, the sisters in Shanghai, especially the middle-aged sisters, were more trustworthy than the brothers
In order to gospelize Taiwan within the next five years, we need to develop these three matters: the ability to lead, teach, and prophesy
If we look back in history, we will find that the success of the church depends upon leading, teaching, and prophesying
When some are able to take the lead are apt to teach and are rich in prophesying the Lords work will be strong and the church will prosper
Laboring in this way, he became the 'king of Bible exposition' in the past two hundred years of Christian history
One time some brothers asked me Brother Nee praised you and said that your progress could be likened to flying please tell us how you fly
Today in Taiwan, for the purpose of international trade, people regard learning languages as a very important matter
If a businessman wants his products to spread into a certain country, he must at least know the language of that country
Anyone who has a heart to serve must be able to speak Mandarin and Taiwanese in order to be qualified to be a co-worker
All the leading brothers in the churches should study the content of this book so that the churches under their leading might be living
Some elders have said that given the condition of their localities, no matter how much they endeavor, it is difficult to go on
If this does not occur, the brothers who coordinate should come together to fast, pray, and come up with a strategy
From now on we need to strive and push toward the goal of taking the lead well, being apt to teach, and prophesying well
Once we have differences in opinion and live according to our moods, it will be difficult for us to continue on in the Lord's way
A person who is not taking the lead should obey the directions he receives, and one who takes the lead should provide directions
If all the co-workers, elders, and full-time serving ones avoid expressing their opinions, the churches will be blessed
Where there is opinion, there the church is through; even if the opinion is the greatest and brightest, it is still useless
Whether we are co-workers, elders, or young full-timers, we need to realize that when we serve together, we need to learn to have no opinion
All of the opportunities in church service-preaching the gospel, home meetings, and group meetings-are open to everyone
According to this calculation, there are at present about forty thousand brothers and sisters who are waiting for us to labor on them
If we labor in these places, we will have to divert a part of the energy from Taipei, which still requires our labor
If we have the heart we should remain in Taipei to observe and compare all the different aspects whether right or wrong whether good or bad
Today in the church there is not only the need to take the lead well and to teach well, but there is also the need to prophesy well
If all of us strive to press on in this way, perhaps two hundred districts will be produced by the end of the year
Each of these two hundred districts will need at least two prophets, and for this reason, we need to endeavor to exercise to be prophets
If all the other aspects are strong except for the prophesying, the manifestation will be poor and the need will not be met
Paul realized the importance of prophesying; thus, he wrote 1 Corinthians 14, an entire chapter concerning the matter of prophesying
Now that the old system has passed away, everything in the church life is open to the saints, and everyone has the opportunity to speak
The Lifestudies are everywhere in the saints homesin the bedrooms on the dressers on the nightstands and even in the bathrooms and kitchens
A person can go to any corner of the saints' homes and receive benefit by opening and reading any paragraph on any page of any book
If we enter into the riches of the Recovery Version and the Life-studies, within a few years the outcome will be astonishing
Today our spiritual education is fully related to the Bible; however, most people read the Bible according to their own way
In the Recovery Version of the New Testament there are over nine thousand footnotes to help us understand the Bible
In terms of the application of our time, the brothers and sisters with jobs can put a book in their briefcase and bring it with them
In short, we must try our best to urge the saints to pursue to know the truth, which comes from familiarity with the Lord's word
When Brother Nee first promoted the matter of everyone speaking, he proposed that we use the brothers' meetings and sisters' meetings
Eventually we did not how to go on in these meetings because the meetings depended primarily upon everyone giving their testimonies
When we come to a meeting we can begin by calling on the name of the Lord then we can find a verse from the Bible read it and pray over it
The key to our advancing is that we who love the Lord and His recovery must learn to prophesy; some must advance in this matter
In this way, over a period of several months and years, the saints will unconsciously acquire a deposit of the truth
Some among us, although they have an intelligent mind and strong comprehension, are too frivolous in their speaking
It is best if this kind of person does not stand up to speak for the Lord; otherwise, he sells himself cheaply
Weightiness is to be as steady and weighty as a precious stone, not light or easily tossed about like a feather in the air
Some people are at a disadvantage in that according to their natural disposition they give people a feeling of being frivolous
We should be free, released, fresh, and living in the meetings, yet we should not to be frivolous, casual, or reckless
If we do not receive much spiritual training and education related to our speaking, our meetings will have an atmosphere of being 'rough'
If we spend time in the Lord's word and pursue the spiritual life, after several months and years our condition will be completely different
The meetings in all the churches in Taiwan will be rich and sweet, because the level of spiritual education will have risen
We did not care who called hymns in the meetings, we sang casually, and it did not matter to us whether we sang at all
When everyone is paying their full attention to the meeting, allowing the Holy Spirit to speak to us, how could some talk among themselves?
If the elders do not take the lead in small matters, it will be difficult for them to take the lead in big matters
If we do not bear the responsibility to carry out the new way, it will become an empty way, and we will not be able to proceed
We have several meetings a week, which we should use to learn the truth, exercise in the truth, and enter into the truth
Through the publication of the Life-study messages, several hundred churches have been raised up all over the earth
To the degree that the brothers have applied these spiritual riches in their leading of the churches, there are some visible results today
We need to lead the saints to have a foundation in the truth, the Lord's Word, and to enter into the experiences of life
They do not carry a strong flavor like that of garlic or seafood; rather, our meetings are just like plain water
If, after meeting for three years, we do not have any special flavor, it would be like drinking plain boiled water for three years
When a person is newly saved, he may feel that he does not fit in, but after pursuing for two years, he should begin to enter into the truth
If possible, they can call a mini-conference in order to fellowship with the saints regarding this particular burden
We need to encourage the brothers and sisters to consecrate themselves and set apart their time for this matter
We need to lead the saints practically and strongly promote the burden of using one-fourth of our manpower to go door-knocking
Of course, these four hundred new ones will require continual visitation and care from the brothers and sisters in the church
Even in regard to cleaning the meeting hall we must arrange chairs for the meeting in an orderly way and not simply pile them up haphazardly
The majority of the saints love the Lord, and as long as the elders lead them, some will surely be willing to knock on doors
While the home meetings are for stabilizing the new ones, the group meetings are for joining them to the saints and caring for them mutually
In addition, in verse 12 he says, 'Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church'
In terms of spiritual gifts, we should seek to excel; we should not desire the inferior gifts but the excelling gift, that is, to prophesy
Verses 3 through 5 also speak of prophesying: 'He who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men
He had a deep realization that without prophesying, the church would not be rich or strong; thus, he paid much attention to prophesying
To serve and take care of a patient is a ministry , and to serve tables, as the seven brothers did in Acts 6:5 is also a ministry
In addition, the Bible says, 'Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it'
He has passed through all the processes and is consummated as the Spirit; hence, this ministry is of the Spirit
The perfect Triune God needed to pass through some procedures and processes in order to be consummated by the addition of a few elements
The Triune God was perfect in eternity past, but He had only the divine element, divinity, without the human element, humanity
After He was born, He passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living and experienced all the hardships of human life
On the negative side, the Lord's all-inclusive death solved every problem, and on the positive side, His divine life was released
After passing through an all-inclusive death, He stayed in death for three days and then rose from death and ascended
The glorification of a grain of wheat occurs once it falls into the ground, dies, and begins to grow out from the ground
Christ was a single grain, but now He has many grains; this is glorification as well as multiplication and propagation
He is able not only to redeem us but also to enter into us to be our life and mingle Himself with our spirit to be our nature and person
Since the ministry of the New Testament is of the Spirit, it is a ministry of justification, not a ministry of condemnation
Since the creation of all things and man, God has had only two ministries: the Old Testament ministry and New Testament ministry
In Christianity, throughout the whole earth, you can hardly find any books or hear any speaking concerning these matters
The New Testament ministry is absolutely part of the Lord's recovery and can be considered the theology of the Lord's recovery
Because the sun and the moon are unique, we speak of them as 'the sun' and 'the moon,' not as 'this sun' or 'this moon'
The singular ministry refers to the matter, the work; the plural ministers refer to those who carry out the ministry
Ephesians 4:11 says, 'He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers'
Although there is only one ministry, all the serving brothers have their ministries within the unique ministry
There are over forty thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and more than thirty thousand of them still need to be visited and cared for
As far as the ministry is concerned, in the Lord's recovery we do not have two ministries; we have only one ministry, the unique ministry
Our hope is that everyone would function in the meetings; this functioning is the fulfilling of their ministries
Before the manifestation of the New Jerusalem, the works done for God by all who belong to Him are parts of the totality of the one ministry
Names such as the Presbyterian Church and the Baptist Church are like a sixth finger in addition to the five fingers of the hand
In one area of the United States almost one hundred brothers came into the Lord's recovery out of the Baptist Church
Some of their parents were pastors and deacons in the Baptist Church, having a strong denominational background
Although tongue-speaking is right, it is also heresy to make tongue-speaking an item of the faith and a basis for establishing the church
The ministry of the Baptists builds up Baptist churches, and the ministry of the Presbyterians builds up Presbyterian churches
They would investigate his background; if his parents and grandparents were members of the Baptist denomination, there would be no problem
If he was from another denomination or had graduated from a seminary of another denomination it would not be easy for him to become a pastor
If this were the case, he would be required to be baptized in their midst and become an official member of the Baptist Church
We may encounter a situation in which some brothers love to expound the Bible; they are the Apolloses of this age
Only John and his disciples should have been in that part; those who came after them should not have remained there
The official beginning of the New Testament economy took place after the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus
He said, 'Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
When Apollos appeared, chronologically he was in the latter stage and should have been fully in the New Testament economy
In John 3:26 the disciples of John the Baptist had problems and quarreled with the disciples of the Lord Jesus
In Matthew 9:14 they went to ask the Lord Jesus, 'Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast'?
In 1 Corinthians Paul may be likened to a father who has just disciplined his children severely; hence, they were not happy
Paul anxiously cared for the Corinthian believers but Apollos was not as concerned about them in this regard he was more like a stepmother
After the father spanks the children, a real mother, without waiting for the father to say anything, will quickly go to comfort the children
We should have the feeling that we are only building up the Body of Christ with the other brothers and sisters
Today we are carrying out the one ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ, but what is the basis of our building?
The apostles' teaching takes the New Testament economy as its center; this New Testament economy is Christ and the church
Outwardly speaking, Judaism is linked to the Old Testament, which existed among the Jews for one thousand five hundred years
Their conversations, practices, and daily life were all according to the law of Moses, that is, the teachings of Moses
Although the law was good, it was not good enough; although the law was complete, it was not sufficiently complete
In the Old Testament age the principle of God's dealing with man was according to the testimony of the law and based on the law
He put the law aside, and thereafter, the principle by which God deals with man was no longer based on the law but on faith
At the end of that time, He told His disciples, 'I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now
The center of God's economy is to save us to the extent that Christ becomes our Head and we become His members
Sadly, they do not know that there is a verse in the Bible that says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
Christianity adheres to the doctrine of three persons one substance saying that in the Godhead there are three persons with one substance
Many may acknowledge that Christ lives in His believers, yet how could Christ enter into them and dwell in them unless He became the Spirit?
Since Christianity teaches the doctrine of 'three persons, one substance,' most Christians dare not say that Christ is the Spirit
Although they advocate the doctrine of 'three persons, one substance,' they also say that there should not be the confounding of the persons
Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,' and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
For twenty years we have been fighting the battle for the truth, and we have read quite a number of books on this subject
Sadly, among tens of thousands of Christians, only a handful are able to speak our Christian faith in such a succinct way
We cannot simply tell people that we believe in Jesus; rather, we need to speak forth the kernel of the New Testament
The portion that Paul completed is spoken of in Colossians 1:26: 'The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations'
The content of the New Testament, that is, our faith, is concerning the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ
The Old Testament concerns the law of Moses and the New Testament concerns the apostles teaching that is Gods New Testament economy in faith
Although Luke was not an apostle, he wrote the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts under the direction of Paul
It is the apostles who completed the New Testament; hence, the content of the New Testament is the teaching of the apostles
If someone asks us what our faith is, we should tell him, 'Our faith is the entire New Testament, that is, the teaching of the apostles'
The twenty-seven books of the New Testament are the teaching of the apostles and speak primarily of the economy of God
For over a century, the matter of the New Testament ministry has been discussed, debated, disputed, and even attacked by Christians
Whenever those in the Catholic Church encounter a problem, their decision is not based upon the Bible but upon the papacy
The Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther, recovered justification by faith and overthrew the headship of the pope
If a person is a preacher in the Baptist Church, whatever he teaches, speaks, and does must be according to baptism
As to the other denominations, some take an individual as their head, and others take their so-called faith as their head
In the Episcopalian Church, that is, the Anglican Church, the state church of England, the king or queen of England is the head
After this incident, it seems impossible that Peter would be able to continue to preach Jesus among the people
Not long after this, Paul went up to Jerusalem to discuss the matter of circumcision with the apostles and elders
He knew deep within that Peter's fault was apparent; God had established Peter to take the lead, but he led the saints into hypocrisy
When Peter was rebuked, it was not actually Paul who rebuked him; it was the teaching in the New Testament that rebuked him
If one does not act according to the standard of the truth of the gospel, such an action damages and violates the truth of the gospel
The 'constitution,' that is, the leadership in the New Testament, is the teaching of the apostles; we all need to follow this teaching
In the Catholic Church the Virgin Mary, the so-called mother of God, is considered to be without the sinful nature
Beginning in the Middle Ages, a great controversy began concerning whether or not Mary was without original sin
From then on, all Catholics and Catholic theologians must say that the Virgin Mary was without the sinful nature
In sending co-workers to particular places, Paul did not insist; rather, he gave the brothers absolute freedom
From the context, these different things refer to the law, Old Testament genealogies , and profane and old-womanish myths
According to Paul's thought, we should speak only God's economy, which is in faith; that is, we should speak only the apostles' teaching
We draw the conclusion that it was the apostles' teaching that took the lead in the New Testament, not Paul as an individual
The apostles' teaching, the truth, the faith, the teaching of God's economy took the lead in the New Testament ministry
In 3 John 910 Diotrephes who loved to be first would not receive the Lords workers including John but babbled against them with evil words
Everything related to the church in Taipei has passed through the meeting, discussion, and decision of the elders before it was carried out
After the decision is made, then they need to discuss who will carry out the matter; this person will be appointed in the elders' meetings
Everything is under the leadership of the apostles' teaching, that is, God's New Testament economy, the faith of God in the New Testament
In the church, matters should be discussed and fellowshipped by everyone in public meetings and not discussed in private fellowships
Do not be afraid that others would know something, because we are not organizing a political party; we are in the church
Almost every nation in the world has two, three, or four political parties that are always involved in intrigue against one another
At the time, it was as if the church in Taipei was put on an operating table; after being dissected, it was sewn back up
Whether the church is in Kaohsiung, Tainan, or Taichung, nothing should be hidden; rather, everything can be completely displayed
Concerning the work with the students, we first need to study the college work and then work with the high school and junior high students
Every church involved with the students' work should fellowship with one another to learn from one another's practices
In the operation of the human body, although there is a certain amount of organization, it is linked to the body organically
After the change, the organization was removed, and everyone walked and served according to the spirit without relying on organization
In the end, the number of attendees dropped from seven thousand to four thousand; approximately one-third of the people were gone
In the past we may not have paid much attention to this matter; instead, we relied on organization and arrangement
Apparently, it may seem to be an arrangement, but this arrangement is for all the brothers and sisters to fulfill their organic function
If, however, the kitchen were demolished and the dining room no longer existed, the family would still think of a way to eat
We write when we have pens and pencils, and if we run out of pens and pencils, we continue by writing with brushes
No matter what circumstances we face, we continue to put out our publications because our literature work is organic
It is not that we cannot use outward arrangements, but we should make use of them only when they are necessary
If in our understanding the students' work, the ministry, and the training are combined together, this is wrong
At present, all the full-time serving ones are in the training, and as a result, the personnel is temporarily in the hands of the training
No one should go to the training center and summon a certain number of trainees to help with a specific student work
The living arrangements and rest schedule of the trainees is completely planned and arranged by the training center
In this way the training center will determine a number for each work; perhaps only forty people will be available for the college work
When the Ministry of National Defense needs money, it must use its budget through the proper procedures and channels
The Ministry of National Defense does not need to merge with the Ministry of Finance simply because it needs money
After we hand over the manpower, the training center will not interfere with the work in the churches and in the schools
If the college work desires to use some of the manpower from the training center, it needs to cooperate with the training center
The responsible brothers from all the churches need to pay attention to this matter and cooperate with the training center
In regard to their character, we need to train them in the habits of rising early and having a set schedule for work and rest
Every day they also need to allot some time to carry out the student work, either in the colleges, high schools, or junior high schools
When the training is in session, the training center will surely cooperate with any need related to the work with the students
Since the trainees are 'on loan' to the various services in coordination, they need to return to the training center after serving
Some schools may require the students to live in dormitories and may have certain regulations related to the dormitory
Since the parents have given their children to the school, they surely desire that their children abide by the school regulations
During this period of time, the school gives the children back to the parents and has no responsibility over them
When we began our work in Taipei in 1949, the land for hall one of the church in Taipei was bought with the money of the ministry
The brothers who conduct the training are apprehensive that once my burden comes they will not be able to live peacefully
On one hand it needs to please the many elders in the churches while on the other hand it needs to satisfy the young people and also myself
A person who takes the lead in the Lord's work and the Lord's church must be like this; he must learn the lesson of the cross
Even if we were the apostle Paul, when we come to the church in Taipei, we should first come and sit without saying anything
We may have heard many doctrines concerning the cross, but when situations come, they manifest whether or not we truly know the cross
One who has truly learned the lesson of the cross does not and dares not speak loosely; speaking is the touchstone of the cross
For a medical school to be established, cooperation must be successfully established between a hospital and the medical school
Similarly, the trainees cannot stay in the training center forever; they must go out and practically apply what they have learned
We require that they go out to labor; in order for them to be able to labor, they must fellowship with the churches in their localities
We need to realize that we have been saved and regenerated, that we have been sanctified, and that we are in the process of transformation
As for unintentional criticisms, we do not now know how to handle them, and we find it difficult to handle them
The elders and especially the co-workers must learn the lesson of not speaking loosely, regardless of where they are
If they can refrain from speaking too much, regardless of where they are, their work will surely be successful
Although they are very familiar with their own specialty, they sense that their knowledge is limited to certain matters, to a special field
If they encounter other problems, they are aware of the need to consult and discuss with doctors in the relevant fields
After motivating them, we should see how many full-time trainee brothers and sisters are needed to cooperate with them and strengthen them
While this may have some impact at the beginning, in the long run and in reality, inciting people has no eternal value of life
Currently the move of the work in many places depends too much on incitement especially the work of the high school and junior high students
In short, we ask the Lord to save us from incitement; we do not want any incitement but a genuine burden of life
While salespersons can be assigned in this way, we cannot do the same in the matter of preaching the gospel and ministering life
Spiritual work is altogether a matter of burden and of life and is not carried out by methods one uses in a career
In the Bible, there is no such thing as assignment or negotiation; rather, everything is carried out according to burden
Of spending the time and effort to labor on these one thousand six hundred, we should devote the manpower to our burden
Perhaps the burdened ones may labor on only two hundred students, and if the majority remains, this will be effective
Through incitement, we may quickly gain one thousand six hundred people, but in the end, we may have only their names but not their persons
While people in the community have addresses, students have a great deal of mobility, which makes it difficult to knock on their doors
In other words, works produced by incitement are not solid; a solid work must be carried out from one's burden
If a brother contacts his classmates out of a burden he has received, he does not need to contact many classmates
We do not need to incite, promote, or lead people to do anything; this kind of work eventually produces nothing
Some kinds of fungus such as mushrooms sprout overnight but plants such as apple trees are not able to grow and bear fruit in a single night
Even in regard to what we do in the training, we need to consider whether it comes out of burden or incitement
Anything that comes out of incitement does not have much value and cannot last eternally; only that which comes out of burden can last
Today many factories in Hong Kong and Taiwan make artificial flowers in order to increase sales they can make thousands of flowers overnight
After a period of incitement, there will be nothing, and after another time of incitement, there still will be nothing
Upon receiving a burden, we need to pay the price to labor, sow, cultivate, water, and take care of the new ones
If there are saints who are willing to open their homes as support stations it will be a proper and effective way to labor on the students
According to the record in Acts 14:23, once the church came into being, elders were appointed in the churches locality by locality
In the New Testament God still desires to administrate His children through the elders, and they must be assisted by the priests
In the New Testament age every one of us has a Bible in our hands through which we can search and know God's intention
The principle of the discussion of church affairs in the elders' meeting is to let the Holy Spirit be the presiding One
In the elders' meeting, we should never elect a presiding officer; if we elect one, we annul the authority of the Holy Spirit
Today the Lord is the life-giving Spirit , that is, the Holy Spirit, who is with us in all the gatherings of the church
In the church the Holy Spirit is the presiding One in all the meetings; thus, we should not have another presiding officer
In the elders' meeting, all the attendants may bring up matters to be decided upon by following the Lord's leading
When the elders come together, if someone senses the leading within to mention a certain matter that needs a decision, he may mention it
It is not sufficient for the elders to merely carry out the administration of the church they must have direct contact with God and seek God
When the Thummim was added, four letters were added, and thus the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet were present
The elders' receiving of God's revelation reflects the receiving of revelation through the letters on the breastplate
The author of this article said that in Joshua 7 Achan's sin was probably discovered through the Urim and the Thummim
The principle related to the use of the Urim and the Thummim is that the elders administration of the church is not through human government
When the elders come before God, they must bear the brothers and sisters on their shoulders and hold them in their bosom
As they bear the saints in God's presence, God enlightens and enables them to read the condition of the saints
There are three means by which the elders administrate the church: the Bible, the Holy Spirit, and the saints as an alphabet
They need to bear the brothers and sisters before God and read the condition of every brother and sister before God
Acts 15 shows that the brothers had a discussion ; this means that all the attendants had an equal right to speak
Today when the eighty-some elders of the church in Taipei come together, every elder has an equal right to speak
After the brothers finished their testimonies, James decided the matter by offering his views based upon the truth in God's word
The Scriptures he quoted were correct, but in the end he added something of Judaism by speaking of 'what is strangled and blood'
Eventually a resolution was formed in Acts 15 which was the decision of the Holy Spirit and the apostles with the elders this is beautiful
The matter of abstaining from blood and from that which is strangled belongs to Judaism and should not be added to the New Testament
The primary responsibility of the elders is to take care of the church and bear responsibility for the administration of the church
The elders should not only bear responsibility for the administration of the church, but they also need to teach and shepherd God's people
According to worldly experience, cities with fewer people usually follow and learn from cities with more people
The co-workers labor in spiritual matters in coordination with the elders in order to build up the church; this is a clear principle
On the one hand, the elders should never be self-content, thinking that because they are elders, they have no need of the co-workers
Even if this is the case, it is wrong for co-workers to go beyond their duties and labor in place of the elders
Although the elders are responsible for the administration of the church, they do not necessarily need to fellowship with the co-workers
They may be able to take the brothers and sisters to knock on doors, but they may not be able to perfect them in the preaching of the gospel
When these ones lead the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel, they do not need to fellowship with the elders
Since the meeting hall is under the administration of the elders, they should first fellowship with the elders before using the meeting hall
While laboring in various localities, the co-workers need to be like the five prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch
As gifted ones, they labored in that locality, serving the church and the saints, yet they did not touch the administration of the church
The co-workers may be sent by the Lord to do a spiritual work in other places, just like the prophets and teachers in Antioch
There should be only spiritual fellowship and no relationships of employment between the co-workers and the local churches
In other words, although the co-workers may live and serve in one locality, they also take care of other churches according to the need
We all need to understand that in the church meetings there are many kinds of gifted ones, but there are no 'elders'
Once the elders come to the church meetings, they should leave their status of being an elder outside the door
The church in Taipei is a big church with many co-workers; thus, it needs to have a proper understanding regarding this matter
Answer: First, we need to see that in Acts 15 the conference was in the Holy Spirit and presided over by the Holy Spirit; this is certain
The decisions related to matters of the church are determined by the Holy Spirit and the apostles with the elders
For this reason, we need to learn the lesson of not giving ground to any mixture from our background; we need to be pure
In Taiwan in the localities south of Panchiao there are many churches but few coworkers how can we take care of the needs in those places
Perhaps there is a need, but because the churches prefer co-workers who are like the apostle Paul, there is no way to meet their need
If the churches south of Panch'iao need co-workers, they can fellowship with the brothers and see if someone receives a burden
At the same time, because of the different backgrounds and environments of all the churches, we simply do not have an absolute leading
Although Congress may insistently try to pass a law two or three times, according to law, the final decision is made by the president
In Taipei there are currently a number of districts in every hall; hence, we can say that the halls form a kind of boundary
A certain hall may start a new district, which requires buying or renting a meeting place; this matter is the responsibility of the elders
Answer: The young full-time serving ones are in the learning process; they can be likened to apprentices who learn by doing
Although we say that these young full-time brothers and sisters are apprentices, we still need to respect them
They may be likened to an intern in the hospital who has just completed his study of textbooks and laboratory curriculum
It is not easy for these young full-time serving ones to coordinate and serve in the various halls and districts
If this is the case, it will be difficult for the church to advance; rather, we must all coordinate together to serve in the church
When we fellowship we should not leave people with a confused understanding rather we need to pay attention to the outcome of the fellowship
In regard to procedure, there should first be contact, and in regard to principle, there should also be fellowship
A lack of circulation in the body is due to a lack of fellowship; a lack of circulation will cause the entire body to become sick
On the one hand, this is good, but on the other hand, there has been an inadequate amount of fellowshipbetween districts
Since it is not convenient to combine districts together, it is difficult for the elders to handle the situation
The brothers and sisters in the district find it stressful to continue in this way and do not want to meet as a district
Question: If the responsible ones from the two districts continue to hold different opinions after their fellowship, what should we do?
All such words are ignorant and should not be uttered; they are our shame, and they are the flesh, which we should abandon
We all need to learn the lesson that the church is the church and that there has to be a proper way to handle this kind of matter
As for the co-workers, they should go to the different districts without having any view or opinion; neither should they insist on anything
The administration is not in the co-workers' hands; whether they speak to one district or two districts, it is not an issue
Answer Even if we abolish all the districts there are still twentythree halls functioning as twentythree units within the church in Taipei
Question: If there is a brother who always speaks improperly in the meetings, should we forbid him to speak during the meeting?
In the discussion of matters, there is a difference between the length, the weight, and the urgency of different matters
As for who should bring up matters or who should speak, these are trivial things; we should never try to compete for a position
Question: After the full-time trainees finish the training, should they stay in Taipei or go back to their sending localities to serve?
Answer: Responsible brothers who originally served in other localities have come to Taipei to be trained for two years
Many big companies and hospitals have this practice that is they send employees to other places to learn through the exchange of experience
After studying this matter thoroughly, we hope that these trainees will return to their localities after the training
If everyone stays in Taipei but cannot be used properly, it is better for them to return to their sending localities
When they return to their sending localities to serve and coordinate in the church, they will surely be more profitable to the churches
Question: Three brothers bear responsibility in our locality, but since two went to Taipei for the training, only one remains
If we insist upon our consideration of materials and are unable to produce a small table, we have missed the point
A church may need two elders; thus, if the leading ones find two brothers who are fitting, they should motivate them a little
The apostles must know the apostles' teaching, just as a lawyer must know the nation's constitution and all of its laws
When there is a problem in the church life, he must be able to solve the problem based on the apostles' teaching in the New Testament
If a person is not able to do this, his qualification for apostleship is questionable; at most, he will be a very weak apostle
Similarly, in fulfilling his ministry, an apostle must be constituted with the apostles' teaching and thoroughly know the truth
If there is any shortcoming in his knowledge of the truth he will not be able to make proper judgments and his judgment will not be accurate
In Acts 2 three thousand people were saved and all of them continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles
If this is the case, we will have to try our best to lead them so that the more experienced ones will rise up and bear the responsibility
We have invited close to eighty trainees, who are neither elders nor co-workers, to join the training for elders and co-workers
If the elders were strong and rich in spiritual matters, we would have had much increase in these twenty years
We are here not to reprimand anyone but with the hope that we all will be on the alert and know our real situation and lack
The population in Taiwan is increasing, the economy is thriving, and every aspect is progressing; only the church is an exception
We should never think that since we serve full time and have some experience in the Lord's work, we are co-workers
If we have some value, it is because our heart is truly set on the Lord, and we are willing to do something for Him
It is possible to gain someone with just a little effort, but we may not be able to keep him with even ten times that effort
A normal, or proper, brother or sister should at least come to the Lord's table to remember the Lord and learn the truth every Lord's Day
As long as we are willing to go out, pay the price, expend our energy, and spend the time to knock on doors, we will surely gain people
Once they have gained some people, they should nourish them properly and then go out again to preach the gospel several months later
In short, we need to decide which way to preach the gospel based on the condition and situation of our particular locality
Before the change of system, we were lacking in matters such as gospel activities, shepherding people, and group meetings
We need to pay attention to life and to work; we need to focus on the growth in life and on bearing abundant fruit
The full-time serving brothers and sisters should learn to pray and must realize that prayer is the first crucial matter in the work
No matter how busy we are and how little time we have, we need to endeavor to tell the Lord all the burdens within us and pray before Him
Some may not think that it is necessary to fast every week but will announce a fast as needs arise; this also is good
When there is adequate prayer, power will come, and when there is adequate prayer, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit will be upon us
It is absolutely beneficial to our body that we fast one day a week, skipping at least one meal, if not all three meals
Fasting not only enables the digestive system to rest properly but also enables the blood circulation to be cleansed
In the future we may announce a fast and encourage prayer on Tuesday afternoon before the evening prayer meeting
At present, we are very short in this aspect, because over half of our gifted co-workers stay permanently in one locality
There should be some adjustment in this practice that is the coworkers do not need to stay in a fixed place to take care of the church there
If our co-workers take turns to go out in this way, the help that the small churches receive will be immeasurable
An ordinary speaking, even with touching words, does not move people, because both the volume and the voice are inadequate
At present, the entire church is learning to speak, and the responsible brothers are even taking the lead to speak
A brother's speaking in the meeting must be living and loud enough for people to hear; hence, his voice must be loud and his tone weighty
In Christianity, however, it is sufficient to have only one man speak, but among us, we want everyone to speak
We want to help all the brothers and sisters practice to open their mouth and use the proper gestures, tone, and volume in their speaking
In carrying out the new way, we should not force people, expect too much, or want to achieve enormous success with the first try
Quick progress often results in a quick withdrawal; in contrast, a steady progress that occurs little by little is the most secure
We should not seek to advance quickly in the new way; rather, we need to take care of people's actual situation
When older people try to climb a mountain, they may need to rest for ten minutes after walking for five minutes
