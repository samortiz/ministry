<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Propagation of Christ</H2><P>The authority and power of the Spirit were to equip the disciples for the Lord's work. The Lord had told them to "go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation" (Mark 16:15), and to be His witnesses unto the remotest part of the earth. Christ had gotten into some people in Jerusalem, but desired to get into thousands, even millions more. That would be His multiplication and spreading&#151;His propagation for the producing of the churches over the entire earth. Clothed with the economical Spirit, the disciples went out to preach the gospel. On one day three thousand repented, and on another five thousand were saved! The Spirit was their life inwardly and their authority outwardly. This is why their work was so prevailing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. OUR EXPERIENCE OF<br>BOTH ASPECTS OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Even Christ as a man experienced the two aspects of the Spirit: He was born of the Holy Spirit essentially, and also baptized with the Spirit economically for His ministry and work. Every believer in Christ should experience the same thing. God's desire is for a universal expression of Himself, a corporate man that is filled with His life and nature. To produce this expression, God has ordained that it be carried out by mortal men on the earth cooperating and coordinating with Him. What a monumental task! Yet, we are more than able; Christ went through a tremendous process for this purpose.</P><P>Now we can enjoy and experience the life-giving Spirit as our life and life supply. By now we should be clear of the many ways that we can partake of the Spirit for our essential living. But in order to go out to preach Christ to others, we need the "heavenly uniform." How do we experience this economical aspect of the Spirit? We experience it by faith. The baptism of the Holy Spirit upon the Body in Acts was a once-for-all accomplishment. We do not need to wait for it. We have it already. First Corinthians 12:13 says that "in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body." Now we simply go out to preach confident of that fact. When we exercise our faith in this way we will find that hell, Satan, and the demons cannot prevail against our ministry. We will be clothed with the "uniform" of greatest authority. Our preaching of Christ will prevail to bring Christ into others.</P><P>Here we see a wonderful cycle for the propagation of the resurrected and ascended Christ. First, we are filled and nourished with Him essentially. Then, clothed with Him economically, we dispense Him to others that they may also enjoy Him as their life essentially. Our essential enjoyment of the Lord is so that we may work economically to spread Him into others. But what we dispense to others must be what we are filled with essentially. One aspect is for the other. We cannot do without either. Praise the Lord! Christ will get His Body on the earth in this way. Each day we need to take Christ as the Spirit as our life. Then, knowing that we have the Spirit as our "uniform," we should carry out God's work of spreading and multiplying Himself into others. We are well able to do it!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>What does "essential" mean?
