The tree of life is for us to contact and receive, while the tree of knowledge is something we should stay away from
We must be very clear that today the Scriptures are a garden, and in this Scripture garden there are also two trees
Eventually, at the end of the Scriptures there is the tree of life as the life supply to all the redeemed ones
If we could take away every kind of life-the vegetable life as well as the animal life-the whole universe would be a barren, desolate desert
If there were no kind of life in a cityno vegetable life no animal life no human life and even no angelic lifewhat kind of city would it be
They try to have many kinds of lives in their home because the more life they have, the more meaningful their home is
If we bury a tiny seed under the earth, after a few weeks it will break through the earth, grow up, and bring forth many beautiful items
If we go to the scientists, they cannot tell us, and if we go to the medical doctors, they cannot give an adequate definition
There is a verse in the Scriptures which says, 'He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life'
In John 11:25 the Lord says, 'I am the resurrection and the life,' and in 14:6 He says, 'I am the way and the reality and the life'
In addition, John 1:4 says, 'In Him was life,' and 10:10 says, 'I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly'
John 3:16 and 36 also support the divine thought that life is simply Christ Himself, the Son of God, as life to us
Christ as the Son of God is life to us, but we need to ask what Christ has to do with God and with the Holy Spirit
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
There are three persons with three items of blessing-Christ, God, and the Holy Spirit with grace, love, and fellowship
There is the love in my heart, the grace as the expression of my love, and the transmission as a means to pass this grace on to the brother
In the same way the Father is the very source the Son is the expression of the source and the Spirit is the transmission of the expression
When we say that the Son of God is life to us, we simply mean that God is life to us in the Son and through the Spirit
The river is in the second chapter of Genesis, and in Exodus 17 this living water flows out of the smitten rock
God the Father is the source, Christ the Son is the spring, and the Holy Spirit is the flow, the stream, of living water
On the other hand, if we do not have the Spirit, we do not have the Son; and if we do not have the Son, we do not have the Father
To have true edification, we must know life, realize the experiences of life, and have the real growth in life
The best way to test, check, and discover if speaking in tongues is real or not is to check whether or not there is some real growth in life
If we desire to know and realize the real experiences of life, we must know that today the Triune God is in our spirit as life to us
Romans 8:16 proves that the Holy Spirit today is within our spirit, taking our spirit as His abode, His residence
The Lord is the Spirit, and when we join with the Lord, we become one with the Lord in spirit; we are one spirit with the Lord
In the same principle, Hebrews 13:20-21 says that the God of peace does in us that which is well pleasing in His sight
If we realize that life is the Triune God Himself, we must realize that the real experience of life is the experience of God
According to the general teachings in today's Christianity, repentance is merely a change of direction and a dropping of the old life
Real repentance is a repentance in which we experience God, a repentance in which God passes through us and we pass through God
God passes through our being-through our heart, through our spirit, and even through our understanding-and we pass through God
One day he receives the feeling that he is wrong to be this way, so he makes up his mind to adjust himself to be humble and careful
One day, perhaps while we are praying, studying, reading the Word, or even walking on the street, God may come to visit us
We will have love, and this very love is nothing other than God Himself experienced by us and expressed by us toward others
It is in Christ that God is life to us, so in order to experience God as life, we must experience Christ as life
By our experiences and our spiritual knowledge, we know that the experience of Christ as life has steps, or stages
According to the Scriptures, the first step, or stage, of the experience of Christ is that God reveals Christ in us
Some are Christians of Christianity, some are Christians of Christian teachings, and some are Christians of Christ
We are not only Christians of Christianity and Christians of Christian teachings; we are Christians of Christ Himself
The first step of the experience of Christ as life is that Christ is revealed into our spirit by the Holy Spirit
It is regrettable that today there are very few Christians who can differentiate between Christ experienced by us and mere patience
To experience Christ as our patience or humility is absolutely different from simply having patience or humility
The real experience of life is the experience of Christ Himself that is Christ revealed in us Christ living in us and Christ formed in us
For Christ to be formed within us is something inward, while for Christ to magnified in us is something expressed outwardly
We need Christ revealed in us, Christ living in us, and Christ to be formed within us, and we also need Christ magnified in us
For Christ to be magnified in us means that there is always something of, or something as, Christ Himself expressed through us
Rather, do your best to experience Christ as everything in the spirit, and try your best to help others to experience Christ in such a way
How can we realize what the real experience of Christ is and what the experience of something other than Christ is?
To be aware that we are humble and patient with the brothers simply proves that we are not experiencing Christ
Other people realize that in us there is something strange, heavenly, and divine, but we ourselves do not sense it
As long as we know we are loving the brothers, that means we are not loving by Christ; we are not experiencing Christ
Other people can realize many good, heavenly, eternal, spiritual, and divine things with us, but we ourselves do not sense them
To experience Christ as life is absolutely something in the Spirit of life, but to experience spiritual power is something else
To be powerful in a wrong way is one thing, while to experience Christ as our life as well as our power is another thing
The experience of life is to experience Christ Himself revealed in us, living in us as life, formed within us, and magnified through us
In the fifth or sixth century, one of the Lord's servants was very learned, eloquent, and powerful in ministry
The fifth stage of the experience of Christ is that we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
Verses 9 through 10 say, 'But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
We have a life which is created by God, which we received of our parents, but this created life is not the real life
Now we must be born a second time of God in order to have the real life the eternal endless indissoluble divine life which is God Himself
The human life is not the real life; it is only an empty vessel to contain the real life, which is God Himself
Even if we had never become corrupt and sinful, we still would need to be born again because as vessels we still need to be filled
Even if we did not fall and were still as we were when we were created by God, we still would need to have the divine life
We are first born of man, of our father, to be a son of man, but we must be born anew of God to be a son of God
As we have seen, to be born again means to be born of God, but verse 5 says that it is to be born of the Spirit of God
We must repent to such a standard that we realize that we are good for nothing but to be terminated and buried
To be born of water is to terminate the old life, to put the old life of Adam into death and into the grave to be buried
The process, the way, to be born of God is first to confess that we are sinful and good for nothing but to be buried
After the meeting, some young brothers told me, 'If this man will be saved, he will be a great help to the church'
We will have the Lord as life in us; we will have the second life, the divine life, which is God Himself in Christ through the Holy Spirit
We have seen what life is, what the real experience of life is, and that the first experience of life is regeneration
At the time the Lord regenerated us, He renewed our heart and changed our heart from a stony heart to a heart of flesh
Before we were regenerated we were dead in our spirit but at the time the Lord came in to regenerate us He renewed and enlivened our spirit
Many Christians consider that the heart is the spirit, and the spirit is the heart; they take it for granted that these are synonyms
The heart is an organ that can love music, but we need another organ, the hearing organ, the ears, to hear music
The Lord is the Spirit, and we have a living spirit, and with this spirit we can contact the Lord as the Spirit
Receiving a new heart and a new spirit are the two main matters related to ourselves that took place in regeneration
You may say that you realize this, but how many times have you praised and thanked the Lord about this until you were beside yourself?
If we realize these two aspects, these wonderful facts, we will have the standing to know how to experience life
Verse 6 goes on to say, 'For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace'
We know we are not in life when we sense that we do not have peace but conflict, something contradicting and disturbing
To feel that we are hungry and thirsty in the spirit simply means that we do not have a sufficient life supply
When we are not in the Spirit of life this law regulates us to feel that we are in darkness that we are weak and do not have peace and rest
If we are about to say something that is not in the spirit, not in life, right away the automatic law spontaneously regulates us within
In addition, with the Triune God dwelling within us, there is a natural, automatic, regulating law, living and spontaneously regulating us
Sometimes, simply because we do not have this knowledge, we may go to the Lord and pray that He will help and strengthen us
Praise the Lord, the Triune God as life is within us, and with this life is the automatic law which spontaneously regulates us!
The first life, the human life, is a created life, and the other life, the divine life, which is God Himself, is the uncreated life
Although it may sound strange, we Christians as reborn people also have a third kind of life because three basic things have happened to us
After creation and before regeneration, however, something else happened to the human race, to our human being
In the fall the devilish life, the satanic life, the evil life of Satan, the life with the satanic nature, was injected into the human race
By creation we have the human life, by the fall we have the satanic life, and by regeneration we have the divine life
John 3:10 says that the children of the devil are manifest, and in John 8:44 the Lord said, 'You are of your father the devil'
John 1:12 says, 'But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
We have three livesthe human life the devilish life and the divine lifebecause three things happened to uscreation the fall and regeneration
We are three kinds of children, and we have three fathers: a human father, a devilish father, and a divine Father
We never hear a cat barking, but there is no need to teach a dog to bark because to bark is something of the dog life
If we bring new hatchlings to a pool of water, some of them will jump into the water, while others will be frightened by the water
Those who jump into the water are little ducks, and those who are frightened away from the water are little chickens
Day by day there is always a conflict within us because we have three different lives with three different laws
On the one hand, we do have peace, but on the other hand, after we receive Christ, we have more contradiction within
Besides these three laws within us, there is another law, the law of God, which tells us to do certain things and not to do certain things
By being three kinds of childrenhuman children devilish children and divine childrenwe have three lives and with each life there is a law
The body was pure when created by God, but this body was poisoned by the nature of the devil, so it changed in nature, becoming the flesh
Before we were regenerated, there was someone else within us, and now even after we have been regenerated, this one is still within us
Within the fallen human race there is something living, dwelling, ruling, dominating, and exercising its authority to subdue people
In the members of the body there is the evil law, the law of sin, and in the mind there is the law of good, the good yet weak law
These two laws war against each other, but the law of evil in the members is stronger than the law of good in the mind
He realized that his smoking was damaging him and his family; therefore, many times he made up his mind not to smoke any more
He was clear in his mind not to smoke opium, and he hated it, but when the temptation came, he could not withstand it
He would say to himself with tears, 'I should not do this,' but even while he was saying this, he was preparing to smoke
As far as doing good is concerned, this body is one hundred percent powerless and impotent; just like a dead body, it can do nothing
At the time of the fall, Satan injected his poisonous, evil nature into the human life through the body as the instrument
At the time man took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil into his body, the body was changed in nature
That is the evil law of the devilish life, and this evil law is much stronger than the law of good in our mind
We have the third life, the life which is God Himself, the divine, eternal, spiritual, uncreated, heavenly life
A brother may spend time with the Lord early in the morning, worshipping, praising, thanking, and fellowshipping with the Lord
He is so much with the Lord that when he comes out of that fellowship, his wife and children realize that he is a man like God
In the afternoon, however, something happens to him, perhaps related to his wife and children, and he becomes angry and loses his temper
Because you have three lives with three laws, sometimes you are a God-man, sometimes you are a devil-man, and sometimes you are a human
We must realize however that whenever we accept the law of good the other law the law of evil will fight with us and we will be defeated
The apostle reveals that when he goes to do good, there is another law, which is stronger than the law of good
We have the Lord as life, and with this Lord, with this divine life, there is the all-potent law, the most powerful, strongest law
In order to experience the divine life, we must realize that within our spirit there is a third life with a third law
Romans 7 speaks of the law of good and the law of sin in us, and chapter eight speaks of the law of the Spirit of life within us
In the soul we have the human life, in the body we have the devilish life, and in the spirit we have the divine life, the life of God
Creation brought the human life to us, the fall brought a pitiful life to us, and regeneration brought the divine life to us
Besides these three laws within us there is another law outside of us and above us which is the Mosaic law the law of God the law in letters
The law of God demands that we honor our parents, and the law of good in our human life right away corresponds with the law of God
We are defeated by the law of evil, and the law of God, due to the weakness of the human life, can accomplish nothing
The law of Moses says that we must obey and honor our parents, love our neighbors, be humble and patient, and do as much good as we can
Whenever the law says, 'Do something for me,' they say amen, not from the spirit but from the soul, in the soulish life in the mind
The natural, soulish life is very willing to answer this kind of demand, but we are dead to the outward law of God
We forget about all the other laws, but there is one law we remember well, that is, the law of the Spirit of life
With every life there is a law, and all the riches, the contents, of each kind of life are included in the law of that life
After this you have to bring forth the right flowers, and then you have to bring forth a certain kind of fruit of a certain size'
On the whole earth there has never been an elementary school of sin, a high school of sin, or a university of sin
Verse 16 of chapter ten is similar, saying that God will impart His laws upon our heart and inscribe them upon our mind
On the one hand, it is one law, while on the other hand, it is many laws which are put within us and written upon our heart
We can never exhaust how rich the divine life is, and all the riches of the divine life are in the law of this life
A seed has a life within it and a law in its life, but if we keep this seed in our pocket, it will have no opportunity to work
As Christians, there is no need to try to do good, but there is the need to give the opportunity to the law of the divine life
We have the responsibility of giving the opportunity, the spiritual environment, to the law of the divine life
She gave up her family, her husband, and her children, and from early in the morning to late at night she worked for the Lord
When we do not love the Lord, we do not care about the work of the Lord, and we do not do anything for the Lord
The problem with many Christians is that they simply do not love the Lord; their heart does not come to the Lord, so nothing in them follows
If we love the Lord with our heart yet try to do many things, we spoil the environment for the divine law to work something out
To speak the truth, however, the Lord Himself was bothered by this, and all the brothers and sisters were bothered
They had a nice talk with him saying Brother we do appreciate that you love the Lord so much and we do appreciate that your heart is right
We need to learn, on the one hand, to love the Lord, and on the other hand, to stop from any kind of doing, trying, and working
If we quiet ourselves, like a seed which lies quietly under the earth, the divine law will work out all the riches of the divine life
In the previous chapters we saw the sense of life-the consciousness or inner feeling of life-and the law of life
After we have received life in a basic way, we must pay full attention to and practice to maintain the real fellowship of life
The Word of life is not doctrine, teachings, or gospel truths but a living person, the Son of God, the Lord Christ
Fellowship comes out of life, it is a matter of life, and this very eternal life is Christ Himself, the eternal Son of God
The believers, the apostles, and the Father and the Son-man and God, and God and man-have the same fellowship and are in the same fellowship
Not only so, there may be thousands of lights in other rooms and buildings which are also one in the same current of electricity
We have the reality that there is a real, divine, spiritual, heavenly, and living current always flowing within us
John 157 says And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all
These verses were written by the apostle through his experience, and they can be apprehended only by our experience
At that very moment the blood of Jesus is applied to us because while we are in the fellowship and in the light, we sense our sins
Even though we Christians are regenerated and saved, we are still in the old nature, and we still walk and live in this world
It is when we are in the fellowship that we have the light, and in the light and under the light we see how sinful and defiled we are
The anointing always follows the cleansing of the blood, and the cleansing of the blood always brings in the anointing
Following this cleansing, he has a fresher and stronger anointing, and in the stronger anointing he has deeper fellowship
He senses that the Lord is so dear, pleasant, and sweet because he is much more in the fellowship than he has ever been
When we are in the light and we sense our faults and defilement, but we do not confess and apply the blood, the flow within us is stopped
The Lord may punish us in this way for one or two days to the extent that even if we want to come back to the fellowship, we are not able
By this we can see that after we are regenerated and receive the eternal life, we must learn to keep ourselves in the fellowship of life
Out of ten Christians today it is rather hard to find one who strictly walks, lives, and works in the fellowship of life
Even while we are arguing or doing something else against the Lord, we have the inner sense that the flow within us is stopped
We may have many questions, but to care for the inward flow of life is the one answer which is good for all of them
To be a Christian with this flow within is simple, but to be a Christian without the inward flow is very complicated
To do this will save us much trouble and we will understand many things more deeply because we are in the inward flow the inward fellowship
In this message, we will consider another preparatory item, the knowledge, discernment, or distinguishing of the spirit and the soul
In order to realize the spiritual experiences of life, we need to know the difference between the spirit and the soul
Both in the Western and Eastern worlds, many people have had the thought that man is of two parts, an outward part and an inward part
Whether people call it the soul or the spirit, it is the same to them because they do not know that we have three parts
They believe that the soul and the spirit are synonymous terms in the Scriptures, that the soul is the spirit and the spirit is the soul
It is as if they consider that to be spiritual is to be psychological, and to be psychological is to be spiritual
In the Greek text, spirit and soul and body consists of three nouns and two occurrences of the conjunction kai, meaning and
In some matters we should be simple, but in knowing these things we should not be simple; we should be detailed
Because we humans are of three parts, we can contact three worlds, the physical world, the psychological world, and the spiritual world
Finally, we pray together and sense something in our deepest part about what is in his deepest part; this is the spiritual contact
Sometimes we have only physical contact with a brother with no psychological contact and, even the more, no spiritual contact
When we contact the saints, we should try our best not to contact them by our psychology, by our soul, our mind, emotion, and will
As we have seen, 1 Thessalonians 5:23, supported by Genesis 2:7, shows us that we are tripartite, of three parts-spirit, soul, and body
Hebrews 4:12 shows us clearly that the spirit and the soul need to be divided and distinguished one from the other
When a priest offered sacrifices to God, he always used a cutting instrument to divide the parts of the sacrifice
To be sure, if we are with the Lord and in His word, the Holy Spirit will divide our soul from our spirit by the word
A brother may pray, serve, work, and travel together with two other brothers, but he may love one brother more than the other
Sometimes when a brother ministers in a meeting, he may notice someone shaking his head in disagreement and may become disgusted with him
Once when the father was ministering in the meeting, his son sat in a corner expressing his disagreement with him
As we have illustrated, we may love a brother and stand with him, yet we love him by our soul, by our self, and out of our self
There is a great difference between the soul and the spirit, and the soul can be divided and should be divided from the spirit
The soulish man, and the soul itself, cannot understand or receive the spiritual things and even considers the spiritual things foolish
It is by the spirit that we understand and discern the spiritual things, and it is in the spirit that we desire to have the spiritual things
These verses say Then Jesus said to His disciples If anyone wants to come after Me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
The self, that is, the soul, the soulish life, is comprised of three parts-the emotions, the mind, and the will
Many times we say that we need to deny our self; to deny our self is simply to deny either our emotions, our mind, or our will
Sometimes we may also say that a brother is too deep in his opinions and thoughts, or that a sister is too emotional
For a brother who is too deep in his thoughts to deny his self is to deny his mind, his mentality; it is to 'lose his head'
If we pay attention to these matters and spend time to consider them, we will see that many persons are of three categories
The sisters should take the brothers as their head, but nearly all the sisters take their emotions as their head
It is difficult to convince the brothers in their thoughts and considerations, so we often must reason and argue with them
These strong persons can be very faithful because they have a strong will, but there is the need to submit their strong will to their spirit
Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
Luke 92325 says And he said to them all If anyone wants to come after Me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it
Leviticus 11:44b says, 'And you shall not defile yourselves with any of the swarming things that move upon the earth'
The soulish man cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God, so we have to give up, reject, and deny the soul
To deny yourself is to deny your own thought your opinion your idea your concept your love your wish your will your decision and your choice
We have to admit that much of the time we are soulish people because we are so emotional, thoughtful, and willful
Because we are so much in the soul, in the mind, emotion, and will, our human spirit does not have the chance, the ground, to do anything
At other times, however, you love certain brothers so much, simply because you are in the emotion, in the soul
If you would deny your emotion, deny your self, your love toward that brother would be transformed from the soul into the spirit
The more you are one with the Lord in the spirit, the more you are spiritual, the more keen you will be in your mind
After two or three years they became very keen in their mind, in their understanding, especially in the things of the Lord
A spiritual person, on the one hand, is so keen in the mind and emotion, and on the other hand, so strong in the will
A spiritual person is one who is so keen in the understanding of the mind, so emotional in his love and affection, and so strong in his will
With one brother you do not sense anything of the Lord but the other brother is so rich in his thought yet so strong so fresh in his spirit
It could be with the flesh and become a mind of the flesh, or with the spirit and become the mind of the spirit
The mind is not the life of the soul, but one of the faculties of the soul to be used, controlled, and directed by the spirit
We must learn the lesson to deny the natural mind, emotion, and will, and to put them under the control of the spirit
2 Corinthians 7:13 says, 'We rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you'
The way for a normal Christian to act, though, is to always deny the natural mind, will, and emotion, and take the Lord Jesus as his life
When you come to a church meeting, do not exercise your mind, but exercise your spirit to sense the inner life
Romans 8:6 says, 'The mind set on the flesh is death,' and verse 7 says, 'The mind set on the flesh is enmity against God'
It is not easy to give a proper, definite, and adequate definition of the flesh because the flesh is very complicated
At the time man was created, man had the flesh of his body, physically speaking, but he did not have the flesh as spoken of in Genesis 6
The body is under the direction of the soul, and the soul is under the direction of the spirit with God in it as life
The soul rose to the top to live by itself, and it had nothing to do with the spirit and was not under the control of the spirit
Gradually the soul, which had been damaged by the fall, was subdued by the body, which after the fall had become transmuted
The life and the nature of Satan have come into the body of the human race by means of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil of which man partook is something of Satan which has been taken by man into his body
Because sin dwells in the members of our body, our body is no more pure; it has been defiled and transmuted in nature to become the flesh
The first meaning in the Scriptures of the word flesh is the transmuted body, the fallen body, the body which has changed in nature
Strictly speaking, even by the time of the second generation of the human race, the time of Cain, man was not flesh
It was at the time of Genesis 6, shortly before the flood, that man not only had the flesh but also became flesh
God created a soul, not a flesh, but man who was a soul was transmuted by step after step of the fall into the flesh
Whether or not we are flesh depends on whether or not we are living, acting, doing things, and walking under the control of the flesh
If we see the difference between the Spirit and Christ, then in principle we can see the difference between the flesh and the old man
The Spirit is none other than Christ, but Christ is the Savior objectively, while the Spirit is the Savior subjectively
If we did not have the Holy Spirit, we could never know Christ; Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is Christ lived out
If a brother sits before us and never does or says anything, it is hard to say if he is a new man or an old man
Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ, but Galatians 5:24 indicates that we need to crucify the flesh
To deal with the flesh is to put to death the practices of the body, to deal with all the sinful deeds of the body
Romans 6:6 says, 'Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled'
Since the fall, our body has been called the body of sin because this body is now possessed and indwelt by personified Sin
In order to know how to walk in the spirit and experience the inner life, we must know the dealing with the flesh
According to knowledge, he may seem to have been in the Lord for many years, but in actuality he has little real experience
The number of ways that the Lord has to give us trials is inexhaustible, including physical matters, family matters, and many others
We discover that we have little real experience, perhaps only five percent or even one percent of what we thought we had
An introspective person, however, is very capable to take care of himself in the best way, but this is his problem
Many believers need to care for their character, but an introspective person should forget about his character
Rather, spiritual growth depends on the denial of the self, and the denial of the self simply means to forget about the self
The first is the accomplished fact seen in Romans 6:6, which says that our old man has been crucified with Christ
Christ's death is for us because we are identified with Him and are in Him, and because we are in Him, we have died with Him
When we receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we recognize that He died for us and also with us, and because He died with us, we died also
They who are of Christ Jesus recognize and realize the fact that they have died, so they put their flesh to death
As we recognize that we have been crucified on the cross, we are released from the bondage and dominion of sin
Christ accomplished His death on the cross, and we were nailed on the cross in Christ and through Christ; this is a fact
At the time we believed in the Lord, we recognized the fact of our death on the cross, and we sealed our realization by being baptized
From this time on, we should never come down off the cross; we must always keep ourselves in the position of death
Seeing the accomplished fact recognizing and receiving it and bearing the cross are the three steps for us to experience the death of Christ
As we have said, when we recognize that we have been crucified on the cross, we are released from the bondage and dominion of sin
As fallen persons, however, we have not only the problem of sin but a bigger, more serious problem, which is the self
Do not give any ground to the self again because the self is on the cross, and the cross is on the self, that is, the self bears the cross
To always keep ourselves under the death of the cross is to deny our soulish life-our thoughts, our desires, and our will
Whenever we have a thought, desire, or will to do something, we must not forget that the cross is on us and we are on the cross
As we shall see, the real bearing of the cross for the denial of the self must be in the Spirit, not of ourselves
Apparently, we are very familiar with a scriptural term such as self, but if we go into its details, it is hard to find a proper definition
Matthew 16:26 says, 'For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life'?
Similarly, Luke 9:25 says, 'For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself'?
If we compare these two passages, we can see that according to the Lord's word, the self in Luke 9 is the soul in Matthew 16
The next part of the fallen being is the fallen soul, and the least part of the fallen being is the fallen spirit
According to the Scriptures, especially the New Testament, the fallen spirit has very little to do with the flesh, the fallen man as a whole
The body is the form, the vessel, made by God, while sin is something from Satan other than the body which came into the body
If man had kept his soul dependent on God, he would never have disobeyed God and taken the fruit of the tree of knowledge
God clearly told man that he should not take the fruit of the tree of knowledge, but man made the decision to take it
If five brothers come together to coordinate, one brother may be very strong in his will, strongly making decisions in certain matters
In 1922 Brother Watchman Nee and another young brother were the leading ones in Foochow, Brother Nee's hometown
Brother Nee came to the meeting place before the meeting started, and seeing that the weather was very cold, he closed the door
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
Verses 2426 say Then Jesus said to His disciples If anyone wants to come after Me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it
Just as sin is something of Satan in the body, the self is something of Satan in the soul expressed mostly through the opinions
If all the wives would learn the lesson to depend on God and give up their own opinion, do you think there would be divorce?
Before verses 21-26, Peter had been under the revelation of the heavenly Father , but just a short time later he was utilized by Satan
Self is the very essence of Satan in the soul, making the soul independent of God to express its self-opinion and self-will
Whenever we are independent of God and have an opinion or will, we have the self with Satan, who is in the self
If we realize this meaning, and we apply it to our daily life, we will see that day by day this is the problem with every one of us
Step by step, day by day, moment by moment, and even event by event we check our self, opinion, will, thought, and concept by the Spirit
To be filled with this Spirit is to be filled with divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, resurrection, and ascension
Many things come to suppress, depress, and oppress us, but when we are in the Spirit, we experience resurrection power
We need to be in the Holy Spirit because it is by the Holy Spirit that the effectiveness of the death of Christ is applied to us
The more we argue, the more we are in the self, and the more we are under the influence of Satan, even the control of Satan
To deal with the self is to live and walk in the Spirit; it is by the Spirit always to apply the Lord's death to our opinion, will, and self
We also need to apply the death of the cross to our self in our daily life and apply this death to all the items of our self
We must pray about this and remember that the way to practice the dealing with the self is by the cross in the Holy Spirit
In order to learn the way of life, that is, in order to grow in life, we need to also deal with our conscience
Paul also tells us that in order to come near to God to contact Him we must have a heart sprinkled from an evil wicked or defiled conscience
In the past few chapters we saw that in order to grow in the Lord as life, we must deal with our flesh and our self
Since the conscience is a great part of our spirit to deal with the conscience is to deal with our spirit which is much deeper than our soul
We may have dealt with our flesh and our self, so at this time we may not be wrong related to the flesh and the self
In our spirit besides the conscience we also have another function, which is to directly sense the thought and will of God
We may come into a room, for example, and sense a certain atmosphere even if we cannot see, smell, or touch it
Sometimes we may make up our mind to do something, but in our spirit there may be the deep sense that the Lord wants us to do something else
At that time, if we insist on our own opinion, our conscience will speak something for God to show us that we are wrong
If, for example, we do something wrong toward a brother, right away the conscience within us will speak for God to tell us we are wrong
As long as we have an accusation in our conscience, it is impossible for us to contact the Lord to pray in a living way
We simply cannot pray because there is something between us and the Lord, damaging our conscience and hindering us
As long as our conscience has an offense, our assurance of faith will leak out because our conscience is breached
To be sure, if there is an offense in our conscience, our assurance of faith, our peace, and our boldness will be gone
In these days we have seen that the kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly rule, but the heavenly rule has much to do with the conscience
After the fall, the function of the conscience in the human spirit became more active than it was before the fall
After the fall, man received the knowledge of good and evil, so the function of his conscience was much developed
At that time, after the flood, God told Noah to set up a human government; man needed to be governed by other men
After we are saved, however, we come under another government, but we should not quickly say that we are under God's government
Many children, however, after being genuinely saved, do many improper things, for which they are afraid of their parents
To be sure, it is difficult for such ones to fellowship with the Lord in a nice way, and it is also hard for them to pray
They do not have the assurance, the peace, to pray because there are many problems and accusations in their conscience
Between human government and divine government is the stepping stone of self-government through the conscience
The government of the conscience is the stepping stone to be delivered out of the human government and translated into the divine government
Always keep a good conscience; then we will arrive at a condition in which we are directly governed by the Holy Spirit
It is because we need to be translated into the presence of the Lord to be directly under the divine government
A city may always have a police station, but if the police need to come into function with us, this means that we have done something wrong
In the same way, as long as we need our conscience to govern us, there is a little distance between us and the Lord
If we were to have no distance from the Lord, the function of the conscience would not be necessary; the conscience would be jobless
Not only when we do something wrong but even when we only intend to do it, we need the conscience, which then comes in to check us
If we have never dealt with our conscience it has many offenses and accusations and it does not work it is out of function in a negative way
As far as fellowship is concerned, we are far from God in our experience, although in fact the Lord is still with us
We may think that we have some growth, but it is only growth in doctrine and knowledge and not in the real experience of life
Those who say this is too legal are too careless, and a careless Christian cannot have even a little spiritual growth
He may have some kind of growth-in knowledge, doctrine, or other matters-but it is not the real growth in life
The real growth is the growth in the spirit, and the growth in the spirit depends very much on our dealing with our conscience
If we go to the Lord in this way, and if we obey the Lord to deal with our conscience, we will see what problems we have
To walk according to the age of this world has very much to do with the ruler of the authority of the air, that is, Satan
Romans 12:2 says, 'And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
Galatians 1:4 tells us that the Lord died for our sins that He might rescue us not only from sins but out of the present evil age
When Cain, the son of Adam, the second generation of the human race, was driven out of the presence of God, he lost God
For human beings to exist, we need to eat, drink, marry, protect ourselves, and have some kind of pleasure or amusement
Even after all this time, human civilization is still for producing food, protecting ourselves, and amusing ourselves
The problem however is that the enemy of God Satan came in to take advantage of these needs to organize a system a kosmos which is the world
One family may have to pay one thousand dollars, and the two families may bargain for a greater or lesser amount
A human must be clothed which in itself is right but today a great system has been added to clothing and many people are systematized by it
If someone is poor, he has nothing with which to be systematized; he is not rich enough to be systematized and bound
If we ask people to serve the Lord, to have a Bible study, or to pray, they may say that they do not have the time
If something that is necessary for our life-even our wife, husband, children, or parents-becomes more to us than God, it is the world
We do not care about the will of God; we simply like collecting spiritual books, but even spiritual books can be the world to us
One young man may have committed some sins, while another young man is very occupied by certain good yet worldly things
Today some preach the gospel by telling people that when they become a Christian, things will be very nice and happy
When He preached the gospel, He told us clearly that in order to follow Him we must forsake everything and come and follow Him
If we would check ourselves in this light, from this point of view, we will find how much the world is with us
Many Christians today are powerless because inwardly their conscience is full of offenses, and outwardly they have many worldly things
Many Christians today talk about the baptism and outpouring of the Holy Spirit to be clothed with power from on high but where is the power
Perhaps at the very moment that we deal with the last item of the old, worldly things, we will be clothed with power from on high
Before the day of Pentecost, the one hundred twenty believers were a group of people who gave up the world entirely
Because they were in the upper room with nothing of the world in their hands, the Holy Spirit was certain to come down upon them
We may appreciate the experience of the day of Pentecost, but we must pay the price that those one hundred twenty paid in their time
If we go to the Lord to deal with the conscience within and the worldly things without, we will see what kind of Christians we are
We will realize that we have many things that are the world, things that are something other than the Lord Himself
Two things simply put us to death: a conscience full of offenses within and the world, usurping, occupying, and possessing us without
We may not be cleansed from all the offenses in the conscience, and we may not be free from the bondage of the world
If we neglect our conscience, we may gain much self-knowledge, but we cannot have even a little spiritual growth
If we have a problem, accusation, or offense in our conscience, it is very difficult to advance in the life of the Lord
In order to deal with the flesh and the self, we need many lessons on applying the crucifixion of the Lord in our daily life
Our gospel preaching must be prevailing and powerful, but the way to preach the gospel in power is to sacrifice
If we give up all the usurpation of the worldly things, we will be released, and we will be clothed with power from on high
We need to deal with our flesh, our self, our conscience, and even the more with our spirit as our innermost part
After we learn how to deal with the flesh, the self, and the conscience, we must learn how to deal with the spirit itself
If the spirit is not pure and right, no matter how clean we are in other matters, there still will be something defiling
Timothy 1:7 says, 'For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness'
It is a spirit of power toward the enemy, a spirit of love toward others, and a spirit of sobermindedness toward ourselves
Galatians 6:1 says, 'Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness'
Proverbs 16:19 says, 'It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, / Than to divide the spoil with the proud'
There are many passages concerning the spirit, but this selection is sufficient to show us that the spirit may be in different conditions
The only verse that might indicate this is 2 Corinthians 7:1, which speaks of defilement of flesh and of spirit
Because we feel happy with others, we may treat them well; this is to contact them with our emotions, which is not sincere
We contact others in sincerity when we contact them in the spirit, because this is a contact from the innermost part of our whole being
For someone to lose his temper is the most sincere contact, because it is easy to release the spirit when we lose our temper
We have self-consciousness, considerations about others, and problems with language, grammar, composition, and content, among other things
When the outpouring of the Spirit comes upon us, we release our spirit and pray from the depths of our whole being
His message is one of heavenly light; it may even be a great and unprecedented revelation, something the church has never before seen
We may go to a brother to speak something very spiritual, yet we may speak it in a spirit that is not meek, not humble, and not of love
Someone may ask us how we feel about a brother, and we may reply that he is a good brother and that we have no problem with him
If a person knows how to sense the human spirit, however, he will be able to realize that we actually have many problems with that brother
If we have a spirit of hatred, even though we may say one hundred times that we love a brother, the spirit of hatred is still there
The more they speak, the more we are clear about them, because the more they speak, the more they expose their spirit
If we listen not merely to their words but to their spirit to their spiritual tone and accent we will know where they are in the spirit
If we have a problem with a brother and we are unhappy with him, he can sense the problem with our spirit as soon as we greet him
We may have the desire to let the brothers know that we have received a great revelation, yet we pretend to be humble
We will speak and release a revelation not to exalt ourselves but to edify the saints by the guidance of the Holy Spirit
The life, the flow, and the channel will all be pure, and we will minister a pure flow of the pure life to the Lord's children
It is a matter of the purification of the passages of the spirit to allow the flow of living water to be released
Verse 27 is all-inclusive, saying that the anointing teaches us all things, so that there is no need for any man to teach us
That we have received this anointing and it abides in us means that a certain kind of motion or action abides within us
We have received such an anointing, and such an anointing now abides in us, anointing, working, living, moving, and acting all the time
The apostles proclaim the divine life, that is, the eternal life, to us, and when we receive the life, we have the fellowship of life
As a rule, when people receive bad news, they are troubled, sometimes in the emotions and sometimes in the mind
As Christians we need to learn how to forget about the troubling matters; we must learn always to give them up and forget about them
We must always try to keep ourselves in contact with the Lord by giving up all the things of our emotions and mind
Even when teaching and doctrine come to our thoughts, we may need to listen to them, but eventually we must take care of the inner anointing
With the inner anointing there is a certain inner sense, inner feeling, and inner consciousness, which we must follow
The more we have this anointing, the more the Triune God is applied to us, and the more the very essence of the Triune God becomes ours
While the anointing of the Holy Spirit is working within us all the time, the very essence and element of God is applied and added to us
The more constantly the Holy Spirit works within us as the anointing, the more the Spirit brings God's essence into us
By the anointing of the Holy Spirit, more of the essence and element of God are added and increased within us all the time
Sometimes we may meet a brother who apparently loves the Lord and seeks Him very much, yet we can sense very little of God within him
Sometimes, however, we may meet a brother who apparently is not very active, yet we can sense something weighty of God within him
If we have much of God within us, we automatically know what the Lord's will is, what we must do or must not do
We must learn the lesson to go along with the inner feeling, registration, and sense that is from the inner anointing
The more we learn the lesson of the anointing, the more we experience the cross in a very practical, real, and living way
The more we intend to learn the lesson of the inner anointing, the more we will appreciate how much we need the blood
The types in the Old Testament show us that the anointing is always applied based on the sprinkling of the blood
In the Old Testament times, when the priests came to be anointed, they first needed to be sprinkled by the blood
It is the anointing of the Holy Spirit that brings light and revelation to us and even brings us into the presence of the Lord to be exposed
If we simply take care of the inner anointing, we will be absolutely and thoroughly exposed by the Holy Spirit
All the hidden matters, hidden thoughts, secret motives, and secret intentions we have or had in the past will be exposed and revealed to us
Even we ourselves do not know ourselves as Jeremiah 179 says The heart is deceitful above all thingsAnd it is incurableWho can know it
On the one hand, we are sorrowful for our subtlety and crookedness, but on the other hand, we are refreshed and satisfied with the anointing
About fifteen years ago we retranslated it into Chinese, and we published it in our bookrooms in Shanghai and in Taiwan
If someone puts his finger on a point of a circle, he cannot say what part of the circle comes before it and what part comes after it
The divine life is the Triune God and this life is the selfexisting eternal uncreated and unlimited life without beginning and without end
Figure 3 shows us that the man created by God as a vessel to contain God has three parts-a spirit, a soul, and a body
Satan came into the created life, so the whole person of man-body, soul, and spirit-was corrupted, damaged, and spoiled by Satan as Sin
Within the created man there was nothing of God, but within this God-man is God Himself, as represented by the golden star
During these three hours, however, the Father forsook Christ because He put all our sins upon Him as the Sin-bearer
In the sphere of Adam there is nothing but sin and death, while in the sphere of Christ there is the eternal life
If one is on the left side of the cross he is in the sphere of sin and death if one has passed through the cross he is in the sphere of life
At the very time we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, He came into our spirit as the Spirit and gives life to us
Transformation is more subjective than positional sanctification, to which many Christians pay their main attention
Freedom from sin , sanctification , and transformation are three different matters, but many Christians today confuse them
We may be freed from sin but not yet experience our sanctification, and we may be sanctified but not yet transformed
A person who is regenerated may realize that he is still under the bondage of sin, so he reckons that he has died on the cross with the Lord
Perhaps after another year he consecrates himself absolutely to the Lord and experiences separation from the world unto God
The Spirit fills our spirit with the divine life, and gradually He saturates our soul-our mind, will, and emotion
Eventually, when the Lord comes back, our entire body will be transformed from the old creation into the new creation to be a body of glory
Sometimes we overcome our physical weaknesses by realizing the divine life in our body, as mentioned in Romans 8:11
When the Lord comes back, our whole body will be transfigured, transformed from the old creation into the new creation to be a body of glory
Every part of our being-spirit, soul, and body-will be filled, saturated, permeated, and mingled with the divine life
We may be full of human love, sacrificing everything for others, but we are still as dark as one that murders others
When gold is outside the temple, it is common and worldly, but if the gold is separated and brought into the temple, it is sanctified
When cattle remain in the herd, they are common and worldly, but if we separate one of the cattle and put it on the altar, it is sanctified
When the Lord comes back, our body will be redeemed, changed, transfigured, from a body of humiliation to a body of glory
At the time we believe into Christ, we are regenerated, and at the time the Lord comes back, we will be transfigured in our body
Romans 12:2 says, 'And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
In 2 Corinthians 3 transformation is by the Lord Spirit, while in Romans 12 transformation takes place in our mind
To overthrow reasonings and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ is the real renewing of the mind
With our understanding there are eyes, not the physical eyes but the inner, mental eyes, and these eyes need to be enlightened
Originally, our soul was something in the old creation, but the Lord's salvation transforms it into something of the new creation
We must realize that we, the old man, the self, the soul, have been crucified, so our mind and our thoughts have to be put on the cross
When we come to read the Scriptures, we must learn the lesson to reject our old thoughts and our old way of thinking
He said that strangely he had read the same passage and had received the light that wives should submit to their husbands
He had the thought in his mind that his wife should submit to him, and he came to the Scriptures to get a confirmation
The mind, emotions, and will are the parts of the soul, and the soul is the old man which has been crucified on the cross
The Holy Spirit with the divine life, which is the Lord Christ Himself, will take possession of our mind, emotions, and will
Peter 1:23 says, 'Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
Chapter two verse 2 says, 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation'
Following this, verse 4 speaks of coming to the Lord, and verse 5 speaks of being built up as a spiritual house
Romans 11:17 and 24 speak of grafting as the uniting of two lives, a poor life and a glorious, fruitful, and better life
In the same principle, when we receive the word of God, the word is grafted, or implanted, in us with the life of God
In Matthew 1625 the Lord said For whoever wants to save his soullife shall lose it but whoever loses his soullife for My sake shall find it
When we reject our self, our soul-our mind, will, and emotions-we give the Holy Spirit the opportunity to take possession of our soul
From the time we are regenerated until the time the Lord comes back, there is a long period for the process of transformation
We must constantly be transformed, but this transformation can be accomplished only by our cooperation with the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit is dwelling within us, and our old man has been crucified by the Lord's cross; the Spirit helps us to realize this fact
In this way we give the Holy Spirit the opportunity, the ground, to transform our soul by the renewing of our mind
