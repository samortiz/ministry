<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE THOUGHT OF GOD TO BE MAN'S LIFE<br>RUNNING THROUGH THE DIVINE<br>REVELATION FROM BEGINNING TO END</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Col. 3:4a; Gal. 2:20a; 2 Tim. 4:22; Col. 3:10-11; Dan. 2:34-35, 44; Matt. 19:28; Rev. 20:4-6; 2:7, 26; 12:5; Matt. 25:34, 46b; Rev. 21:1-2, 10-11; 22:1-2, 5b; 21:24</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br>BECOMING HIS BELIEVERS' LIFE</H2><P>The first item covered in the New Testament is God's coming, beginning from His being incarnated and ending with His becoming a life-giving Spirit, in order to reach our spirit. After God's coming, God enters into us to regenerate us, to make us His children, His sons, that we may be partakers of the divine nature. This partaking will consummate in our being glorified. After our regeneration, Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God remains within us to be our life (Col. 3:4a). He not only enters into us to regenerate us, but He also remains within us to be our life. Christ is our life in three ages: the present age, the coming age, and the eternal age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In the Present Age</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Living in the Believers' Spirit for Their Daily Life</H2><P>In the present age Christ lives in the believers' spirit for their daily life (Gal. 2:20a; 2 Tim. 4:22). Our daily life should not merely be a human life that we live out by ourselves; our daily life should be Christ. In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me." In this portion Paul seemed to say, "Christ within me is my life, and now He lives in me to be my living. He is my life within and my living without. I am living Christ. Christ is my life, and Christ is also my living. He is my daily life."</P><P>The Christ who lives in us as our life is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). If we are going to take Christ as our life and live Him as our living, we must be a person in our spirit. We must be in our spirit, not in our mind, emotion, will, understanding, likes, or dislikes. When we dislike a person, the more we think about that person, the more disgusted we are. For example, in the training, a sister may have been assigned a roommate that she considers to be troublesome. The more that sister thinks about her roommate, the more troublesome her roommate becomes to her. The solution to this kind of problem is to turn to our spirit. We must consider one another in our spirit. When we turn to our spirit, Christ as our life is there. This is our Christian life.</P>
