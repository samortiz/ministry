   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE WILL AND PRAYER I. THE POSITION OF THE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The will is also a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already covered the matter concerning the mind and the emotion of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With the mind, the emphasis is on the comprehension and understanding of the soul concerning matters or things; with the emotion, the emphasis is on the likes and dislikes of the soul, and with the will, the emphasis is on the decisions and determinations of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, with regard to a certain matter or thing, whether or not you decide to have it, to choose it, or to refuse it, these judgments and decisions are the functions of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the mind occupies a very great part of the soul, it is not the governing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The governing organ, the presiding part of the soul, is the will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Determining whether one likes a certain thing or not is the function of one's emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His comprehension concerning a certain matter and his understanding regarding a certain thing are the faculties of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Having comprehended and understood it, he likes or dislikes it, but will he choose it or refuse it?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This will be decided by the will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the final deciding organ is the will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In a proper man, the will should rank higher than the mind and the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It should stand in the highest place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In a normal situation, a man would use his mind to understand and comprehend and his emotion to desire or hate, but the final deciding and determining function belongs to the will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us consider someone who comes to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first organ he uses is the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He listens, understands, and comprehends with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having understood and comprehended, he uses the next organ, which is the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After his mind is touched, the Holy Spirit penetrating through his mind touches his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once his conscience is in operation, his emotion is influenced and he wants to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, he feels sorry about his past life, and his heart begins to incline toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that moment, he needs to exercise his will to decide and determine to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, it is the will that presides in man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It serves as the presiding organ and decides matters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although his mind understands something, and his emotion likes it, he is helpless if his will does not choose it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The will is the final deciding organ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are many people who act as if they do not have a will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are also many who act as if they do not use their will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They put their will in subjection to their emotion and also allow it to be obliterated by their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such men are not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One who is without a will or who does not use his will is just like a ship without a rudder.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose a ship has no rudder or does not use the one it has.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That ship will go wherever the wind blows and will thus be without direction.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>People who act entirely according to the impulse of their emotion, without any control, are just like a ship without a rudder or a car without a brake.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The will should be the controlling organ in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason someone loses his temper in a fierce way or commits a crime is because his emotion is too active while his will lacks the controlling power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The reason that someone can become so exhilarated he is beside himself and goes beyond the bounds of a normal behavior is also due to the lack of a controlling will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The prayer life of such a one fluctuates with the blowing of the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When there is some kind of atmosphere carrying him, he prays; otherwise, he does not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His will does not have the controlling strength.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is true both with his personal prayers and his prayers in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When his emotion is aroused, he will just pray his own prayers according to his own feelings with no concern for the flow of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, if his emotion is not aroused, he will not pray at all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both his public and private prayer life are altogether subject to the stirrings of his emotion and are not under the control of his will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of person cannot be a man of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The will, subject to the control of the spirit, should be the presiding part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the position of the will.</S>
