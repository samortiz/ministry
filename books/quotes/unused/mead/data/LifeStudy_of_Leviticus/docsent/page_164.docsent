   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>First, we must take care of the sacrifices and then of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sacrifices vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>5, 7 refer to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the whole universe Christ is the unique sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, for the sake of our need, this unique sacrifice becomes many sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is one sacrifice in many aspects: the trespass offering, the sin offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, Christ is one sacrifice becoming five sacrifices, or one sacrifice in five aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The sacrifices in chapter seventeen refer to Christ in His person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the unique sacrifice applied to our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As such a One, He meets our need in five aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is our trespass offering, sin offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In particular, He is all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, to take care of the sacrifices means to take care of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible, the blood refers to Christ's redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whereas the sacrifices refer to Christ's person, the blood refers to Christ's work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our New Testament faith, the unique faith, is a composition of the person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we put together Christ's person and work, we have the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We believe in Christ, and we believe in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is our faith, which is according to the teaching of the New Testament and according to God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As believers in Christ, we treasure the two matters that constitute the faith in which we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We treasure Christ's person, and we treasure Christ's redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Leviticus 17, Christ's person is typified by the sacrifices, and Christ's work is typified by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must care for the sacrifices and the blood; that is, we must care for the person of Christ and His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter seventeen of Leviticus, the Israelites were charged not to offer their sacrifices in any place they desired.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, they were required to bring their sacrifices to a unique place, to the one place chosen and designated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's unique choice was "the entrance of the tent of meeting," "before the tabernacle of Jehovah" v. 4 . This unique place the entrance of the tent of meeting signifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today the church is the place of God's tabernacle, the place of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The sacrifice was to be offered only at the place where the tabernacle was.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This signifies that today Christ should be applied in the church, the place of God's dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Leviticus God's dwelling place on earth was the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the New Testament age God's dwelling place is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, as signified by offering the sacrifices at the entrance of the tent of meeting, we should apply Christ in the church, the place of God's dwelling today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To apply Christ outside the church is to abuse Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Concerning the matter of applying Christ in the church, I would ask you to consider why we do not have a name to designate what we are as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are simply the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Often we are reproached because we do not use a name to designate the church, such as Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, or Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To name ourselves in this way would be to offer sacrifices anywhere, according to our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is typified in Leviticus 17 by offering the sacrifices in an abusive way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To apply Christ in an abusive way is to apply Him without regulation, restriction, or limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today many like to have a proper noun as a name to designate the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But to designate the church in this way is to denominate it, and this is to be abusive in the application of the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many years ago I had a conversation with some Christians who found fault with our standing concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They said to me, "You are too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is present in China, in Great Britain, in America.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is in every church Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I answered by saying, "Yes, Christ is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But why does He have to bear so many names?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is there a Chinese Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A British Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>An American Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is there a Lutheran Christ or a Wesleyan Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To answer these questions with a "no" is to lose the case.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To designate the church by taking a name in addition to the name of Christ is to abuse Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may use marriage as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A married lady should have one husband and one married name.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose Mary Jones marries Mr. Smith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Her name should then be Mary Jones Smith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If she were to take any other name, she would be abusing the name of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She would in fact be prostituting herself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The principle is the same with abusing Christ by applying Him outside the church, that is, by applying Him anywhere we choose according to our preference.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kind of abuse, this kind of prostituting of one's self, is typified in Leviticus 17, where the expression "prostitute themselves" is emphatically used v. 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to Leviticus 17, the worship of God must be limited to the place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the place of God's dwelling on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every sacrifice is to be brought to this place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This means that Christ is to be applied in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, many Christian workers today do not have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Instead of applying Christ in the place chosen by God, they apply Christ everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To do this is to abuse Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Let us now consider in detail from Leviticus 17 the two matters of taking care of the sacrifices and of the blood.</S>
