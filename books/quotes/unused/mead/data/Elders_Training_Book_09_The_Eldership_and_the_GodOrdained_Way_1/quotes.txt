[2]  Books 9 through 11 of this elders' training series are composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee to the elders from July 1986 through July 1991.
[3]  Brother Nee also said that it would be hard for us to change since we were accustomed to this traditional way of meeting.
[4]  Furthermore, the practice of the saints in the early church was to meet in their homes Acts 2:46; 5:42; 20:20 .
[5]  The church has been dead, passive, and low in the rate of increase because we did not have the crucial way to gain people through the home meetings.
[6]  I realized that initially it might be a suffering to have such a change.
[7]  Seemingly we may not make that much profit at the beginning, but we will lay a good foundation so that we can make an unlimited profit in the future.
[8]  I have the full assurance that the God-ordained way, the biblical way according to Acts 2:46, Acts 5:42, and 1 Corinthians 14 works.
[9]  We have to anticipate that as we cooperate with the Lord to carry out His ordained way, we will gain a substantial increase.
[10]  When our number is low, we do not need a hall, but when we gain a certain amount of increase, it is good for all the saints to gather together.
[11]  We should endeavor to have one out of twenty saints in our locality serve the Lord with all of their time.
[12]  All of us need to be one with the Lord in the life-pulse of His new move.
[13]  In this chapter I would like to present the contrast between the practice of the church life as seen in the record of the New Testament and what is seen in Christianity.
[14]  Many years ago our brother, Watchman Nee, saw this clearly.
[15]  It is new for us to go out to visit people with the gospel.
[16]  First, we have to go to our "Jerusalem."
[17]  In other words, we need to go to those close to us, that is, our relatives, neighbors, friends, colleagues, and classmates.
[18]  Instead of going to visit people with the gospel, however, we have picked up much of Christianity's way.
[19]  Recent statistics show that over the last twenty-two years, from 1964 to 1986, the membership of the Roman Catholic Church has increased by only .62 percent annually while that of the Southern Baptist denomination has increased by only 1.38 percent annually.
[20]  These statistics show us that the traditional, unscriptural way of preaching the gospel does not work well over the long run.
[21]  This biblical way includes four things: 1 the preaching of the gospel by visiting people to get people saved for Christ Matt 28:19; Mark 16:15 ; 2 having home meetings set up in the new ones' homes for nourishing and cherishing them that they may grow in life John 21:15; 1 Pet 2:2 ; 3 having group meetings to group the new ones together for perfecting Heb 10:24-25; Eph 4:12-13 ; and 4 prophesying, speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord, in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23-24, 31, 39a .
[22]  The Lord said that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth; then He charged the disciples to go and disciple the nations Matt 28:18-19 .
[23]  This is to go with the Christ who has all the authority.
[24]  Many years ago, the inner-life people made being regenerated too difficult.
[25]  The new ones should also be grouped together for group meetings.
[26]  In the old way of having group meetings, the attendants merely took turns reading through something from the Word and the ministry.
[27]  To try to bring the church into the practice of the biblical way too quickly will not work.
[28]  God promised Adam that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent Gen 3:15 , and He waited four thousand years to fulfill this promise.
[29]  About two thousand years after this promise to Adam, God promised Abraham that through his seed, all the nations of the earth would be blessed 22:18 .
[30]  CHAPTER FOUR GOD'S ADMINISTRATION GOD'S ADMINISTRATION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
[31]  If we are going to see God's administration on this earth, we have to see the administration of the church.
[32]  The very crucial part in God's government was God's instant speaking through the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate of the high priest.
[33]  Among the people of Israel, there were the elders on the one hand and the priests on the other hand.
[34]  After the high priest received the instant speaking from God, he did not directly execute or carry out what God spoke.
[35]  Instead, he passed on the word he had received to the elders, and the elders became the direct administrators among God's people.
[36]  GOD'S ADMINISTRATION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The Elders Appointed by the Apostles
[37]  The United States is a good example of a country ruled by its Constitution.
[38]  Besides the elders as the priests and as the administrators, there are the prophets and teachers as illustrated in Acts 13:1-4.
[39]  There is another aspect to the apostles' relationship with a local church, which Brother Nee talked to us about, in 1 Timothy 5.
[40]  First Timothy 5:19-20 says, "Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses.
[41]  The apostles' hands should be off of the church in its administration, but this does not mean that the apostles have absolutely nothing to do with a local church after its elders have been established.
[42]  Based upon Paul's word to Timothy in this matter, how can we say that the apostles, who appointed the elders and handed over the church to them, have nothing to do with the church or the elders once they have been established?
[43]  In 1 Corinthians 4:17, Paul says, "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church."
[44]  During that time I talked about the leading of the apostles and the leadership in the Lord's ministry, but I do not feel that what I said was accurately understood by some.
[45]  We had our trainings mainly based upon Paul's example in the two passages we quoted above in Acts.
[46]  I have a burden to stay in one place for at least nine months out of the year in order to directly help build up the local church there with some elders.
[47]  Sixty-six years have passed and we have not seen a model of a local church built up entirely according to what we have seen from the Lord.
[48]  Because I was so busy training the saints, I did not have the opportunity to build up a local church according to what I teach and according to what I have seen of the Lord.
[49]  About four years ago, in October of 1984, I went to Taipei to have some new things tested out as an experiment for our practice of the church life.
[50]  Before I went, I told some of the brothers that I was going to Taipei to try to do something new.
[51]  The Living Stream Ministry office is only a business office to serve my ministry for two things: to publish the messages in book form and to distribute these messages in both video and audio tapes.
[52]  Even with three brothers taking the lead in a certain locality there might be some troubles.
[53]  I do not feel that anyone is doing anything against me, and I am not against anyone, so we can have open, frank fellowship in love.
[54]  Question: When the leading brothers come together to pray for the church, am I understanding correctly that you do not bring up any of the problems that you see in the saints?
[55]  Answer: Even with what we say to our wives, we must exercise our wisdom in order to have a marriage life with a peaceful and sweet feeling.
[56]  Question: Some of the saints may hear some rumor or some gossip.
[57]  They may not become negative themselves or cause some trouble, but the symptom in many cases is that they become discouraged.
[58]  In this chapter we want to see the organic way to care for the church as the organic Body of Christ.
[59]  To cherish the church is also an organic matter.
[60]  Note 1 of Ephesians 5:29 in the Recovery Version says, "To cherish is to nurture us with tender love and foster us with tender care, outwardly softening us through tender warmth that we may have soothing, comfortable rest inwardly.
[61]  Negative things can arise among us because we do not see that the church is organic.
[62]  The leading ones' care for the church is not an organizational matter.
[63]  To interpret the Bible properly is not an easy thing.
[64]  Many have their own interpretation of what the Bible says, but we need the proper interpretation.
[65]  It is only when the church has degraded and deviated from the line of life, that organization is needed.
[66]  If the elders take the lead in an organizational way, this indicates that the church has degraded.
[67]  THE ORGANIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHURCHES AND THE WORK
[68]  Paul told the Philippians that he thanked God for their fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel 1:3-5 .
[69]  This was the saints in Philippi participating in the furtherance of the gospel through the apostle Paul's ministry.
[70]  The relationship is this the churches should always help the work and cooperate with the work to promote God's work, and the work should try the best to always strengthen the churches, edify the churches, establish the churches, and build up the churches for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[71]  CHAPTER SEVEN PRACTICING THE NEW WAY TO BUILD UP
[72]  In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning our need to pick up the new way to practice the Lord's present recovery.
[73]  In the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians, we can see the enjoyment of Christ as our portion.
[74]  THE NEW WAY TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST
[75]  When I returned to Taipei in 1984, I was burdened of the Lord to find out a new, scriptural way for us to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[76]  Now that we have picked up the God-ordained way of preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes, others are following us to do the same thing.
[77]  In a conference of some Catholic bishops in 1987, one bishop said that if we have never knocked on people's doors, we have never consecrated ourselves to the preaching of the gospel.
[78]  Although we have seen the light concerning how to preach the gospel in the most effective way, we still are not too clear regarding how to have the home meetings.
[79]  The Epistles show us that the early churches often met in a certain saint's home, such as the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla Rom 16:5 , the church in the house of Nymphas Col 4:15-16 , and the church in the house of Philemon Philem.
[80]  First Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 tell us much more regarding how to have the church meetings.
[81]  We are more clear concerning the care of the church meetings because we have 1 Corinthians 14 a whole chapter of forty verses instructing us how to meet as a church.
[82]  In order to have what is described by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14, we must have the perfecting of the saints by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers in Ephesians 4.
[83]  Some have said that after the apostles establish the churches with the elders, they should keep their hands off, having nothing to do with the churches and elders anymore.
[84]  Paul told them that he was with them for three years v. 31 , teaching them publicly and from house to house v. 20 . For Paul to teach the saints publicly means there was some public exhortation, probably in front of the saints as a congregation.
[85]  CONDEMNING OUR HABIT TO NOT TAKE THE NEW WAY
[86]  I realize that it is not easy for the elders of the church to suddenly change to a new way.
[87]  In the book of Ephesians, Paul tells us that the gifts the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are for the perfecting of the saints 4:11-12 .
[88]  We need to be like Paul, who did not shrink from declaring to the saints all the counsel of God v. 27 . While we are staying with the saints, we have to open up all the things concerning God's New Testament economy, His eternal plan.
[89]  In addition to teaching the saints, Paul also admonished them.
[90]  As an illustration of what it means to admonish, let us consider a father speaking to his son about his need to study diligently.
[91]  If we do not have the assurance that one out of three that we baptize will remain, we had better baptize four, looking to the Lord that we will gain one of these for the church life.
[92]  Since we all love the Lord Jesus, love to preach the gospel, and love to see sinners get saved, we should pray for the saints who go out to visit people in their homes even though we cannot go.
[93]  After my four-year study in Taipei, I have picked up these four crucial points: 1 begetting by gospel preaching; 2 nourishing by home meetings; 3 teaching by small group meetings; and 4 building up the church by church meetings.
[94]  For this organic building to be realized, the gifted persons must do their best to perfect every saint.
[95]  The co-workers and the elders who are taking care of the saints need to go to their homes.
[96]  If we have a revelation as a new vision, we can call a meeting of the local churches.
[97]  We can even have a conference with the nearby churches to give a series of messages to cover a particular vision, a particular revelation, which we have received of God.
[98]  The Bible presents us with a clear picture of God's desire for the church as the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23a , the expression of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .
[99]  It is hard to make a distinction between an apostle and a prophet.
[100]  Even the evangelists are for the perfecting of the saints.
[101]  For many years my concept has been that the evangelists are only good for going out to preach the gospel, but Ephesians 4 tells us that Christ gave them to perfect the saints.
[102]  After our four-year study which began in 1984 in Taipei, we see that in the proper procedure to build up the Body of Christ, the first step is to preach the gospel.
[103]  In the past, our Lord's Day morning meetings were carried out in a routine way.
[104]  How wonderful it is to be in the Lord's recovery, and now by His mercy we have a way to practice the church life by the preaching of the gospel, home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings.
[105]  We have to visit people in their homes to pass on the gospel to them.
[106]  I hope that all the churches will try to enter into preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes.
[107]  We do not have many verses in the Bible to tell us how to carry out the home meetings and small group meetings, but we know that we need to pray much, exercise our spirit, and release our spirit when we meet with the new ones in their homes.
[108]  It is not worthwhile for us to remain in the old way any longer.
[109]  We need to take the new way gradually and positively.
[110]  After the small group meetings, we need church meetings, or district meetings, of about fifty saints.
[111]  If we take this new way the Lord has shown us, we will double after one year and many of the saints will have been trained, perfected, and instructed to speak with content.
[112]  I believe that the Lord will recover this way to the uttermost.
[113]  If we are faithful to the Lord, the time will come when the Lord will gain twenty thousand out of a city of one hundred fifty thousand.
[114]  In 1984 I fully realized that we needed to be adjusted and have some advancement in our practice.
[115]  Verse 1 and verse 39 of 1 Corinthians 14 both say that we should desire earnestly to prophesy.
[116]  We have the capacity and the obligation to prophesy, and we should desire earnestly to prophesy.
[117]  Paul also told us in verse 12 that we should seek to excel to the building up of the church.
[118]  In giving us the revelation of the priesthood of the gospel of God, the raising up of the new believers, the perfecting of the saints, and prophesying, the Lord has given us a conclusion to our four and a half year study.
[119]  I considered whether I could find any more verses in the New Testament concerning how to serve, how to meet, how to function, how to preach the gospel, etc. I believe that we have exhausted the revelation in the New Testament concerning the Christian way of service.
[120]  In order to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we have to visit people.
[121]  As the leading ones, we need to ask ourselves what we will do as we function in the churches.
[122]  We need to take care of the new believers for at least six months.
[123]  It is best if we can care for them for a year until they are established.
[124]  We do not want to compel people to take anything or impose what we have learned on others, but we need to have some discernment to know the more excellent things.
[125]  In Colossians 1:28, Paul said that he announced Christ, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom to present every man full-grown in Christ.
[126]  In this chapter, I want us to be impressed that we should not function, serve, or meet in a natural way.
[127]  We may think that serving God, preaching the gospel, or functioning to give a testimony are things that we can do easily and naturally.
[128]  God is Spirit, so those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth v. 24 . Today by His mercy and under His enlightenment, we can say that we are clear what it means to worship God in our spirit.
[129]  Thus far, after about nineteen centuries of church history, the Lord has not gained His heart's desire.
[130]  What is revealed in the New Testament concerning the preaching of the gospel is not shallow.
[131]  All those who preach the gospel must do so as priests.
[132]  We must also realize that the goal of the opposition today is twofold: to oppose the God-ordained way and to smear, to put down, and to put aside my ministry.
[133]  Dear saints, suppose that today we put the God-ordained way aside and we put this ministry aside.
[134]  If we reject the God-ordained way, we have no way to go on.
[135]  Now we need to consider how to have the group meetings.
[136]  A number of questions may be asked in the group meeting.
[137]  Some will be concerning the truth, and others will be concerning life.
[138]  In our fellowship with the new ones, we can tell them that it is best to have books like these in our homes so that we can study a part of a lesson when we want to learn something concerning the truth or life.
[139]  If a certain brother were charged to take care of a group meeting, probably very few of the saints in the group would pray for that meeting.
[140]  They would not bear the burden for the meeting because they know that a brother has been assigned to care for it.
[141]  I would like to say a word to the elders.
[142]  At the present time, some of the saints may not feel good about changing our way of meeting from one person speaking to a meeting of mutuality with all prophesying.
[143]  Furthermore, we should not despise anyone or any church if they do not fully practice the ordained way.
