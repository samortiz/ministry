   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMPLETION OF THE LORD S SOWING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus not only healed the soil, but He also released God s life and imparted it into the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through His death the divine life in Him was released, and through His resurrection this life was imparted to the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, the Lord s death and resurrection were the completion of His sowing Himself as a seed into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This sowing began in chapter one of Mark and continued throughout this Gospel until it was completed in chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter after chapter the Lord Jesus was sowing Himself into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is clearly revealed in chapter four where we see that as the Sower He came to sow the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord Jesus was resurrected, this sowing was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The disciples then became another kind of soil, the good soil, and they began to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the early chapters of the book of Acts we see that the disciples were good soil producing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE WEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the fact that the disciples became good soil and began to grow Christ does not mean that the weeds could not grow in them again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Galatians 2 we see that certain weeds had begun to grow again in Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason the weeds came back was that Peter was still under the influence of the old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, the weeds were trying to grow in Peter in Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to this chapter, Peter saw a heavenly vision, a vision related to the sowing of the seed into the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God intended to use Peter to sow the seed of the kingdom into another kind of soil, into Gentile soil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At first Peter refused to obey the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This refusal indicates that something was growing in Peter instead of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The things of the old religion, the weeds, were growing in him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter twenty-one of Acts we see that Peter was under the influence of James.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we consider Acts 21 together with Galatians 2, we see that many weeds were growing in Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to ask ourselves how many weeds are growing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What do we mean by weeds?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A weed is something other than Christ that is growing in us to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our experience these weeds may include culture, religion, ethics, morality, philosophy, improvement of character, and the effort to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of the saints who have been under this ministry for years are still under the influence of their cultural and religious background.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of this influence, the view of God s New Testament economy has not been made clear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This influence and this lack of clarity delay the Lord s coming back because it frustrates the development of the kingdom within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>OUR NEED FOR A CLEAR VIEW</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At this point we should once again ask this question: what is the kingdom of God?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Contrary to the traditional understanding, the kingdom is not merely a realm where God rules over people and a realm which we enter to enjoy eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christians do not have a proper understanding even of what eternal life is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They think that eternal life is some kind of everlasting blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to have a clear view from the New Testament concerning the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Testament the kingdom of God is not a material realm in which God exercises His authority to carry out His governmental administration so that we may enter this realm to enjoy an eternal blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not the concept of the kingdom in the New Testament, and we should drop this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is revealed in the New Testament regarding the kingdom of God is that the kingdom is a Person, not a material realm.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This One who is the embodiment of the Triune God came to be the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Mark 4 He says that the kingdom is like a sower sowing the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Both the Sower and the seed are the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus came to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In His ministry He did not sow anything other than Himself as the seed of the kingdom.</S>
