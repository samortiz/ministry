<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GROWTH AND THE BUILDING</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 2:2-5; 1 Cor. 3:7-13, 16-17; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:13-16</H1><P>In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning the building up of the church by the growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GROWTH IN LIFE FOR THE BUILDING UP<br>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>First of all, we want to consider several passages in the Bible that link together the growth in life and the building of the church. First Peter 2:2-5 says that if we have tasted the Lord, not only believed in Him, we will long for the nourishing milk in His word and then we will grow (vv. 2-3). By this growing, we will be built up as a spiritual house (v. 5). Hence, these few verses show us mainly two things: one is the growth in life and the other is the building up of a spiritual house. The building up of the church as a spiritual house depends upon the growth in life. We are built up by growing in the life of Christ. Hence, growing is for building up, and building up depends on growing.</P><P>Now let us read 1 Corinthians 3:7-9: "So then neither is he who plants anything nor he who waters, but God who causes the growth. Now he who plants and he who waters are one, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's cultivated land, God's building." Notice here that the apostle used two kinds of description for the church. First, he likened the church to God's cultivated land, God's farm, God's plantation, God's husbandry. Then, he likened the church to God's building. With the cultivated land, the farm, there is the need for growth. With the building, or the house, there is the need for building up. Verses 10 through 13 tell us what kind of materials should be used for the building.</P><P>Then verses 16 and 17 go on to say, "Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, and such are you." The temple of God in verse 16 refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, whereas the temple of God in verse 17 refers to all the believers universally. All the believers are the unique temple of God in the universe, which has its expression in many localities on the earth. The temple is the building, and the building depends upon the growth of the cultivated land.</P><P>Furthermore, we can see the matter of growth and building in Ephesians 2:21-22. Verse 21 says that in Christ "all the building...is growing into a holy temple in the Lord." Not only are we being built up, but we are also growing into a temple. Then verse 22 says, "In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit." Again, we see that the building up of the church as the dwelling place of God depends on the growth in life.</P><P>Then in Ephesians 4:13-16 we see again that the building depends on the growth. Verse 13 says, "Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." Verse 14 goes on to say that "we may be no longer little children..." We are no longer little children because we have grown up. Verse 15 says, "But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ." We have to grow up into Christ, who is the Head of the Body. Then verse 16 tells us that out from the Head, Christ, "all the Body...causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love." In brief, this passage shows us that the building up of the Body, the church, depends on the growth of life in Christ.</P>
