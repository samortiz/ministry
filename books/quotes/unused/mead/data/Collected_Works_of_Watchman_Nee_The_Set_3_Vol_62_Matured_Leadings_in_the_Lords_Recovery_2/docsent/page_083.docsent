   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REVELATION OF GOD'S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the past I thought that God's salvation was to save me from hell and sin, but these are actually not the first items of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to His plan and from His perspective, God's salvation primarily is not to deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before 1934 I suffered much.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I was painfully aware of my inward sins, my critical attitude, my jealousy, and my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The gross sins were gone from me the day I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For a long time, however, I was living in the experience of Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time I thought that God's salvation was primarily to deal with my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From 1934 onward I began to touch some light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During 1935 and 1936 I touched more.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By 1940 I was quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For a while I was so released that I would laugh, jump, and praise unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Revelation of Genesis 1 and 2</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's Image and God's Life</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During the past few years, the light I have seen from God involves mainly two things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, God created man to have His image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, God wants man to have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Genesis 1:26-27, God created man with the intention that man would have His image.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the first time the Bible speaks of God's relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second time the Bible speaks of God's relationship with man is in Genesis 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After God created man with the dust of the earth, He breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that God not only created man in His image; His intention was to dispense His life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second time the Bible speaks of God's relationship with man is when it speaks about God's image and His life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is God's purpose in man?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He wants every one of us to have His image and His life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to our natural concept, we think that the goal of God's salvation is to save us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's salvation does include our deliverance from sin, but we have to realize that the main item in God's salvation is for us to have His image and His life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is something very high and great.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the brothers and sisters have not seen this, and they only pay attention to their services, they have not yet reached the central goal of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's intention in creating man is for man to have His image and His life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's Goal Being Frustrated</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man was created, but he did not have God's life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God intended, anticipated, and ordained that man would eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that man would receive the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, before man received God's life, Satan came in to frustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through his temptation, man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From that point forward, man deviated from the central goal; he sinned and fell.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a result, he was kept away from God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God sealed the way to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He guarded the way to that tree with the cherubim signifying God's glory and the sword signifying God's holiness of fire signifying God's righteousness which turned every way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to draw near to the tree of life for its fruit, a man must pass through the cherubim, the fire, and the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that in order for man to receive God into him as life, he has to meet God's requirements of righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the end of Genesis 3, man could not match God's righteousness and holiness, and he came short of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, man could not receive God's life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Giving of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From Genesis 3 we move on to Exodus 20.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There we have the giving of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Twenty-five hundred years after man's creation, God gave His law on Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There God was surrounded by His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God was inside, and man was outside.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Man could not draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because man did not realize his own depravity, there was the need to institute the law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But we have to know that in giving His law to man, God had no intention for man to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the contrary, He wanted man to break it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If man were to keep the law, God's plan would have been fully frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man, perhaps, would be in turmoil and be at Mount Sinai even today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Please remember that God does not expect man to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He wants to put His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We want to be delivered from our temper, but God wants us to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We want to be perfect, and we want God to help us, but God does not have such a thought at all.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His salvation is not for making us perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His goal is for man to be like Him, to have His life and His image.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The story at Mount Sinai in Exodus is only a replay of the story in Eden in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Eden there were two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The other was the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After man was tempted by Satan to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and fell, there were cherubim, the sword, and the fire around the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This means that God's righteousness, glory, and holiness guarded the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In Exodus we also find fire on Mount Sinai, a sign of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have the law, which refers to God's righteousness, and we have God's glory itself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Eden we have the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On Mount Sinai we have the knowledge of good and evil in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Just as God had no intention for man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, He had no intention for man to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is God's consistent goal.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hence, the scene at Mount Sinai was merely a replay of the scene in Eden.</S>
