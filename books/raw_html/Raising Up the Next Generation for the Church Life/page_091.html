        <h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT THAT GOD GIVES US BEING OF LOVE</h2>
<p>The spirit that God has given us is our human spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit. This spirit is a spirit of love; hence, it is of power and of sobermindedness (2 Tim. 1:7). We may think that we are very powerful and sober, but our spirit is not of love. We talk to people in a way that is full of power and sobermindedness, but our talk threatens them.</p>
<p>Paul said that we need to fan our gift into flame (v. 6). The main gift that God has given us is our regenerated human spirit with His Spirit, His life, and His nature. We must fan this gift into flame. This means that we have to stir up our spirit so that our spirit will be burning. Romans 12:11 says that we should be burning in spirit. If our spirit is not a spirit of love, our fanning it into flame will burn the whole recovery in a negative way. We must have a burning spirit of love, not a burning spirit of authority, which damages. Whatever is mentioned in 2 Timothy is a requirement for us to face the degradation of the church. How can we overcome the degradation of the church? We must have a burning human spirit of love. Under today&rsquo;s degradation of the church, we all need a spirit of love fanned into flame to be burning in spirit. Love prevails in this way.</p>
<p>According to my observation throughout the years, most of the co-workers have a human spirit of &ldquo;power&rdquo; but not of love. We need a spirit of love to conquer the degradation of today&rsquo;s church. We should not say or do anything to threaten people. Instead we should always say and do things with a spirit of love, which has been fanned into flame. This is what the recovery needs.</p>
<p>The church is not a police station to arrest people or a law court to judge people, but a home to raise up the believers. Parents know that the worse their children are, the more they need their raising up. If our children were angels, they would not need our parenting to raise them up. The church is a loving home to raise up the children. The church is also a hospital to heal and to recover the sick ones. Finally, the church is a school to teach and edify the unlearned ones who do not have much understanding. Because the church is a home, a hospital, and a school, the co-workers and elders should be one with the Lord to raise up, to heal, to recover, and to teach others in love.</p>
<p>Some of the churches, however, are police stations to arrest the sinful ones and law courts to judge them. Paul&rsquo;s attitude was different. He said, &ldquo;Who is weak, and I am not weak?&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:29a). When the scribes and Pharisees brought an adulterous woman to the Lord, He said to them, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&rdquo; (John 8:7). After all of them left, the Lord asked the sinful woman, &ldquo;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;No one, Lord.&rdquo; Then Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you&rdquo; (vv. 10-11). Who is without sin? Who is perfect? Paul said, &ldquo;To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:22). This is love. We should not consider that others are weak but we are not. This is not love. Love covers and builds up, so love is the most excellent way for us to be anything and to do anything for the building up of the Body of Christ. (<em>The Vital Groups,</em> pp. 73, 75)</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING YOUR BEST TO CONTACT<br />
THE YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Second, learn to do your best to contact the young people. Helping the young brothers and sisters depends not on your ability to give them messages but on your regular, frequent contacts with them. When you contact the young brothers and sisters, do not begin by asking, &ldquo;How many chapters of the Bible have you read today? Have you prayed?&rdquo; Such questions should not be brought up until you have had many contacts with them, maybe even after eight or ten times. Remember not to talk about spiritual things at the initial contact with them. It is even more so in dealing with an unbeliever. Do not talk about the Lord Jesus when you first contact him. The reason you refrain from mentioning the Lord Jesus is that as you maintain contact with him, seemingly you are retreating, yet actually you are advancing. You need to sense his feeling until one day you can impart the gospel into him. Then you will be successful at once. However, if you do it prematurely, it is easy to cause a negative reaction. If you mess up the whole thing, he may not receive the Lord for his entire lifetime. It is the same in dealing with any young person. Do not stir up his negative feeling by talking to him right away about reading the Bible or praying. You must wait until you have more contacts with him and he feels that he likes you and that you also like him. Once you have touched his feeling and earned his trust, then you can begin to talk about spiritual things. This is like giving the right prescription for an illness. With the right medicine, the illness will be cured. Then you can expect to see a result.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EMPHASIZING PRACTICALITY<br />
INSTEAD OF STRESSING DOCTRINES</h2>
<p>Third, when you help the young people, do not give them a lot of doctrines; instead, give them something practical. You should not put too much emphasis on doctrines, not only when you have personal contact with them but also when you are preaching the gospel or giving messages to them. If you give them only some doctrines and they come only to listen, there will not be much effect. The more you speak doctrines, the more the young people become dead, cold, and backsliding. Because young people have many practical problems, you need to sense their feelings, beginning with these problems. Therefore, you need to spend some time to study the problems of the young people in their practical living, including problems both before and after their salvation. Based upon your studies, when you preach the gospel or speak a word of edification to them, what you speak is practical and is related to the practical matters that you have touched in their lives. (<em>How to Lead the Young People,</em> pp. 21-23)</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
