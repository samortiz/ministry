[1]  The saints in those churches did not forsake Paul himself; rather, they turned away from his New Testament ministry, the apostles teaching which he preached.
[2]  If all of us today in the Lord s recovery did not care for the apostles teaching preached by Brother Watchman Nee and me, the church and the Lord s recovery would become degraded.
[3]  With Paul and Timothy we see an excellent pattern.
[4]  As we have pointed out, Paul told Timothy to lay these things before the brothers, referring to the things which he was writing in this Epistle.
[5]  Today we should follow Timothy s example and lay before the saints the things with which we have been nourished by the Lord through the ministry.
[6]  It is a fact of history in the Lord s recovery that any church which follows the ministry is strong and blessed.
[7]  Just as people have different tastes in food, so the Lord s recovery also has a taste for the ministry that has built up the recovery over the years.
[8]  The recovery was raised up with a certain taste.
[9]  This means that if you speak something contrary to the taste of the Lord s recovery, your speaking will be rejected, and you will be the first to suffer loss.
[10]  Let me give you an illustration of what I mean by a taste for the ministry in the Lord s recovery.
[11]  All the churches in the recovery were raised up through the ministry, and the saints have been eating this ministry for years and have a taste for it.
[12]  Whether or not a particular ministry is part of the New Testament ministry can be proved by applying three governing principles: one, the principle of the processed Triune God being dispensed into His chosen people; second, the principle of Christ and the church; and third, the principle of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.
[13]  Throughout the twenty centuries of church history, the divisions, confusions, and problems which have taken place among all the Christians were all due to a ministry.
[14]  We need to be very clear that the foundation of all the denominations and the factor that produces each denomination are their different ministries.
[15]  If all the Christians today would be willing for the Lord to take away their different ministries, they would all be one.
[16]  Paul, Peter, and James were all there, and a ministry of another kind was trying to come in. In 1 Timothy 1 Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to take care of one thing: to charge certain ones not to teach differently, which means not to teach according to another ministry vv.
[17]  Paul was carrying out God s New Testament ministry and his ministry followed Peter s ministry, which was an immediate continuation of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Himself.
[18]  Then in the second part of Acts, Paul s ministry was a continuation of Peter s to carry out God s New Testament ministry.
[19]  It is crucial for us to see what the New Testament ministry is.
[20]  However, we should not consider his ministry a separate, individualistic ministry.
[21]  From this we can see that probably not more than two or three years after John began to preach, his service caused trouble and became a rivalry to the Lord s ministry.
[22]  He had no consideration about anything other than the Lord s ministry, even no consideration about his life.
[23]  We need to go back to consider something concerning the case of Barnabas.
[24]  He was faithful, and he was the one who brought Paul in Acts 9:27 .
[25]  Surely Barnabas was not a Judaizer, but because of his opinion, he took his way to carry out the so-called ministry.
[26]  However, his ministry became a problem there, not because of Peter, but simply because there was such a thing as Peter s ministry.
[27]  If I had a ministry that was used as Apollos s, do you think that my usefulness to the Lord would be increasing all the time?
[28]  Apollos was not dissenting with Paul, but his ministry bore a different color and flavor than Paul s ministry.
[29]  V. NO UNCERTAIN SOUNDING OF THE TRUMPET IN THE LORD S MINISTRY
[30]  For also if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
[31]  They have nothing to do with the Lord s headship or with the Lord s redemptive work.
[32]  Whether or not a certain church takes the ministry does not decide whether that church is a genuine local church.
[33]  The title of this message does not say no uncertain sounding of the trumpet in the Lord s recovery but in the Lord s ministry.
[34]  I am not talking about something in the Lord s recovery, but I am talking about the ministry.
[35]  They did not lose their status as local churches due to the fact that they gave up Paul s ministry, but in fighting the battle, Paul s ministry could not depend upon them.
[36]  Some of the saints became what they are in the Lord one hundred percent due to my ministry, and I do not want my ministry to waste their time.
[37]  Whatever I would say concerning the home gatherings, the full-timers, the truth lessons, and the spreading of the gospel is not for anyone who does not feel good about my ministry, who is dissenting to my ministry, who is pretending to be here under the ministry yet actually is not.
[38]  The Lord has opened my eyes to realize as I have told you in the past, that in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, there is only one current flowing from the throne Rev 22:1 .
[39]  Barnabas wanted to take his cousin Mark along with him on their journey and Paul said no. To us that is a small thing, but after Barnabas left Paul with Mark there is no more record of him in the Lord s move in the book of Acts.
[40]  BEING RESTRICTED TO ONE PUBLICATION WORK FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LORD S COMMISSION TO HIS RECOVERY Being Restricted in One Publication
[41]  One thing that has caused the Lord s recovery trouble is the fact that we have different publications.
[42]  If we mean business for the Lord s recovery, we must avoid any kind of involvement in problems.
[43]  I did write some books, among which were a book on the genealogy of Christ, a translation of part of Pember s Earth s Earliest Ages, and some books on the kingdom of the heavens.
[44]  Since in every age there has been the work of ministry, it stands to reason that in this age also there should be the continuation of the Lord s ministry.
[45]  May the Lord open our eyes to see that as long as we are human beings, we should be Christians; as long as we are Christians, we should enter into the Lord s ministry in this age.
[46]  Today, we also need to be in God s building ministry to work out our own salvation, that is, to bring our salvation to its ultimate conclusion so that we can be exalted by God in glory as the Lord Jesus was.
[47]  The one who can be the leading one in the Lord s move today is the one who knows God s New Testament economy, the one who knows what God s speaking is today.
