   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Good Aspect of Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Usually when we mention the flesh, we think that the flesh is corrupt and wicked, just as mentioned in Galatians 5:19-21.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the Bible shows us that the flesh has not only an evil aspect, but also a good aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The good flesh desires to do good and to worship and serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul in Philippians 3:3-6 indicated that there were some who worshipped God in the flesh and boasted in their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The flesh there undoubtedly refers to flesh in its good aspect, for by it man worships God and through it man boasts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why is there a good aspect of man or of the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because although we are the people who fell deeply, we still have some good element which was originally created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we often want to do good and serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But, after all, man or the flesh in its good aspect is weak and powerless, desiring to do good or serve God, but not being able to do either.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the sight of God, we, the fallen men, controlled by the flesh, wholly became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anything which originates in us, whether good or bad, is of the flesh and does not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, not only our temper, hatred, or anything against God which originates in us are of the flesh, but the gentleness, love, and even the service to God which originates in us are also of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever originates in us, whether good or bad, is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to know the flesh to such an extent; then we have really touched the meaning of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, in the Bible, flesh also denotes the good aspect of man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE POSITION OF THE FLESH BEFORE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the position of the flesh before God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is God's attitude toward the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This matter is clearly mentioned in many places in the Bible; however, we can only point out here the most important passages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A. God Cannot Mingle with the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Exodus 30:31-32, "Upon the flesh of man shall it the holy anointing oil not be poured."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The holy anointing oil typifies the Holy Spirit, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the declaration that the holy anointing oil must not be poured upon man's flesh means that God cannot mingle or unite with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. God and the Flesh Cannot Exist Together</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Exodus 17:14, 16, "Jehovah said unto Moses I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven Jehovah hath sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why did God determine to exterminate Amalek and to have war with him from generation to generation?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is because Amalek in the Bible typifies our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Israelites as the descendants of Jacob typify the chosen, regenerated part within us, that is the new man in our spirit belonging to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Amalekites as the descendants of Esau typify the fallen natural part within us, that is the old man in the flesh belonging to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Esau and Jacob were twins, but their descendants, the Amalekites and the Israelites, were mutual enemies; they could not stand together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Likewise, our fleshly old man is very close to our spiritual new man; the two are also mutual enemies and cannot stand together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fact that God would have war with Amalek shows us how God hates the flesh and desires to exterminate it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the flesh is not exterminated and there is no dealing with it, our spiritual life will have no way to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The two can never compromise or co-exist.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Saul became the king of Israel, God commanded him to smite Amalek, destroy all they had, and spare them not 1 Sam 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, Saul spared Agag, the king of the Amalekites, and the best of the sheep and oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All that was good he would not utterly destroy, but everything that was vile and refuse he destroyed utterly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since Saul did not absolutely obey the command of God, he forfeited God's favor and lost his throne.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that if man does not absolutely reject the flesh, but retains what is good and honorable in the sight of man, he cannot please God, because between God and the flesh there is no compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the book of Esther, Mordecai chose to die rather than to bow down to Haman, an Agagite, the descendant of Agar, the Amalekite.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because Mordecai withstood firmly to the end, he pleased God and also brought deliverance to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is further proof that only when we do not give in to the flesh, even unto death, can we please God and become fitting vessels for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God and the flesh cannot exist together!</S>
