   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Contacting Our Acquaintances,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Transfusing Christ into Them,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and Inviting and Leading Them</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to Attend the Group Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are revived every morning, overcoming every day, and have the Lord Himself as our supply and our supporting strength, as far as we ourselves are concerned, this is quite sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we must not forget that we also have to dispense Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every one of us has some people that we know, including our relatives, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among them, we can find at least twenty who are not yet saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to write down their names and give a copy of this list to the church and keep another copy for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should then pray continually for them and should contact them, transfusing Christ into them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of us should do this, beginning from our own "Jerusalem" cf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no need to knock on "cold" doors; these "warm" doors are enough for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the same time, we can seek for fellowship; we should coordinate with others to preach the gospel to our own acquaintances or those of the brothers and sisters, and we should invite and lead them to attend the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, from now on we should prepare a list of our gospel friends, on the one hand, and establish group meetings, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The group meeting is the foundation of our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eighty percent of the church life is contained in the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition to attending the Lord's Day morning meeting, every one of us should attend a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The number at a group meeting should not be too many or too few.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Preferably it should be around twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The elders and co-workers should train the brothers and sisters in the group meeting to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In every group meeting, we expect the brothers and sisters to bring their acquaintances along.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They should try their best to invite and even to lead them to attend these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Toward the Close of the Group Meeting,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Preaching the Gospel to Them One by One,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Leading Them to Believe in Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>to Call on His Name, and to Be Baptized</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our group meetings have to be living, and they should never be in the way of a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all should testify and should fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not tell stories.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, we should speak simply of our experience of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If new ones or gospel friends come into our midst and listen and observe what we are doing, they will be quite interested and impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>About half an hour before the close of the group meeting, we can take the gospel friends aside and preach the gospel to them individually.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should preach to them with the booklet "The Mystery of Human Life" which we have ready with us, and we should open our mouth, exercise our faith, and preach by looking at the new ones with our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should exercise the authority that the Lord has given us and should lead them to believe in Christ, to call on His name, and to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way, they will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After Baptism, Conducting a Lesson</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>with Them on the Way of Life,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Teaching Them to Call on the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the Time with Their Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the new ones are baptized and have changed their clothes, we should conduct a lesson with them on the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It does not have to be long.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The main thing is to tell them that our Savior is living in us today; we can call on His name all the time to contact Him and to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After this, we should exercise to demonstrate to them a little how we do it, and we should ask them to do the same to show us whether they have learned it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must do this, and we must not be lax in doing it.</S>
