   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NATURAL VIRTUES AND CAPACITIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING BROUGHT TO THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN ORDER TO BE BROUGHT INTO RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At this juncture we need to consider a matter that is significant in the typology in the Old Testament and in the fulfillment of the types in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In typology many persons were temporarily used by God according to their natural capacity and natural virtues to signify something spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An example of this is Nehemiah and his aggressiveness, which was a virtue in his human conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whereas in typology natural things were used by God temporarily, in the fulfillment of the types in the New Testament, all the natural virtues and capacities should be brought to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They need to be put to the cross and crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many among us think that to put a certain thing to the cross means to put that thing to an end. In a sense, this is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, according to the real significance of the cross of Christ, the cross does not mean merely that something is put to an end but that the natural things are crossed out in order to be brought into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The cross of Christ brings all natural things to death and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But according to the Bible, burial is followed by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Burial is therefore the threshold of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever is buried will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to John 12:24 a grain of wheat falls into the ground, dies, and is buried.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But this is not the end. After burial, something will come forth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Example of Moses</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us consider the example of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I believe that Moses had a strong character and that in his natural constitution he was even more aggressive than Nehemiah was.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the age of forty Moses aggressively volunteered to save Israel out of the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, but God came in to limit him, allowing him to fail and be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses was then buried in the wilderness for forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, the resurrecting God came in to resurrect Moses Exo 3:2-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Example of Peter</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God made us with certain virtues and capacities in our natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew 25:15 tells us that the talents are given according to our own ability, that is, our natural ability, which is constituted of God s creation and our learning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This ability needs to be crossed out and then brought into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the experience of all the able and capable apostles, such as Paul and Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter, for instance, was in the tomb for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever he crept out of the tomb, the Lord Jesus would send him back to the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the night of the Lord s betrayal, Peter was so bold and aggressive as to say to the Lord, Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Mark 14:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter went on to tell Him that others might forsake Him but he would never do so.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What boldness!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What aggressiveness!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord told Peter, Truly I say to you that today in this night, before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times v. 30 . Once again, Peter was put to the cross and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Entering into Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If our natural capacity, natural ability, and natural virtues are not crossed out, they will cause a great deal of trouble and will be the source of big mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we allow our natural capacity, ability, and virtues to be brought to the cross and die, we will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then in resurrection our capability, ability, and virtues will be many times greater than they were in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These things are still ours, but having passed through death and burial, they are now in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that we ourselves, with our capacity, ability, and virtues, have entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We continue to exist, but we with our natural ability have been brought into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reality of resurrection is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Resurrection, therefore, is the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our natural capacity, ability, and virtue need to be transferred from our natural life into the consummated Triune God through death and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In ourselves we are natural, but when we are transferred out of ourselves into God, who is resurrection, we enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An Important Principle</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a very important principle for interpreting the types and their fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do not apply this principle, all the natural capacities, abilities, and virtues, unchecked by crucifixion, will be like wild beasts among us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This has been the situation with many capable ones who came into the recovery and stayed for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They eventually realized that in the recovery there was no ground for them to employ their natural capacity and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, they left the recovery and formed a work for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were not willing to accept crucifixion and burial in order to be brought into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They could not take the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the reason certain capable persons who have come into the recovery do not remain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God needs people who are highly educated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, he needed someone like Moses, who was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians Acts 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If Moses had not been an educated person, God would not have used him to give the law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, we should not trust our natural wisdom or education.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is risky to put our trust in such things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we are one with God, we will put our natural wisdom and education to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more we do this, the more we will be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is never a loss to sow the seed of our natural ability into the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we sow a seed we lose it temporarily, but eventually there will be a harvest in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>NEHEMIAH S LIVING IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Nehemiah was one who lived not in his natural man but in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He was aggressive, but his aggressiveness was accompanied by other characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First, he loved God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is no doubt about this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was born in captivity and was appointed to be the king s cupbearer, but he loved God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He also loved the holy land signifying Christ , the holy temple signifying the church , and the holy city signifying the kingdom of God .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He loved God and, in typology, he loved Christ, the church, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As a person who loved God, Nehemiah was one who contacted God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We are told a number of times that Nehemiah prayed to God Neh 1:4; 2:4b; 4:4-5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Furthermore, Nehemiah trusted in God and even became one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In himself Nehemiah s aggressiveness was natural, but in God his aggressiveness was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Nehemiah was an aggressive person who loved God, the holy land, the holy temple, and the holy city, who contacted God and had fellowship with Him, who trusted in God, and who was one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As a result, he became the representative of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to be clear about this in order to understand the intrinsic significance of the type according to the insight given by the Spirit.</S>
