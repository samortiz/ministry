   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Teaching His Disciples to Pray</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Based upon this background, the first God-man taught His disciples to pray for executing God s will according to His economy by faith Matt 21:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Having Faith in God without Doubting</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the praying one could have faith in God without doubting, but believing that he had received what he asked for, and he would have it Mark 11:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The praying one is now one with God, in union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is mingled with God, so God becomes his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is what it means to have faith in God, according to the Lord s word in Mark 11:22.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The praying one is absolutely one with God, and God becomes his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Mark 11:24 the Lord said, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would like to present two testimonies concerning the experience of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first one is concerning the Lord s move to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Soon after the United States defeated Iraq in 1991, one day a thought came to me: Why don t you go to Russia?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now is the time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I fellowshipped with the leading co-workers about this, they all agreed with me, so we announced to the saints that we would follow the Lord s leading to go to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Right away there was a response from the Body for this move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a testimony that I had the full faith that we received a success.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the time we decided to go to Russia, a number of the saints had been trained and prepared by finishing two terms of the full-time training in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They responded that they would go, and in November 1991 over thirty went to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Right away the financial support came from the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Russia today there are two big churches in Moscow and St. Petersburg.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Recently, thirty-five more churches have been established.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Also, there are numerous locations with groups of seeking Christians who have left the denominations and are waiting for us to visit them to help establish them as local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The brothers have estimated that by the end of this year, there will be fifty well-established churches in Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Besides Russia, the Lord has been moving in other eastern European countries, such as Poland, Albania, Romania, and Armenia.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This has been the Lord s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have just followed His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our going to Russia has been of the Lord s will for the accomplishment of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the experience of having faith in God without doubting, and believing that we have received what we have asked for so that we receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to pray according to God s will for the fulfillment of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we are one with God and the right persons in God s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we have the assurance that we have received what we have prayed for.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second testimony is concerning my experience of the Lord in 1943, which was a critical year of the war between China and Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was very much oppressed by the military police of the Japanese invading army in my city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One night I had a dream in which the Lord assured me that I would not be harmed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In that dream I was walking and I came to a slope with four steps.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After I stepped down, a German shepherd jumped up and put its front paws upon me, but the dog did not hurt me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When it stopped bothering me, I saw the day dawn, like the dawning in the morning, with a broad highway, very bright and very straight.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After waking up, I realized that this was not an ordinary dream.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As I considered this dream, I received its interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The four steps were the last four years of the war, which were very difficult in China.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There were eight years of fighting between Japan and China, and the last four years, after America joined the war, became very hard.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Japanese military police arrested me, but before they did I had this dream.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I realized that the German shepherd signified the Japanese who were troubling me but who eventually did not do any harm to me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After this troubling there was a broad highway shining under the dawning of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I then knew that after the Japanese trouble, the Lord would bring me onto such a highway.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I had this dream fifty-three years ago, when I was only thirty-nine years old, in 1943.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After 1943, because of being imprisoned by the Japanese, I became sick with tuberculosis of the lungs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The doctor charged me to rest absolutely in bed for six months.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In October 1944 I left Chefoo and rested in Tsingtao for another one and a half years until 1945 when the Japanese surrendered.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the war, the brothers in Shanghai and Nanking asked me to visit the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 1948 the political situation changed in China, and Brother Nee made the decision to send me out.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I went to Taiwan in 1949 to minister Christ for the establishing and building up of the churches there.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually, I came to the United States and began to minister here for the Lord s recovery in 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I never dreamed that I would be here.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today the whole earth is open to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During all my time in the church life, I have never seen such a harmony among the churches, among the elders, and among the co-workers as today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By His mercy and grace, we can boast that today on this whole earth, all the churches, the co-workers, and the elders are in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every sign is an encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every report is beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord is working everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The open door to the Lord s recovery is His doing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For this move, I have prayed at rest, believing that I have what I have asked for.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we ask the Lord for things that satisfy our desire, we will not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is because our prayer is not according to God s will for the fulfillment of God s economy, and we are not the right persons.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First, we must be the right persons, absolutely one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One night, during my imprisonment by the Japanese for thirty days, I looked up and said, Lord, You know why I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At the time it seemed as if the Lord Jesus was right before me.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I had the full assurance to say to the Lord, Lord, I am imprisoned for Your sake.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must first be the right persons before God, persons who are one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then we can have God as our faith and pray according to our knowledge of God s will for the fulfillment of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we pray for something according to our desire, not according to God s will, to fulfill our purpose, not to fulfill God s economy, we can never have the faith in God to believe that we have received what we asked for.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>K. Teaching Them How to Flee by Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In prophesying that the returned Israel in the future will suffer the great tribulation, the first God-man taught them how to flee by prayer Matt 24:15-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>According to God s economy, He gave up Israel but He would not give them up for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is a temporary matter.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord Jesus told the leaders of Israel in Matthew 21 that God would give them up.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then in Matthew 24 the Lord prophesied that the dispersed Israel would eventually return to their holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But at the end of this age, because of Antichrist, a great tribulation Matt 24:21 will occur in the holy land, so Israel will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord told them to pray, asking God to save them.</S>
