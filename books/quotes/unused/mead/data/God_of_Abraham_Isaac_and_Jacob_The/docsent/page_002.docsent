   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Scripture Reading: Exo 3:6, 15-16; Matt 22:31-32 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 10:11 says, "Now these things happened to them as an example..."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible records the history of the Israelites as an example to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is for the purpose of our edification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although there is an outward difference between God's work in the Old Testament and His work in the New Testament, they are the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The principle of God's work is the same today as it was in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God chose the Israelites to be His people, and He also chose men from among the Gentiles to be His people Acts 15:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible says that we are fellow citizens and members of the household of God Eph 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It also says that we are the true Jews Rom 2:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the history of the Israelites is a pattern to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this book we will consider the way God deals with His people; in other words, the way God edifies His people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Putting it another way, this book will show the kind of experience we must acquire before we can become the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will discuss this subject through a consideration of the history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob because each of these three persons occupies a particular place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible shows us that God's people had two beginnings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first beginning was with Abraham because God's selection and calling began with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The other beginning was with the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God told the Israelites that they would be a people to Him among all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They would be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation Exo 19:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, Abraham was a definite beginning for God's people, and the nation of Israel was also a definite beginning for God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In between these two beginnings, God gained three persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First there was Abraham, then there was Isaac, then Jacob, and then the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From that point on, the nation of Israel became the people of God, and God had a people of His own.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we can say that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the foundations of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there would not be the nation of Israel, and without Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there would not be a people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's people became His people through the experience of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is interesting to note that God said, "I am...the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" Exo 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said this in the Old Testament, and the Lord Jesus quoted it in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob" is quoted in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke Matt 22:32; Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, the Lord Jesus said that we would see "Abraham and Isaac and Jacob..in the kingdom of God" Luke 13:28 , and that "many will come from the east and the west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens" Matt 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here, He does not mention anyone else's names, only the names of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob each occupy a special place in the Bible.</S>
