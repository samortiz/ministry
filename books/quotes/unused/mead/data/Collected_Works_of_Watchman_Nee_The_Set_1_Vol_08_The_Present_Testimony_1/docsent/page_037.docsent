   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAR BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEW AND THE OLD Issue No. 14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a believer is regenerated, he should know two very important things: how much he has gained through regeneration and how much of his natural disposition remains.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This knowledge will keep him advancing along his spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We now need to explain what man's flesh includes and how the Lord Jesus has dealt with the elements of the flesh in His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, we want to see what a believer has received at the time of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 7:14 says, "I am fleshy, sold under sin."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verses 17 and 18 say, "Sin...dwells in me...that is, in my flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From these two verses we can see that the flesh is composed of "sin" and "I."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This "sin" is the power of sins, while the "I" is what we usually call the self.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a believer wants to understand what spiritual life is, he must make a clear distinction between these two components of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know that the Lord Jesus dealt with the sin in our flesh on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the Bible tells us that "our old man has been crucified with Him" Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible never tells us to be crucified concerning sin because this is something that Christ has fully accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no more need for man to do anything concerning sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the Bible tells us to reckon ourselves to be dead to sin v. 11 . In this way we can receive the effectiveness of the death of Christ and can be fully delivered from the power of sin v. 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the Bible never tells us to be crucified for our sins, it does tell us to bear the cross in regard to the self.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus mentioned many times that we have to deny our self and bear the cross to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reason for this is that there is a difference between the Lord's dealing with our sins on the cross and His dealing with our self on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We know that it was only after the Lord went to the cross that He bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not bear them before this time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, He did not just deny Himself after He went to the cross; instead, He denied Himself all the time He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A believer can overcome sin in a minute, but he must deny himself for his whole lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Galatians makes clear to us these two aspects of the relationship between the flesh and the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, it tells us that "they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts" 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that on the day a person begins to belong to Christ, his flesh is crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man has not been taught by the Holy Spirit, he may think that there is no more flesh because it has been already crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Bible tells us to "walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These verses clearly show us that a person who belongs to Christ and who has the Holy Spirit dwelling in him still has the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only is the flesh still present, but it is particularly powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do these two passages contradict one another?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No, they do not.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 24 deals particularly with the aspect of sin in the flesh, while verse 17 deals particularly with the aspect of the self in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The cross of Christ deals with sin, while the Holy Spirit deals with the self through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through the cross Christ has freed the believers completely from the power of sin so that sin will no longer lord it over them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through the Holy Spirit, Christ is dwelling within the believers so that they can overcome the self day by day and fully obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Victory over sin is an accomplished fact, while victory over the self is a work that is being accomplished day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a believer understands the full salvation of the cross, he will, at the time of regeneration, i.e., at the time he receives Jesus as his Savior be completely free from sin on the one hand, and receive a new life on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Unfortunately, many workers have not presented God's full salvation to the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, the sinner only believes in a half-salvation and only receives a half-salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His sins are indeed forgiven, but he does not have the power to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes the way of salvation is indeed fully preached, but the fact that a believer only desires the grace of forgiveness without sincerely desiring the power to overcome sin, also results in his only receiving a half-salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If one believes and receives full salvation at the time of his regeneration, he will have little experience of being defeated when battling with sin and more experience of battling with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But very few believers are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we cannot say how many are like this, we can say that the number is very small.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most believers receive only a half-salvation; therefore, most of their battle is with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some do not even know what the self is at the time of their regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This has something to do with the experience of a person before his regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people have the inclination for doing good even before they are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, they do not have the power which enables them to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although their conscience is relatively clear, they have little strength to do good, and conflict becomes inevitable.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what the world calls the conflict between reason and lust.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After these people hear about full salvation, they sincerely receive the grace of victory over sin in the same way that they receive the grace of forgiveness from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But other people have a darkened conscience before they believe, and they are very sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have never tried to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When they hear about full salvation, they naturally lay hold of the grace of forgiveness and neglect but not reject the grace of victory over sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This kind of people invariably experiences conflict with the sin in the flesh after being regenerated.</S>
