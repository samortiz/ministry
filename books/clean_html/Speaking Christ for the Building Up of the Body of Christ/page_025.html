<h2 class="head1">THE STARTING OF OUR MEETING</h2>
<p>The proper starting of our meeting should not be in the meeting hall but in our homes. We should start the meeting by calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, praying, singing, praising, and speaking. While we are on the way to the meeting place and when we arrive, we can continue to enjoy the Lord in this way. If a number of the saints are already there practicing the meeting, we can join what they are already doing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SUBJECT OF OUR MEETING</h2>
<p>In our meetings we do not need to have a definite subject. To have a definite subject is wrong according to the revelation of 1 Corinthians 14:26, which says that whenever we come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, or has an interpretation. Surely each attendant will not bring something to the meeting that covers the same subject. Hebrews 10:25 also implies this. This verse tells us that in our meetings we need to &ldquo;exhort one another.&rdquo; How could the meeting have a definite subject when we are exhorting one another? There is no need of a definite subject in our meetings. We need to keep the meeting open to any subject or subjects as the Lord leads through the attending saints. Our meetings do not need a prearranged program. We must have the faith to have our meetings with nothing prearranged. Having a program binds, annuls, and kills.</p>
<p>A rich feast is composed not only of one dish. The more courses of food there are and the more variety there is, the richer the feast is. Some leading ones have made some prior arrangements when the saints come together for a love feast. They assign certain saints to bring hot food, others to bring salad, others to bring bread, and others to bring potatoes. But this is not a real feast. A feast has more than just four courses. It should have at least twelve courses with many varieties of foods and tastes. Such a feast is a real enjoyment, and a rich meeting should be just like this. Each saint should bring a different &ldquo;dish.&rdquo; Our meetings need to be a real feast to both God and man. We all need to bring our topmost portion of the riches of Christ that we have enjoyed to the church meeting and present them for God&rsquo;s satisfaction and the saints&rsquo; nourishment. I believe the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will arrive at the reality of 1 Corinthians 14:26 because this is the Lord&rsquo;s Word. This is the heavenly and divine way revealed in the Scriptures. We must take care of what is said in the Holy Bible. First Corinthians 14:26 does tell us that whenever we come together, each one should have something. Throughout the years of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, some of us have tasted and experienced some meetings in the nature of what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Now the Lord wants us to enter into the full reality of such a wonderful meeting life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF OUR MEETING&mdash;TO EXHIBIT CHRIST</h2>
<p>The goal of our meeting is to exhibit Christ, and the Christian meeting is an exhibition of the Christian daily life. The Christian daily life is just Christ. Paul said, &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21a). Christ must be our daily life, and our meeting is an exhibition, a display, of our daily life. The center of this display is Christ Himself. Whatever we pray, speak, or sing must be with Christ as the center. We do not speak other things. We only speak Christ. We must learn to practice our meetings according to the scriptural way of meeting and serving. We cannot practice the new way according to our natural way. We must be trained in the spirit and with the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF OUR MEETING&mdash;<br />
TO BUILD UP THE SAINTS<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The purpose of our meeting is to build up the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ. According to my observation, many Christian meetings, or so-called services, at the very most only help to edify the saints without building up the Body. To build up the Body of Christ as an organism, we need the meetings which are according to the Bible. The unscriptural, traditional way of meeting annuls, chokes, and deadens the living members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>One can build an article of furniture by arranging and attaching pieces of wood to one another in an organizational way. But to build up a person as an organism is a different matter. Whatever is put into a person to build him up must be something living, something of life. For a living person to be built up, he needs to take in some organic, living substance. Morticians make corpses look better by putting make-up on them. Although a corpse may look better outwardly, it is still full of death. The Lord&rsquo;s way is not to change us only outwardly but to add His very life into our inward being to transform us and make us His living members.</p>
<p>Death is more defiling before God than sin (Lev. 11:24-25; Num. 6:6-7, 9). According to the Old Testament, if anyone sinned, he could be forgiven simply by offering the sin offering (Lev. 4:27-31). However, anyone who touched the dead body of a man had to wait seven days before he could be cleansed (Num. 19:11, 16). The traditional way of meeting is a way of death. We must practice the new way of meeting according to the Bible. We must stay away from any way that is deadening, annulling, or choking and take the way that supplies people with something organic and that builds up an organism, not an organization. The reason why the Lord has not come back yet is because there is not such a living organism on this earth to match Him.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of millions of Christians on this earth today, but where is the Body built up? There are thousands and thousands of assemblies and gatherings, but where can we see the organic Body? We cannot see the organic Body of Christ because the meetings in the traditional way cannot fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose to build up the Body. Week after week many believers attend this kind of meeting, but at best they are only edified personally. Only the way to meet that is according to the Bible can build up the Body of Christ as a divine organism.</p>
<p>Whatever we do in the scriptural way of meeting requires the exercise of our spirit. If we speak, read, sing, or testify, we must exercise our spirit. When we exercise our spirit, the Spirit that is within our spirit operates and the issue is something organic. This is why we should not behave, act, or move in the meeting according to anything natural. We must do everything according to our spirit under the anointing. Then something organic will come out to nourish us and others in order to build up the organic Body of Christ. In our meetings the saints are built up for the building up of the Body of Christ by four things: by our giving a testimony, speaking forth Christ, teaching the truth, and preaching the gospel. These are four categories of things that we can and should cover in our meetings.</p>
