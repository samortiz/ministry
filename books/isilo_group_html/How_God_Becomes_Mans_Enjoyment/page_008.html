<h1 class="title">EATING AND DRINKING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we fellowshipped concerning eating and drinking, based on John 6. In this chapter we will say more concerning eating and drinking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER CHRISTIAN FAITH INVOLVING<br />
EATING, DRINKING, AND ENJOYING CHRIST</h2>
<p>When we come before the Lord, we must see that He wants us to eat, drink, and enjoy Him; therefore, He is a tree and a river. We should not think that God wants us to be good, to do good, or to please Him. We must drop such concepts because they are from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and not from the tree of life. God does not want man to pay attention to good and evil. He wants us to focus on how He can be our life. He wants to feed us. He wants to be our food and our living water so that we may eat and drink Him in order to be satisfied. Then we will not only do good, but we will have a holy living. Holiness surpasses good, because holiness is God. God wants to feed us, fill us, satisfy us, and overflow from within us. This divine thought far surpasses the good that man focuses on.</p>
<p>We all believe that Christians should zealously preach the gospel, and we are often exhorted to be zealous for the gospel. I do not like to exhort others in this way, because zealous gospel preaching can often be merely behavior, which is of little value before God. Moreover, such behavior will not last, for the Christian walk is not mere behavior. The Christian walk is the expression of life. It is the expression of eating and drinking the Lord to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>There is no need to exhort a tangerine tree to bear tangerines. Such an exhortation is useless, for bearing tangerines is the spontaneous expression of the life within the tangerine tree. If the tree has water, good soil, fertilizer, sunshine, and air, it will spontaneously bear tangerines in abundance. If the tree does not have adequate water, soil, fertilizer, sunshine, and air, it will not bear fruit, no matter how much it is exhorted.</p>
<p>A brother who does not eat or drink God does not have any spiritual fertilizer or spiritual water. Exhorting him to preach the gospel zealously can be compared to exhorting a dead person to stand up. However, a brother who fellowships with the Lord daily, enjoys Him as his daily satisfaction, and lives because of Him is one who is filled with the Lord; hence, he does not need to be exhorted in order to preach the gospel. A brother who is filled with the Lord will have a fire burning within and will not be able to stop preaching the gospel. He will not be able to stop himself from overflowing with the Lord and expressing the Lord. This is the living of a person who is full of the divine life.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s concept is always related to outward behavior and doing things, but God&rsquo;s way is to enter into man in order to supply and transform him. God is both water and fire. He wants to enter into us and to cleanse and burn us. Then He can occupy us and be expressed through us. This is God&rsquo;s way, and this is the true significance of the Christian life. The Christian life is not a matter of behavior or of being good. The Christian life is a matter of Christ entering into us to be our life and life supply so that He can be expressed through us. The Christian faith is also not a matter of exhorting believers to honor their parents. We cannot honor our parents in ourselves; we need to allow Christ to fill us as our life by eating Him as our food and drinking Him as our living water. When we are filled with Christ, we will express Him by honoring our parents. This is the proper Christian life.</p>
<p>I hope that we can distinguish between behavior and the Christian life. Religion tells people to improve and cultivate their character. Christianity tells people that Jesus can change them. The proper Christian faith teaches people that Jesus Christ is their life, their food, and their living water. Hence, they need to receive Him by eating, drinking, and enjoying Him so that He will fill them, and they will live out His divine life. The chorus of <em>Hymns,</em> #509 says, &ldquo;God is in Christ to be my supply, / God as the Spirit nourisheth me; / If upon Christ in spirit I feed, / Filled with His life I&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo; When God lives in us, fills us, and occupies us, He will be expressed through us. This is glorious. The proper Christian faith involves eating and drinking Christ. This is the Christian life. It is a life of enjoying Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How God Becomes Man's Enjoyment &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
