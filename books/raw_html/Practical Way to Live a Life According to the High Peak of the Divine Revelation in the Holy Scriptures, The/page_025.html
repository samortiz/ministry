<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Church</H2><P>The Body of Christ is first the church, the congregation, the gathering, the assembly, of the called-out ones. This is the meaning of the Greek word ekklesia. The church appears in many cities to be the local churches as the many local expressions of the one church on the earth, without any division of nationalities, races, and social ranks (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11). When I came to the United States and saw that there were so-called white churches and black churches, I was shocked. When I was a young man, I wondered how the Church of England could be in my hometown in mainland China. On the other hand, in the Chinese community in Southern California there is a Taiwanese church. What a shame it is for Christians to be divided in such ways! The Body of Christ has no nationality, no race, and no social rank.</P><P>Although the local churches are the many local expressions, they still remain "the [one] church" (Eph. 1:22-23), "the [unique] church of God" (1 Cor. 10:32; Acts 20:28) universally in its unique unity, unique oneness. Paul said that we should not become a stumbling block to the Jews, the Greeks, or the church of God. The church of God means all the churches on earth. Do not think that you can build a church that is separated from the other churches. If you have this kind of thought, you are off. The church's unity, oneness, is universal. The church is not divided and should not be divisive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Organism of the Processed<br>and Consummated Triune God</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God constituted with the believers in Christ, the many God-men, as the outward human framework; the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, as the divine essence; the all-inclusive Christ, the unlimited Christ, as the divine element; and God the Father, who is over all and through all and in all, as the divine source (Eph. 4:4-6). In other words, this organism of God is constituted with the believing human beings as the outward framework and the Triune God&#151;the Spirit, the Son, and the Father. The Spirit is the essence, the Son is the element, and the Father is the source. The essence is within the element.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Wife of the Processed<br>and Consummated Christ</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the wife of the processed and consummated Christ. She is Christ's counterpart, typified by Eve as the counterpart to Adam (Gen. 2:21b-24; Eph. 5:29-33; Rev. 21:2, 9; 22:17a). Eve was produced out of Adam, typifying that the church is produced out of Christ through His death and resurrection. When Adam was sleeping, God opened up his side, took out a rib, and built that rib into a woman. When Adam awoke, his wife Eve was presented to him. This signifies death and resurrection. Eve came out of Adam and was joined back to Adam to be one flesh with Adam. This shows that the church was produced out of Christ through His death and resurrection and joined back to Christ to be one entity with Him in life and in nature.</P><P>Christ is God Himself. The processed and consummated God, not the original God, has a wife. In eternity God was merely divine; He had not yet been processed and consummated. He did not yet have a wife. But when the very eternal God was processed and consummated through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, something came out of His pierced side (John 19:34). The Lord's pierced side was prefigured by Adam's opened side, out from which Eve was produced. Christ's death released the divine life from within Him, and His resurrection life produces the wife of Christ.</P>
