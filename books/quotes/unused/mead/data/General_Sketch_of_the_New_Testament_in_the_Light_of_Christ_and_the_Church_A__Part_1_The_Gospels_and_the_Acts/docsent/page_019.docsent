   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man Brought into God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's being brought into God is the last major item unveiled in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The four Gospels describe a two-way traffic the coming and going of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The coming of Christ is in incarnation, and His going is in death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ's coming in incarnation brought God into man, and His going by death, resurrection, and ascension brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By His coming, God lived on earth in a man, while His going brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, man today is in the heavens in God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why the apostle Paul told us that our life has been hidden with Christ in God Col 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 14 through 17 makes this matter more clear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chapters fourteen through sixteen record the last words spoken by the Lord before His death, and John 17 records the Lord's closing prayer after His message.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These four chapters give us a clear vision of the way in which the Lord brings us into the Father by His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>HAVING THE PROPER INSIGHT INTO THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not have the proper insight, we cannot be clear about what the New Testament says.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before I came to the United States for the first time, I purchased a very good Japanese camera, and I read the instruction booklet several times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, however, I did not know what it was talking about because I did not have the insight into how the camera worked.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, we may be able to recite the New Testament word by word from the first book to the last, but if we do not have the proper insight, we cannot understand it clearly and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not have the kind of insight revealed in these seven foregoing points, we can never be clear about the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need a clear view of Christ's incarnation, the kingdom, the condition of the fallen race, the all-sufficiency of Christ, the wonderful living of the divine life in the human life, the imparting of life through the redemption of Christ, and the wonderful fact that man has been brought into God by Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are clear concerning these few matters, God's eternal purpose and the entire holy Word will be transparent to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This will greatly influence our daily walk and even revolutionize our entire Christian concept.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our work and our service will be greatly affected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will be delivered from tradition and be brought into something living and real.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the histories and biographies of the men of God who were used very much by the Lord in the past, they had this kind of realization and insight to some degree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, what they realized at their time was not as clear as what we see today, because the Lord has opened these matters more and more over the years, sometimes more and more each day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord's eternal purpose and His Word are thoroughly transparent to us, this vision will govern our walk, our work, our service, and our entire Christian concept.</S>
