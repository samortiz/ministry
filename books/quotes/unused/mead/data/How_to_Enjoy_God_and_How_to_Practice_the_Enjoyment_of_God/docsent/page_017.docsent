   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE HOW TO ENJOY GOD IN PRAYER Scripture Reading: Psa 42:1-2; 27:4; 62:1; 104:34; 145:5; 29:2; 150:1; Gen 18:22, 33</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter and the next we will consider how we can enjoy God through prayer and reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer and reading the Word are the most crucial means to receive and enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although prayer and reading the Word are quite common among us, there are many details to consider.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people pray, but they do not know the meaning of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Similarly, many people read the Bible, but they do not know the significance of reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more common a practice is, the more science there is to it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should never think that as soon as one becomes a Christian, he automatically knows how to pray and read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a Christian truly touches the key to prayer and reading the Word, he is on his way to enjoying God daily.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us now consider how to enjoy God through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>PRAYER BEING TO BREATHE IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Prayer is not mainly a matter of coming to God to ask for something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The meaning of prayer is not to ask God to do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The primary significance of prayer is to breathe in God, to absorb God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we pray, we should not have a motive or intention of asking God to do something for us; rather, our intention should be to breathe in God and absorb Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regrettably, many Christians misunderstand the meaning of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They think that we need to pray to God to ask for help because there are things that we cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let me say strongly, this is not prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Real prayer has nothing to do with asking God for help.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Simply put, prayer is our spiritual breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all know what it is to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we breathe out, we exhale the carbon dioxide that is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we breathe in, we inhale the oxygen that is outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what happens when we breathe in and breathe out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In prayer we do the same thing we breathe out what is within us, and we breathe in what is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything that we have in our natural being can be compared to carbon dioxide, and everything that God is can be compared to oxygen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we pray, we breathe out everything undesirable, and we breathe in everything of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Recently we found a good hymn on prayer Hymns, #255 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This hymn says that when we come to God, we breathe out ourselves and everything we have, and we breathe in God and everything He has.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this breathing in and out, we are delivered from ourselves and are put into God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of breathing discharges what is within us and brings in everything of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we breathe out, our sins are exhaled, and when we breathe in, God s holiness is inhaled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By breathing out, we rid ourselves of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By breathing in, we take in God s power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may be full of sorrow and grief, but as soon as we come to God and breathe out, the sorrow and grief are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After breathing out, we must breathe in. When we breathe in, God s joy and comfort enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the meaning of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Prayer is to breathe in God, just as we breathe in air.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever we pray, we breathe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Prayer is our spiritual breathing before God and in God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though we often do not know what to say when we wait on God, there is a sighing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This sighing can be compared to breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our experience shows that when we sigh a little, the weight on our shoulder disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are fully released and rested, and we overflow with a sense of sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may often find ourselves sinking into darkness and confusion within, not knowing which path we should take, what we should do, or even how we should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But while we wait on the Lord, we utter a sigh from deep in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is interesting that after sighing for a while, the darkness and confusion vanish, and we become clear and uncluttered, knowing the way to proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This wonderful experience is the meaning of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Real prayer is nothing but waiting on God and breathing in God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we breathe, we exhale everything that we are and inhale everything that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let us now consider ten points to illustrate how we breathe in God through prayer.</S>
