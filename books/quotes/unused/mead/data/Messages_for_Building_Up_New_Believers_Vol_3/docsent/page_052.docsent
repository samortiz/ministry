   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 6 says, For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a quotation from Proverbs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It reveals the purpose of the Lord s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. Discipline Being the Arrangement of Love</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God does not have the spare time to deal with all the people of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He disciplines only those whom He loves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He disciplines us because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He disciplines us because He wants to make us vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has no time to discipline everyone in the world, but He disciplines His own children because He loves them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, discipline is God s provision of love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Love arranges the environment that we should be in. We call this arrangement His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Love measures everything that comes our way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It orders the things that we encounter in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This measurement is His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Discipline is for our greatest profit and for bringing us to the loftiest goal in God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And He scourges every son whom He receives.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All those who are disciplined have the ground to say that they are received by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Scourging is not a sign of God s rejection; it is a proof of His acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I say again, God does not have the time to deal with everyone; He wants to spend His time on the sons whom He loves and receives.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Discipline Being the Father s Education</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once you become a Christian, you should be prepared to accept discipline from God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are not His child, God will let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will allow you to live an undisciplined life and walk your own way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But once you have accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior, once you are born of God and have become His child, you have to prepare yourself for His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No father has the time to discipline another man s child.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether his neighbor s son is good or bad is not of his concern.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A good father, however, will always discipline his own son in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will deal with his son strictly according to guidelines that he has set in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He will not discipline his son in a mindless and haphazard way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He will train his son according to a few objectives, namely, honesty, diligence, long-suffering, and noble aspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The father puts together a certain curriculum to discipline his son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He molds his son into a certain character.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same way, since the day we were saved, God has been arranging a curriculum for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He wants us to learn certain lessons so that we will be conformed to His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He wants us to be like Him in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why He arranges, disciplines, and scourges.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His goal is to make us a certain kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the very beginning of his Christian life, a child of God must realize that God has prepared many lessons for him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has made many provisions in the environment and has ordered many things, experiences, and sufferings for the purpose of producing a certain kind of character and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what God is doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He wants to build up a certain kind of character in us, and He does it by ordering all kinds of circumstances to come our way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The minute we become Christians, we have to realize that God s hand is guiding us in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The ordained circumstances will come, and the scourgings will come.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As soon as we get off the right way, His scourges will be upon us and will goad us back to the way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every child of God should be prepared to accept God s disciplinary hand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God disciplines us because we are sons.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God does not waste His time on others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has no time to discipline those who are not His beloved sons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God has no time to reprove those who are not yet accepted as sons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Scourging and discipline are expressions of God s love and acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only Christians can have a share in God s scourging and discipline.</S>
