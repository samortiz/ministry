<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF ALL THE CHURCHES TO BE THE SAME,<br />
TAKING THE WAY OF HOME GATHERINGS</h2>
<p>The contents of Book 7 in this series were given as a preparation for this fellowship. Now around this globe more than six hundred churches will take the same way. These churches will be like a caravan. If all the cars are driving and you do not drive, your car may be crushed. All the churches on the whole earth will be going on in the same way. The churches in New Zealand, Australia, Ghana, Taiwan, the United States, and everywhere will take the same way as a great local church caravan moving and traveling through this globe.</p>
<p>In the present situation some may be taught and encouraged to be different. To them all the local churches should be different and the teaching and leadership of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry do not fit into their situation. Now you should realize why the eight chapters in Book 7 are a preparation to this fellowship. I am not saying that this kind of church should be dropped. Forget about this thought.</p>
<p>Some United States citizens do not have any idea about fighting, yet they enjoy this country to the uttermost. Somebody, though, is fighting for them. They may be taking advantage of the fighters, but they are still citizens of the United States. We should consider the churches who want to be different as local churches, but we cannot bring them in to fight the battle for the recovery. We need every church to be a fighter.</p>
<p>Suppose the six hundred churches throughout the globe were all different from one another and that each church went its own way. Where then would the impact be? This would be like the age of the Judges in which there was no king and everyone did what was right in his own eyes. When Gideon chose three hundred men to fight the battle for the Lord, they all became the same and they fought the battle for all of Israel (Judg. 7:7, 18). We need such churches today. Wherever we go, it would be wonderful if all the churches were the same.</p>
<p>One particular news publication recently reported that during the past fifty years the Muslims have increased five hundred times, from two hundred million to the present one billion. During the same period Hinduism increased one hundred seventeen percent, Buddhism by sixty-three percent, and Christianity by forty-seven percent. Even Buddhism got more increase than Christianity. The Muslims have such a high increase because they are all unified. Basically speaking, all the Muslims have one way regardless of their nationality or country. Christianity, on the other hand, is weakened by all the divisions.</p>
<p>One brother who is contacting some Jewish people said that some of them have said, &ldquo;If Christianity is true, why do you have so many denominations?&rdquo; This annuls the power. There is no need for others to oppose us. We ourselves are opposing one another. When I came to this country, I taught the truth from the Bible, and I was opposed. In mainland China some of the faithful brothers were judged and arrested. The policemen secretly told these brothers, &ldquo;You did not make any mistake or do anything wrong. We know you are innocent people. The only problem is that your people are fighting one another.&rdquo; That meant that other Christians were fighting against them by contacting the government, so the policemen had to come and arrest them at the order of the government. This is a shame to the Christians.</p>
<p>We Christians have lost our impact by our being different. This is the subtlety of the enemy. If only all the Christians in the United States were the same, what power and impact there would be! This would not only take the entire United States but also the entire globe. But where is such a thing today? Many Christians are fighting. They are not only fighting against us but against each other. The teaching that encourages the believers to be different is erroneous. This is why I studied the New Testament again to find any hint that there should be different churches. The more I studied, the more I realized that all the churches should be identical (see Book 7&mdash;chapter four). Because the Muslims around the world are one, their increase was fivefold in the last fifty years. The churches around the globe do have a certain amount of fellowship; this is our impact. But we must learn to be the same.</p>
<p>Our practice has to be in the sphere of the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The home gatherings are something in the realm and even at the center of this revelation. This will never cause any trouble to produce divisions. The way of home gatherings is the biblical way, the way ordained by God and initiated by the moving Spirit at the very start of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
