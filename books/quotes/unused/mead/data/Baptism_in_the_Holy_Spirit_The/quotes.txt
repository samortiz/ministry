[1]  The Scriptures clearly reveal to us that there are two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit: the inward aspect for life and the outward aspect for power.
[2]  Inwardly we need the breath of the Holy Spirit breathed into us for life, and outwardly we need the wind of the Holy Spirit blowing upon us for power.
[3]  The outward aspect of power is always for the sake of the inward aspect of life.
[4]  After we have been baptized in the Spirit into one Body, we must drink of the Spirit that we may grow in life and be built up in the Body.
[5]  The laying on of hands is only a form, of which the real meaning or reality is that we must be rightly related to the Body that we may be in the right position to partake of the baptism in the Holy Spirit already accomplished upon the Body.
[6]  Many Christians and even many Christian teachers confuse the outward baptism in the Holy Spirit with the inward filling of the Holy Spirit.
[7]  The baptism in the Holy Spirit has already been accomplished, as seen in 1 Corinthians 12:13.
[8]  Some Christians always insist that speaking in tongues is a necessary manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
[9]  We have briefly given the proper definition of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
[10]  Since the baptism in the Holy Spirit has been accomplished upon the Body of Christ and still exists upon it, we must be properly related to the Body and maintain this proper relationship with the Body in order to be one with it.
[11]  If some separation exists, if we are wrong with the Body, if we do not stand and keep our position in the Body, we will lose the ground for claiming and partaking of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
