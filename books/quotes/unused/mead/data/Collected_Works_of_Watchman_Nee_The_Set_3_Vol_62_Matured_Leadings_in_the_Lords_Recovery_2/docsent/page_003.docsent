   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's Way of Revival</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Whole Body Serving</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of us have been very much affected by Western missionaries and by the mission societies behind these missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We think that God's way is through mission societies or foreign boards.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Bible says nothing about mission societies and foreign boards.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God only raises up churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mission societies, on the other hand, are raised up by men, in particular, by such men as A. J. Gordon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These men promote mission societies and foreign boards; they organize evangelistic institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mission societies, foreign boards, and evangelistic institutions all look to a few men to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But God has only one way in the Bible; He only chooses one kind of people to preach the gospel all the believers Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone God has saved is a Christian, and every brother and sister He has given to the church has to be equally absolute in rejecting lust, sin, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They must be equally given to preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has not chosen a special class of people in the church to forsake everything for the gospel, while leaving the rest to do as they please.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church must not have two different classes of people, one being absolute in consecration while the other loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There can only be one class of people in the church those who are absolute in consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the way of revival that God is taking today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the church is built up this way, the gates of Hades surely will not prevail against the church, and sinners surely will not be able to withstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our experience during the past few years has proven this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The result of the church preaching the gospel has been a multiple increase.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Taipei alone, the number has increased thirtyfold since last year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The rate of increase is measured by the number of folds, not by percentages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the whole church rises up to serve, God's grace is more than we can hold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From north to south and from east to west, all the brothers and sisters have voluntarily offered up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not here to say that some should hand themselves over and others should not.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have no intention of drawing a line and dividing the saints into two classes of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May the Lord find no hindrance in us, and may He find a way through the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May the Lord not be hindered by worldly elements in the church, just as He is not hindered by sin in the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Way to Meet the Need</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>the Whole Body Handing Itself Over</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>to Be Perfected</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today two kinds of work face the church the work of begetting and the work of continual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, it has to gain sinners on the one hand and edify the saints on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Handing ourselves over does not merely mean handing over our possessions, but handing our very person over.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The purpose of handing our possessions over is merely to allow the Lord to have a free way through us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the Lord gives us a thousand people this year, will we be able to help these thousand pray, read the Bible, and break bread together?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unless we serve together as the Body, there is no way we can meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps we have a shabby prayer meeting or a sloppy bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who should open their mouths do not, while those who should not open their mouths do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everyone is unbridled in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If this is the condition among us, how can we serve together?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must find the proper way to serve before we can integrate the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the reason we must not only hand over our possessions, but our whole being for the service.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the only way for God to have a way among us, and this is the only way for God to have a way among the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church is like a big bakery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It "digests" raw flour and produces baked bread.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church must have enough capacity to "digest" a large amount of flour and roll it out again in the form of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church must be able to absorb as many people as are added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It cannot solicit temporary help at the last minute.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are twice as many bakeries in Shanghai as in Hong Kong; this is the only way to meet the needs of the population.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the same way, the church must train and perfect enough people to serve to meet its need.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church must not bring men to salvation only to lose them later.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If it loses them, that is, if it saves a few one month and loses a few in the next few months, the total number will never increase, and the church will never be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the church in Taipei, Brother Chang Yu-lan said that he is training the brothers and sisters until they can absorb everyone; if five thousand come, they will absorb five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If fifty thousand come, they will absorb fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps some have joined our meetings for a few months but still do not know anything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have not contacted them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I hope that after this fellowship we will make arrangements to take care of them immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Fifteen or sixteen years ago, I gave a message in Shanghai on being anxious for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I used an illustration of the roofers passing tiles from one person to another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps I can change the application of that illustration a little.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose a worker carries twenty tiles to the site.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He passes these tiles one by one to a person halfway between the ground and the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The man on the roof then receives the tiles one by one from the one in the middle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The one in the middle has the ability to take as many as the one on the bottom passes to him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the one at the bottom gives him five tiles, he can take all five because he passes them all on.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the one in the middle does not pass the tiles that he has received or if the one on top does not receive the tiles from the one in the middle, the middle one will be overburdened by the tiles.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the Lord has not started anything, we will not sense the urgency of the need to train the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But as soon as the Lord starts something, and the church continues to gain some new ones, we will realize the urgent need to train these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As soon as new believers join the church, we have to train them and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to tell them what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Perhaps a person has joined us this month.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In three or four months he needs to turn around and take care of the next group of new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In this way the church will care for new ones in an orderly way wave after wave.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Those who are saved in January will take care of those who are saved in February.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord will bless the church; the church will grow, and it will also be able to absorb the result of its growth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the reason I have to shout, "The whole church has to hand itself over.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It cannot delay!"</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our possessions are only one among many things that we have to hand over.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not make too much of material offering.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hopefully, you will not make too much of it either.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our hope is that everyone will hand himself over to be perfected and edified so that the whole Body can rise up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the past, men conducted warfare on a one-on-one basis.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It was guerrilla warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Today it is different.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Warfare is a matter of total mobilization and joint operations.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Paratroopers fight by dropping from the sky one by one, but they do not fight in an isolated way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Their thrust is part of a joint operation.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Many times I have felt that the Western missionaries were engaged in guerrilla warfare when they went to inland China.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Sometimes a couple would work in a place for thirty or forty years without gaining more than three or four people.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They worked hard, and they were tireless.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I admire them for their mind to suffer, but we cannot preach the gospel this way.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Today in China we need migrations that move like paratroopers.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should use the seaports as centers to train our brothers, then send them group by group into the interior west of China.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I believe when we respond to God's move this way, the gospelization of all of China will not be a problem.</S>
