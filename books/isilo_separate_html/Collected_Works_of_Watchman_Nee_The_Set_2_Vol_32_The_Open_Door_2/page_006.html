There was much blessing from the Lord. Some sisters have truly advanced in prayer. Soon we may have a gospel meeting in Chang's Garden.</p><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi<br />June 18</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>If the Lord so leads, I will go to Ch'eng-tu for a rest. Presently, I have been providing hospitality for the brothers and sisters and also taking care of some literature work. Perhaps I will still help to translate the The Dynamics of Service. Therefore, I am afraid to travel in the next three weeks. A few days ago I spoke with Brother Ke. On his way home, he stayed in a hotel in Shiaoshing where he was interrogated by military police. The letter of recommendation which he carried gave him some trouble. The military police did not understand terms such as "the meetings in various places" or "the Lord's table"; they thought that our brother was in some kind of secret society. Fortunately, God sent a nephew of his, whom he had not seen for seven years and who happened to be working there, and the matter was settled in peace. I feel that we should consider how we write the letter of recommendation in the future.</p><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi<br />June 22</p><p>(Perhaps in the future in writing letters of recommendation, we should add the words in Christ after the word brother so that others will know that we are Christians. It is also not too proper to put "those meeting in the Lord's name" in the signatory. It is better to explicitly say, "the church in such and such a place." In principle we should make it as plain as possible&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Lan Tsi-yi, Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>During the past two months, God has granted us grace in the churches in Wu-ch'ang and Hankow. First, He has perfected many believers in quietness to grow in life. Second, He has been saving sinners apart from our scheduled works. Third, He has opened many doors for the work. The more we see that we are useless and powerless, the more we see His work. He teaches us that hidden prayers are more important than quick-paced work. Gradually I have come to know Him as the Lord of the work and the working Lord! May glory be to His name!</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />May 23</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>We see God's grace in the work in Bai-Sha-Jou. The chief nurse of the hospital (a brother) has found a house. Brother Chen Yuen-sin has moved in with another brother. Some of the wounded soldiers have received the Lord, and even some officers have asked for gospel booklets and Bibles. God has shown me day by day that nothing is greater or more important than prayer.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />June 3</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
