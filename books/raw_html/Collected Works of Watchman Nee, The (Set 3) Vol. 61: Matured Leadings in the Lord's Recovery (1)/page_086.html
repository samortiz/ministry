<h2 class="head1">THE WELSH REVIVAL</h2><p>The Welsh revival was brought in through Evan Roberts. He was not educated at all; in fact, he was only a coal miner. Yet he brought in the greatest revival in the world&mdash;the Welsh revival. Wales was a big place, but Roberts worked mainly in one small chapel. He did not have complete sermons ready for delivery. His speaking was only a few sentences. Sometimes he would pray a little, but the congregation would always leave weeping or leave dancing. Their meetings did not have a set time for opening and closing and were not held in fixed places. They met at any place and at any time. People could come in the middle of the night or in the early morning. Almost every family was revived, and prayer meetings were conducted in every household. No one knew who the preachers were. Sometimes one person would stand up and call a hymn. At other times someone would stand up and read a verse.</p><p>Mrs. Penn-Lewis came from a Quaker background. She was a very strict person. Out of curiosity she joined these meetings. The scene she saw was a mess: Some mothers were nursing their babies; others were taking their meals. Some were praying, while others were singing. Outwardly, there was mayhem; the whole place looked like a market. However, she testified that there was something inexplicable and mysterious in the atmosphere. It was very unusual. Outwardly the scene was very noisy, but inwardly these people were all one. This happened in 1903 and 1904. By 1909 some brothers visited them from England and were told by one of the local pastors, "We have fewer and fewer converts every year. During the last one or two years we have hardly converted anyone." The visitors asked if this meant that the revival had taken a step back. The pastor answered, "No, all the people here are converted already." Roberts was able to bring in such a great revival because he was a fully consecrated person. He was willing to give up everything and spare nothing.</p><p>Today while we were singing this hymn, we touched the spirit of the author. It is a spirit unmatched in power in all the ages. The word presence is parousia in Greek. It refers to the Lord's descending, His manifestation. Although the Lord has not physically come again, we can bring His presence to our midst. This presence will bind us and restrict us; we will not dare be slothful. May all our walk and work be constrained and bound by His presence, and may we not deviate from this pathway in any way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE APPOINTMENT OF DEACONS<br />AND RESPONSIBLE ONES</h2><p>Presently, we have appointed eleven deacons and twenty-two responsible ones. We hope that these brothers and sisters will take up more responsibility in the five districts.</p><p>From now on, our work has to pay special attention to the care and perfecting of the young brothers and sisters. In addition to these five districts, we have asked a few saints to open up their homes and make them a kind of fellowship station. We have also asked a few sisters to care for these homes like governesses or nursing mothers. They should spend time to talk to the young brothers and sisters, read the Bible together with them, or cook for them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR TRAINING</h2><p>Presently, there is an immediate need for saints to migrate to all parts of China, but the condition of the saints here is far from ready. If they move now, they will just create problems for the churches in other localities. Therefore, we need to actively conduct more trainings. Do not underestimate the matter of migration. This is more serious than fighting a war, and the training that is required for such a move is more severe.</p><p>The first crucial thing to learn in this training is coordination. The next most important thing to learn is to be bold. The trainees have to learn to preach in the open air. They also have to learn to speak to unbelievers, to care for new believers, and to study the Bible.</p>
