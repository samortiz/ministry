<h1 class="title">THE TRIUNE GOD DWELLING IN THE BELIEVERS AS THEIR LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:6; John 14:20; 15:5; 14:17; Rom. 8:11; John 14:23; Gal. 2:20; Rom. 8:2; Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4; 1 Cor. 6:17</h1>
<p>Before we fellowship concerning the proper way for believers to meet and to serve, we must consider how the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is life to the believers. Without the Triune God as life, the believers have no way to meet or to serve. The Triune God being life to the believers is the greatest topic in the New Testament, and the way for believers to meet and to serve is a great matter in our practice of the new way. Christians have had different opinions and views concerning the way to meet and to serve. Hence, we must come back to the Bible and see what is revealed in it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL AND SALVATION</h2>
<p>Religions teach man to fear God and adjust his behavior according to his fear of God. The philosophy of Confucius and Mencius teaches moral principles that require people to practice self-cultivation in their character and relationships. Such principles become the standard for their human living. However, as far as the Christian life is concerned, our living, our meeting, and our serving are not governed by religion or by moral teachings. Our meeting and serving depend on the Triune God in whom we believe and who has come to be our life.</p>
<p>How does the gospel and salvation differ from religion and philosophy? Religion teaches people about a God who is outside of man. What is taught in religion concerning God is erroneous and false. Judaism and Islam both speak of the one true God who created the universe, but their God is outside of man. He is high above in the heavens and deserves to be obeyed and worshipped by all men. According the New Testament, however, the God whom Christians worship is not only the Creator and the sovereign Lord of the universe. He has regenerated us, His believers, and has entered into us to be our life. He does not want to be the Lord who is merely worshipped, feared, and served outwardly by us. Rather, He wants to enter into us to be our life and be joined and mingled with us so that He can be one with us. This far exceeds the general teaching in religion.</p>
<p>Although we are fallen descendants of Adam, we all have a desire to do good. Whether we can do good is another matter. We consider that honoring our parents is good, commendable, and something to be proud of, but most of the time we fail, just as Paul says, &ldquo;To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not&rdquo; (Rom. 7:18). No one likes to steal; everyone thinks that stealing is a shame. Everyone likes to be proper and decent. We would prefer to give to others and to help them, rather than to steal. Everyone has the desire to do good, but no one has the ability to carry out this desire. The highest goal of religion and philosophy is to stir up within man the desire to do good.</p>
<p>The gospel and salvation are neither religion nor philosophy; they are God Himself. God is not content with being outside of us. He desires to enter into us. The New Testament reveals that the deepest part of our being is our spirit. Man is of three parts: a spirit, a soul, and a body (1 Thes. 5:23). Everyone has a physical body, which the Bible calls the outer man (2 Cor. 4:16). Our physical body is for us to contact the material world. Within our body is our psychological being, which the Bible refers to as our soul. The functions of the soul include thinking and remembering, loving and hating, and making judgments and decisions. In addition to our body and our soul we also have a spirit, which is our deepest part. The pursuit of human life is to gain satisfaction in these three parts. Our body needs food and clothing. After we are fed and warm, our soul needs amusement. Pursuing knowledge, listening to music, and so forth, are for the satisfaction of our soul. Nevertheless, even after gaining such things, there is still a thirst, a longing, in man&rsquo;s deepest part, which is deeper than his body and his soul. This part is represented mainly by the conscience, which is a part of the human spirit.</p>
<p>Our spirit is the innermost part of our being. Only God can satisfy the longing in our spirit. As soon as we believe in the Lord Jesus, He enters into our spirit to be our satisfaction. God is Spirit, and we also have a spirit (John 4:24). Hence, these two spirits match each other and can respond to each other. The chorus of hymn #450 in the Chinese hymnal says, &ldquo;Spirit begets spirit.&rdquo; This means that God the Spirit enters into our spirit and gives birth to, or begets, our spirit. Formerly, our spirit was inactive, asleep, dormant, and deadened. However, when we believed in the Lord Jesus and were washed by His precious blood, the Spirit entered into our spirit to awaken and enliven our dormant and deadened spirit thereby regenerating our spirit (3:3-8).</p>
<p>After entering into us, the Spirit remains in us to be with our spirit and even becomes one spirit with us. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; As soon as we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were joined to Him and became one with Him. God is not only outside of us as our Lord for us to worship; He is the Spirit and has entered into our spirit to be joined to us and mingled with us as one spirit. He is in us as our life. From the day that we believed in the Lord, He has been living in us. Hence, as believers, we have our natural life and also the life that we received from God when we were regenerated. This life is the Spirit, and this life is God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
