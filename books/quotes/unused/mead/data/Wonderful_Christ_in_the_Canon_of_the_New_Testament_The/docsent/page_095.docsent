   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE HARVEST OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Rev 21:1-21 THE ETERNAL HOLY OF HOLIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Revelation is a book of symbols, so to understand this book, we need to find the real meaning of all the symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is also a book that reaps all the seeds of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must use these principles in understanding the New Jerusalem in chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first thing we need to see is that this city is square, with three equal dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The length, the width, and the height are all identical.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament, there is only one thing that has three equal dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is the innermost part of God s dwelling place, the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the tabernacle, the Holy of Holies is ten cubits wide, ten cubits long, and ten cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the temple built by Solomon, the width, length, and height of the Holy of Holies are twenty cubits 1 Kings 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this we understand that the whole New Jerusalem is the eternal Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That is why there is no temple in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The whole city is the temple, twelve thousand furlongs, by twelve thousand furlongs, by twelve thousand furlongs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that this city is one thousand times the total mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is altogether a mingling of God with man, and this mingling will be God s eternal Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God does not desire any kind of habitation in the heavens or on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only is the earth not satisfactory for God s habitation, even the heavens do not satisfy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s desire is to have a habitation of Himself mingled with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, God wants His chosen people to be His habitation by being mingled with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the real church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church life is neither a building nor a place, but a group of God s chosen people mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more mingling we have, the more we will be God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>AN INWARD METABOLISM</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The mingling of God with man is the real meaning of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Transformation is the divine essence coming into us to replace the fallen human element.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are human, but the divine elements are coming into our being to replace our natural essence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what the New Testament calls transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Transformation is not an outward change, but an inward metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Metabolism is an inward change caused by a new element replacing the old.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is God s work today, and this is the work the indwelling Christ is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is also the reason that teachings, doctrines, forms, and regulations never work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Teachings may correct you, and regulations may improve you somewhat, but they can never metabolize you; they can never transform you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The metabolic process in our physical bodies takes place with the eating of food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we eat day by day, something new comes into our body to replace the old.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the old things are discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The body s health depends upon this kind of metabolization.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus is transforming us!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Day by day He is metabolizing us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>RELIGIOUS VEILS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be transformed we need an unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we all with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>. All the veils keep us from being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most of the time our veils are our old concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They may be good and wonderful, but they are old.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord is new and fresh every day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is moving on!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we still hold on to our old concepts, we will have veiled faces.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These things may have been good ten years ago, or even two years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the Lord is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Old Testament, the Lord charged His people to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He also charged them to keep the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Jews became so accustomed to these things that they could never give them up.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then one day the very God who gave them these commandments came to them in a very mysterious way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He came in the form of a little child born in a manger at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If He had come in a glorious way with two camps of angels escorting Him, all the people of Israel would have received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But because He came in such a manner, they missed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Who could believe that this little child was the very God?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet Isaiah 9:6 tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A child is born, yet His name is called the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Jews paid all their attention to the verses concerning circumcision and the keeping of the Sabbath, but they missed Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If they had heeded this verse, surely they would have been watching for such a child to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the wise men came from the East, they might have been clear that this was the fulfillment of Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When Jesus came to the Jews, He completely disregarded the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He told them that He was the Lord of the Sabbath!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If they have Him, they have the Sabbath, and if they do not have Him, they miss the Sabbath Matt 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God s dealing with man is always improving.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Leviticus 11 tells clearly the things that can be eaten and the things that cannot be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even after Pentecost Peter still held onto that ancient, traditional teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It forced God to give Peter a vision to show him that what He had cleansed Peter should not call common or unclean Acts 10:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Peter was veiled by the old religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Apostle Paul was a typical Jewish religionist.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then the Lord within began to show him that circumcision was just an outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This was not easy for a typical Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But he was very bold to say, For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation Gal 6:15, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>. Some of us still hold onto something which veils us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some of my friends have told me that they cannot tolerate the noise in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But is this really wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>How many verses can you find about meeting in a silent way?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I cannot find one verse.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There are a few which tell us to be silent, but all of these are regarding God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to be silent if God is coming to judge!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But when we are meeting together, are we expecting to be judged by God?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We are meeting with joy!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Psalm 100:1 tells us to make a joyful noise unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is not just a voice, but a noise.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Do you think that the Lord really cares for all the silent religion?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Paul tells us that in the last days there is the danger that some will have the form of godliness without the power 2 Tim 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A mere form means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We need the reality!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The reality is just the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must forget about all the old, dead, traditional things, or they will become a veil to us.</S>
