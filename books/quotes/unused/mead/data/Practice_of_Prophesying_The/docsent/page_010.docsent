   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Based on Her Knowledge and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Experience of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The utterance of Mary's prophesying was based also upon her knowledge and experience of God, that is, on what God had done over her and for her.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 48-50 refer to God's dealing with Mary herself in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 48, Mary said, "Because He has looked upon the low estate of His slave."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mary considered herself to be not merely a maid but a slave to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, she considered her estate to be low because she was poor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mary was a descendant of David, but at that time she was a lowly virgin, not in Jerusalem or in Bethlehem, the city of David, but in Nazareth, a despised city in a despised region.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, God overshadowed her in her low estate, in her humble situation, and selected her to be the vessel for His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 48, Mary prophesied, saying, "For behold, from now on all generations will count me blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All generations have blessed Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God lifted her up from her low estate to a high position, to be "the mother of my Lord" v. 43 . A young woman from Nazareth was uplifted by God to be the mother of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 49, Mary continued, "...because the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is an indication that Mary believed in the word the angel spoke to her in verses 30-37.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 50, she continued, "And His mercy is unto generations and generations to those who fear Him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mary was a young woman who feared God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, God's mercy came to her as well as unto generations and generations of those who fear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The thought here is marvelous, and the composition, the expression, is very poetic.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mary was not a professor but a "country girl" from Nazareth, yet she could utter such a poetic prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a shame to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are not "country girls"; many of us have obtained college degrees, and some among us have earned Ph.D. degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, not many among us can compose such a meaningful and poetic prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Based on Her Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>of God's Dealing with People</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mary's prophesying was also based on her knowledge of God's dealing with people in general.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verses 47-50 speak of God's dealing with Mary in particular, whereas verses 51-53 concern the principles by which God deals with people in general.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verses 51-52 Mary said, "He has done mighty things with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He brought down potentates from thrones and exalted the humble."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is able to deal with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In view of the principles revealed in these verses concerning God's dealing with people, we should not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In his arrogance, Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, invaded Ethiopia in 1935.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, Hitler in his arrogance broke his promise to the British prime minister and invaded Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1939.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These events began the Second World War.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, God scattered these two exceedingly arrogant men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To this day no one knows the location of Hitler's corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God brought down potentates, including Mussolini and Hitler, from their thrones and exalted the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In history God has done this often.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 53 Mary continued, "He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He sent away empty."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To give good things is outward and objective, but to fill is inward and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has filled us with good things, and the rich He sent away empty not merely empty-handed, but empty inwardly and subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we consider ourselves rich, we shall be poor; we shall be empty in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if we are poor and are hungry, we shall be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Matthew 5:3 and 6 the Lord Jesus spoke according to this principle: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens...Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."</S>
