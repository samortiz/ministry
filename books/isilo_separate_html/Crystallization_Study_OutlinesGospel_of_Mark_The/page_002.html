<h1 class="title">The Slave of God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 10:45;<br />
Phil. 2:5-9; Isa. 42:1-4; 50:4-5, 7; Exo. 21:1-6</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The subject of the Gospel of Mark is the Slave of God as the Slave-Savior of sinners&mdash;10:45:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Mark&rsquo;s purpose is to provide a detailed record to show the beauty of the Lord Jesus as the Slave of God in His human virtues&mdash;5:34; 6:34; 8:23; 10:14-16.</li>
	<li>In New Testament usage, the word <em>slave</em> refers to one who has sold himself and has lost all human rights&mdash;Rom. 1:1; 2 Pet. 1:1; Jude 1; Rev. 1:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was a slave who had no rights.</li>
		<li>In His gospel service He was a slave not only to God but also to man&mdash;Matt. 20:28; Phil. 2:7; Acts 3:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>A key to understanding the Gospel of Mark is that in this Gospel we see much more of the Lord&rsquo;s acts than of His words&mdash;3:10-11; 4:39; cf. Acts 10:36-42.</li>
	<li>Mark&rsquo;s record concerning Christ as the Slave of God is a record of the Lord&rsquo;s excellent deeds, which displayed both His lovely humanity in its virtue and perfection and His deity in its glory and honor&mdash;1:14-15, 21-22, 25-26, 30-31, 38-41; 2:10-11; 7:31-37.</li>
	<li>Mark 10:45 reveals that, as the Slave of God, He served sinners even with His life, His soul; by giving His life as a ransom for sinners, the Lord Jesus accomplished the eternal purpose of God, whom He served as a slave.</li>
	<li>As the Slave of God, the Lord Jesus taught His disciples, at the very time they were striving to be first, to take the position of a slave&mdash;vv. 35-45.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the Gospel of Mark are the details of the teaching regarding Christ as the Slave of God in Philippians 2:5-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although the Lord was equal with God, He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped and retained; rather, He laid aside the form of God and emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave&mdash;vv. 6-7.</li>
	<li>In His incarnation the Lord Jesus did not alter His divine nature; He changed only His outward expression, from the form of God, the highest form, to that of a slave, the lowest form&mdash;v. 7.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s work in His human living to build up the fashion of a man and take on the form of a slave was the foundation and background of His ministry&mdash;v. 8a.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus humbled Himself, &ldquo;becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross,&rdquo; which was the climax of His humiliation&mdash;v. 8b.</li>
	<li>The Lord humbled Himself to the uttermost, but God exalted Him to the highest peak&mdash;v. 9.</li>
	<li>The pattern presented in Philippians 2:5-9 is now the life within us; there is an urgent need among us to experience Christ as such a pattern.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is the mind that was in Christ when He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, and humbled Himself, being found in fashion as a man&mdash;vv. 5-8.</li>
		<li>To have such a mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts, in His tender inward feeling and in His thinking&mdash;1:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the Gospel of Mark is the fulfillment of the detailed prophecies in Isaiah concerning Christ as the Slave of Jehovah; by considering these prophecies, we can understand more fully what is recorded in Mark concerning Christ as a slave:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus Christ, the Slave of God, was God&rsquo;s choice; God delighted in Him&mdash;Isa. 42:1.</li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s life was a life of sorrows and grief&mdash;53:2-3.</li>
	<li>Instead of crying out and making His voice heard in the street, He was calm and quiet; He did not strive with others or promote Himself&mdash;42:2; Matt. 12:18-21.</li>
	<li>Because He was full of mercy, He would not break those who are like a bruised reed, which cannot give a musical sound, or quench the ones who are like burning flax, which cannot give forth a shining light&mdash;Isa. 42:3-4.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus did not speak His own word, but having the tongue of the instructed, He spoke according to God&rsquo;s instructions&mdash;50:4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jehovah awakened Him every morning, awakening His ear to hear as an instructed one&mdash;v. 4b.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus was never rebellious; rather, He was always obedient, listening to the word of God&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		<li>Because the Lord Jesus had the ear and the tongue of an instructed one, He knew how &ldquo;to sustain the weary with a word&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Slave-Savior trusted in God and set His face like a flint; in fulfilling God&rsquo;s purpose, He was strong&mdash;v. 7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The servant in Exodus 21:1-6 is a type of Christ as the Slave of God, who sacrificed Himself to serve God and God&rsquo;s people&mdash;Matt. 20:28; Eph. 5:2, 25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the Slave of God, the Lord Jesus stood in the position of doing nothing on His own but acting only according to the word of the Father&mdash;Exo. 21:6; Psa. 40:6; John 5:19, 30, 36; 6:38; 7:16; 8:26; 12:49; 17:4.</li>
	<li>Love is the motive and the prerequisite for a slave&rsquo;s continual service (Exo. 21:5); because the Lord Jesus loved the Father (His Master&mdash;John 14:31), the church (His wife&mdash;Eph. 5:25), and all the believers (His children&mdash;Gal. 2:20b; Eph. 5:2), He was willing to serve as a slave.</li>
	<li>All who believe in Christ, belong to Him, and have His serving life should take Him as their pattern by learning to be slaves, loving God, the church, and God&rsquo;s people&mdash;Mark 10:42-45; Phil. 2:5-8; Gal. 5:13; Eph. 5:2; Rom. 1:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A slave does not care for his own interests but is always willing to empty himself, humble himself, lower himself, sacrifice himself, and serve others.</li>
		<li>As a slave of Christ and of God, Paul was willing to empty himself, humble himself, and sacrifice his rank, rights, and privileges&mdash;1 Cor. 9:19-23.</li>
		<li>Like Paul, we can become such slaves by the serving and sacrificing life of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 12:15; Phil. 2:17.</li>
		<li>In carrying out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we need to have the spirit of a slave, the love of a slave, and the obedience of a slave&mdash;v. 5; Rev. 22:3b.</li>
		</ol></li>
