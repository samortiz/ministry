   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CHURCH LIFE IN WHICH EVERYONE SERVES Passing On the Burden</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Every Brother and Sister</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a co-worker goes out to work and to build up a church, he should pass on all his work to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the beginning he may come with a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But gradually, the burden should be passed on to the shoulders of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose here is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, you would hold his hand and work together with him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gradually, you would pass on your work to him, while you stand beside him to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Up to a certain point, you can let go completely and transfer everything to his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do this, when you leave, you will not need to go through any transfer procedure, for all the things will have been passed on to him already.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1943, on April 12, I became ill.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Immediately, I conferred with the responsible brothers and made arrangements for the Lord's Day meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After this, I lay down on my bed and began to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the services were taken over by the brothers and sisters immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church at that time had many areas of service.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Offerings alone were classified under seven or eight categories.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There were many other kinds of work besides.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that time, we had about a thousand brothers and sisters, and business affairs were complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet all the saints divided up the work and proceeded in an orderly way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This lasts until today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A few years have elapsed, but today the brothers and sisters are still serving in the same way as they did then.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Example of the Church in Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here is how we divided up the services among the brothers and sisters in the church in Chefoo: one brother who was a postman was responsible for mopping the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He would come every Saturday to mop the floor, and he would find out in detail from the responsible brothers how to mop it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After he had found out the way from the responsible brothers, he would go about doing his work quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he completed his work, he would leave.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way, all the brothers and sisters learned to listen and to work without talking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the best kind of service.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One brother who worked in an insurance company was assigned to clean the windows.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At home, he had his own maid, and at work, he had people working for him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when he came to the meeting hall, he did everything with his own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to learn to start with the small chores.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the beginning, I washed the toilets.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later, other brothers and sisters joined me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One sister was responsible just for putting clean rags in a bin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every Saturday, some serving ones would come and pick up the rags for cleaning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After they finished their service, this sister would pick up the rags and bring them to be washed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some sisters in Shanghai are doing the same thing with the hospitality linens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not Replacing, but Perfecting the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I first came to Nanking, some brothers and sisters thought that I came to "run" the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I told them that I did not come to "run" the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, I came to give them trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I came to generate work for them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is true that I came with a burden, but this burden had to be passed on to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not think that because Brother Lee has come, everyone is now free.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The same is true in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This time, when I left Shanghai, I did it in such a way that I do not have to go back anymore, because all the responsibilities have been transferred over to the local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Western missionaries came to China, they came to "run" churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They monopolized everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They even solicited foreign money for them to "run" their churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not our way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are here to help the brothers and sisters to fulfill their functions.</S>
