The church and the eldership may be very familiar to us, yet we need some basic realization and understanding concerning them
The church is familiar to all of us, but not many Christians can speak adequately concerning what the church is to God and to Christ
When God was incarnated as the Man Jesus, He traveled and worked for three and a half years in Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem
Our God has a good pleasure to head up every part of His scattered creation in Christ through the channel of the church
The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does
Ephesians 5:29 says, 'For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church'
The church is one universally as the Body of Christ and one locally as the local testimony, the expression of Christ
Some people say that as long as we love the Lord and live Him, we can serve Him properly regardless of what ground we stand on
To them, as long as people love the Lord, serve the Lord, and even live the Lord, it is not wrong for them to meet in their own way
The elders, especially those who are somewhat new in the eldership, should get into all these points that they may know the church
They will know the truth, and their understanding, their attitude, and their standing, their ground, will be upright
The elders are not the rulers of the church lording it over the church but rather patterns of the flock taking the lead in the church life
The elders serve not by way of compulsion, but willingly, according to God; not seeking gain by base means, but eagerly
Some elders may not have a proper knowledge of the Lord's heart and may not have a message, a word, from the Lord to the church
The reward to the elders will be the unfading crown of glory, which they will receive at the manifestation of the Chief Shepherd
It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers' enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ
We should always be very concerned for our fellow members, and we should lead the new ones among us into the same condition of concern
When the new ones were saved, they realized that their salvation came to them through some Christians who were concerned for them
If no one had ever been concerned for them, some of them may never have heard the Lord's name and would not have been saved
The first responsibility of the elders is to always have an interest and concern for others' spiritual welfare
When the elders are very involved with the church's business affairs, the church does not have a promising future
In a corporation the general manager does not do the accounting or many other jobs; he simply manages them and assigns them to his employees
The elders must pick up a burden to contact people in this way and to assign all the business affairs to the serving ones
Many messages concerning the Spirit, the economy of God, and the dispensing of God have been released, but many have not entered into them
The principle is that all the elders should labor in the word and learn in order to be good ministers of Christ Jesus
After several contacts with an unbelieving person, we can eventually tell him that we have a real concern about his salvation
The elders must also learn to pray with a particular burden for the relationship with the Lord of those for whom they are concerned
The number of people the elders contact is the deciding factor of the condition of the church in their locality
It is very convenient, profitable, and necessary for them to contact people, especially the new ones, before and after the meetings
Nearly all the elders have accepted in theory the God-ordained way to meet and serve, but many do not practice it
As we have seen in the previous chapter, the elders must be apt to contact people and must build up the habit of contacting people
Lastly, the God-ordained way is to train the new ones to prophesy for the organic building up of the Body of Christ
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also the feeding and the raising up of the new members of the Body of Christ
After we gain people and disciple them into the kingdom, we have to feed them and raise them up as the new members of the Body of Christ
We have to endeavor to feed the new ones and raise them up, so that they may be the practical members of the Body of Christ
While a mother cares for her child, she trains him, and after a number of years, all his members function properly
The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also for the building up of the organic Body of Christ through prophesying
After graduation from high school, a person may study for four more years in college and then several more years for an advanced degree
Our gaining of people, however, should not be through rebuke or condemnation with any kind of negative spirit, attitude, and tone
We should spend a pleasant time with him, and in this time we will be able to pass on the proper knowledge of how to behave
These elders take Paul's word concerning the overseers and say that they must oversee how the saints are going on
An elder that can do many things in the church without being at one extreme or the other is a successful elder
He had no relief in his spirit until the good news came through Titus, telling him of the Corinthians' positive response
She learned the lesson of bearing the cross, and she learned the lesson of praying and of living in the light of the Lord's appearing
They must realize that this person needs the Lord, and they must be happy with him and try to give him an 'injection' of Christ
Many Christians contact people for the Lord, but they do not know what the purpose of their contact with others should be
The proper purpose in gaining people is firstly that they may be regenerated for the increase of the kingdom of God
If we see what the purpose of contacting people is, we will realize that we are short in our contact with others
Regardless of what we are, if we touch the building up of the Body of Christ, our entire being must be transformed
Even our experience in the church is not trustworthy, because in our experience many habitual things have been constituted into our being
All the points in this and the previous message should remind us of how we must be reconstituted to contact people in a proper way
As a result, what is in us in our contact with those who come to us is in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil
When a person speaks, we must discern what he says, not in the realm of who is right or wrong, good or evil, but in the realm of life
If we remain in the spirit rather than in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil, we will minister life to him in a pure and direct way
We will be saved from the realm of good and evil, and we will help the brother also to be saved from this realm
We must be full of discernment but outside of the realm of good and evil without criticizing, despising, and judging others
If we are in the spirit, full of life, we will be full of discernment, but we will have no criticizing, despising, or judging
We will be able to minister life to anyone who comes to us because we will not care to remain in the realm of good and evil
If we know the devices of Satan, we will not intensify a negative situation and cause it to be built into a worse issue
Whether or not we can do this depends on whether we are persons in the realm of good and evil or in the realm of life
In their contact with people, the elders must be full of love, concern, and sympathy in a meek and humble spirit
Visiting the persons involved in an issue and determining who is right and who is wrong exhausts the elders' time and energy
Otherwise, a small issue may be built into a major case in the church, like a small hill becoming a great mountain
It is not only a temptation but also a snare of Satan to try to deal in the realm of good and evil with a difficult case between two parties
Many of us upon hearing of a situation may simply charge the persons involved to be patient and exercise their love
The way to get out of the snare is to minister Christ to the persons and help them to realize they are short of Christ
The elders' contact with people is not to convince, to catch, or to arrest, but to recover, to bring people back to the Lord
Whereas there were only two or three parties involved in the problem at first, now the elders have become parties involved in the problem
When the leading ones in the church listen to a case, they must remember not to be snared by the knowledge of good and evil
When someone is in need, they should contact him several times, but they should not touch the matter of who is wrong and who is right
They will help him contact the Lord, and eventually they may have a chance to pray with him and bring him to the Lord in that prayer
When a local church has been established for a period of time, there will be some saints who do not come to the meetings
We have to shepherd all the saints, but if the Lord blesses us, there will be too many persons to take care of
If they do not receive Him after several contacts, we may discover that their situation is a hard case which may waste our time
He looks to see how many persons are under the care of the eldership, how they are doing, and how their growth, life, and daily living are
All the people in the church need the care of the elders, and the elders can only render care by contacting them
In contacting people, the elders must avoid superiority complex, argument, offense, or any form of humiliation
An elder may be fifty-five years old, and the one he contacts may be only fifteen, but the elder should not care for his status
Rather, the way to contact people is to try to find the opportunity to minister Christ to them, to give them an 'injection' of Christ
If we are not proper with those whom we contact, we will offend them and cause them to close their heart to us
Regardless of what one has done, if he comes to us, we should take the opportunity to minister something of life into him
We should go to him, not to talk about what he has done, but to take the opportunity to minister life and light into him
It is very good if an elder can be in a city for fifteen years and seemingly know nothing about anyone except how to minister Christ to them
When our eyes 'gain their sight,' our love diminishes, and when we know everything about our spouse, our love is spoiled
It would be marvelous if the elders could love everyone in the church life as much as they loved them in the first year they became an elder
In the beginning of our church life, we had a 'honeymoon,' but after a few years, certain saints may have even become our adversaries
It is easy for us to minister life to a brother we regard highly, but we may be cold and indifferent to another kind of brother
Corinthians 12627 says For you see your calling brothers that there are not many wise according to flesh not many powerful not many wellborn
God has chosen the foolish of the world that He might shame the wise and God has chosen the weak of the world that He might shame the strong
If we learn that certain persons are not good and as a result do not care for them, we lose the opportunity to minister Christ to them
We should care only to minister Christ to people and not care for quick results or for a person's situation or condition
The elders should also catch the proper time to dispense Christ, either with a quotation from the Bible or with a word of their inspiration
Brother Nee once said that to minister a special supply to people is easy, but to cause people to be hungry is hard
Question: How does one overcome in a situation in which he sees people's failures and his contact with people has become spoiled?
Only the Lord's grace and mercy can help people, so we must always do our best to minister His love, grace, and mercy to them
The church should be filled with love, grace, mercy, and lovingkindness through the ministering of Christ to others
When we are helping others to be recovered, we must remember that in nature and essence we are the same as they are
We all are sinful, and sometimes the Lord will allow us to be tested to show us that we are the same as others
Question: How can we resume fellowship with a brother who has a problem after we have ceased to contact him for a while?
Question If someone comes to us and tells us about his own failures should we stop him or listen to him and try to give him a helping word
If their speaking is criticism concerning others' failures, it is best to stop it, but we have to exercise our wisdom in doing so
Question When people come to speak about their problems is it proper to open the Word and show them how the Lord feels about their situation
We also must learn the lesson to be fearful and trembling, looking to the Lord whenever someone comes to us with a problem
They should try their best to simply minister Christ and the gospel with God's salvation, grace, love, mercy, and light in a pure way
If the elders consider in this way, they will always be able to get people saved and bring them into the church life in a remaining way
If the elders do not have a proper contact with people, those whom the saints bring to the church may not stay
We may think that we are holy, but when we get into the Lord's presence, our conscience tells us that we are not holy
Question: For the sake of time, is it proper to contact people by telephone, or do we need to visit them or have them into our homes?
We may or may not know a person's failures and sins, but if we minister Christ as life to him, Christ will care for him
The Lord wants to get the poor and crippled and blind and lame, and He even commands us to compel them to come in
In the Lord Jesus' earthly ministry, people complained a number of times about the kinds of people He contacted
Our natural being needs to be transformed to a spiritual being so that we can have the view, the sight, that the Triune God has
His asking for forgiveness was not based upon anything they had done, but upon the Lord's great compassion, His great mercy
We may pray this way at times, but deep within us, we always give ourselves a high evaluation and give others a low evaluation
We need to pray for our children, but we must be careful not to give our children a higher evaluation than others
The Lord answered them in this way: 'If you pray for others' children as you have done for your children, your children will be saved
The Corinthians were Greeks, who sought to be strong not only psychologically in philosophy but also physically in athletics
The Greeks were for being strong both mentally and physically, but in the church in Corinth, there were not many strong
The work of such 'heroes' who think that they are always right eventually issues not only in division but also in destruction
Experiences tell us that our evaluation of the believers in the church has turned out quite often to be the opposite
We may feel that he is good material to be an elder, but after five years he may no longer be attending the meetings
We may not think much of another brother, but five years later this brother may become very promising and useful in the Lord's hands
With the poor ones, He exercises His righteousness, and with the suffering, afflicted ones, He decides with equity
Our responsibility is to minister Christ to them just as Christ only ministers righteousness to the poor and equity to the afflicted
We must be persons who are thoroughly transfused and permeated with God, persons full of the Spirit as Christ was
If we still remember and are deeply impressed with his backsliding, this remembrance will reduce our usefulness in the hand of the Lord
Daniel 1 shows us how Daniel and his companions overcame the king, Nebuchadnezzar, in not eating the idolatrous diet
Although Daniel served the Lord in the midst of such a negative situation under a number of Gentile kings, he was not disappointed
Nearly all the elders, full-timers, and co-workers serve people according to their choice, their preference, and their evaluation
The entire congregation may be disgusted and disappointed with this speaking, but we should not be offended by it
After this person speaks, we should rise up to give an edifying, encouraging, life-giving word, without rebuking this person
We should be blind spiritually because we know no one according to the flesh; everyone who is in Christ is a new creation
Whether or not he will be promising, whether or not he will be good material for an elder or co-worker, we should leave to the Lord
If we had never done anything wrong in our contacting of people and in the evaluating of people we would be very successful in the eldership
The elders' spiritual responsibility in a church is firstly to bear fruit, to preach the gospel to gain sinners
After His resurrection, He charged His disciples, saying, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth
A persecution was raised up against the whole church in Jerusalem, and most of the disciples were scattered to preach the gospel
The apostle John stressed fruitbearing in his Gospel telling us that we are the branches of the divine vine the organism of the Triune God
We may think that the fruit-bearing branches in John's Gospel and the serving priests in Revelation are two different things
The apostle John told us that we, the New Testament believers, are priests, but he did not tell us what to offer
In Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a New Testament priest, offering the sinners saved from the nations as sacrifices to God
He also said that he was poured out as a drink offering and he charged all the New Testament saints to offer themselves as living sacrifices
After being saved, they become members of Christ, and since they are the members of the corporate Christ, we offer them as sacrifices to God
We have to go out to tell out God's virtues that people may be called out of their darkness into the marvelous light of God
For the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, the elders must redeem the time by budgeting it to make a weekly schedule for the gospel
George Muller prayed for many people, and only two of those he prayed for were still not saved at the time of his death
They must lead sinners to know God's salvation by man's believing in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, as his Savior and life
Of course, we should first say something to open up the sinner's mind, heart, and even his spirit, but then we must help him to pray
We must help people to exercise their spirit, and we ourselves must learn how to be properly connected to the Lord
It is most effective to lead a person to exercise his spirit by leading him to pray and assimilate a Bible verse concerning the gospel
When we have the sense that someone has touched the Lord, we should help him through some verses to have the assurance of salvation
Ephesians 320 says that the Lord is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power which operates in us
The recent events in Europe, Russia, and the Middle East have caused us to reconsider the Lord's move on the earth
In the twenty centuries since the Lord's incarnation, the Lord's move on the earth has always gone on according to the world situation
Julius Caesar conquered the Mediterranean areas of North Africa and the Holy Land a little over forty-five years before the birth of Christ
His adopted son, Augustus, defeated his opposition and became the first formal Caesar of the Roman Empire in 27 B
It also had much to do with the Lord's death, His resurrection, and the gospel's spread to produce the churches
Eventually, however, the Lord's recovery was brought into the English world for the spreading to all the continents
More recently, the satellite countries of Russia have abandoned Communism and have moved toward democratic governments
We should not allow Europe to be lost, but neither should we do anything in a quick way according to our natural thought
Because of the English language and the leadership of this nation, the Lord's recovery has spread quickly in the past quarter of a century
We should go not as individuals; we should go as a team of at least four, including a couple of age thirty or older as the core of the team
Soon there will be more business transactions between the United States and Germany, and more job opportunities will open up
If some remain in the United States, they will not be very useful, but if they go to Europe, they will become useful
We should struggle and be very energetic because we know that Satan's goal is to frustrate the spreading of the gospel
As New Testament believers, we must fulfill our priesthood to get sinners regenerated to become the members of the Body of Christ
The Lord Jesus said that we believers are the branches of this vine, and the branches of this vine are for bearing fruit
We have many things today, including Bible reading, Bible study, and prayers, but the one thing we lack is fruit-bearing
If we do not have fruit-bearing, we cannot have the increase, and if we do not have the increase, we cannot build up the Body of Christ
In order to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we must build up a habit of the normal way for the spreading of the gospel
Often, the natural way of gospel preaching is to invite a good evangelist, a top speaker, who has much knowledge concerning the gospel
Most of our relatives who are brought to the Lord by our personal contact over the years will be good preachers to bring others to the Lord
The proper meaning of visiting people for the gospel by knocking on their doors is to have personal contact with people
If we have close relatives, we should spend our time, heart, and energy on them; we do not need to knock on new doors
If only one-third of the attendants in the church life pick up the burden to do this, we will have a thirty to sixty percent increase
The Lord Jesus eventually showed the immoral woman the need to exercise her spirit to contact God as the living water
We may know how to teach or instruct people, but we have not learned the way to enliven them in our contact with them
We must be like electricians who know how to make the proper connections to bring the electricity directly to a person in need
It is crucial that we firstly change our way from bringing people to good speakers or meetings to contacting them personally
It is also crucial that we learn to contact people again and again waiting for a chance to enliven them to connect them to the electricity
If we have this skill, we will realize how to touch the conscience of those like the Samaritan woman to make them desperate
We will know how to point out that even in their confession of sins, they must exercise their spirit to contact God as the Spirit
The first step of the God-ordained way is the preaching of the gospel according to the New Testament priesthood of the gospel
In addition to bringing this God-ordained way to all the churches, we are burdened for the release of the truth
We should restrict our time with them in the morning to pray-reading the Word and having a little fellowship about the enjoyment of Christ
When we visit them, we should not speak too much of the truth to them, nor should we try to gain them in a quick way
For the preaching of the gospel, the feeding of the new believers, and the perfecting of the saints, we must visit people
We have been very busy meeting taking care of the church and managing the church but it seems that there has been little result to our labor
Just like in fighting with new weapons, we can win the battle for the increase of the church with the 'new weapon' of visiting people
Many Christians today do not know that the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, is a life-giving Spirit and that we have a regenerated spirit
The first meal we have to feed the new believers with is that our Savior today is a life-giving Spirit and that we have a spirit
They also need to realize that they should always exercise their spirit by prayer to contact the Lord, the Spirit
We are weak and low in our spiritual life because we do not continually exercise our spirit by prayer to contact the Lord
When we pray we may subconsciously have the thought that the Lord is merely sitting on the throne in the heavens
Although this is true, we should also have the consciousness that we are praying to the One who is in us and who is one spirit with us
The last empire, the Roman Empire, is signified by the legs of iron and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay
Roman culture may be considered as a consummated culture, which is composed of Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman law and politics
All the elders should keep morning watch and should also practice having morning watch with others on the phone
There is the urgent need everywhere to help and to stir up the saints to participate in this new way of morning watch
The way to raise up the new believers is to nourish them that they may have the growth in life which issues in the daily salvation
The full-timers among us should spend ninety percent of their time for visiting, going to see people again and again
The ones whom we perfect will be brought into the fourth step of prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ
The God-ordained way as revealed in the Bible is the proper practice of the church life against the papal and clergy-laity systems
There are those among us who think that there is not much difference between us and the denominational churches
During the time of my ministry outside of mainland China in the past forty years, there have been at least three divisions caused among us
We have outwardly come out of the Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations, but we still carry and walk in these two systems
The real significance of the pope is in the papal system, and the real control of the saints is in the clergy-laity system
Spontaneously, they kill and annul all the members of the Body of Christ by depending on a class of people called the clergy
It is not normal for only a small number of the members of a person's body to function while all the rest are paralyzed
Where is such a corporate man, comprising the living, active, functioning members of the Body of Christ to fulfill the purpose of God?
Mostly what is considered in Christianity is the work of gaining sinners, winning souls, to build up a congregation
We are still carrying, probably unintentionally and subconsciously, the philosophy of these systems with us in whatever we do
We should be perfecting all the members of the Body and equipping all the parts of the new man but we do not do much perfecting or equipping
In our elders' training thus far, we have seen that we need to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel
We should practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel to present and offer saved sinners as sacrifices to God
The practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel does not depend mainly upon gatherings with good speakers
In Christianity a small number of the ones who are brought to Christ go to seminaries to learn how to be the clergy
A Chinese person who has moved to the United States may use chopsticks ninety percent of the time and a fork only ten percent of the time
Of doing this, though, many of us are occupied with other things which we think are necessary for the managing of the church
They are not group meetings which are practiced according to the New Testament teaching, especially in Hebrews 10:24-25
The co-workers and elders should learn how to contact individual saints to fellowship with them particularly concerning the group meetings
The full-timers need to spend all of their time getting themselves educated in the holy Word and contacting people
Within a period of one or two years, they should be able to do the same thing that we are doing in our service to the Lord
We are weak and very short in our practice of the church life today because we do not have the proper group meetings in mutuality
He may not be able to answer my question adequately, but whether an answer is adequate or not is a matter of degree
Paul encouraged the saints to pursue love and to earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but he especially encouraged them to prophesy
To prophesy according to 1 Corinthians 14:31 is not something which comes down upon a person suddenly in a meeting
In order to help the saints to learn how to prophesy, we published the books entitled The Holy Word for Morning Revival
The notes in the Recovery Version and the Life-study messages can help us to enter into the divine revelation in the holy Word
Learning to prophesy requires our labor on the Word with the help of the proper exposition that opens up the Word
The elders have to spend a great deal of time to stir up the brothers and sisters to have a heart to learn to prophesy
In one locality, some of the Chinese-speaking sisters have been burdened to teach some of the other sisters to prophesy
Once her prophecy has been corrected, she comes to the meeting and anxiously waits for an opportunity to speak
If all the brothers and sisters in the different localities would have such a spirit, the meetings would be very high
In some places, the attendance on the Lord's Day is one hundred, but the attendance of the prayer meeting is less than thirty
The work of the full-timers, if they are really capable, is to show others a pattern and to develop others so that the others can do more
The reason for my concern is that the brothers have often told me Brother Lee thank the Lord for the fulltimers who have come to help us
Saints who are not fulltime have a job and may have a family so they do not have a great deal of time to invest in the Lords work directly
Take the opportunity to fellowship with the saints about the Lord's interest on earth, and take the time to have a little prayer with them
If we are not in one accord, we are through with the oneness of the Body, and the blessing in the church and in the work will be gone
In order to keep a good, excellent, and beautiful order in the church, the elders should remember to avoid three things
Peter 5:5 says, 'In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders, and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another'
Not only should the younger ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the younger ones
The elders need to set up a pattern by taking the lead to serve and care for the church so that the believers may follow
We need Your Spirit, the Spirit of grace, and even the Spirit of supplication, that we may pray to You to receive Yourself as our grace
Lord, we like these three names in Zechariah 1:1 at an appointed time Jehovah will bless and Jehovah will remember
Paul's charge to us is that the 'new hands' should be considered carefully before being brought into the realm, the circle, of the eldership
About eighty percent of the brilliant young ones whom the Lord brought into our realm were spoiled by their pride
If we had fifty co-workers who would be able to go to help meet the present demand, it still would not be sufficient
Some brothers there promised us that they had the means to distribute these books all the way from Moscow to Vladivostok
Throughout the years, we have had many promising young ones, many crops, but when they were growing up, they got cut off by their pride
The middleaged brothers after staying in the Lords recovery about eighteen to twenty years may consider themselves as heroes in the recovery
Pride, the thought of being a hero, and opinions have been used by the enemy among us in the past seventy years
There may be three brothers in the eldership in a certain locality one is older, one is younger, and the other one is middle-aged
My burden in this elders' meeting is to try my best to fellowship with you all concerning the real problem among us today
Pride, the thought of being a hero, and opinions are the factors working something out secretly to damage one thing the Body of Christ
Christ does have a Body, but in practicality this Body has been crippled, annulled, and to some extent destroyed
If you have one of these three problems pride, the thought of being a hero, or opinions in practicality the Body is absent in your locality
In doctrine, it may not seem so good to say that the Spirit is the Body, but in actuality the Spirit is the Body
Locality as the church ground of a local church separates the church in existence but does not divide the church in essence
The saints who live in Atlanta have to be the church there, and the brothers and sisters in Anaheim have to be the church here
The churches in the Gentile world had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in solving the problems in teaching
The churches in the Gentile world also had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in supplying the physical need
The apostle Paul was endeavoring to raise up financial help, physical help, from the Gentile saints for the Jewish saints
Although the Spirit inspired the saints to warn him not to go to Jerusalem, he said that he did not care for his life
Since some of the Corinthian saints said this that is a strong evidence that Peters ministry and teaching were accepted by the Gentile world
The co-workers in the Jewish world and those in the Gentile world had pleasant and sweet fellowship with one another
All the above points show that all the co-workers in all the regions should do the same one work universally for the unique Body
There is a practical situation that is abnormal, and the biggest point of this abnormality is the different works
Thank the Lord that due to the riches of the truth, the Lord's recovery is being welcomed everywhere on the earth
In Paul's time, because of the lack of modern transportation and communication, it would have been logical to have the work divided
If we want to be those who are in the practicality of the Body we need to keep the oneness of the Body and maintain a good order in the Body
In our fellowship in this message, we want to address a few problems which have been existing among us for years
Until these problems are solved and removed, the church life will not have much peace, and the recovery will be greatly devastated
The source, or the root, of this present turmoil is the carelessness in our regard for the oneness of the Body
Through the formation of these national churches and the Protestant denominations, the oneness was slaughtered
Based upon this principle, the Presbyterian church came into existence because some desired to keep the truth of the presbytery
In the eighteenth century, Zinzendorf took the lead in the recovery of the initial stage of the church life in the unity of the Holy Spirit
The China Inland Mission which he formed was a mission established for going into the interior of China to save sinners
Despite what Hudson Taylor endeavored to do, China Inland Mission churches were eventually formed, established, and built up
Darby argued that such people might be spiritual but because they still remained in the denominations they had to be called evil companions
Brother Austin-Sparks said strongly that the ones who have more of Christ are the ones who are more the church
He visited us again in 1957, and this is when the problem with him arose over the truth concerning the ground of the church
Paul and Peter encountered the trouble concerning circumcision recorded in Acts 15, but they did not have any division
Even if the accusations they made were true, however, that cannot be built up as a case to justify their division
One of the tests of a genuine local church is that it should have universal fellowship with all the other local churches
Later they began to say that once an apostle establishes churches and appoints elders in them he should keep his hands off of these churches
To keep the oneness of the Body is actually to keep the oneness of the Spirit because the Spirit is the reality and the essence of the Body
Ephesians 4:2 says that we need to keep the oneness with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love
When a problem arose concerning circumcision, Paul and the brothers with him took care of it in the proper way
By taking care of Christ and by taking care of His Body, we will avoid division, keep the oneness, and maintain a good order in the Body
Let us come together with an open spirit to pray together, get into the Word, and check our situation with the Word in fellowship
To keep a pleasant, good, and beautiful order in the recovery, we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ
Not only should the younger ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the younger ones
If you do not care for what they have taught or done in the past and teach according to your preference, you will make trouble
For a brother to speak and the rest listen every Lord's Day in the church meetings annuls the functioning of the saints
If only a few brothers speak all the time, the riches in all the members of the Body of Christ cannot be released
The entire world, especially eastern Europe and Russia, is open to the truths which have been released in the Lord's recovery
We have seen from the training on Zechariah that when the Lord comes back, the remnant of Israel will have learned the lessons
We should respect one another, help one another, perfect one another in life, and complete one another in work
At His coming back we will be rewarded, and we will be His bride to match Him and to fight the war against Antichrist
After the recent training on Daniel and Zechariah, the view in the Bible, the divine revelation, is so clear to us
We should go on with our Christ, who is God's centrality and universality, so that we can fulfill His heart's desire
