<h2 class="head2">D. Making a Fleshly Proposal to Her Husband</h2>
<p>However, Sarah, who submitted herself to her husband, is a negative model in the matter of proposing that her husband take Hagar as a concubine (Gen. 16:1-3). God had repeatedly promised Abraham that he would have a seed and that he would personally bring forth a son (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 15:4-5), yet Sarah was not able to bear children. Because of this, she proposed to Abraham that he should go in to her maid, Hagar, to have a son through her (Gen. 16:2). This was altogether a proposal of the flesh. Eventually, Abraham accepted Sarah&rsquo;s proposal, took Hagar as his concubine, and begot Ishmael through her (Gen. 16:15). This is a warning to all women who hope in God, namely, that they should not make any proposals according to the flesh to their husbands; and it is a warning to the husbands also, namely, that they should not listen to the fleshly proposals of their wives. Otherwise, they will produce &ldquo;Ishmaels&rdquo; out of their flesh, who will lust against the &ldquo;Isaacs&rdquo; born of God&rsquo;s promise. This is to sow according to the flesh and reap corruption of the flesh; for whatever a man sows, this he shall also reap (Gal. 6:8, 7).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. REBEKAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Symbolizing the Church,<br />
Which Comes Out of Grace</h2>
<p>Sarah symbolizes grace, which produces the believers for the constituting of the church, whereas Rebekah symbolizes the church, which is produced by grace. Grace comes out of God the Father (2 Tim. 1:9), and the church belongs to Christ (1 Cor. 3:23) and is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). In Rebekah we can see that the church, symbolized by Rebekah, has the following four characteristics.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Chosen by the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Rebekah was chosen to be the wife of Isaac by the old servant, who was sent forth by Isaac&rsquo;s father, Abraham, to the land where Abraham was called by God (Gen. 24:1-4). When Abraham was old and well advanced in age, he said to the oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, &ldquo;Thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.&rdquo; Here Abraham typifies God the Father, the old servant typifies the Holy Spirit, Isaac typifies Christ, and Abraham&rsquo;s country and kindred indicate the place of fallen men and the fallen human race, respectively. Therefore, Abraham&rsquo;s finding a wife for his son signifies that the church is chosen for Christ out of the fallen people by the Holy Spirit, who was sent by God the Father to the place of fallen men.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Receiving Gifts from the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>As the old servant had hoped, Rebekah gave him a drink and also drew water for his ten camels. So the old servant took a golden ring and two golden bracelets and gave them to Rebekah (Gen. 24:17-22). Afterward, when the old servant went to her house, he brought forth more articles of silver and of gold, and raiment, and gave them to her (Gen. 24:53). The golden ring of half a shekel typifies the Holy Spirit as our foretaste. The two golden bracelets of ten shekels put on her hands typify that the gift of life that we have received of the Holy Spirit can fulfill the requirements of God&rsquo;s commandments and fully carry out the divine function. And the articles of silver, the articles of gold, and the raiment signify the riches of Christ. Therefore, Rebekah&rsquo;s receiving of the golden ring, the golden bracelets, and more articles of silver and of gold, and raiment, signify the church&rsquo;s receiving of the Holy Spirit and the gift of life from the Holy Spirit, and its enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Leaving Its Close Relatives and the World</h2>
<p>After Rebekah received and enjoyed the riches, the old servant wanted to go back immediately to his master&rsquo;s place. Rebekah&rsquo;s brother and mother considered keeping them there for a few more days, but Rebekah was willing to leave her father&rsquo;s house and her country immediately and go forth to the land of God&rsquo;s promise to be Isaac&rsquo;s wife. So they sent her and Abraham&rsquo;s servant and his men away (Gen. 24:54-59). This signifies the church&rsquo;s willingness to be separated from its relatives in the flesh and from the world.</p>
