   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Issue No. 6 THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am writing this from Kulangsu, Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The month before last, I was invited to work here in southern Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But due to the fact that the next issue of the magazine was not yet ready and due to my physical weakness, I was not able to come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The week before last, in my prayer, the Lord showed me clearly that I should come.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, three days ago, I came here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now I am preaching the Lord's gospel to the students and the "nominal members" of the Gospel Hall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The impression I have here is the same as elsewhere: man always tries to be saved through his own good works!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although such ones always fail and know that they are not trustworthy, they still look to themselves and would not trust fully in God's grace!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not strange to a fleshly person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What they see and think is not grace at all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have never thought about God's love!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more I travel in my preaching itinerary the more I realize that everywhere, men need the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We who have received His salvation should try our best to spread God's gospel of grace so that sinners, the ones who are incapable of doing any good and who know that they are hopeless, may believe and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our job is to preach clearly God's free grace in the power of the Holy Spirit so that many disappointed and downtrodden sinners may have the hope of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Praise God that salvation has been accomplished!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This issue may be thinner than the previous issues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is because the articles for the first column are finished, and I have left it open without filling in with something else.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition, I had to travel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, there were fewer pages.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From here, the Lord willing, I still want to go to Tungan, Changchow, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that you would not forget to pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The next two issues will probably have to be prepared while I am traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Please do not neglect praying for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We thank and praise our Father that the subscriptions for The Christian have been increasing day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I also thank many of my readers for their great effort in promoting this magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are more and more modernists in the churches today, and there are several publications that are testifying for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you have not introduced this paper to others before, we request that you would spend a little time and energy today to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Introduce this magazine to your pastors, your church members, your classmates, and your friends that they may receive the service of The Christian also.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May the Lord be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Watchman, in Amoy</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>April 1</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Issue No. 7 THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have been away for about two months, traveling in such places as Amoy, Kulangsu, Tungan, and Changchow, and have now returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of the weakness of my health, I was not able to finish this issue until the week before last.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would ask my readers to pardon me for the delay.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This time we have received more new subscriptions from southern Fukien, and we have sent out the magazines to them according to their order.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there is anyone who has paid but has not received their copy, please write to us to inform us so that we can forward the same to you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many readers sent in seventy cents after January.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the price, they will receive only eight issues.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the seventh issue of this year already, and your subscription will be over after the next issue.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you want to continue the subscription, please send us the money so that we can continue the service.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, we will have to discontinue the mailing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people think that it is inconvenient to send money to us because the post office is not issuing postal money orders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here is an alternate way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those in places which do not take postal money orders can buy a cashiers check from a foreign bank, or they can spend five cents to send the money to us by mail.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course, if postal money orders can be bought in your place, you do not need to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We hope that the readers whose subscriptions are about to expire will not delay and will send in the money orders right away to renew the subscriptions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our magazine has greatly increased in circulation within the last few months.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At present, our Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>3 and 4 are completely out, and the other issues have only a few hundred copies left.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who want back issues should write to us right away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Summer is about to come, and everywhere there are summer camps and other retreats.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope that the readers of The Christian would take this opportunity to introduce this magazine to all the attendants so that this paper can serve more Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, students everywhere are now being affected by the modernists, and they do not understand what salvation is.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope that the pastors and teachers everywhere will introduce this paper to the students you know so that God will save and edify them through this magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Please do not forget to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The synopsis of Revelation should have been published long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But due to my busy schedule, I could not put in the additional material that I wanted to put in, and the book is not yet published.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Finally, I fully realize that I am but a sinner saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>My thoughts and my ways have many imperfections before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The one I hate the most is myself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>O God, be merciful to this useless servant!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Please pray for me so that wherever I go, I can walk according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Pray that God would lead me to do what I should do this summer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For now, my future is full of thorns, and I do not know what I should do in the way ahead of me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Please do not neglect remembering me before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord willing, we will see you again next month.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Watchman, in Ma-Kiang</S>
