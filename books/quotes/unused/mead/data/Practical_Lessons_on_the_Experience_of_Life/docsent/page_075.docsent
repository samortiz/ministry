   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSFORMATION NEEDED FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To have the church is a matter not only of growth but of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to build the church we must be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Human beings were made from clay.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Originally, Peter was a piece of clay, but when he received Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the Lord immediately changed his name to Peter, a stone John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The clay was transformed into stone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Revelation 21 we see that Peter becomes not only a stone but a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The name of Peter is written on the foundation of precious stone vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>14, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we are regenerated, we are first transformed from a piece of clay into a piece of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After this we are transformed in our soul, and eventually at the Lord's coming we will be transfigured in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we will be precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even a pearl is something that has been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I did not make up the word transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Romans 12, before the apostle brings us into the reality of the Body life, he tells us to do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first is to offer ourselves bodily for the Body, and the other is to be transformed by the renewing of the mind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our spirit has been regenerated, but our soul still remains old.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must have our soul transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In these two verses we can see that the building of the church depends on our real consecration and the transformation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can never be built up as pieces of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even if we are stone within, the stone is still covered by clay; as such, we cannot be built together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we need transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same word for transformation is in 2 Corinthians 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 17 says, "And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then verse 18 says that we are being "transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have seen, in the parables of Matthew 13 there is the view of life, growth, and transformation to produce the building materials.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1 Corinthians 3, the apostle has the same thought that the Lord Jesus had in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul says that we are the cultivated land of God, that we need the seed to be planted and to grow 1 Cor 3:6, 9a .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then on the other hand, he says we are the building of God, built with precious stones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>9b, 12a .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore in Matthew 13 and 1 Corinthians 3 we can see the consistency of the divine thought: Life is sown into us to grow and to cause transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE PRACTICAL NEED TO PLANT AND WATER FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now I must speak something practical.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a local church, we must have Christ planted into people as the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do not oppose teachings and gifts; I simply care for how much of Christ has been sown into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How much of Christ has been planted?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need the sowing of Christ as the seed of life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There must be the planting of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The apostle Paul said, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth" 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do we have the watering and the growth?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mothers know that after they have a baby, they must feed the baby.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the first week, she feeds the baby one way; then in the second week, second month, and second half year she still knows the right way to feed the baby.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A mother knows how to feed a baby to make him grow, but in the church today do we know how to help people to grow?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do we ourselves know how to grow?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have learned much by visiting many places where there were many seeking ones coming together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the first year of their coming together, the situation among them was not clear, but after two or three years everything was exposed and brought to the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In all these meetings almost no one has any idea or knowledge of how to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We praise the Lord, however, that He has brought many of these people to the point that they realize they need something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are only two ways to build up a church, or a so-called church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One way is to organize; this is the organizing system.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the denominations, including the Roman Catholic Church, depend on the organizing system.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as they have the best organizing regulations and a strong, proper character for organizing, this so-called church will flourish.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It will be built up not by life but by organizing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the wrong way; it is the worldly, human way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The proper and spiritual way is to build up the church by life and the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This requires us to know how to sow Christ into people and know how to grow in Christ and how to help others to grow in Christ.</S>
