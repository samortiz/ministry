	 <h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>Among the saints in Taipei there are at least several thousand household units, and all of these households have children. When we say children, we are referring to young people between the ages of six and twelve, that is, elementary school students from first through sixth grade. We believe that there are more than two thousand children of this age group among us. There are also many children in the households of our neighbors, friends, relatives, colleagues, and classmates. We should not do a work merely among the children in the church. Our work must include the children outside the church. This is the children&rsquo;s gospel work. The inhabitants of this island would be happy for their children to know the Lord&rsquo;s truth and gain genuine benefits. This is a great matter, and we must do our best to promote it. By next summer, or at the latest by the end of next year, the church in Taipei can have at least five thousand children who are under the teaching of the brothers and sisters and who are listening to the truth every week.</p>
<p>We might have only one thousand children, but we hope that after one year or less we can have five thousand children. The children who are presently six years old will graduate from college in sixteen years, and the children who are twelve years old will graduate from college in ten years. If we continue the children&rsquo;s work, we will be unable to estimate the long-term results. After the children are saved and graduate from elementary school, they will be gospel seeds in junior high school; after they graduate from junior high school, they will be gospel seeds in high school; and after they graduate from high school, they will be gospel seeds in college. If we labor on the children, our numbers will continually grow. We believe that if we start with five thousand children and continue this work for fifteen or sixteen years, more than ten or twenty thousand young people will be brought in as a result of the children&rsquo;s work. That is a significant number.</p>
<p>The ones who are saved through our young people will be both stable and remaining, because they will have heard the gospel in their youth and would continue to hear the truth until they graduate from college. Upon their graduation from college, they will be a group of young Christians who are cultivated in and equipped with the truth. Therefore, this is a great and important work. May many brothers and sisters, including the students and especially those in college, give themselves to the Lord, and may they have a desire to bear the responsibility to serve in the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>It is not enough to have children&rsquo;s meetings merely in the meeting halls. We need more brothers and sisters who are willing to open their homes. There should not be too many children in one meeting. At the most, there should be twenty to twenty-five children meeting in a saint&rsquo;s home. Furthermore, the children&rsquo;s meetings do not have to be only on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. If we have them on Saturday or any other day of the week, every district will have many homes for the children&rsquo;s meetings every week. If our goal is to gain five thousand children, we need two hundred fifty children&rsquo;s meetings. If every meeting has twenty children, there will be five thousand children in two hundred and fifty meetings. It would be wonderful if these meetings were in the homes of the saints and in the meeting halls.</p>
<p>We also need a group of brothers and sisters to teach the children. Every meeting would need three brothers and sisters as teachers. If there are two hundred fifty meetings, we immediately need seven hundred fifty college-age brothers and sisters to bear this responsibility. The saints need to be encouraged so that the teaching is done in a manner that is rich, living, and high. We will certainly be able to bring in excellent material through the gospel in the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL WORK</h2>
<p>Our brothers and sisters are at all levels of society. They work in every profession, in companies, in hospitals, and in government offices. These saints should endeavor to bear the work of the gospel. The community gospel is another great work that requires the help of the full-time co-workers to promote it and to be involved in it.</p>
<p>I hope that all the churches in Taiwan, regardless of their size, will divide into small groups. Through the small groups we will recover the dormant saints and preach the gospel in the community from house to house. We will also begin the campus work and the children&rsquo;s work. If we are faithful and work together to carry out these matters and accomplish them, I believe that within half a year twenty thousand brothers and sisters on the island of Taiwan will be going on positively in a church life that involves recovering the dormant saints and gaining new ones.</p>
