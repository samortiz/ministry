On one hand, the Lord answered, &#147;You said it!&#148; Yet, on the other hand, He still called Himself &#147;the Son of Man,&#148; holding firmly to His human status.</p><p>Besides this, His birth, His living and actions on earth all prove that He is a man: Philip saw Him as &#147;the son of Joseph, from Nazareth,&#148; a real man (John 1:45). And coming into His own country, His own people called Him &#147;this man.&#148; They knew that He was &#147;the carpenter&#8217;s son,&#148; and that He had a &#147;mother,&#148; &#147;brothers,&#148; and &#147;sisters&#148; (Matt. 13:54-56). These facts strongly prove that He is absolutely a man, not a bit different from an ordinary man. He reclined at the table and ate with men just like an ordinary man (Matt. 9:10-11; Luke 7:36; John 12:2). When He was crucified, the soldiers divided His garments (John 19:23-24), thus proving that He put on clothing just like a normal human being. He, &#147;being wearied from the journey&#148; and being thirsty, asked a woman for a drink (John 4:6-7). He &#147;wept&#148; as did those who were present at that time (John 11:33, 35). He &#147;laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself...poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded&#148; (John 13:4-5). All these actions prove that He is absolutely a man.</p><p>The Lord was a man, not only while He was on earth before His death, but even after His resurrection, His ascension to heaven, and His coming again in the future, He still is and forever will be a man in eternity. After His resurrection He appeared to His disciples and said to them, &#147;Behold my hands and my feet....Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me have. And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet....And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of a honeycomb. And he took it, and did eat before them&#148; (Luke 24:39-43). This proves that after His resurrection He is still a man, has flesh and bones, and eats like a man. He told the high priest, &#147;Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power&#148; (Matt. 26:64). This means after ascending to heaven, He is still a man. He told His disciples, &#147;For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels&#148; (Matt. 16:27). Again, in Matthew 26:64 He says, &#147;You shall see the Son of Man...coming on the clouds of heaven.&#148; This means when He comes again in the future He is still a man. He said to Nathanael, &#147;You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man&#148; (John 1:51). This describes His condition in the future, in eternity. He still is the Son of Man; He still is man unto eternity.</p><p>In addition to the four Gospels, other New Testament books contain verses which also prove He is a man: He is &#147;Jesus of Nazareth, a man&#148; (Acts 2:22). Stephen saw Him in heaven as &#147;the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God&#148; (Acts 7:55-56). Romans 1:3, &#147;Jesus Christ our Lord, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,&#148; clearly proves that He is a man of blood and flesh. He is &#147;the one Man Jesus Christ&#148; (Rom. 5:15). He is &#147;the last Adam,&#148; and He is &#147;the second man&#148; (1 Cor. 15:45, 47). He is the One who died for all (2 Cor. 5:14). He is the seed of Abraham (Gal. 3:16). &#147;Out of whom according to flesh is the Christ&#148; (Rom. 9:5) proves He is a man with flesh who came out of Israel. That He was &#147;come of a woman&#148; (Gal. 4:4) certainly proves that He is a man. He &#147;became in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man&#148; (Phil. 2:7-8). This absolutely proves that He became a man. First Timothy 2:5 refers to &#147;the Man, Christ Jesus.&#148; He was made a man who is a little inferior to the angels (Heb. 2:6-9). &#147;Since therefore the children have partaken of blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner shared in the same&#148; (Heb. 2:14). This means He became a man of blood and flesh. The statement, &#147;Jesus Christ is come in the flesh&#148; (1 John 4:2), clearly shows us He became a man. He is &#147;One like the Son of Man&#148; (Rev. 1:13). He is &#147;the Lion of the tribe of Judah&#148; (Rev. 5:5). This means He is a descendant of Judah. This also proves that He is a man. He is &#147;the Offspring of David&#148; (Rev. 22:16) surely proves that He is a man.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
