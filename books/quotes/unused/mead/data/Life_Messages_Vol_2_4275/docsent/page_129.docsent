   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Symbolizing the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament we come to the final picture of the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After God saves us, He begins the work of transformation within us so that we may become a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ, who is the Head of the church, is an individual golden lampstand; the church, His body, should correspondingly form a corporate golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is this what we are?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a church in a locality, are we truly a golden lampstand?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are surely not that by nature, for we were formed of the dust of the ground Gen 2:7 , not of gold!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"The first man is of the earth, earthy" 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we die, we return to the dust from which we were taken Gen 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nonetheless, we do have gold within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God Himself is within us, because we have been born of Him John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As His children, we have His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From our earthly parents we have our human nature, but through regeneration we have been made partakers of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yes, we do have the gold of God's life in us, but the question is, how much?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A glass may contain just a drop of water, or it may be overflowing its brim.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps you have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You pray to Him occasionally, but most of the time you are content to live without contacting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You come to the meetings only when someone brings you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can there be any overflow from you?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Does the gold have a way to increase and be formed in you?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, you may be another kind of Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Others can testify of you that when they talk with you, the water is always flowing over the brim.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gold in you has increased and is apparent to others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>GOLD VERSUS CLAY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is the church in your locality a lampstand of gold, or is it only clay?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You probably will have to answer that it is part clay and part gold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You were born of dust, or clay, and you grow up to be a man of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For you to be transformed from a man of clay to a man of gold is not easy and requires time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you had been born pure gold, the forming of the golden lampstand would have been simple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church in your locality becomes a golden lampstand as all of you are transformed from clay to gold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How does this come about?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To remain a man of clay does not require stealing or scheming like Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we live by our natural being, even though we do not commit outward sin, we are only clay.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God, the gold in us, is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are to live by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not to love or hate by our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may recognize pride as coming from ourselves; but it is also quite possible for our humility to be from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must not appreciate a love or humility which is of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The point is not whether we love or hate, but whether our love or hatred comes from the self or from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may remember how you vowed on your wedding day to love your wife or to submit to your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am sure you discovered even before your honeymoon was over that you could not fulfill your promise!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is the same story for almost everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if you do find that you are able to love your wife or submit to your husband, that love or submission is of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible tells us that Christ lives in us Gal 2:20 and that to us to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As Christ lives in us and as we live Him, spontaneously we shall find love arising toward our wife or submission toward our husband.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This love or submission is of gold, not clay.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How much of your daily living is gold, and how much is clay?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the question that should concern you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not ask about love or hate, pride or humility.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To think in those terms is to be in the realm of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What you need to ask is whether the love or humility is of gold or of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may have a nice way about you and be well liked by others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But is your pleasant manner from the earth or from the gold?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Probably it is a mixture of the two.</S>
