   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Bright Angel Created by God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Isaiah 14:12 tells us that Satan was the Daystar for Lucifer, according to Latin , son of the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as the daystar is the leading one among the stars, so Satan must be the head of all the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The title son of the morning shows that he was there early, in the morning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus Satan, from the earliest days of the universe, was the head of the angels, bright as the daystar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Satan s origin was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was God s anointed cherub, the one closest to God, holding the highest position in God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He had not only the kingship, but also the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But he was deprived of his position and offices when he rebelled against God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now God has chosen us to be His priests and kings, to take over Satan s position and offices, to put him to shame, and to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE REBELLION OF SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ezekiel 28:15 says that Satan was perfect in his ways from the day he was created.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, God did not create an evil Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God created a good and perfect archangel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But at a certain time, this archangel, the anointed cherub, rebelled against God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A. The Cause of Rebellion</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan rebelled against God because of pride in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ezekiel 28:17 says that his heart was lifted up because of his beauty, that he corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>28:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that he had the full measure of completeness and was short of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But he gazed on his beauty and was proud.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He looked at his brightness, and because of his brightness he used his God-given wisdom to commit sins and do unrighteous deeds, and thus corrupted his wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To look at what God has made us and to forget God Himself always tempts us to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Pride was the cause of Satan s rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In our experience, all the natural virtues and spiritual gifts can be utilized by the Devil to make us proud.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even the Apostle Paul could be exceedingly lifted up by the transcendence of the revelations 2 Cor 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The proud Devil is still walking about on the earth, seeking the proud ones whom he may devour 1 Pet 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The only way to resist him is to humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble 1 Pet 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus is a good example in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan exalted himself, but the Lord Jesus humbled Himself Phil 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the Lord Jesus overcame Satan, and Satan had nothing in Him John 14:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. The Purpose of Rebellion</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The purpose of Satan s rebellion was to exalt himself to be equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Isaiah 14:13-14 we find that five times Satan said, I will : I will ascend into heaven...I will exalt my throne...I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation...I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan wanted to be equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That was the purpose of his rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. The Process of Rebellion</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan initiated the rebellion against God with the evil intention to overthrow God s authority Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>28:15-18; Isa 14:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only did he rebel, but a great part of the angels who were under his hand also rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Revelation 12:4 and 9 we see that one-third of the heavenly stars, that is, one-third of the angels, followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Revelation stars represent angels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Matthew 25:41 the Lord Jesus refers to the Devil and his angels.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ephesians 2:2 describes Satan as the ruler of the authority of the air, and Ephesians 6:12 tells us of the rulers...the authorities...in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These rulers and authorities were the angels under Satan s hand, ruling over the pre-Adamic universe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Satan rebelled against God, most of his angels followed him in his rebellion, becoming the fallen angels, the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today, in the universe there are two categories of angels, good angels and evil angels.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The good angels stand with God; the evil ones are allied with Satan against God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The living creatures which were on the earth at that time also joined Satan in his rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus God judged them with water and they became the demons on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their lodging place is in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man s body is also their temporary dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Matthew 12:43 says, Now when the unclean spirit goes out from a man, it passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows that the lodging place of the demons is in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If they cannot find water, they make the physical body of a human being their temporary dwelling place Matt 12:44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why do demons like to get into water or into a human body?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In his book, Earth s Earliest Ages, G. H. Pember has made a scholarly and thorough study of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Geologists and archaeologists have discovered that the earth is not merely six thousand years old, but much older.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some have discovered fossil remains of bones which are thousands and thousands of years old.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But according to the Bible, there are only about six thousand years from Adam to now.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Mr. Pember found the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2 there was a period of time which he called the interval.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No one can say how long this interval was.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At any rate, it must have been a very long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After studying this matter thoroughly, Pember inferred that at a certain time after the original creation, Satan and his angels rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Pember also inferred from the biblical record that in this pre-Adamic age there existed on the earth some living beings and that they also joined Satan in his rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thus Satan, his fallen angels, and these living beings were all judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After they were judged by God, these beings lost their bodies and became disembodied spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the reason that demons want to enter a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The water with which God judged them became the deep where the demons must live.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Pember even proved that under this deep water there is the so-called abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The deep water is the demons dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>One day, while the Lord Jesus was sailing across the sea, a strong wind blew and a great storm arose.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He commanded the wind to stop and the storm to be silent Matt 8:23-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Why did the air become windy and the water stormy?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because there were the fallen angels in the air and demons in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They knew that the Lord Jesus was going over to the other shore to cast out demons Matt 8:28-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Thus they raised up the wind and the storm to frustrate His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the pre-Adamic age, the evil angels and the living beings followed Satan in his rebellion against God to form the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Its sphere is the so-called world including the earth and the air.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Today, in Satan s kingdom there are the fallen angels in the air, the demons in the water, and the fallen human beings on the earth.</S>
