<h2 class="head1">THE YOUNG SERVING ONES NEEDING<br />
TO BE FEARFUL OF BEING PROUD</h2>
<p>The future of the young serving ones is limitless. The Lord will give a considerable number of them important services in the carrying out of His commission. However, when they are given some responsibility, their pride will become a source of temptation. Thus, they should be fearful of their pride.</p>
<p>In 1950 Brother Nee went to Hong Kong and brought a revival to the church. He sent me a telegram asking me to come to Hong Kong and help lead the service of the church, including that of the elders, co-workers, and deacons. I was absent from one of the revival meetings, but during this meeting Brother Nee said, &ldquo;Although Brother Lee has been used by the Lord, he is not proud.&rdquo; Please forgive me for speaking about myself. Brother Nee spoke this word as a warning so that those who had handed themselves over to the Lord would have no expectation of a future for themselves. The Lord will have mercy on those who truly give themselves to Him, and He will perfect them to be useful. However, once a person becomes useful, it is easy for him to become proud. Pride is a worm that destroys us by devouring us from within.</p>
<p>The brothers who became a problem were not fearful of the element of their pride. When they were with us, they listened to me but despised the other co-workers. This is pride. In the future you may be supplied with a great measure of grace by the Lord, and He may perfect you in order to use you to a great extent. After accomplishing such a work, you should still go before the Lord and say, &ldquo;I am an unprofitable slave; I have done what I ought to have done&rdquo; (cf. Luke 17:10). Even if you have seen the vision of Christ, you should not think that others have not seen it. It is wrong to say that others have no vision. If you have seen a vision and know the Lord&rsquo;s way, you will not intimidate others or promote yourself. Instead, you should walk quietly according to the Spirit and minister Christ in the meetings of the church in your locality.</p>
<p>If a brother is raised up in a local church, other churches will learn about him, even if he has a quiet manner. The churches will surely hear about him and welcome him. In this way he will be blessed, and the churches will also be blessed, supplied, and established through him. However, he should be fearful of becoming proud or of seeking a way to advance. The doors that the Lord wants to open will be automatically opened. May the Lord cover me with His precious blood. I have the position to speak such a word, because I am leading the churches, and I have never sought to advance myself. It was not my intention to work in the United States. In 1938 I received two checks: one check was for my traveling expenses to America, and the other was to cover one year&rsquo;s expenses for my family. At that time I did not have the Lord&rsquo;s leading to go to America. But twenty years later, in 1958, by the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement I was invited to London and Denmark, and I passed through America.</p>
<p>If you have Christ and can minister Christ, you do not need to look for openings; doors will open for you. Joseph had an abundance of grain, so all the earth came to him to buy grain. All five continents are open to the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. My only concern is that we are not perfected. When we are perfected, we can be sent out. There are too many places in need of ones who can be sent. It would not be too much to send three or four hundred to South America. Many places in Europe are also waiting. We must always be afraid of arrogance and pride, especially if we have some spiritual constitution and gift. We must always remain in humility.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT FORMING PARTIES<br />
WITHIN THE UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>I have often considered the incident with the brothers who stirred up the trouble in Taiwan, because it left a great wound. Not only did the brothers make the mistake of being proud, they also formed themselves into a party. They had no secrets among themselves, but they were tightlipped with the other co-workers. In the Body of Christ the members should not form parties. There cannot be a &ldquo;small Body&rdquo; within the Body. If there is a &ldquo;small Body&rdquo; within the Body, it will become a cancer. Eventually, the situation among those brothers became cancerous, and it devastated the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Whether we are in Taichung, London, or Hong Kong, we should not try to gain some who would follow us. This is to form a small circle within the Body, and it is extremely dangerous. This is like two sisters who are willing to tell each other their secrets but who are unwilling to speak to their mother. Relationships like this need to be terminated. We are in one universal Body, and there should be no small circles within the one large circle of the Body. In the Body there is no such thing as one member being dearer or nearer to another member.</p>
<p>I began serving the Lord in Chefoo more than fifty years ago, but I do not have any co-workers with whom I have an intimate, personal relationship. Brother Chang has served with me for over fifty years, and Brother Liu has coordinated with me in the ministry of the word. Many saints probably think that these brothers are very dear to me. If you were to ask them, they would say that I have given them &ldquo;hot and sour soup,&rdquo; not &ldquo;sweet soymilk.&rdquo; It is the same in the United States; I do not have any co-workers with whom I am intimate on a personal level.</p>
<p>There are several co-workers who have left us. Some of them accused me of being wrong, while saying that they were right. It is strange that those who say that they are right often have the most difficulty working with others. But even though I am wrong, I have many co-workers. Nevertheless, I am not intimate with any of them. I do not give them &ldquo;sweet soymilk&rdquo; to drink; rather, I give everyone &ldquo;hot and sour soup.&rdquo; Those who are new full-timers should realize that I do not serve &ldquo;sweet soymilk.&rdquo;</p>
