<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. David's Removal of the Ark of God<br>from the House of Obed-edom to His City, Zion</H2><P>In verses 11 through 23 we see that David removed the ark from the house of Obed-edom and brought it to his city, Zion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Because of God's Blessing on Obed-edom</H2><P>Obed-edom offered hospitality to the ark of God, and for this reason God blessed him and all his household. When David heard that God had blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that he had because of the ark of God, David came back to remove the ark of God to Zion, David's private city, which was the center of the public city of Jerusalem (vv. 11-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. David Offering Sacrifices to Jehovah<br>and Dancing with All His Might before Jehovah</H2><P>When those who bore the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, David sacrificed an ox and a fatling (v. 13). Also, David danced with all his might before Jehovah, having girded himself with a linen ephod (v. 14). David wore a garment which only the priests should wear. For that day, he became a high priest to wear the ephod. On that occasion he was a priest as well as a king. In a sense, he broke the divine ordination. But in another sense, this was an honor and a glory to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Ark of God Being Brought Up<br>with Shouting and the Sound of the Trumpet</H2><P>Verse 15 tells us that David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Ark of God Being Lodged<br>in a Tent That David Pitched for It</H2><P>The ark of God lodged in the tent that David pitched for it. David offered sacrifices before Jehovah, blessing the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts and apportioning to all the people some cakes (vv. 17-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Michal the Wife of David Despising Him<br>at His Dancing before Jehovah<br>and Receiving the Curse of Not Having a Child</H2><P>Everyone was happy except Michal, David's wife, who was of the house of Saul. When she saw King David leaping and dancing before Jehovah, she despised him in her heart (v. 16). After David blessed the people, he returned to bless his household, and Michal went forth to meet him and mocked him, saying, "How the king of Israel has made himself honorable today, uncovering himself today in the sight of the maids of his servants as some worthless fellow might shamelessly uncover himself!" (v. 20). David replied, "It was before Jehovah, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of Jehovah, over Israel; so I played before Jehovah" (v. 21). The chapter concludes by saying that Michal the daughter of Saul had no child until the day of her death (v. 23). Her mocking of David brought upon her the curse of childlessness.</P>
