<h2 class="head2">People&rsquo;s Salvation Being Related<br />
to Our Giving of Our Money</h2>
<p>According to my knowledge of God, I would like to advise the saints not to be calculating with God. We must give one-tenth of whatever the Lord gives us as our income for His use. We should never touch this one-tenth. Besides this, whenever the Lord has a move, we need to give. In the Old Testament the basic tithe came from the produce of the land, and the additional tithes were given by the children of God according to their ability which had been measured to them by the Lord. We should never be calculating with God. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles&rdquo; (Luke 16:9). Who are these friends? They are the sinners gained through the preaching of the gospel and by the money we give.</p>
<p>We may not feel that people&rsquo;s salvation is related to our giving, but actually their salvation depends on our giving. Suppose Taiwan produces one hundred fifty full-timers who are supported by the saints. The full-timers will preach the gospel and lead thousands of people to salvation, and the newly saved believers will remember our giving in their thanksgiving to God. We may not know of it today, but when the Lord returns, these friends will come forth to welcome us. What a pleasant scene that will be!</p>
<p>Paul says that the Philippians were his joy and his crown (Phil. 4:1). In the same way, when we give money to supply the full-timers for the gospel and a person is saved through them, we can say, &ldquo;That person is my joy and my crown.&rdquo; When the Lord returns, He will settle accounts with us. Both Matthew 25 and Luke 19 reveal that the Lord will return and settle accounts with us. He will give an account of how many persons we led to salvation, and how much money we gave for the spread of the gospel from the time we were saved. Then He will give each of us what is due. This is the joy and reward of preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Returning to Settle Accounts with Us</h2>
<p>In Luke 19 the Lord said to the one who gained ten minas, &ldquo;Well done, good slave. Because you have become faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities&rdquo; (v. 17). Then to the one who gained five minas He said, &ldquo;You, be over five cities&rdquo; (v. 19). But to the one who did not gain even one mina, the Lord said, &ldquo;Take the mina away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas...I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away&rdquo; (vv. 24-26). This also applies to our giving of money. There is a reward and punishment related to our use of our money. If we have surplus money and only deposit it in the bank or put it as a mortgage for a house, when the Lord returns, there will not be many people welcoming us. We should not think that we need to be cautious in our giving. If we are too cautious, we will hinder the Lord&rsquo;s business and hinder the salvation of people&rsquo;s souls. The angels are expecting people to be saved, and the Lord is also waiting for people to be saved. If we do not cooperate by giving our lives and our money, the Lord has no way to move.</p>
<p>This fellowship is not concerning fund-raising; it is the truth in practice. We cannot speak only of the first part of Luke 19, concerning the salvation of Zaccheus; we have to speak also of the second part of Luke 19, concerning one mina gaining five minas or even ten minas. If we preach the gospel, we will gain a reward, but if we do not preach the gospel, we will receive punishment. When the Lord returns, He will settle accounts with us. He will give an account of our life concerning how we used our lives and how we used the money He gave us. At that time we will not be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, I was very cautious. I put the money in the bank where it was safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us that we may be faithful in doing three things: first, to rise up to pray; second, to cooperate with the Lord&rsquo;s touching us and calling us to hand over our lives to serve full time for His move; third, to follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning our money and to continually give according to the Lord&rsquo;s need without being afraid of giving too much. These are three practical things we can do according to our present situation. If every saint rises up and follows this way, we will have a great prospect of evangelizing Taiwan in five years.</p>
