THROUGH BEING BROKEN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES<br />
OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING TO BE BROKEN</h2>
<p>In the secular world people know that a person&rsquo;s ideal condition often differs from his real situation. This can also be applied to spiritual matters. Believers who seek and follow the Lord eventually discover that there is often a substantial difference between their real condition and the condition that they desire. Very few believers have learned the lessons or have been worked on by the Lord. Few can testify that since the day of their salvation there have not been any problems in their pursuit of the Lord, that they have accomplished what they want, or that they have arrived at the spiritual condition they desire. The biographies of spiritual believers reveal that their experiences were primarily of being broken.</p>
<p>Let us consider the matter of reading the Bible. After salvation or after being revived, many believers make a vow to read the Bible every day. They even consider which method they should use to complete the Bible in a year. Their plan is ideal. However, very few believers are able to achieve their ideal plan, and when they do, there does not seem to be much benefit. In contrast, those who can read the Bible properly experience being broken in their reading. They desire to read the Bible diligently, but God arranges many situations in their environment that interrupt them. They have an earnest desire to set aside several hours a day to read the Bible, but God arranges unavoidable circumstances, such as a brother seeking help because of a family problem or a sister coming for fellowship because she is unhappy with her husband, not to mention their own problems. These situations make it impossible for them to fulfill their desire in reading the Bible. They can read only a short portion of the Bible and ponder over it briefly in the midst of their chaos. I can testify that reading the Bible in this way often issues in special enlightenment from God and yields unexpected results. However, those who are able to read the Bible according to their plan may not receive any light. They might become well versed in the Bible, but they are dead. Those who can receive light from reading the Bible often experience being broken.</p>
<p>This principle applies not only to reading the Bible but also to prayer and to other spiritual activities. This principle also applies to the Lord&rsquo;s work and to the church. We can say that the history of the church is a matter of being broken. Such experiences, however, issue in genuine growth in life.</p>
<p>Bible expositors have highly appraised the church at Pentecost. They consider the early church to have been blameless and faultless. As far as God&rsquo;s work is concerned, there was no problem, but the church experienced serious problems. For example, in Acts 1 through 4 the condition of the church was wonderful, but in chapter 5 something negative occurred&mdash;Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, lied to the Holy Spirit (vv. 1-11). In this portion even though the morning had just begun, it seemed as though the sun had begun to set. Then in chapter 6 complaints arose because of the distribution of food (vv. 1-2). Hence, the church at Pentecost was not so spiritual or so good. Whatever God does is good, but our situations are not ideal, because we must be tried and broken in order to become dependable. This applies to the church and to the individual believers.</p>
<p>The condition of the church at Pentecost can be compared to an unfired clay brick with a newly painted pattern. The pattern must be burned onto the brick by passing through fire. God did a work of grace in the early church and provided it with a wonderful situation. Soon afterward the church passed through a great trial; it went through a &ldquo;furnace&rdquo; in order to be broken. God supplied the church with grace, and He allowed the church to be tried. However, the church failed and became desolate. Hence, the apostle Paul, who preached the gospel to the Gentile world, said that all who were in Asia had turned away from him (2 Tim. 1:15). This shows how desolate the church had become.</p>
<p>According to its outward condition, the church had become worse than it was at Pentecost. But according to its intrinsic nature, the church at the time of Pentecost was inferior to the church at the time of Paul&rsquo;s rejection.</p>
<p>This principle can be applied to our present situation. For example, a local church that is flourishing and thriving in the beginning of the year may fall because of two small problems in the second half of the year and never recover its initial condition. However, according to its intrinsic nature, the condition of this church may be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
