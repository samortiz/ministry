   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEGATIVE SPICES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The oil, the frankincense, and the salt are the positive spices in the meal offering, but there are also some negative spices.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By negative spices, I mean that these spices are never to be added to the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"No meal offering, which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the Lord made by fire" Lev 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why should we never add leaven or honey to the meal offering?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is because these two things can be easily fermented.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When fermentation begins in any food, that food is corrupted and damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first negative spice mentioned is leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Leaven in the Bible always signifies evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Worldliness, sinfulness, anything related to corruption, and all evil things are likened in the Bible as leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What then is honey?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Bible honey signifies something good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our hatred is leaven, and our love is honey.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our pride is leaven, and our humility is honey.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All our good behavior is honey.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our love may be good, but it can be fermented.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In many cases, hatred does not ferment as much as love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose five brothers are living together and hate one another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It would be rather difficult for them to be fermented, for they are so cold in their hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when they love one another too much, they are disarmed by their natural love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Within just a short time they may all become fermented.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the church we do not need pride nor do we need humility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not like to have a brother who thinks he knows everything nor do we like to have a brother who always says he knows nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is honey.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Honey is so sweet and is so deceitful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know that hatred is bad, but no one would say that love is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But Leviticus 2 says that we should not put any leaven or honey in the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No leaven or honey will be accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They will not ascend from the altar as a kind of sweet savor to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must neither be proud nor humble.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must simply take the oil and the frankincense with a certain amount of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the Spirit, the resurrection, and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The salt is just the cross to cross out our natural love, our natural affection, and our natural patience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All these "good" things must be crossed out, for they will cause fermentation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am always afraid of a patient person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you are patient with me all the time, one day you will be the most critical person in the world to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not appreciate any kind of natural patience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the natural goodness must be crossed out by the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The salt is the cross and the frankincense is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the meal offering, which is the humanity of Jesus, there is the killing of the cross, and there is also the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The salt kills, preserves, and imparts lasting power, and the frankincense is the fragrant resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The salt in this chapter is called the salt of the covenant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"And every oblation of thy meal offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt" Lev 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the covenant that God has made with us, the basic factor is the cross, the crucifixion of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This causes His covenant to last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is by the cross that it is made an everlasting covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, in the meal offering there is the humanity of Christ, the divinity of Christ, the cross to kill and preserve, and the resurrection fragrance to flavor His whole humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This should not be a mere doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are feeding upon the meal offering, we will eventually become what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We live by what we eat, and gradually what we eat becomes what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The meal offering includes the humanity of Jesus, the divinity of Jesus, the cross of Jesus, and the resurrection of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is the fine flour, the oil, the frankincense, and the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is no ground for any leaven or honey in this meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the life of Jesus as a man there is no place for any kind of impurity or corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are feeding on such a Jesus, we will have the fine flour, the oil, the salt, and the frankincense, without any leaven or honey.</S>
