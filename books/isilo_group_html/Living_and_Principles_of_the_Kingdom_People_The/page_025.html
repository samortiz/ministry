<h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLES OF<br />
THE KINGDOM PEOPLE&rsquo;S LIVING AND WORK</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 7:13-27</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the last section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 5 through 7. In the first six sections the Lord spoke concerning the living of the kingdom people. The last section is a conclusion that speaks of the principles of the kingdom people&rsquo;s living and work. This section shows how a person under the ruling of the heavens should live and work on the earth, and it reveals the basis on which his living and work will be judged. These principles are the foundation of the living and work of the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF GATES AND WAYS</h2>
<p>The Lord first spoke of the gate and the way. In Matthew 7:13 and 14 He said, &ldquo;Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it. Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it.&rdquo; There are two kinds of gates and two ways before the people of the kingdom of the heavens. There are the wide gate and the broad way that lead to destruction, and there are the narrow gate and the constricted way that lead to life. The people of the kingdom of the heavens must not take the wide gate or the broad way; they should take the narrow gate and the constricted way. The first principle for the living and work of the people of the kingdom of the heavens is to enter the narrow gate and to take the constricted way.</p>
<p>There are no restrictions with the wide gate and the broad way, but the narrow gate and the constricted way are restricted. When people enter or leave a house, they prefer to take a wide gate and a broad way because it is more convenient to pass through a wide gate than it is to pass through a narrow gate. Sometimes, a person who is carrying many things finds it difficult to pass through a narrow gate. He needs to put some things down in order to pass through a narrow gate. Similarly, it is more convenient to walk on a wide way than on a narrow way.</p>
<p>As believers, there are two ways in which we can live. The first way is easy to walk on because it is wide. Christians who take this way have few problems, no matter how they live or work. Everything seems easy for them. The second way is inconvenient to walk on because it is narrow. Christians who take this way are inwardly restricted regarding their words and actions.</p>
<p>There are many examples of Christians who live on the broad way and Christians who live on the narrow way. For example, every living person has to make friends. Concerning making friends, unsaved people have a wide gate and a broad way; they can make friends with any kind of person. However, many Christians have not dealt with the matter of making friends. They may not be as undisciplined as they were prior to their salvation, but they are still loose in the matter of making friends. Such Christians are taking the wide gate and the broad way. There are some Christians, however, who are restricted in the matter of making friends. They are governed by the kingdom of the heavens and dare not be so free. They do not make friends loosely, nor do they have friendships with all kinds of people (cf. 1 Cor. 15:33). This indicates that they take the narrow gate and the constricted way.</p>
<p>In the matter of clothing it is also obvious that some Christians are not restricted; they wear whatever they want to wear and adorn themselves according to their desires. Some Christians, however, are restricted inwardly and cannot be loose about the material, color, or style of their clothing (cf. 1 Tim. 2:9).</p>
<p>The kingdom people should take the narrow gate and the constricted way as a principle in their living and work. It is convenient to take the wide gate and the broad way, but the Lord said, &ldquo;Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction.&rdquo; The wide gate and broad way lead to destruction. The word <em>destruction</em> does not refer to eternal perdition but to suffering destruction in one&rsquo;s deeds and work (1 Cor. 3:15). It is a great loss for everything that one has done to be destroyed. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s word is quite serious. We must be delivered from the wide gate and the broad way in our living, walk, and work and in the administration of the church; otherwise, our living, walk, work, and administration of the church will end in destruction.</p>
<p>The narrow gate and the constricted way lead to life; they result in life. Hence, a living and work that are according to the narrow gate and the constricted way will last forever and be approved by the Lord. Because the gate is narrow and the way is constricted, few believers find them. We must ask for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy so that we may walk this way.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13:31 through 33 the Lord spoke in parables concerning the great tree and the leaven: &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, and which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches...The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&rdquo; A mustard seed is small and should grow into a small mustard plant. However, in this parable the mustard seed becomes a great tree. The three measures of meal should be pure, but the whole lump is leavened by a little leaven (cf. 1 Cor. 5:6). Something was added, and the lump was rejected by God. The leaven was added through the wide gate and the broad way. Someone who takes the wide gate and the broad way must compromise. As a result, many improper things can be added. Therefore, the growth of the great tree and the adding of leaven are related to taking the wide gate and the broad way. In order to avoid the great tree and the leaven, we must enter through the narrow gate and take the constricted way.</p>
<p>Why did the Lord talk about the gate and then the way? The gate and the way relate to the same thing, but the gate emphasizes the beginning, and the way emphasizes the continuation. We have to enter through the gate and then walk on the way; we cannot walk on the way and then enter through the gate. This is significant. If we first tried to walk on the way and then enter through the gate, there would be many ways that lead to the same gate. In the world people think that the means do not matter as long as they achieve their goal. There is even a Chinese saying that speaks of using different routes to arrive at the same destination. However, in spiritual matters this is never the case. In spiritual matters we must first enter through the gate and then walk on the way. In spiritual matters we cannot take different routes to end up at the same destination. In other words, different beginnings do not lead to the same result, and wrong beginnings do not bring in the right result. In order for the result to be right, the beginning must be right. Hence, the beginning of spiritual matters is crucial and must be right and proper.</p>
<p>The beginning is the gate. God wants us to pass through a gate in every spiritual matter. The principle of the gate is that it is narrow and tight. Even in such a matter as making friends, the kingdom people must pass through a gate and have a severe dealing in the beginning. Previously, there was no gate and no way; hence, we made friends indiscriminately. But now that we are under the authority of the heavens, we must pass through the gate in the matter of making friends. There is a strict limitation, a strict principle, in relation to the kind of people we can befriend. To say that we should befriend good people but not bad people can still be a wide gate and a broad way. The narrow gate and the constricted way are not only a matter of not befriending bad people; they may include not having friendships with good people. We do not keep friendship with the world (James 4:4), nor do we commune with unbelievers (2 Cor. 6:14). We pursue only with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22).</p>
<p>Concerning clothing and adornment, we must pass through a gate in order for us to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and be restricted. Formerly, we wore the current fashions. But now that we live under the authority of the kingdom of the heavens, we are restricted from things that are not befitting for a saint. This is to pass through a gate. Working for God is another example. Formerly, because we did not understand the meaning of being ruled by God, there was no work that we could not do. However, now that we are living under the heavenly rule, we must pass through a gate in our spiritual work and undergo rigorous examination. This is a strict principle in the Lord&rsquo;s work. We can do things only that are in accordance with this principle; we cannot do things that contradict this principle.</p>
<p>In order to be restricted by the heavens, our living and our walk must enter through the narrow gate. This is pleasing to the Lord. Only those who have entered through the narrow gate have entered into the realm of the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens. If we are to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord wants us to first enter through the narrow gate and reject everything that is incompatible with the heavenly nature. However, it is not sufficient for us to pass through the narrow gate; we must still take the constricted way. The way is the continuation of the gate; it is an extension of the gate. The way for us to maintain the narrowness and strictness of our entrance through the gate is to take the constricted way. The narrowness and the strictness that we experience when we enter through the gate are the same narrowness and strictness that we should maintain as we walk on the way. We did not experience looseness when passing through the gate, and we should not experience looseness when walking on the way. Passing through the gate helps us to walk the way, but passing through the gateway cannot replace our walking on the way. After entering the gate, we must continue walking on the way. If we are willing to be restricted and ruled by the heavens so that every aspect of our living and walk is narrow, we will be full of life and gain something of eternal worth.</p>
<p>Although the Lord did not speak of salvation or of perdition in this section on the gate, this section includes the matter of reward and punishment. The word <em>destruction</em> in Matthew 7:13 refers not only to our living and work being devoid of the eternal worth of life but also to our suffering destruction. This means that before the judgment seat of Christ we will suffer loss by being punished. However, if our living and work are based on the narrow principle, we will have the eternal fruit of life and also the reward of life before the judgment seat of Christ. The principle of the gate and the way is the basis for the living and work of the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Living and Principles of the Kingdom People &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
