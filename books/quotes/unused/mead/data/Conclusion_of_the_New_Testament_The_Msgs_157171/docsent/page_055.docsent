   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Serving and Worshipping God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament serving God is actually the same thing as worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You cannot serve God without worshipping Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Neither can you worship Him without serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For instance, in Matthew 4 the Lord Jesus was tempted by the Devil concerning worship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Referring to the kingdoms of the world and their glory, the Devil said to Him, "All these will I give You if You will fall down and worship me" v. 9 . The Lord Jesus answered, "It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve" v. 10 . Here we see that to worship actually means to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, to worship God is to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without serving God we cannot render real worship to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1 Thessalonians 1:9b Paul says that the believers at Thessalonica "turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Literally, the Greek word rendered "serve" here means to serve as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As used in verse 9, the word serve is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It includes everything we do in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is living because He is true, not false.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, in 1:9 Paul speaks of serving a living and true God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church of the Thessalonians was made up of believers serving a living God who is true.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is also what we are doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fact that we are serving a living God proves that we are in God the Father 1 Thes 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we were not in the Father, we would not be serving a living God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1:9 the word "living" is mentioned before the word "true."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is rather easy to serve a true God; it is not so easy to serve a living God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, we need to serve a living God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God must be living to us and in us in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He should be living in our speech, in our behavior, and every aspect of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By our daily life we prove that God is living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If God were not living, our daily life would be very different from what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our present living is a testimony that the God whom we serve is living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is living in us, and He controls us, directs us, and deals with us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He will not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, in many matters He corrects us and adjusts us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fact that God controls us and directs us, even in such small things as our thoughts and motives, is a proof that He is living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We live under the control, direction, and correction of a living God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As believers in Christ we must live a life which bears the testimony that the God we worship and serve is living in the details of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The proper Christian life should bear a testimony that God is living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The reason we do not do or say certain things should be that God is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The God whom we worship and serve is living not only in the heavens but also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No doubt, when God is living to us in our experience, He is also true.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1 With Their Conscience Purified from Dead Works</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we come to serve God, or worship God, we need to have a pure conscience, a conscience purified from dead works or from any kind of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hebrews 9:14 says, "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the cross, Christ offered Himself to God in a human body, which is a matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But He offered Himself through the eternal Spirit, who is of eternity, without any limit of time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because Christ offered Himself by the eternal Spirit, His blood has an eternal efficacy to purify our conscience so that we may serve and worship the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The blood of Christ purifies our conscience to serve the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To serve the living God requires a blood-purified conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To worship in dead religion or to serve any dead thing rather than God does not require our conscience to be purified.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The conscience is the leading part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The living God, whom we desire to serve, always comes to our spirit John 4:24 by touching our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is righteous, holy, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our defiled conscience needs to be purified so that we may serve Him in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To worship God in our mind religiously does not require this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hebrews 9:14 speaks of "dead works" and "the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because we were dead Eph 2:1; Col 2:13 , whatever we did, bad or good, was dead works in the sight of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The book of Hebrews does not teach religion; it reveals the living God 3:12; 9:14; 10:31; 12:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To touch this living God we need to exercise our spirit and to have a blood-purified conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins Matt 26:28 , and the new covenant was consummated with it Heb 10:29; Luke 22:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It has accomplished eternal redemption for us Heb 9:12; Eph 1:7; 1 Pet 1:18-19 , and now it washes us from our sins Rev 1:5; 1 John 1:7 and purifies our conscience so that we may serve and worship the living God.</S>
