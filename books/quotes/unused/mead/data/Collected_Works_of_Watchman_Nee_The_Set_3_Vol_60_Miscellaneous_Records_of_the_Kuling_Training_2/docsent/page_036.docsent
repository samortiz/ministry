   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THINGS THAT AN AWAKENED SINNER SHOULD DO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we reach this point, a sinner will ask, "What should I do to be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here are also four things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Confess</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first thing we should do is to tell an awakened sinner to confess his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although this verse is for Christians, in principle anyone who confesses his sins to God will receive His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must be clear about confession.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Confession means to stand on God's side and to acknowledge sin as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people only plead for forgiveness without making any confession.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, many people say to God, "I am proud.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am envious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am lustful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hate others."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They only ask God to forgive them, but they do not acknowledge these as sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact of the matter is that as soon as a sinner acknowledges a sin to be sin, God will forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Confessing to God means acknowledging before Him that a sin is sin indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to lead sinners not only to pray for forgiveness but to confess sin as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone has a few particular sins of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does not commit all sins in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, confession means to confess the few particular sins that one has.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Confession cannot be general.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One has to confess his sins in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not say to God, "I am proud.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am envious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, we should confess, saying, "I am proud, and this is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am envious, and this is sin."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The worst thing that an evangelist can do is to invite a sinner to the feast but fail to introduce him to the Host.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our purpose is not to make others nod at our doctrines, but to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After they have understood the four points spoken of above, we should lead them to kneel before the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once a man confesses his sins, he stands on God's side and condemns sin as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he does not confess his sins, he is still standing on the side of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to bend the stiffened knees; we have to lead him to kneel down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not ask him to just ask for forgiveness; we have to make him confess first and then ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A great advantage of this confession is that the confessor will never forget what he has done.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once he prays this way, he will no longer be able to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This confession will count in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Read God's Word</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After a man confesses his sin, we have to give him God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will establish him in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a man does not believe in his heart, his prayer and confession will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A sinner's body does not play any part in his salvation and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His spirit is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His understanding is darkened, his emotion is void of aspirations, and his will is definitely antagonistic.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How can such a person believe?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, something outside of him has to get into him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to deposit something into him, something that will not come out once it gets into him the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only God's word works.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No doctrine will work, and no casual remark will work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only God's word works.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only His word will enter and operate within man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, the second thing to do with an awakened sinner is to let him read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let him read God's Word over and over again, until this word gets into him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what Romans 10:14 and 17 mean when they say that seeking comes from believing, believing comes from hearing, and hearing from the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>James 1:21 says that God's implanted word can save a sinner's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Second Peter 1:4 says that a man partakes of God's nature through the promises in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Acts 2:41 says that men were saved through receiving God's word, the word which Peter preached at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All of God's work is included in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When a man receives God's word, he receives God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The content of God's word is His work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Man does not touch God's work directly; he touches God's word, and through His word he touches His work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Gospel preachers must try to memorize many verses concerning God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In preaching the gospel, we should announce God's Word sentence by sentence until sinners are fully clear.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this way they will never forget God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to make others trust in God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They have to rest on God's word, to the extent that they treat God's word as a pillow.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Such a pillow supports their head all the time even after they are saved.</S>
