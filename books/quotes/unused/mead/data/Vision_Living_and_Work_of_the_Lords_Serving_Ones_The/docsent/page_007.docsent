   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING UNTIL WE ARE SKILLED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we preach the gospel, the most important thing for us to learn is how to use the Bible and how to be flexible in using the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should spend time to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may not thoroughly understand the contents of the gospel even after reading many books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should endeavor to memorize verses and the main points from the books so that we may freely speak the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this way we will be able to speak freely with people concerning the gospel, using any verse.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must practice until we are skilled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are well-versed in all the points of the gospel, whether we are preaching the gospel on a campus or in a home gathering, the people we contact will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GOING TO THE VILLAGES TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From this time onward, we must promote the gospel on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, every home must preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, we must preach the gospel to people in every occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Third, we must preach the gospel in middle schools and on college campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fourth, we must go to the villages and towns to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can all go to the campuses to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of us must go to the towns and villages to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It would be good if every meeting hall in every church could send one small group of saints to preach the gospel in the villages every Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must spread the gospel and not merely have meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In particular, in the future the full-timers who are in this training should go to other places to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Matthew 10, we should go out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We go out in groups.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Several brothers and sisters can form a group and go to a village.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They can stay there for three to four days and preach the gospel there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Recently, a group of five brothers in America went to different places that do not have a church and preached the gospel on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They went to a university in the state of Louisiana, but they were turned away by the school authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later they had a meeting with the president of the university, who allowed them to stay there and even provided a place on campus for them to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many students in that place have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same principle, we need groups of four to five brothers and sisters to go to villages and towns.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that the Lord will arrange for many Taiwanese-speaking saints to go to the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the future the young ones should spend a long time in the villages to preach and spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not be in a hurry to establish churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should first be diligent to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the full-time trainees should be the first group to learn these lessons and go preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Based on these instructions, we should find the relevant information from the books and study on our own or with companions so that we are equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The results depend on how much effort we put in. Hence, we need to study and work hard.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The young people must not be idle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Question: At present, there is a good response among the college students to the gospel, but it is not easy for them to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some students feel that to be baptized is to join a religion and are concerned about the opposition from their family.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Other students who have a positive response to the gospel want to wait until the time is right to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can we help the students take the next step and be baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Answer: We must pray and ask the Lord to give us the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Preaching the gospel requires power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must pray for this, but we should not take the way of the charismatic or Pentecostal movements.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should tell the Lord to give us the experience, not feelings; we want to experience the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For a person to be willing to believe requires the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For a person to be willing to be baptized requires even more of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Merely using methods to persuade people to be baptized is human manufacturing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must look to the Lord to give us the economical Spirit; we need the presence of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, the best way is to take people to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not so easy to lead people to be baptized if we are in a home or in a school; however, if we take people to the mountain and spend a few days together, it will be very easy to lead them to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Human beings are living organisms with feelings and emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person will respond one way when he feels cold in one setting and differently when he feels warm in another setting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So we must consider these two factors: the economical Spirit and the setting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Question: Recently more than a hundred young people were gained and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We hope that they can live a normal Christian life and can also preach the gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, since they have recently been saved, it is not possible for them to know the Bible well or to have read many spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Is it possible to collect crucial verses with simple explanations into a booklet so that these young people can become familiar with these items in a short period of time and use them to speak to others?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Answer: Everything depends on us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have the materials, but we need some saints to dig out the treasures, to digest them, and to compile them into booklets or tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the right method, and it will be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, in the future we can compile material from these treasures that would be suitable for children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not use worldly material for the children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should digest the main points of the truth and turn them into simple words so that we can speak the truth to the children.</S>
