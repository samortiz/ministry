   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING A GOOD START TO THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Basketball players realize that in order to play a good game, they must have a good start.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If they start the game in the wrong way, they will lose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all have to learn how to start the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not easy to call the first hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To begin with the hymn "Down from His Glory," for example, may start the meeting with a low atmosphere, and once the meeting is "buried" by the first hymn, it is hard to resurrect it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At least a few minutes before the scheduled start of the meeting, the brothers should start to pray rather than announce a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This will immediately bring the meeting into the right feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, many keep the regulation and wait until the scheduled time to begin the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Someone should offer a praise to the Lord, and then some others should follow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need not start the meeting with a hymn, according to a regulation; rather, we should start it in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That will change the whole atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not easy to choose a hymn to begin the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, we should simply learn to have some prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is easy to start a message meeting by announcing a hymn, but it is hard to start the Lord's table meeting with a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is difficult to say why this is so, but we know this from experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we must learn to start the table meeting by prayer, unless someone has the assurance that a certain hymn is right to start the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without the assurance, however, we should not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only the proper hymn can prepare the way for a proper meeting, so unless we are very clear and the meeting is already very open and uplifted, it is better not to choose a hymn at first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the meeting starts in a wrong way, there is no need to adjust or correct directly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, we should try the best to have another start.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may have the sense that the first hymn chosen is wrong, but we may not do anything to help the beginning of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That is simply a further mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After a wrong start, we have to do something right away to have the right start.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will save the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we let it go, the meeting will "float" without the proper direction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes also we do not sense the right time to pass the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To pass the bread and the cup requires the right atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, it is merely a kind of procedure or regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A meeting for the Lord's table that is out of the proper order is very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In such a case, some may still have the boldness to express something, but they may not have the flow or direction.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>USING HYMNS THAT HAVE THE PROPER FEELING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During the worship of the Father, we should not sing hymns that have differing feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Certain hymns may even be similar, but this does not mean they match each other.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One hymn may be on the greatness of God, while another is on the newness of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One may be compared to the winter, another may be like the summer, and others like the spring and the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To sing of all "four seasons" is not to have the proper direction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should know where the flow is going and what direction of the compass to "sail our boat."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First Corinthians 11:26 says, "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this short verse there are three points: to eat and to drink; to declare, display, and proclaim the death of Christ; and to look forward to His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the Lord's table, therefore, we always eat and drink the Lord to enjoy Him, and we display the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, we have the sense in the spirit that as the table meeting ends, we are looking forward to His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do have this sense, then it helps to sing some hymns about the Lord's second coming, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, it is possible to call a hymn on the Lord's coming without the proper sense.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why we stress that we need to follow the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To call a hymn on the Lord's coming without the flow is merely a legality; it is like serving a cold dish of food.</S>
