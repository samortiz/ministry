BEING THE NEW JERUSALEM,<br />
AND THE ISSUE OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE<br />
BEING BABYLON THE GREAT</h2>
<p>The tree of life signifies the union of God and man, and it issues in the New Jerusalem. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies the mixture of Satan and man, and it issues in Babylon the Great. The Bible begins with two trees and ends with two cities: Babylon the Great and the New Jerusalem. Babylon the Great is the mystery of Satan (Rev. 17:5). The New Jerusalem is the mystery of God. Babylon the Great is the mystery of Satan mixed with man; that is, Satan is one with Babylon the Great even though he cannot be seen. The union of God and man is also a mystery. Man cannot see God, but God can mingle with man. This mystery issues in the New Jerusalem. Throughout the ages Satan has been building Babylon the Great in order to destroy the New Jerusalem. However, God has been destroying Babylon the Great and building up the New Jerusalem. In the end God will triumph; Babylon the Great will fall (14:8; 18:2), and Satan&rsquo;s hideout will be completely torn down. With no place to hide, Satan will be bound by God (20:1-3). After Babylon the Great is destroyed, the New Jerusalem will appear (21:2). The New Jerusalem is the city of God, His dwelling place. The New Jerusalem is the issue of the tree of life. A river of water of life flows in the city, and on both sides of the river of water of life grows the tree of life (22:1-2). Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a mystery with the tree of life as its content, and Babylon the Great is the issue of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>Human society is a part of Babylon the Great, because it is full of the development of good as well as the development of evil. Religion, including Christianity, has always been involved with the development of good. Christianity helps Babylon develop the good side of the tree of knowledge. Inadvertently, even Christians who love and fear the Lord help the development of the good side of the tree of knowledge. Society talks about loving people, religionists talk about loving people, and those who love and fear the Lord also talk about loving people. However, this is not of the tree of life; it is the good side of the tree of knowledge.</p>
<p>We talk about loving people, but if our love is of man, not of God, it is still of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and belongs to the mystery of Satan. We need to be saved to the point of contacting God, enjoying Him, and taking Him as our life. When we take God as our life, His love will be lived out from us. This love is completely different from our human love. Human love is the development of good, but God&rsquo;s love is the issue of life. Human love belongs to Babylon, but God&rsquo;s love belongs to the New Jerusalem. Human love is the development of the mystery of Satan, but God&rsquo;s love is the development of the mystery of God.</p>
<p>We need to be enlightened to see that God and Satan are two trees, two paths, and two issues. The two trees are two sources: one tree is the source of life, and the other tree is the source of good and evil. One path is of life, and the other path is of good and evil. One issue is the mystery of life, the New Jerusalem, and the other issue is the mystery of good and evil, Babylon the Great.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, those who surrounded Him continually asked what they should do (John 6:28; Mark 10:17; cf. Matt. 19:16). Such questions only develop the good side of the tree of knowledge. When Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, came to consult the Lord Jesus, He said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (John 3:3). This is the Lord turning people from the good side of the tree of knowledge to the tree of life. The Lord came to the earth to save man from the tree of knowledge, particularly from its good side, to the tree of life.</p>
<p>The New Testament, especially the Epistles, stresses the tree of life (Rom. 5:10; 1 Cor. 15:45; Gal. 2:20; Col. 3:4). When it does speak concerning matters related to conduct, they are presented as the fruit of the divine life in man (Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16). However, many who read the Bible do not see these matters in relation to the fruit of the tree of life in man; instead, they receive these portions as commandments that they should fulfill. Many cannot discern between the things of the New Jerusalem and the things of Babylon the Great; hence, they confuse good things related to the tree of knowledge with the things of life. We must be enlightened to see the source. If our love comes from God, it is of God and belongs to the New Jerusalem. But if our love is not out of God, it is the good side of the tree of knowledge and belongs to Babylon the Great.</p>
<p>At the end of the Bible there are two cities. Both cities are symbolized by a woman. The New Jerusalem is a woman, and Babylon the Great is also a woman. The New Jerusalem as a woman is called the bride (Rev. 21:2). This means that she is very chaste. Babylon the Great is called a harlot (17:1-5). This means that she is very impure and full of confusion, having both the good and the bad and mixing the good with the evil. In our gatherings may we be a chaste bride who has only the things of the tree of life. We must never be a fornicating harlot who mixes good and evil. Our gatherings should always be the New Jerusalem, not Babylon the Great. We should have only life flowing within; we must not be in the development of the tree of knowledge. May the Lord grace us to see this vision.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
