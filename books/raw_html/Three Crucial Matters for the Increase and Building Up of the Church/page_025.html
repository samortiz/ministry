<h1 class="title">THE NEW WAY BEING A WAY OF BLESSING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BURDEN IN CHANGING OUR WAY</h2>
<p>Based on our observations over the past few years, we have a heavy burden and feel that we must change our way. We need a new beginning. There is no doubt that God, the Bible, the truth, and salvation do not and cannot change. No one can change the fact that God created the earth. Man can go to the moon, but he cannot change the moon, nor can he change the earth. However, man&rsquo;s activities change, and his method of working and the tools he uses to work are constantly changing. Over the past six thousand years the methods used by human beings for transportation have continually improved. These improvements are evident to everyone.</p>
<p>In the church life, however, there has not been much improvement in the way we meet, preach the gospel, serve, and shepherd the brothers and sisters, even though there are many things that can be improved and need to be changed. Twenty years ago factories, commerce, and methods of communication were outdated in Taiwan, but Taiwan&rsquo;s present advancement in technology is recognized all over the world. Taiwan has improved to the extent that it is considered modern. In the same way the church life should advance. This does not mean that we change the truth or salvation but that we must improve the church life. The Bible is unique, but we should consider the way we read and teach the Bible. According to our practice of the new way, we established home meetings for nourishing new believers. However, we need to research the best way to carry out the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING <em>LIFE LESSONS</em></h2>
<p>In our research to find the best way to nourish the new believers, we have tried two ways. We first tried using the Life-study messages. I spent one week with the elders in America to present the crucial points in each of Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. This was to help them study the Life-studies. The elders were happy to receive the help, but they were unable to use the Life-studies to nourish the new believers. The problem was not with the material; rather, we did not know how to use the material. Therefore, we are now using another way. We are teaching <em>Life Lessons,</em> which consists of four volumes with twelve lessons in each volume. This is a total of forty-eight lessons. Using <em>Life Lessons</em> has been successful.</p>
<p>In the past the full-time trainees suffered when they went to nourish the new ones in their homes because they did not know what to say. Before we began the new way, the brothers who minister the word had a difficult time, and they dreaded Lord&rsquo;s Day morning because they were responsible to speak. Despite our numerous publications, it was difficult for them to select a topic to speak on. If their messages were shallow, many saints would not want to listen. If their messages were deep, no one would receive their speaking. The main requirement in leading a meeting is the Spirit and the Word. If we have the Spirit without the Word, the meeting will be empty, and if we have the Word without the Spirit, the meeting will be dead. We need both the Spirit and the Word. This is not easy. Should the topic of a good message be the heavens or the earth? Should it be the Lord Jesus or the Spirit? Should it be the church or the cross? Or should it be justification or salvation? It is difficult to find an appropriate topic.</p>
<p>For this reason, we put much consideration into the writing of <em>Life Lessons.</em> The first volume begins with the assurance of salvation and ends with knowing the church. In other words, it leads a new believer from being assured of his salvation to knowing the church. This volume also includes household salvation, clearance of the past, prayer, reading the Bible, knowing the true God, knowing Christ, knowing the Holy Spirit, and knowing the cross of Christ. The topics in this volume can be compared to a staircase because they lead a person step by step to know five great truths: the Bible, God, Christ, the Spirit, and the church. This is the content of the first volume.</p>
<p>Volume 1 ends with a lesson on knowing the church, and volume 2 begins with the negative matter of knowing the sects. The result of a person knowing the sects is that he desires to meet. Therefore, the second lesson is on meetings. The most important meeting is the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting in which we break bread to remember the Lord. After the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting there is a lesson on consecration. When a person is consecrated, he wants to serve the Lord, but because he is empty, he does not have the strength. He needs the inward and outward filling of the Holy Spirit. After being filled inwardly and outwardly with the Holy Spirit, he can preach the gospel and serve the Lord. When he preaches the gospel and serves the Lord, he sees the financial needs and participates in material offerings. This is the content of the second volume.</p>
<p>The third volume is somewhat deeper. It begins with being transferred into Christ, that is, being transferred out of Adam into Christ. Then it speaks of being joined to Christ, abiding in Christ, experiencing Christ, taking Christ as everything, becoming one spirit with the Lord, living in the fellowship of life, obeying the sense of life, obeying the teaching of the anointing, walking according to the spirit, and awaiting the Lord&rsquo;s coming. The last lesson is on being raptured to meet the Lord. The third volume begins with being transferred into Christ and ends with being raptured to meet the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus, volumes 1 through 3 of <em>Life Lessons</em> cover the entire Christian life. The fourth volume then gives a brief presentation of every aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation. It begins with the way to enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation through repenting, believing, and being baptized. Then it presents the contents of salvation: forgiveness of sins, cleansing of sins, propitiation, reconciliation, sanctification, justification, regeneration, renewing, transformation, maturity, conformation, and glorification. These lessons contain all the stages of salvation from believing to glorification.</p>
