<h1 class="title">AN OVERALL VIEW<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<p>In this message we will fellowship concerning the way that the Lord&rsquo;s work should go forward in Taiwan. In order for us to have a thorough understanding of the work, we must have an overall view of the progression of church history, and we must understand the general situation of Christianity today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROGRESSION OF CHURCH HISTORY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">No Creed but the Bible</h2>
<p>Around the year A.D. 90 the apostle John wrote the last book in the Bible, Revelation. This not only completed the entire New Testament; it also completed the divine revelation concerning the Lord. However, the books of the New Testament had not been collected together, nor had they been formally recognized. At the time of the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325, only twenty books of the New Testament were recognized; the remaining seven books, including the two important books of Hebrews and Revelation, had not yet been recognized. Without these two books, the New Testament would not be complete. Hebrews is one of the writings in Paul&rsquo;s ministry, and Revelation is one of the writings in John&rsquo;s ministry. With regard to the revelation in the New Testament, Paul&rsquo;s ministry is the most important, and John&rsquo;s ministry is the second most important. However, at the time of the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325, the New Testament contained only twenty books. These books were the basis for the creeds.</p>
<p>To this day Roman Catholicism and Protestantism take the creeds as the basis of their confession of the faith. Almost every denomination still recites one of the creeds and the Lord&rsquo;s prayer every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. According to their practice the basis of their confession of the faith is the creed, not the Bible.</p>
<p>Over the past one hundred fifty years, three large Christian groups formally announced that they did not care for the creeds; they cared only for the Bible. The first group that criticized the creeds was the Brethren. The Brethren said that they did not want any substitutes; they wanted only God&rsquo;s divine revelation, which is the entire sixty-six books of the Bible. The next group, which is the largest Christian group in America and even the largest denomination in the world, was the Southern Baptist Church. The Southern Baptists often say, &ldquo;No creed but the Bible.&rdquo; The third group to criticize the creeds was the Church of Christ. The teachings of this group are similar to those of the Brethren. The believers call themselves the Church of Christ, and they sometimes put up signs that say, No Creed but the Bible. Besides these three groups, we also have no creed but the Bible; thus, we can say that we are the fourth group. We were raised up in China. Since our beginning, we have repeatedly asserted that we do not care for the creeds, because they are unreliable and incomplete.</p>
<p>The portion of the Bible that the Council of Nicaea used to formulate the creed in A.D. 325 contained only twenty books. The seven books that were missing were Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation. Of the nine books from Hebrews to Revelation, only 1 John and 1 Peter were formally recognized at the time of the Council of Nicaea.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Council of Nicaea was to decide on the doctrine of the Trinity. However, the council did not use the book of Revelation, which contains important matters concerning the revelation of the Trinity. Revelation 1:4 speaks of the &ldquo;seven Spirits.&rdquo; These seven Spirits are the Spirit in the Trinity. The creed, however, does not refer to the seven Spirits; the creed speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but it says nothing concerning the seven Spirits. Seven books&mdash;Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation&mdash;were not recognized as the canon until A.D. 397 at the Council of Carthage. The entire New Testament was formally recognized only at that time. Hence, we have strong ground to say that the Council of Nicaea was not based on the entire Bible. Hence, we neither accept nor follow the Nicene Creed as a complete statement of our faith.</p>
<p>Since there were still arguments concerning the doctrine of the Trinity, after the Council of Carthage there was a constant succession of councils. After public recognition of the papal system in the Roman Catholic Church, there was no longer a need for church councils; instead, the pope made the decisions. The Catholic Church believes that Peter was the successor of Christ and that he was the Bishop of Rome; therefore, they recognize him as the first pope. The pope is the head of the Catholic Church, and his words represent the Catholic Church. Hence, the Catholic Church teaches that all believers must obey the word of the church. The Catholic Church does not base its teachings on what the Bible says, on what God says, or on what the Lord says; its teachings are based on what the church says. <em>What the church says</em> means &ldquo;what the pope says.&rdquo; Beginning in the sixth century until today, all disputes in the Catholic Church are decided by the pope.</p>
<p>Most Christians today take the sixty-six books of the Bible as the basis of their faith. Some Christians, however, base their faith on the creeds. Other Christians say that their faith is based on the creeds plus the decisions of the church councils, referring to the Council of Nicaea and the other councils that were called to discuss the basic matters of the faith.</p>
<p>In addition to the creeds, some groups do not accept all of the books of the Bible, and others accept more. Some Christian groups say that they believe the four Gospels, but they do not accept the Epistles of Paul. In the Catholic Church some books have been added to the Bible; they are in addition to the sixty-six books of the canon. These apocryphal books are fictitious. The Roman Catholic Church is not the only entity that prints Bibles with these fictitious books; the Bible Society also prints these books. There are even some preachers who quote the apocryphal books in their messages.</p>
<p>We recognize the sixty-six books of the Bible, which includes the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. We do not accept the apocryphal books that were added by the Catholic Church, nor do we base our faith on the creeds, because they are incomplete and were written without seven books of the Bible. Our faith is based on the entire Bible.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord's Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
