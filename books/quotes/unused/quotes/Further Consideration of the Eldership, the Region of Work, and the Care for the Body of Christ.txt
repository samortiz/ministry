We need Your Spirit, the Spirit of grace, and even the Spirit of supplication, that we may pray to You to receive Yourself as our grace
Lord, we like these three names in Zechariah 1:1 at an appointed time Jehovah will bless and Jehovah will remember
Paul's charge to us is that the 'new hands' should be considered carefully before being brought into the realm, the circle, of the eldership
About eighty percent of the brilliant young ones whom the Lord brought into our realm were spoiled by their pride
If we had fifty co-workers who would be able to go to help meet the present demand, it still would not be sufficient
Some brothers there promised us that they had the means to distribute these books all the way from Moscow to Vladivostok
Throughout the years, we have had many promising young ones, many crops, but when they were growing up, they got cut off by their pride
The middleaged brothers after staying in the Lords recovery about eighteen to twenty years may consider themselves as heroes in the recovery
Pride, the thought of being a hero, and opinions have been used by the enemy among us in the past seventy years
There may be three brothers in the eldership in a certain locality one is older, one is younger, and the other one is middle-aged
My burden in this elders' meeting is to try my best to fellowship with you all concerning the real problem among us today
Pride, the thought of being a hero, and opinions are the factors working something out secretly to damage one thing the Body of Christ
Christ does have a Body, but in practicality this Body has been crippled, annulled, and to some extent destroyed
If you have one of these three problems pride, the thought of being a hero, or opinions in practicality the Body is absent in your locality
In doctrine, it may not seem so good to say that the Spirit is the Body, but in actuality the Spirit is the Body
Locality as the church ground of a local church separates the church in existence but does not divide the church in essence
The saints who live in Atlanta have to be the church there, and the brothers and sisters in Anaheim have to be the church here
The churches in the Gentile world had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in solving the problems in teaching
The churches in the Gentile world also had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in supplying the physical need
The apostle Paul was endeavoring to raise up financial help, physical help, from the Gentile saints for the Jewish saints
Although the Spirit inspired the saints to warn him not to go to Jerusalem, he said that he did not care for his life
Since some of the Corinthian saints said this that is a strong evidence that Peters ministry and teaching were accepted by the Gentile world
The co-workers in the Jewish world and those in the Gentile world had pleasant and sweet fellowship with one another
All the above points show that all the co-workers in all the regions should do the same one work universally for the unique Body
There is a practical situation that is abnormal, and the biggest point of this abnormality is the different works
Thank the Lord that due to the riches of the truth, the Lord's recovery is being welcomed everywhere on the earth
In Paul's time, because of the lack of modern transportation and communication, it would have been logical to have the work divided
If we want to be those who are in the practicality of the Body we need to keep the oneness of the Body and maintain a good order in the Body
In our fellowship in this message, we want to address a few problems which have been existing among us for years
Until these problems are solved and removed, the church life will not have much peace, and the recovery will be greatly devastated
The source, or the root, of this present turmoil is the carelessness in our regard for the oneness of the Body
Through the formation of these national churches and the Protestant denominations, the oneness was slaughtered
Based upon this principle, the Presbyterian church came into existence because some desired to keep the truth of the presbytery
In the eighteenth century, Zinzendorf took the lead in the recovery of the initial stage of the church life in the unity of the Holy Spirit
The China Inland Mission which he formed was a mission established for going into the interior of China to save sinners

He visited us again in 1957, and this is when the problem with him arose over the truth concerning the ground of the church
Paul and Peter encountered the trouble concerning circumcision recorded in Acts 15, but they did not have any division
Even if the accusations they made were true, however, that cannot be built up as a case to justify their division
One of the tests of a genuine local church is that it should have universal fellowship with all the other local churches
Later they began to say that once an apostle establishes churches and appoints elders in them he should keep his hands off of these churches
To keep the oneness of the Body is actually to keep the oneness of the Spirit because the Spirit is the reality and the essence of the Body
Ephesians 4:2 says that we need to keep the oneness with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love
When a problem arose concerning circumcision, Paul and the brothers with him took care of it in the proper way
By taking care of Christ and by taking care of His Body, we will avoid division, keep the oneness, and maintain a good order in the Body
Let us come together with an open spirit to pray together, get into the Word, and check our situation with the Word in fellowship
To keep a pleasant, good, and beautiful order in the recovery, we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ
Not only should the younger ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the younger ones
If you do not care for what they have taught or done in the past and teach according to your preference, you will make trouble
For a brother to speak and the rest listen every Lord's Day in the church meetings annuls the functioning of the saints
If only a few brothers speak all the time, the riches in all the members of the Body of Christ cannot be released
The entire world, especially eastern Europe and Russia, is open to the truths which have been released in the Lord's recovery
We have seen from the training on Zechariah that when the Lord comes back, the remnant of Israel will have learned the lessons
We should respect one another, help one another, perfect one another in life, and complete one another in work
At His coming back we will be rewarded, and we will be His bride to match Him and to fight the war against Antichrist
After the recent training on Daniel and Zechariah, the view in the Bible, the divine revelation, is so clear to us
We should go on with our Christ, who is God's centrality and universality, so that we can fulfill His heart's desire
