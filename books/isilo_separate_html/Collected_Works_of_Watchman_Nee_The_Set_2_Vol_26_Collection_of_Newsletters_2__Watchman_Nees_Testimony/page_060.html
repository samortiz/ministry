I am thankful that you remember me from such a distance! When I went to Tsinan, I met Brother Liu T'ien Min there. Brother Liu had been to Kuang Jau and Ling Tzu to visit the brothers. He has now returned to Tsinan and will go back to Ts'ou County tomorrow. I was in Tsinan for about three weeks and had a total of sixteen meetings. I want to go back to Peking tomorrow or the day after. At first the brothers in Tsinan wanted me to live there, but Peking kept sending me letters telling me to hurry back. I must first return to Peking to see them and to consider the Lord's leading and arrangement. I hope you pray for me often! (Parts omitted.)</p><p>The brothers here have improved much recently and are very living. Among the local brothers, Brother Ts'ao is very solid.</p><p>Where is Brother Nee? When will he return to Shanghai? I hope you let me know! When will you leave Shanghai? I pray that you will tell me when The Christian and The Glad Tidings will be published. Greet Brother Ho Yueh Chiao and T'ang Shou Ling. May you have peace in the Lord! Greet all the brothers and sisters for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chung Chieh</p><p>The seventeenth at 8:00 p.m.</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS BRIEFS FROM VARIOUS PLACES</h2><p>(1) Brother Hu Ch'i P'u and Brother Hu Ch'i T'ang did some work in Hsiao Shan, Chekiang province. Brother Hu Ch'i T'ang preaches the truth concerning the church, and Brother Hu Ch'i P'u preaches the truth about God's will. The brothers there hope that the Lord's servants will go there often to work.</p><p>(2) A meeting has begun in Hu Shu of Hangchow. The Lord raised up a few faithful, obedient brothers who were willing to walk in the Lord's way: T'ao Chun Ai, Chen Fang, etc. The condition of the meeting is very good.</p><p>(3) Sisters Ku and Tso of the Gospel Hospital in Soochow have been forced to leave the hospital because their firm stand for the truth was unacceptable to the administrators of the hospital. The two sisters now live at 2 Kao Shuai Alley, Soochow. They are very happy to be worthy to suffer for the Lord's name.</p><p>(4) Brother Wang Teng Ming had another attack of stomach illness and is in the hospital recuperating. The illness was so serious that he could not eat or drink. He was anemic in addition to having stomach problems. The doctors decided that they had to operate, but they could not because of the anemia. Thank the Lord, there were several brothers who gave blood to Brother Wang because of the Lord's love. Two sisters who were nurses were led of the Lord to go to the hospital to serve our brother. For these reasons he became stronger, and the doctors operated on the ninth of this month. He is better now and can eat and drink. He will soon be able to leave the hospital.</p><p>(5) Brother Watchman Nee developed heart disease after the Overcomer Conference in Hangchow. He is physically very weak. He seems to have recovered now and has left Shanghai temporarily to rest. We hope that the brothers and sisters in all the localities will pray for him.</p><p>(6) After the Overcomer Conference in Hangchow, Brother Faithful Luk and Brother Chiang Tze Hang stayed in Shanghai for a few days. Chang Kuang Jung and Hsu Chung Chieh went to work in Swatow. Brother Philip Luan also came to Shanghai for a few days. Brother Witness Lee went to Chefoo for a few days. Their present travels can be found in the preceding articles, so we will not repeat them.</p><p>(7) Brother Huang Tsai Ch'ing is working in Ningpo.</p><p>(8) Brother Chiang Chun T'ien went to Ch'ang-ch'un in Manchuria last month.</p><p>(9) Brother T'ang Yen Ming has left Kung Ho City, Tai Shan, Kwangtung province and has returned to his old family home in Lo Ting. His address now is c/o Yi Feng Company, Su Lung Shu, Lo Ting, Kwangtung province.</p><p>(10) Brother Hu Ch'i T'ang, a responsible brother in the assembly in Pao Shan, was transferred by his company to Chiang Wan in Shanghai.

Sister Wang is now working in Soochow.</p><p>(12) Sister Ruth Lee and Sister Chang Chi Nien went to Hankow to rest after the Overcomer Conference in Hangchow. At the same time they are doing some work in the regions of Hankow and Changsha. They have already left Hankow and are passing through to visit the sisters in Chiu Chiang, Nanking, and Chen Chiang on their way back to Shanghai. They will probably arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month.</p><p>(14) Sister Miao Yun Chun worked in Shanghai after the Hangchow conference and is still here.</p><p>(15) Issue No. 37 of The Present Testimony has not been published, because Brother Nee was sick and is now traveling. The Christian was delayed by the registration process and by the preparation of the mailing list. Issue Nos. 2 and 3 will be published as one volume. Issue No. 3 of The Glad Tidings will be published soon, we hope. This all requires the prayers of the brothers.</p><p>(16) The Shanghai branch office of the Bethlehem Oil Company in Yi Lin Town, northern Kiangsu, has already moved back to northern Kiangsu.
