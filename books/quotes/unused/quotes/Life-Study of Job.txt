The book of Job is named after its writer Job whose name means hated or persecuted signifying what Job suffered of Satan the enemy of God
Since Christ destroyed Satan on the cross, we may think that Satan no longer has the 'civil right' to go into the presence of God
The book of Job is poetic in form, with the exception of chapters one and two and the last eleven verses of chapter forty-two
Job is the first of the five poetic books in the Scriptures; the other four are the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs
The contents of the book of Job are the expressions of the sentiments of godly men including Job his three friends and the young man Elihu
Their expressions were uttered before the law was given, yet their sentiments were filled with the principle of good and evil
They reasoned that Job must have been wrong in some regard or aspect and that the things which happened to him were a judgment from God
It is necessary that God exercise His governmental control over man and judge man according to His righteousness
In Acts 17:31 we are told that God 'has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated'
Some of God's judgments are temporary, like that on Sodom, and some are ultimate, like that at the great white throne
Concerning this 1 Timothy 524 says The sins of some men are openly manifest going before to judgment and for others they also follow after
Because some of Gods judgments are temporary and others are ultimate some people prosper and flourish even though they are sinful and evil
Job and his friends might have had different views in what they insisted on and debated about regarding God's judgment
It is evident that Job and his friends did not see the positive aspect of God's economy in dealing with His holy people
That is, God wants to strip, not to judge, His holy ones that He might gain them so that they might gain Him more
Throughout the centuries, many readers of the book of Job have had the same concept, thinking that Job suffered because of God's judgment
Even though you may not be wrong, suddenly certain things happen to you, and God uses these things to strip you
God stripped his all in order that He could be his all for his full transformation and conformation to the glorious image of God in His Son
They may know a little about regeneration and renewing, but most do not know anything about transformation, conformation, and glorification
Among today's Christians, the teaching concerning such matters is lacking because the revelation regarding them is lacking
In Job there is no further revelation concerning this, for the revelation in this book is not clear, complete, or perfect
Since Job is such an early book, it does not contain a clear revelation of God's purpose in dealing with His people
In Paul's Epistles we see that God's purpose in dealing with us is to strip us of all things so that we may gain God more and more
In addition to being perfect inwardly and upright outwardly, Job feared God positively and turned away from evil negatively
Integrity is the totality of being perfect and being upright; it is the totality of perfection plus uprightness
Job possessed seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a great many servants
Job's sons would hold feasts in each one's house, each on his own day, and they would invite their sisters to eat and drink with them
Because feasting, an excess in eating, can be worldly, Job sanctified his children after their days of feasting
He still has given Satan a certain limited time so that he can do something to meet some negative need in the fulfillment of God's economy
Without Judas, how could the Lord Jesus have been betrayed, and without being betrayed, how could He have gone to the cross?
He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a great many servants
If we read this carefully, we will see that God's boasting here was with the intention that Satan would do something for Him
In verse 11 Satan went on to say, 'But stretch forth Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face'
Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your hand; only do not stretch forth your hand against him'
We should not think that God was caught by Satan, for Satan was caught by God to do something for Him to strip Job for God
Satan, an evil angel, was willing to do what none of the good angels was willing to do, and he immediately accepted God's commission
Satan's evil concept concerning God's dealing with His seeking people is based on his commercial principle of gain or loss
In Job 1:12b-19 we see that Satan attacked Job and that Job suffered trials in the matter of his possessions and children
They had struck the servants with the edge of the sword, and only the messenger had escaped to relate these things to Job
At the end of Satan's first series of attacks, Job did not pray but blessed God without sinning or charging God with unseemliness
They could not speak anything because they had no knowledge, no understanding, concerning the purpose of what had happened to Job
In His plan, God held a council twice and checked with Satan twice concerning Job, and Satan fell into God's plan
Job was contented in the realm of success in his gaining of material things and in his ethical attainments, but he had nothing of God
Today we have the New Testament, especially the writings of the apostle Paul, who completed the divine revelation
The desire of God's heart is that we would gain Him in full as life, as the life supply, and as everything to our being
Concerning the day of his birth, he said, 'Let that day be darkness;/Let God not seek it from above,/Nor let light shine upon it'
Job's experience of God's consuming and stripping in the Old Testament was far behind that of Paul in the New Testament
Paul was born destined to be crucified, and he was reborn crucified that it would be no longer he who lived but Christ who lived in him
After much consideration Paul said that he still preferred to live, not to die, because to him to live was Christ
Job considered his suffering of affliction something very heavy, but Paul considered his affliction momentary and light
How much weight of glory we will have depends on how much we suffer in our present affliction for the Lord's sake
Paul magnified Christ by living Him, whether through life or through death, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
God's intention was not to have a Job in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but a Job in the line of the tree of life
After God created Adam, He placed him in front of two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
God then charged Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for if he ate of that tree, he would die
If Adam had eaten of the tree of life, this tree would have entered into him and then would have grown within him
At Job's time the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was only two thousand years old, but now it is six thousand years old
In every human society, regardless of the kind of ethics it has, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is growing
In our practical, daily living, are we in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil or in the line of the tree of life?
In chapter four we have the beginning of the first of the three rounds in the debates between Job and his three friends
In verse 6 Eliphaz asked Job, 'Is not your fear of God your confidence,/And the integrity of your ways your hope'?
He said that the innocent and the upright will never perish and that those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble reap the same
Speaking in a poetic manner, Eliphaz continued, saying, 'By the breath of God they perish,/And by the blast of His anger they are consumed
Eliphaz should have asked Job how much of God he had gained, but at that time the divine revelation had not reached such a level
Job was suffering and was waiting to receive something from his friend, but Eliphaz did not minister anything to Job
He admonished him not to reject God the Almighty's chastening, so that Job might be blessed by God in His ways
Eliphaz said to Job, 'Behold, blessed is the man whom God corrects;/Therefore do not reject the chastening of the Almighty
The book of Job shows us that God, through Satan as an ugly tool, was tearing Job down by two ways: stripping and consuming
He said, 'Oh that my vexation were weighed indeed,/And that my ruin were lifted onto the scales together with it!
In his speaking Job surely was different from Paul, who rejoiced triumphantly when he was about to be martyred
Job said to them, 'To him who is fainting there should be kindness from his friend,/Else he will forsake the fear of the Almighty
He also compared them to brooks that were turbid, dark, because of ice and snow and that were eventually scorched by the sun and became dry
Job told his friends that they treated him not as a friend but as merchandise over which people bargain regarding the price
Although Job knew these things, he did not know God in reality, and he did not know anything concerning God's economy
He had no idea that God had no intention to increase his perfection, uprightness, righteousness, and integrity
Rather, God's intention was to strip all these human virtues which he had as his contentment, that he could seek and gain only God Himself
As we are practicing the New Testament way we desire to nourish to feed all the saints that they may be perfected equipped to speak for God
Many have been members of the Body of Christ for years, but still they cannot speak even a short word for Christ
We may talk about Christ, but we may not live Christ or have the practice of appreciating Christ or exalting Christ
When we come together, whatever we do our singing, praying, speaking, prophesying will be an expression of Christ
Through such blessings the Triune God becomes one with all His beneficiaries making them the church the Body of the One who fills all in all
God could not speak such things to Job and his friends because their kind of spiritual culture was very primitive
After challenging God, Job turned to his friends, blaming them for not showing kindness to him, who was fainting under the striking of God
He expressed that he had the common knowledge of the struggle, the vanity, the trouble, the suffering, and the end of human life
Of trying to attain to the peak of integrity, Job needed to do his best to pursue God, to pursue Christ the person directly
Bildad claimed that all the disasters and the plague on Job were not Gods perverting of justice or the Almightys perverting of righteousness
Bildad thought that Job's children might have sinned against God and that God delivered them into the hand of their transgression
To be fair, Bildad might have had some ground to say this, since Job's children were killed while they were feasting and drinking wine
In his rebuttal there was no flavor of being enlightened in the divine revelation and no taste of being spiritual in the divine life
His rebuttal was utterly powerless to convince Job, who was higher in things concerning God than his contemporaries
Job was also in darkness, daring to challenge God, and this opened the way for his friends to speak in darkness
Job was saying that he already knew what his friends were talking about and that they did not need to speak any more about it
After asking how a man can be righteous before God Job said If he is pleased to contend with HimHe cannot answer Him one thing in a thousand
It was not God's judging but God's stripping, consuming, and tearing down that He might rebuild Job with God Himself
God kept His intention hidden throughout the ages, not telling Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, or any of the prophets
The Creator did a lot in His creation, but before the New Testament time He did not unveil to anyone what His purpose was
Not knowing this, Job misunderstood God and thought that God was angry with him and was judging him and punishing him
God knew that after Job had passed through a time of suffering he would be rebuilt and become another person a new man in Gods new creation
Zophar taught Job that God the Almighty is unlimited, higher than heaven, deeper than Sheol, longer than the earth, and broader than the sea
In verse 12 Zophar said, 'An empty-headed man acquires intelligence/When the foal of a wild ass is born as a man'
In his despising and even sarcastic speaking here, Zophar went so far as to liken Job to a foal of a donkey without any intelligence
He would forget misery, and his time would rise more brightly than the noonday, or, though dark, it would still be like the morning
The eyes of the wicked will fail, the way to flee will be lost to them, and their hope will be to end their breathing
In this message we will begin to consider Job's superiority complex, accusation against his friends, and arguments with God
As a concluding word he said to his friends, 'Behold, my eye has seen all this;/My ear has heard and understood it
In verse 28, referring to himself, Job said, 'Such a one is like some rotten thing that wastes away,/Like a garment eaten by moths'
Realizing that God had marked his paths and had set limits for him , Job wanted God to explain the situation to him
As we have pointed out, Job did not know God's purpose concerning him, although he believed that there was a purpose hidden in God's heart
The Bible which consists of sixtysix books begins with God and His creation in Genesis and consummates with the New Jerusalem in Revelation
After God's rebuilding with the divine constitution we, like the Lord Jesus, become divinely human and humanly divine
Before incarnation Christ was only divine, but after His incarnation He became a God-man, a man with the divine nature
Having been regenerated by Christ, we have become a part of Him, and now we are the same as He is divinely human and humanly divine
In our reading of the Bible, we need to focus our attention on God's eternal economy for the divine dispensing
Job and his three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, were in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The first thing God had to do was to strip Job, consume him, and tear him down so that he would become nothing as a person under suffering
Job said that he wanted to argue with God and even 'litigate' with God in 'court,' making himself the plaintiff and God the defendant
It is extremely important that we consider the vital aspects of the answer to Job revealed in the New Testament
From this we see that the incarnation was God's coming out of eternity into time, to enter with His divinity into humanity
According to the revelation of the New Testament, the death that Christ died on the cross was all-inclusive and also vicarious for us
Not only so, in resurrection He was made the life-giving Spirit --not just a God-man but a Spirit that gives life
After His resurrection the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples during a period of forty days, and then He ascended to the heavens
In this message we will continue to consider Job's arguments with God and then go on to Eliphaz's rebuke and warning
Whereas there was hope that a tree which had been cut down would sprout again, there was no hope for a man who had been laid low
A man lies down and does not rise up;/Until the heavens are no more, he will not awake,/Nor will he be roused from his sleep'
It seems that Job was too sensitive and that he was deeply troubled psychologically as a result of being in the realm of good and evil
Finally, Job claimed that God destroyed the hope of man, prevailing forever against him, changing his countenance, and sending him away
Eliphaz said that Job's knowledge was as vain as wind, without the fear of God and restraining godly meditation before God
The fifth item is the ascension of Christ with the pouring out of the consummated Spirit to produce the church
All the other items unveiled in the New Testament are related to these ten main items either directly or indirectly
Other believers argue about matters such as presbytery and about what kind of musical instruments if any may be used in the church meetings
We need to learn the items of God's economy not merely objectively, in a doctrinal way, but subjectively, in an experiential way
How can we have the experience of being a part of the church, the Body of Christ, the new man, and the organism of the Triune God?
Because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and coinhere, when the Father is present, the Son and the Spirit also are present
Before the incarnation the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were the one God in eternity, who had not yet been processed
By passing through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, this unique God was processed
By passing through these five sections of His process, the unique Triune God was processed and consummated to be today's Triune God
In the New Testament we are charged to be regenerated by this Spirit and to receive the divine life through this Spirit
You should not do anything, for whatever you do will be in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Job complained that God had worn him out and had desolated all his company though there was no violence in his hands and his prayer was pure
Job went on to say that his mockers were provoking him, even though he was upright, righteous, and held fast to his way more strongly
In verse 9 Job declared, 'Yet the righteous man will hold fast to his way,/And he whose hands are clean will wax yet stronger'
Bildad concluded, 'Surely these are the dwellings of the unjust,/And this is the place of him who does not know God'
In his complaint against his friends , Job asked them how long they would grieve his soul and crush him with their words
Job complained that God had subverted his cause and had compassed him about with His net in violence and without justice
In his extreme sensitivity Job felt that God had treated him in this way, but surely God did not do such things to Job
Job went on to say that God had walled up his way so that he could not pass and that He had put darkness upon his paths
Job's hope had been to build up the 'tree' of his integrity, but God would not allow such a tree to grow within Job
Job claimed that God had also kindled His anger against him and that in Himself He considered Job as His adversary
Job then said that God's troops had come together and had cast up their highway against him and had encamped all around his tent
Although God was stripping Job, He surely was not angry with him; neither did God consider Job as His adversary but as His intimate friend
Job went on to say that his bones cleaved to his skin and to his flesh and that he had escaped by the skin of his teeth
He asked his friends to pity him, for, according to his feeling, the hand of God had touched him and God was persecuting him
If we do not have a complete vision of God's economy, we might think that Job's word, 'My Redeemer lives,' is very good
He told them to be fearful of the sword, for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, that they might know that there is a judgment
In his anger toward Job, Zophar said that his own disquieting thoughts answered him, and hence haste was in him
Zophar continued by saying that he heard the reproof that humiliated him and that the spirit of his understanding answered him
In his teaching of Job Zophar said that the joyous shouting of the wicked is short and that the rejoicing of the profane is for but a moment
Regarding the wicked person, Zophar said, 'Like a dream he flies away and is not found;/Indeed he is chased away like a vision of the night'
Zophar claimed that though wickedness is sweet in the mouth of the wicked, his food in his bowels is the venom of asps within him
Finally, Zophar taught Job that because the wicked knows no respite in his craving, of that which he desires he will save nothing
Zophar concluded his teaching by saying, 'This is the wicked man's portion from God/And the inheritance decreed to him by God'
In this message we will consider the word of Job in chapter twenty-one and the word of Eliphaz in chapter twenty-two
Finally, Job concluded that the prosperity of the wicked is not in their own hand and that their counsel is far from God
Job continued by asking whether the wicked become like straw before the wind and like chaff that the storm carries off
Speaking to his friends, Job said that he knew their thoughts and devices to wrong him by saying, 'Where is the house of the prince?
Next, Job asked who would declare the way of the wicked one to his face and who would repay him what he has done
According to Job, when the wicked is borne to the grave and kept by a watch, the clods of the valley are sweet to him
In verse 34 Job asked his friends why they comforted him with vanity, for their responses left only falsehood behind
As a result, according to Eliphaz's logic, snares were around Job, dread and darkness troubled him, and an abundance of waters covered him
The main point in verses 21 through 30 is that according to Eliphazs logic the Godseeking righteous man will be blessed and delivered by God
The teaching of Eliphaz may seem to be very good; however, its source is not divine revelation but human logic
Eventually this entity will be enlarged and consummated to be the New Jerusalem as the fullness the corporate expression of God for eternity
In the New Jerusalem we can also see the divine attributes expressed through the virtues of humanity for eternity
In the New Testament there are many divine titles, such as Father, Lord, Master, Redeemer, Savior, the Lord of all, and the King of kings
Galatians 3:14 shows us that the Spirit is the aggregate, the totality, of the divine blessing of the gospel given to us
Such a blessing includes redemption regeneration the divine life righteousness justification sanctification transformation and renewing
We should do everything and be everything by the Spirit, with the Spirit, in the Spirit, and through the Spirit
We should pray by the Spirit, read the Bible by the Spirit, love others by the Spirit, and preach the gospel by the Spirit
The incarnation was the beginning of God's move, which is for God to come out of eternity into time to enter with His divinity into humanity
Some who hold this view regard the three of the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as three separate persons
After many years of study and experience, we can say that this understanding of the Triune God is not accurate
On the evening of the same day, He came to the disciples and breathed Himself into them as breath, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Ten days later, on the day of Pentecost, He descended to pour out Himself as the economical Spirit on the disciples
As a result of all the steps of this process God is no longer the raw God God before His process but the cooked God God after His process
The consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God is the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit
Today He is the reality of the Father He is the reality of the Son and He is the Spirit not before the incarnation but after the descension
In Galatians this Spirit is the Spirit of blessing, the all-embracing and all-inclusive blessing of the gospel
In contrast to Job, we have the 'cooked God,' the God who has been processed so that we may eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him
Job was terrified at His presence and was in dread of Him, feeling that God had made his heart faint and that the Almighty had terrified him
For morning is to all of them like the shadow of death,/Because they are acquainted with the terrors of the shadow of death'
From his previous speakings Bildad might have learned the lesson that the way to lose the case and to appear foolish is to speak too much
Concluding that this is impossible, he said, 'Behold, even the moon has no brightness,/And the stars are not pure in His eyes
Each step of this process has become an ingredient of the Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God
Next came the ingredient of resurrection, which is a matter of passing through death without being held by death
Through resurrection Christ was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God , and through resurrection He also became the life-giving Spirit
Finally, we have the ingredient of Christ's descension as the all-inclusive Spirit to produce the church, His Body
As we consider all these ingredients, we can see that the processed and consummated Triune God is much richer than the 'raw' God
In the Spirit we have the three of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit with all the steps of God's process as the ingredients
He had not yet been processed and consummated through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension
We need to see that we are living at a great time the time after the Triune God has been processed and consummated
Our unique need as Christians is the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit
We praise the Lord that it is not we who need to fulfill the New Testament requirements but the Spirit in us who fulfills them
Remember, the Spirit is our God, our Father, our Lord, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Shepherd, and our life and life supply
Our God is the processed and consummated Triune God, who is the consummated, all-inclusive Spirit as everything for our Christian life
In Acts 2 we see the pouring out of the consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit upon God's chosen people
The Spirit is the consummated Triune God, and the bride is the regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified tripartite man
In this message we will begin to consider, from chapters twenty-six through twenty-eight, Job's final speaking to his three friends
Job's friends only had the knowledge about such matters as being good in order to please God and to receive prosperity
Job concluded by saying, 'Behold, these are but the fringes of His ways;/And how small a whisper do we hear of Him!
He declared that as God lives and as long as his breath was in him his lips would not speak anything wrong nor would his tongue utter deceit
In verses 8 through 23 Job continued by teaching his friends high-mindedly concerning the hope of the profane man
Job asked about the hope of the profane man when God cuts him off, taking away his soul and not hearing his cry
After this, Job went on to instruct his friends regarding the portion which the wicked man would receive from the Almighty
None of his friends needed this teaching; they already knew these things and could have taught concerning them
In chapter twenty-eight Job went on to show off his high-pitched knowledge concerning the way to find wisdom and understanding
He said that God, who sees to the ends of the earth and beholds all that is under heaven, knows the place of wisdom and the way to it
Job went on to say that, in his excellent past, he was eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, and a father to the needy
Job chose the way for them and sat as chief, dwelling 'as a king among the troops,/As one who comforts those who mourn'
Job also sighed over the fact that when he expected good, evil came, and when he waited for light, darkness came
God took these away in order that Job would pursue God Himself instead of other things, yet Job did not understand
God had His divine element with His divine attributes, but He did not have anything related to incarnation, humanity, and human living
According to 2 Corinthians 3:18, the God whom we are looking at today is different, for He is much richer in His ingredients
It is hard to say, however, in what way Job saw God, whether in a physical way or in the way of a spiritual revelation
In our morning watch, even if only for fifteen or twenty minutes, we have time to be with the Lord, time to remain in the Spirit
We will have the sense that we are receiving something of God's element, that we are absorbing the riches of God into our being
We all need to see a clear comparison between the way taken by Job and his friends and the way revealed in the New Testament
On the one hand, Paul suffered in order to gain Christ; on the other hand, he suffered for the building up of the Body of Christ
In verse 25 Paul went on to say that he became a minister of the church according to the stewardship of God to complete the word of God
In this sense we may speak of the deification of the believers, a process that will consummate in the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is a composition of Gods chosen redeemed regenerated sanctified transformed and glorified people who have been deified
In order to practice his uprightness, righteousness, integrity, and perfection, Job restrained the lust of his flesh in fearing God
He did not make gold his hope or call fine gold his confidence, and he did not rejoice because his wealth was great
Job said that he did not rejoice at the misfortune of the one who hated him, exult in his suffering, or curse his life
Job's boasting here indicates that he was in the realm of human ethics, not in the realm of the divine economy
Through his eight times of speaking to his three friends, Job exposed himself, exposing many negative things concerning himself
In his speaking to his friends, Job complained that God was not fair in treating him in an unexplainable, severe way
Job was a person groping in darkness and in blindness concerning his relationship with God according to what God wants
Athanasius one of the early church fathers said concerning Christ He was made man that we might be made God and The Word was made flesh
The way we must take today is the way of moving in the move of the Spirit and of having the Spirit moving in our move
If we allow ourselves to calm down when we are angry, we will be saved from making foolish mistakes caused by speaking or acting in anger
He desired to speak that he might have some relief, without respecting any man's person nor flattering any man
Elihu then declared that his words would manifest the uprightness of his heart and that his tongue would speak what he knew sincerely
Elihu corrected Job telling him that he was not right in saying I am clean and without transgressionI am pure and there is no iniquity in me
Elihu claimed that God speaks to men in two ways in a dream, a night vision, and by opening the ears of men and sealing up their instruction
Next Elihu corrected Job for saying I am righteousAnd God has taken away my right and It does not profit a manTo delight himself in God
Elihu went on to refute Job, saying that God would never do evil and that the Almighty would never commit iniquity
Rather, God will render a man's work to him and will cause a man to receive that which is according to his own way
In verses 12 through 15 he declared, 'Indeed in all certainty God will not do evil,/And the Almighty will not pervert justice
Toward the end of this speech, Elihu asked Job, 'Should He recompense to fit you, since you have rejected it'?
By reading chapter thirty-four, we can realize that Elihu was a person who was full of the knowledge of good and evil
Elihu continued by teaching Job that men cry out to God because of oppressions and cry for help because of the mighty arm
Elihu went on to say that Job had said that he did not behold God, that his cause was before God, and that he had to wait on God
The speaking of Job, of his three friends, and of Elihu was altogether lacking in the exercise of the spirit to contact God
Of exercising their spirit, they exercised their mind to compose poetry and to make a display of their knowledge
The word spirit refers not to the Spirit of God but to the human spirit as the organ for us to realize and respond to God's move
While he was in spirit, John saw a number of visions, resulting in his writing the twenty-two chapters of the book of Revelation
John saw the lampstands as the symbols of the churches , indicating God's economy concerning the Body of Christ
Eventually, John saw the new heaven and the new earth with the ultimate consummation of God's economy, the New Jerusalem
If we are this kind of person, others will not be able to understand us because in spirit we are moving as our God is moving in us
When we turn to our spirit and get into our spirit, even while we are driving, we may sing, praise, or rejoice
There is no other way to be a lover of God, to be a seeker of Christ, or to be an overcomer than to be in spirit
If you are a person in the spirit, then you will be in the spirit to meet God, to see God, and to stay with God
When you have Christ, you have the church because Christ is the Head of the new man and the church is the Body
When you are in the spirit the matters of the local church will come to you and this will cause you to pray for the situation of the church
These prayers are the real, prevailing prayers because you pray in your spirit and because, in spirit, you are moving in the Lord's move
Elihu also said that those who hear God and serve Him 'will spend their days in prosperity/And their years in pleasantness'
Next, Elihu warned Job that he was filled with the judgment of the wicked, telling him that judgment and justice had taken hold of him
In 36:26 Elihu declared, 'Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him;/The number of His years we also cannot search out'
Finally, in his last word to Job, Elihu instructed Job to fear God, who does not look upon any who are wise of heart
Try to exercise your spirit, because the very God, our present God, our God today, is right in our spirit with all His bountiful supply
The last part of the Bible from Acts through Revelation covers the matter of the divine Spirit who is now in our spirit to become one spirit
When you come to the vital groups, you should turn to the spirit, remain in the spirit, and exercise the spirit
Our speaking concerning a saint who is sick should not be in ordinary words but in words from the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit
The move of the Triune God today is altogether in the two spirits, in Himself as the consummated Spirit dwelling in our regenerated spirit
Chapters thirty-eight through forty-one, which we will consider in this message, cover God's appearing to Job with the divine unveilings
The situation here certainly was not one of coming to the throne of grace to receive mercy and grace to meet the timely need
In His questioning of Job, Jehovah first asked him, 'Who is this who darkens counsel/By words without knowledge'?
Eventually, Job would have to admit that it was he who darkened counsel by speaking words of nonsense, words without revelation
Jehovah's question here indicates that He regarded Job as a fault finder, as one who was contending with the Almighty
In previous messages we have emphasized the fact that God's dealing with His people is not for judgment or for punishment
In reading this book, we need to learn of Job, of his three friends, and of Elihu to be silent and let God be the only one to speak
Job 38:4-38 covers the divine unveiling concerning the universe, including matters related to astronomy and geography
Onto what were its bases sunk,/Or who laid its cornerstone,/When the morning stars sang together/And all the sons of God shouted for joy'?
The revelation regarding the purpose of God's dealing with Job had to wait until Christ came and until the apostle Paul was produced
Job 42:7 tells us that God condemned Job's three friends for not speaking concerning Him that which was right, as His servant Job had
Job felt that, according to his conscience, he had not done anything that required God to come in to judge him or to punish him
Job's three friends, however, insisted that Job's sufferings were a proof that he had done something wrong and was being judged by God
God, in His progressive revelation, did not make His purpose in dealing with His people clear to Job at his time
God charged Job's three friends to go to Job and offer a burnt offering for themselves that God's servant Job might pray for them
All the physical blessings with which God blessed Job were to show Job God's lovingkindness and faithfulness in his latter days
As an example, brothers, of suffering evil and of long-suffering, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord
You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen his end from the Lord, that the Lord is very tenderhearted and compassionate'
In 40:10 God said to Job, 'Deck yourself now with majesty and excellency,/And array yourself with honor and splendor'
In verses 12 and 13 God went on to say, 'Look upon everyone who is proud; bring him down;/And tread down the wicked where they stand
God was telling Job that he should look at himself and realize that he was proud, even though he had no reason to be proud
God was indicating to Job that he should be abased, that he should be hidden in the dust and even buried there
Rather, He considers all these things as frustrations and intends to strip them away from us, consuming them bit by bit
As a result of this transformation, you will be a person reflecting God, that is, expressing Him and dispensing Him to others
God wants to transfer you from your present realm into His realm, not only to make you one with Him but even to make you a part of Him
Many believers have no understanding of the economy of God or of the divine dispensing according to the divine economy
If you want to teach them about these matters, you must do so in a very gradual way, beginning with the most elementary things
We all need to realize that today there are two different realms the realm of the old creation and the realm of the new creation
The realm of the old creation is the realm of natural things, and the realm of the new creation is the realm of divine things
We may also say that His humanity was 'sonized,' meaning that He became the Son of God not only in His divinity but also in His humanity
The Bible indicates that God's consummation will, in principle, come through God's move among the descendants of Japheth
We need to see the completed divine revelation in the entire Scriptures concerning God's relationship with man
In the fulfillment of this type, something came out of Christ the divine life to become the church, which is the bride to match Christ
God regarded man, that is, respected man, and was pleased with man, not in man's good doing, but in the burnt offering
In the time from God's creation of man to the calling of Abraham, God also judged the rebellious man at Babel, which was the ancient Babylon
The second dispensation covers the period of time from the calling of Abraham to the decree of the law through Moses
In addition, God promised Abraham that in his seed, the coming Christ, all the nations of the earth, including us, would be blessed
The third dispensation is the period of time from the decree of the law through Moses to the first coming of Christ
God gave Abraham the promise, yet his descendants did not know themselves, considering that they could do everything God required
In this dispensation God promised the people of Israel that He would be incarnated through them to be their Christ
As another part of His relationship with man, God promised the people of Israel that He would pour out His Spirit upon all flesh
What they had received of their forefathers could reach, at most, only the level of the revelation in the age of Abraham
In this life-study of Job, my principle has been to study Job in relation to the divine revelation in the Bible as a whole
After all the speaking of Job, his three friends, and Elihu, we have God's appearing to Job with the divine unveilings
God asked Job many questions about the universe and about the animals to impress him with the fact that He is unlimited
Because Job was in the primitive stage of the divine revelation, God could not have spoken to him about all these things
As an illustration of our difficulty in understanding the divine things, let us consider the case of Nicodemus in John 3
If Nicodemus could not understand something that takes place on earth, how could he understand the things that take place in heaven?
In John 16 the Lord told His disciples that although He had yet many things to say to them, at that time they could not bear them
Of speaking to Job regarding these things that were on His heart, God asked him about other things, including himself
Following this, there was an attack upon Job's body, and this led, through his daily sufferings, to the gradual consuming of Job himself
God's answer to the book of Job is the completed divine revelation in the entire Scriptures concerning God's relationship with man
In resurrection Christ also became the life-giving Spirit for the producing and the constituting of the Body of Christ
By Christ as our righteousness we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life
By Christ as our sanctification we are being sanctified in our soul that is transformed in our mind emotion and will with the divine life
In Colossians 1:15-19 we see that God wants to make Christ, the embodiment of God, everything to us, the believers of Christ
At the end of the book of Job, after all, God came in, indicating that what Job was short of in his human life was God Himself
Up to the age of Job, there was not a revelation like what is positively, clearly, and fully unveiled in the New Testament
We will be able to speak of these things to others, not only in personal fellowship but also in the church meetings
If we know these items, we will be able to give messages on them, prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ
Fallen man also needed to receive Christ as the seed of the woman that he might be delivered from Satan the 'serpent's' death-power
All these matters the sacrifice with its blood, the coats of skins, and the seed of the woman are found in Genesis 3
As a redeemed person, man needed to offer Christ as the burnt offering that he might be regarded, respected, by God
Spiritually speaking, it is significant that, in the sequence of books in the Scriptures, the Psalms comes after Job
The book of Job, preceding the Psalms, is a record of human views based on human concepts concerning the relationship between God and man
The book of Job does not indicate whether Job or his three friends or Elihu sought to gain God as their attainment and enjoyment
In Psalm 1 the psalmist was seeking after God, yet he did not seek God directly, but made the law of God the goal of his seeking
In a significant part the book of Psalms is mixed with the divine revelations of Christ with God in His house and in His city
Although the book of Job contains very little of the divine revelation, this book nevertheless has a particular function in the Scriptures
The book of Job ministers to its readers a picture of man's concept concerning God's dealing with His holy people
The function of this book is to expose the deficiency of the divine revelation in Job's age, which was quite primitive in knowing God
Our contentment with what we know of God is a hindrance to our progressing in the understanding of the divine revelation
Finally, the book of Job functions to serve the Bible readers with a capacity to understand the secrets of the next book, the Psalms
We have seen that our principle in this study of Job is to study this book according to what is revealed in the Bible as a whole
Regarding God's dealing with Job, there were certain mysterious things, and these things are to some extent unveiled in the Psalms
The psalmists were right in seeking after God, but they were not right in making the law of God the goal of their seeking
Next, the Psalms ministers to the Bible readers, in their ignorant seeking of God, the all-inclusive Christ in God's economy
We need to study the Psalms in order to learn the details concerning this all-inclusive Christ in God's eternal economy
In these messages we have been considering the significance of the book of Job according to the Bible as a whole
In the divine revelation in the holy Scriptures there are two trees, two sources, two lines, two principles, and two ends
God and the Lamb are not sitting side by side on the throne; rather, God is in the Lamb much like light is in a lamp
Out of the throne of God and of the Lamb that is out of the one God flows a river and on the two sides of this river grows the tree of life
God created man breathing into him the breath of life which became mans spirit but at that time He did not put Himself into man as mans life
Before eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve were ignorant, not knowing, so they had no sin
When the rich young ruler came to the Lord Jesus and called Him, 'Good Teacher,' the Lord Jesus said, 'Why do you call Me good?
Surely todays television and so many different kinds of newspapers and magazines are branches of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The first tree is the source of men who seek God as life for their supply and enjoyment, of whom Abel is the leading one
The second tree is the source of men who follow Satan as their poison unto death and eternal perdition, of whom Cain is the leading one
These two ways the way of life and the way of death lead men to the two Godordained ends the New Jerusalem and the lake of fire respectively
Just as there is life in a grain of wheat, within the human shell of Christ's physical body there was the divine life
He went to the cross and died, and the death of the cross broke this human shell and released the divine life to produce many grains
Peter 2:2 says that as newborn babes we need to drink of the milk of the word so that we may grow unto salvation
When we perfect the saints, we minister Christ to them, dispensing Christ into them not only as milk but also as solid food
The divine dispensing is carried out by the Spirit of life as the life-giving Spirit with His bountiful supply
When we were attracted by Christ, believed in Him, and called on the name of the Lord Jesus, a living person entered into us
When we were saved, the Spirit came into our spirit to regenerate our spirit, to enliven our spirit, and to be mingled with our spirit
To live a normal Christian life is to care for the two spirits the divine Spirit in our regenerated human spirit
When we contact the Lord, when we pray to Him, and when we praise Him, our part is to receive His dispensing, and His part is to dispense
