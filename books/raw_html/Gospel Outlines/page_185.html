<h1 class="title">JESUS IS ABLE TO SAVE TO THE UTTERMOST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Heb. 7:25</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Jesus is God coming as man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus is God coming as man to become man&rsquo;s Savior.</li>
	<li>Because His power is the power of God, there is no limit to His power.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jesus&rsquo; redemption is eternal
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because He is God coming as man, and God is eternal, His redemptive work on the cross is eternal.</li>
	<li>Eternal means limitless and measureless. His redemptive work has an eternal, measureless effect.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jesus is living forever
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus not only died to accomplish redemption, but He also resurrected.</li>
	<li>Jesus not only resurrected, but now He is living forever.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jesus is always interceding
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus died and resurrected not only to become man&rsquo;s Savior, but also to become his intercessor before God.</li>
	<li>Just as His redemptive work is eternal, so also is His intercession for man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jesus is able to save to the uttermost
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus is God coming as man, whose redemption is eternal; He is living forever and always interceding. Thus, because He is fully qualified, He is able to save men to the uttermost.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;To the uttermost&rdquo; means that He is able to save men not only for all time and eternity, but also to the uttermost in extent.</li>
	</ol></li>
