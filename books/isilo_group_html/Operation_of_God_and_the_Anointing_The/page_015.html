<p>In the late 1820s the Lord raised up the British Brethren and gave them substantial spiritual light. In the early twentieth century He raised up Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis. She knew the cross and knew the truth concerning the believers&rsquo; co-crucifixion with Christ. She was helped by the mystics, just as Brother Andrew Murray was also helped. Mrs. Penn-Lewis read almost all the writings of Madame Guyon. She even wrote a summary of one of Madame Guyon&rsquo;s well-known books, <em>Spiritual Torrents;</em> this summary was published as <em>Life out of Death</em>. The writings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis are rather weighty, and those with spiritual experience acknowledge that Mrs. Penn-Lewis was spiritual. However, believers in the Brethren Assembly oppose Mrs. Penn-Lewis. These believers have seen the light of the cross but neglect the experience of the cross. They do not understand that light is comparable to theory and that experience is comparable to practice. Hence, we must not focus merely on objective truth while neglecting subjective experience.</p>
<p>The mystics, however, were too much in experience. For example, Brother Lawrence knew more about God from seeing a leaf fall. In principle this is right, but focusing on experience can become a problem. Those who read the writings of only the mystics can become narrow. The Bible says that everyone who believes into the Lord will have eternal life (John 3:15; 6:40) and that whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved (Rom. 10:13). However, the mystics say that a person must answer the Lord&rsquo;s solemn call before he can be regenerated. Their so-called answering the Lord&rsquo;s solemn call refers to overcoming. It is a mistake for them to regard regeneration as being related to the growth of spiritual life. As soon as a person calls on the Lord&rsquo;s name, he receives the Lord&rsquo;s life. This is regeneration. The mystics, however, say that regeneration is not complete until Christ lives and reigns in a person. This overemphasis of experience is in conflict with the light. This is one of the reasons that there have been disputes among believers in church history.</p>
<p>The Lord has shown us the light seen by the Brethren, and He has also shown us the experience of the mystics. The universe is filled with air, but we receive air one breath at a time. Similarly, the universe is filled with Christ, but in order to experience Him, we need to receive Him as our life in our being and in the small things of our living. I am concerned that many of the Lord&rsquo;s seekers in the churches still focus either on light or on experience. If they would accept both light and experience, there will not be a problem. Light is profound and revelation is high, but we experience them in simple and small ways.</p>
<p>Based on the light that we have seen, we will consider our experience. Second Corinthians 4:7 says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels.&rdquo; This means that the One who fills all things has come into our earthen vessel. Hence, we should not thank and praise the Lord by saying merely, &ldquo;You are the universe. You are all things.&rdquo; We should praise Him further by saying, &ldquo;Lord, You are in me, an earthen vessel.&rdquo; This is according to experience. In order to experience the divine life, we must first see that the Christ who fills all things is in us. For this reason, Paul says, &ldquo;Do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you?&rdquo; (13:5). Not only so, the treasure in us manifests the excellency of the power of God (4:7). We must know this if we want to pursue and experience life. The Gentiles do not know that there is a treasure in us, but we must know this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSECRATION AND LOVING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Like Paul, those who know the treasure and pursue to live out the life of this treasure should be determined to gain the honor of being well pleasing to the Lord (5:9). They should also be constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love to no longer live to themselves but to the Lord who died for them and has been raised (vv. 14-15). This is to love the Lord and to consecrate ourselves to Him. We need to see the Lord&rsquo;s love and consecrate ourselves. We can pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am determined to stop living to myself but to live to You. You died for me, and You have been raised.&rdquo; This is the second life exercise.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>Third, we must see that the Holy Spirit lives in us and that we must use our spirit to fellowship with the Lord by beholding His beauty and by letting His image become our image through transformation. Second Corinthians 3:17-18 says, &ldquo;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; This is fellowship. After consecration, there should be fellowship. Hence, when we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we must fellowship with Him so that He can live in us and live out of us. Fellowship causes us to grow in the spiritual life.</p>
<p>The fellowship in 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 includes the teaching of the anointing in 1 John 2:27 and the operation of God in Philippians 2:13. We must put these three passages together. The Lord Spirit is in us; hence, we need to open to Him and fellowship with Him so that He can have the opportunity to anoint us and to operate within us. When we receive the teaching of the anointing and follow His operation in us, we will be transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image. This is to have Christ formed in us (Gal. 4:19) and to let Him grow in us (Col. 2:19). Hence, as those who love the Lord, we must consecrate ourselves to Him and fellowship with Him. Fellowship brings in the growth of life, which leads to our being transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Operation of God and the Anointing &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
