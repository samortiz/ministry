   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Isaiah 66:1-2 the Lord seemed to say, "Heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool for My feet.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What else do I desire?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am looking for those who are poor and of a contrite spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I want to enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are the place of My rest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have been in heaven long enough.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I desire to come into man."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Read the Bible again to see whether our God wants to stay on the throne in heaven or He wants to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you bow down to Him again, He would say, "Forget about it!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have had enough of your bowing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rise up, rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How about taking two bites of Me and drinking two mouthfuls of Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you say, "Lord, I dare not eat You or drink You," the Lord may say, "You have been poisoned by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Satan has poisoned you with the poison of religion in that apparently you are worshipping Me, yet in reality you are far away from Me, and you dare not contact Me. I don't want your worship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I want you to eat Me. I desire to come into you and live in you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am here proving that today you and I need to turn from the concept of worshipping a great and high God to the enjoyment of the lowly and small Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yes, He is the Lord of all, the most high God, yet today He has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Greek word for spirit is pneuma, which also means breath.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If your tire has no air, that means it is without pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our Lord, the dignified and high God, is our breath, our air.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not try to revere Him by putting Him so high.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is high enough; tens of thousands of angels bowing down to Him are enough for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He needs us to eat Him day by day and even moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the subjective experience, the subjective viewpoint, in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From the Scripture verses used in this message we can see that Christ not only gives us authority to become children of God, but He also lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Upon hearing us say that Christ lives in us, the opposers say, "Don't you know how great Christ is and how small you are?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Can such a small person like you contain Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, this is what Galatians 2:20 says: "It is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only so, in chapter four it says, "I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you" v. 19 . We have to thank the Lord and say, "Lord, I am such a small man, yet You live in me wholly, and You will be formed in me."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, Ephesians 3 says, "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith" v. 17a . The complete Christ is making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is not only our life and our food; He also indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our heart is His home; He lives and moves in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has become our person, and we have become His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How subjective this is!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These are the subjective truths and the subjective viewpoint in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Traditional Christianity does not see this, and some in it even oppose this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we do not oppose this; rather, we are enjoying it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thank You!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only are You in me as my life, but You, as a whole entity, live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You will be formed in me, and You will make home in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My whole being is Your dwelling place."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What will be the issue of the Lord's living in us in such a way?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The issue will be that we are "filled unto all the fullness of God" v. 19b . This is God and we, we and God, completely united and mingled.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are filled with all the fullness of God, and we are the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The opposers say that this is to create gods and to teach that man can evolve into God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They say this due to their blindness and ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, today we know for a fact that our Lord lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that every one of the saints in the Lord's recovery will testify and say, "I know for a fact that our great and high Lord, the Lord of all, is my life, my breath, my living water, and my food.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He lives in me to be my everything."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are two sides to the truths in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yes, on the objective side, He is the Lord in heaven, who is above all and who is dignified and great with majesty and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, on the other side, this Lord is actually in me, speaking to me, fellowshipping with me, walking with me, as well as supplying, supporting, and comforting me all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I am empty within, He fills me there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is truly my life within, and He is my inward supply.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every one of us has certain religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without being taught, we know that God is the greatest and the highest One.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today the most difficult thing is to get rid of the religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You need revelation to see that this Lord today is also the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As the breath of life He is in us to be our life, our supply, our strength, and even our person.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul said, "For to me, to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 ; he also said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not to evolve into God; rather, this is a glorious transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ lives in me; hence, to me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is subjective.</S>
