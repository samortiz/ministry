   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE BODY, ONE WORK, AND ONE WAY OF RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord desires to recover this one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You should not think that I control people or try to wield power over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we were in Shanghai and Brother Nee was leading the church, some gifted ones came into our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They could preach the gospel and work, and they knew that the way of the Lord s recovery was right.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, in their view, this territory was occupied by Brother Nee, and so by remaining in the recovery, they would have no way to gain their own territory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, they left the recovery, and some of them became famous preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many of the Chinese evangelists who are now famous were among us at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some formed their own groups, others established their own work, and still others gained honorary doctorate degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They knew that this was the Lord s unique way, but they wanted their own work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is only one way, one Body, and one recovery of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Brother Nee was raised up, he pioneered the way, and it was difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are his successors.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By the Lord s grace I can say that when Brother Nee was taking the lead, I was submissive and did not dissent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although he and I were only two years apart, I never had an opinion about him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I never dissented in the co-workers meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the work of the ministry, I did whatever I was asked to do; I had no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have often said that I can submit to any person because I can submit to one person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Nee showed me the way of the recovery, and for this reason I submitted to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1934 Brother Nee was going to be married in Hangchow, and he asked me to be his best man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The marriage stirred up a great turmoil for him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When he came to Shanghai, we met, and I tried to comfort him, saying, Brother Nee, there is no natural friendship between us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am taking this way because you have led me to see that this is the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please be at peace, even if you give up this way, I will still take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am taking this way not because there is a relationship between us, but because I have seen that this is the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if you give it up, I will still take it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope the young brothers and sisters would see this way and would be able to say to me, Brother Lee, you have led us to take this way, but we want to tell you that even if you give it up, we will still take it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our God is uniquely one, and all the things in the universe created by Him are one in substance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, everything related to the church is intrinsically one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christianity is in a situation of apostasy because its numerous divisions deny this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the Lord s church is essentially one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are here to bear the testimony of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to see that the Lord s church is one, the Lord s Body is one, and the Lord s recovery is one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I gave you sweet soymilk to drink every day, it would be easy to say that this is the church, but since I give you hot and sour soup, it is not as easy to say that this is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When things are palatable for some saints, they speak loudly and highly of the church, but when they taste things that are hot and spicy, they often leave and begin to speak differently.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are thoughtful and our eyes are opened, we will not be easily deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to know why we are here; otherwise, we will leave this way and come to a dead end.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who were with us and then left tried to do another work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, the work they accomplished became dissipated; it was, at most, a transient success.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, we can testify that Brother Nee was imprisoned for twenty years, and until the time of his departure to be with the Lord, his work was not transient.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though he is dead, he still speaks, and his words have reached the uttermost parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Fifty years ago Brother Nee led me to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I followed him because this way is the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today, fifty years later, I am happy to say that I am still taking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Under the covering of the Lord s precious blood, I would say that no Christian work can compare with the work of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This work is being spread on all five continents.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is by the Lord s mercy and grace that I can say that no other Chinese preacher has had as much influence in preaching the truth and building up the churches among English speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not even a Galilean fisherman; I am a fisherman from Chefoo, which is smaller than Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Peter did not have a theological degree and neither do I, but the Lord s work among us has truly been blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are not blind followers, and many of you have received a higher education.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you compare the Life-studies and the other messages put out by this ministry with the books published in Christianity, you will see the preciousness of our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When people taste what we are offering, they truly appreciate our food.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Regrettably, some believers who use our messages are not willing to acknowledge their source.</S>
