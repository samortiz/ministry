   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This chapter is a continuation of the previous chapter concerning what we observed during our trip abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In these days God wants to recover one church in one city as His practical testimony on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a recovery will meet the inward, spiritual needs of the believers in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is also what the Lord earnestly desires.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have not seen this light as clearly as we do today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even when I was in Shanghai, my view was not this clear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were enlightened concerning the building up of the church until 1953.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Over the past five years my view of the building has become clearer, my burden heavier, and my understanding richer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are not the first messages being released on the building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We emphasized the building up of the church in past trainings and conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I spent three years, from 1955 to 1957, to speak concerning the building in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By the Lord s leading, I have gained a deep impression during this trip that there is a need to build up the local churches in order to have a house for the satisfaction and rest of both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God should have a house because He has so many children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can a person have many children but not have a house?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today God has many children, but He does not have a house on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not be proud, but if we stopped the meetings in Taipei, we would not have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am not speaking of the importance of this work merely because this is our work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If this is the work of man, it can be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Where should a child of God meet if he goes to Kaohsiung?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where can he find a home?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A casual believer who is indifferent to God s desire or a believer who lives in the world is not interested in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, a believer who has a heart for the Lord and lives in His presence will be homeless in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wherever we go, God does not have a house, even though He has so many children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are objective and sober and consider this matter from God s point of view, we will realize that God has many children in many places, but He does not have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have never had a burden as heavy as this during my thirty years of serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither have I had a burden as definite as this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the need in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most of the places that we visited were large cities.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We were in more than twenty countries and visited thirty large cities and over twenty smaller cities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We did not rest; we tried our best to observe the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We initially planned to go to Berlin, but we were told that Berlin no longer occupies an important position since it is not the capital of Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We therefore changed our itinerary and went to Zurich, Switzerland.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We tried to visit large cities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, we gained the same impression wherever we went: every place has a need for the house for God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The three largest cities in the world New York, London, and Tokyo have thousands of Christians, but they do not have a house, a dwelling place, for God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Wherever we went, we saw that the children of God have this need.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>HAVING THE GOSPEL AND LIFE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>BUT STILL NEEDING GOD S HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This realization strengthens me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I sense that God will recover His building among His children.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the same time, we have to see that God has raised up many believers to work for Him, but not many can meet the need of His building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In America Billy Graham preaches a genuine and living gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I attended a crusade that he held in San Francisco, and I can testify that the gospel he preaches is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has a genuine burden for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was truly raised up by God to preach the gospel in America.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brother T. Austin-Sparks is a believer who lives before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His exercise to live before the Lord is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I can testify that Brother Sparks does not seek anything outside of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is genuinely learning to live in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even though our way and the light we have received differs, I can testify concerning his living before God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May the Lord cover me to say that apart from the work of these two brothers, according to my observation, the activities in Christianity are either insignificant or are conducted to gain a following.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is difficult to find a person with a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This situation shows the widespread desolation on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Surely the Lord is great.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He can still use believers who seek their own gain for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God can even use Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, people everywhere are still being genuinely saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, these believers have a need, and no one is meeting this need.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brother Sparks saw that the children of God are hungry, and he wants Honor Oak to be a place that supplies food.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He wants to be like Joseph, and he wants Honor Oak to be a place that gives people food, just as Egypt did in the years of famine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is his intention.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, during my trip I saw that the children of God do not need only food.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s children need a house.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not enough to supply them merely with food.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is also the need to give them a place to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The children of God are at a stage where it is not sufficient merely to be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They need a house, a place of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The function of a house includes supplying food.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The most important matter in a home is to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But not every place that gives food is a home.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Restaurants are places where people can eat, but they are not homes.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The most practical need of believers today is to have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, the difference between what Brother Sparks sees and what we see is this matter of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Brother Sparks says that it is sufficient to supply spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We say that there is still the need for God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I was at Honor Oak for only a few days, but I felt this need.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brother Sparks gives the saints food, but they are still homeless.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Nearly everyone at Honor Oak longs for a home, a place of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What I observed strengthens this feeling within me and assures me that this is exactly what God wants to do in these days.</S>
