   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIGHT AND THE WORK OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God works through His light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His work in man begins with light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The work in Genesis began with light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With light there was the separation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the fourth day, the light took on tangible shapes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 9, the Lord healed the blind man with the spittle mixed with clay vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1-11; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mark 8:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Clay signifies the flesh and the earthly things, while the spittle signifies the Lord's divinity, which produces something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This life becomes the light of man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord mixing spittle with the clay means that divinity is mixed with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord's incarnation is the best illustration of the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The spittle and the clay signify the light of life in divinity mingled with humanity to produce the anointing, which brings healing to the blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the blind man was healed, he did not see clearly at first; he saw men walking as trees.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord touched his eyes again, and when the blind man looked a second time, his eyes were fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This signifies that believers sometimes receive light but are still not too clear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They become clear only after they have received further light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can testify from our experience that light is cumulative.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The light that we have today is far more than the light we received years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>MISCELLANEOUS FELLOWSHIP The Destruction of Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We praise the Lord for the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If Jerusalem had remained, there would still be sacerdotal sacrifices, and the priestly service after the order of Melchisedec could not have been instituted.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the temple had not been destroyed, the believers would have esteemed the physical temple and not considered the church as God's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Finally, when worship centers around an outward physical building, the believers no longer worship in spirit and in reality see John 4:21-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Doing God's Will</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A worker must learn to know God's will and must learn to not work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Most workers know that once they have God's command, they should act according to such command.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But many people work even when there is no clear command from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Presumption is working without command, while disobedience is failing to work when there is a command.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In either case, this is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every worker can know God's will in a direct way, and there is no need for us to beg to know His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I assume responsibility for informing my servant about even the smallest task, such as fetching a small pair of scissors, how much more will the Lord be responsible for giving His servants detailed instructions for what He wants to do?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once we are clear about the Lord's will, we should no longer be affected by men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once Paul became clear of the Lord's will, he was bold to say that he did not confer with flesh and blood Gal 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did not compromise the truth with anyone, including Peter and John.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every worker of God must have a direct and subjective knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul was able to boast of "my gospel" Rom 2:16; 16:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His gospel was not from men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every worker should be able to boast as Paul did of "my gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Confession</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Confession is toward God and not toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we sin, we sin against God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, when we confess, we confess to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is wrong for anyone to confess to men in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The extent of confession should only be the extent of one's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If one commits a sin before God, he should only confess to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The confession in 1 John 1:9 is a confession before God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It means to call sin a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When God considers something to be a sin and we also call it a sin, this is confession.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As one believer said, "We should give sin the right name."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is what it means to confess to call sin a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many people confess their sins to men.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They think that once they confess their sins to men, their hearts will have peace, and they think that everything will be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet they have only confessed to men; they have not confessed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This kind of confession is only a performance; it has no value whatsoever before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It will not remove man's sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only the Lord's blood has the power to wash us of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although confession before men will render a person some psychological relief, it will not remove his sin-record before God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Oxford movement in the eighteenth century emphasized confession to men.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They only paid attention to the act of confession and neglected man's deliverance before God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Dr. Stearn once said that the salvation they spoke of was only a kind of psychological deliverance; it was not a genuine salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Confession alone cannot save men.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only the Lord's blood can save men.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First John 1:9 tells us that the Lord's blood can wash away all sins and unrighteousnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many people do not have an opportunity to settle with men the sins they committed in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, the thief who was crucified beside the Lord did not have an opportunity to confess his sins to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet he was still saved, because he trusted in the Lord's salvation Luke 23:42-43 .</S>
