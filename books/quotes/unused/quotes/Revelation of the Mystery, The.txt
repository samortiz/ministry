You will also conclude that the meaning of the heavens, the earth, and all things cannot be focused merely on human living
It is difficult to determine a direct answer to the questions concerning the true meaning of the universe and the true meaning of human life
There is only one book-the Bible-that clearly explains the meaning of the universe and the meaning of human life
If we would thoroughly get into these verses, we would see the meaning of the universe as well as the meaning of human life
God's desire is not to be expressed through angels nor through any other creature but to be expressed through man
If man had not fallen and sinned and even if Satan the devil did not exist in this universe God would still desire to carry out this matter
God is a mystery because although God is a story in the universe, no one can explain Him or describe Him thoroughly
The United Nations is actually a group of quarreling nations because not one nation acknowledges Christ as the Head
We should be clear that when we say Christ is all, we refer to the reality of all the positive things and not the negative things
In John 10 the Lord said, 'I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall go in and go out and shall find pasture'
At the same time, it was the Lord Jesus who led him out of the fold, since He is not only the door of the sheep but also the Shepherd
Ephesians chapter three reveals that even the dimensions of the universe-the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth-are Christ
The breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe are immeasurable, and all of these dimensions are Christ
Ephesians chapter three says that when Christ makes His home in our entire being we will know what are the breadth length height and depth
Because of man's limited mentality, there have been many debates and different interpretations concerning the person of Christ
If you confess that the Lord Jesus is a man, then since man is a creature, you must confess that He is both a creature and the Creator
Today in Taiwan there is so much rich producedifferent kinds of grains fruits and vegetables plus chickens ducks and other kinds of meat
The emergence of the dry land from the death waters on the third day in Genesis 1 is a type of Christ who resurrected from the dead
Christ is typified not only by the light and the expanse but also by the land, which was raised out of the death waters on the third day
If people had such an enlarged view of Christ as all, then they would not argue, saying that Christ is the Son but not the Father
Since the first part of that line says, 'Thou became me,' it naturally follows that the second part should say, 'I became Thee'
Would it not be ridiculous for someone to say that four plus four equals eight but that eight does not equal four plus four?
The Lord is advancing in His recovery today, and the most important item in His recovery is the mingling of God with man
The Bible clearly shows us that as the source, Christ is the Father, and as the One who enters into us, He is the Spirit
Isaiah 9:6 says, on the one hand, that He is a child and a son, and on the other hand, that He is the mighty God and the eternal Father
When Saul of Tarsus was on the road to Damascus, the Lord Jesus suddenly appeared to him, saying, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
He saw that when he had been persecuting Stephen, he had been persecuting Christ, because Stephen was a part of Christ
On the day of his conversion, Saul of Tarsus was opened by the Lord to see that the church is the Body of Christ
Perhaps someone will ask, 'If a Christian goes to the movies, plays mah-jongg, beats people, and commits arson, is that person also Christ'?
Formerly every one of us was an old man, but today, having been saved, we are all in the church, and every one of us is a new man
To use the utterance of the Scriptures, our spirit as our inner man is the new man, and our flesh as our outer being is the old man
Those who have been completely renewed in the spirit of their mind can completely ignore everything of the old man
When others offend us, we will no longer become angry, nor will we feel offended, because the one who was offended was our old man
When he sees that, instead of being offended, you have put on the new man, he will also give up his natural being and put on the new man
If we truly see that the church is the new man, and if we put off the old man and put on the new, we will never be a problem in the church
If this is the case, we will spontaneously stand on the ground of the church, and there will definitely be the oneness
Every day we need to learn this basic lesson of turning to the spirit, putting off the old man, and putting on the new man
We need to see that because Ephesians speaks from the heavens, there is no need for help from the circumstances on the earth
God's grace is so sufficient that there is no need to have a great deal of outward help from the circumstances
Whether or not you have a wife, and whether or not you have the circumstances, you need to always put off the old man and put on the new
We must look to the Lord that the churches would not remain old but would remove all the oldness and become altogether new
It was not until recently that the Lord clearly showed us that the church is not only the Body but also the new man
We are pointing out this matter because when we read the Bible, it is not easy to find verses linking the church as the Body to the Spirit
It is also possible to see this in 1 Corinthians 12:13a, which says, 'For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body'
We were told that God deals with us through our wives, our husbands, our children, illnesses, and all kinds of adverse situations
The Spirit in the new man is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, who is the Lord Himself who went through death and resurrection
Ten years ago we saw that the church is the new man, but we did not see it clearly enough, and it did not become a burden in us
It is very interesting that the Bible does not put the word living in the record, yet we are able to discover it in our reading
The stone that the builders rejected is for the building as indicated by the builders' original intention to use it
Acts 412 says And there is salvation in no other for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved
He saves us not to bring us to heaven but to transform us, who are sinners made of clay, into stones with His stony nature and element
The seven eyes in chapter three are the seven eyes on the stone, and the seven eyes in chapter four are the seven eyes of Jehovah
In Zechariah chapters three and four there are the seven eyes on the stone, the seven lamps on the lampstand, and the seven eyes of Jehovah
The seven eyes on the stone, the seven lamps on the lampstand, and the eyes of Jehovah all speak of the same thing
Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain, and he will bring forth the topstone with shouts of Grace, grace to it'
Revelation 4:5b says, 'There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God'
The lampstand in the Holy Place is Christ, and the lampstand that came to the earth for the building of God is the Spirit
The Spirits shining shines God into us and His observing infuses Christs essence into us transforming us into stones good for Gods building
Jehovah stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
Zechariah mentions this because this book speaks of God's building, which absolutely depends upon the seven Spirits of God
On God's side there is the Spirit of God, which is the seven Spirits of God, but on our side there must be our spirit
If we would read the book of Zechariah as a whole, we would see that the building of the temple typifies the building of the church today
In order to clarify this, we may use the three sections of the tabernacle in the Old Testament as an illustration
The outer court which is outside of the tabernacle itself denotes the earth while the Holy Place typifies Gods dwelling place in the heavens
These lampstands are not two lampstands but two aspects or two ends of the one, unique lampstand in the universe
As the lampstand He operates on the earth and enters into us, His believers, thus producing the churches, which are also lampstands
The seven golden lampstands in Revelation 1 are the product, expression, and embodiment of the unique golden lampstand
In one aspect the lampstand is Christ, in another aspect it is the Spirit, and in still another aspect it is the church
According to the fact, the church is Christ, but according to our experience, the church is the embodiment of the Spirit
Strictly speaking, the church is neither a matter of being dealt with nor a matter of bearing the cross and being broken
If the substance of this stand was not wood, then no matter what color you painted it or however you disguised it, it would not be wood
The Spirit, signified by the lampstand, is for the producing of the church, which is the reprint of the Spirit
The golden lampstand in Zechariah is the original copy, and the golden lampstands in Revelation are the reprints
May this light shine thoroughly and brightly so that we who are in this age would see more clearly than the Christians twenty years ago
Only when you use a proper sheet of paper will the ink be immediately absorbed and the print will come out clearly
We may say that God dwells in us, but strictly speaking, He does not dwell in our mind or in our emotions but in our spirit
We need to be strengthened, not in our mind or in our joy, anger, sorrow, or delight but in our spirit, in our inner man
It is good to turn to our spirit, but we need to progress until our spirit controls our mind, that is, until our mind and our spirit are one
If we allow our spirit to control and direct our mind, our mind and our spirit will become one, and our mind will be subject to our spirit
Spontaneously, we will put off our old manner of life-the old man-and we will put on the new man-the church life
When we turn to our spirit, the Lord does not need to wipe away our tears because our spirit will turn back our tears
Once we get into the presence of the Lord, that is, once we turn to our spirit, the grievances, insults, suffering, and pain are gone
The problem is that we always focus on the breaking of the outer man instead of focusing on the release of the spirit
The seven Spirits are the essence and reality of the church, and our spirit is the best 'paper' for the reprinting of the seven Spirits
The Greek word that is translated economy denotes a kind of management, administration, government, or distribution
God has an economy, and in His economy there is an administration, a government, a dispensation, and a distribution
All that God is is high, divine, and mysterious, all that God has is bountiful, and all that God can do is boundless
Paul said that he was sent to preach these riches, that is, to preach what God is, what God has, and what God can do in Christ
The riches of Christ not only comprise what God is, what God has, and what God can do but also comprise His experiences as a man
The Spirit's strengthening us is Christ's making His home in us, and Christ's making His home in us is God's filling us
We do not have to wait until we have been strengthened by the Spirit in order for Christ to make His home in us and for God to fill us
The Spirit's strengthening us is Christ's making His home in us, and Christ's making His home in us is God's filling us unto His fullness
The Spirit's strengthening us, Christ's making home in us, and God's filling us are not three different matters
The church is the issue of the Spirit's strengthening us, Christ's making His home in us, and God's filling us
The church is not the result of the breaking of our flesh or the result of the rubbing away of our sharp edges
What the Bible presents is transformation, telling us that we are being transformed from clay to precious stones
The church is the result of our being filled, saturated, and occupied by the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit
The tree continually absorbs water and the riches from the soil, and in this way it is strengthened until it is full-grown
We may be able to break a clay pot into pieces and even grind it into powder, but we cannot turn the clay into a diamond
We should pray for the Spirit's strengthening, Christ's making home, and God's filling, and then the church will be produced
Most historians acknowledge the fact that those years were dark, but most do not realize what caused the darkness
We know, however, that the reason those years were dark was because at that time the word of God was completely sealed
Several northern European countries, such as Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, accepted the Lutheran church as their state religion
The reformers established the Lutheran sect and the Lutheran church, but they sacrificed the truth concerning the church
When Schwenckfeld found that Luther would not accept what he had seen, he went into voluntary exile, which lasted for many years
From this we can begin to understand why fundamental Christianity opposes us when we get into matters such as the Spirit of life
While the emphasis of fundamental Christianity is on doctrines, the emphasis of the Lord's reaction is on life
The experiences of Madame Guyon and Thomas a Kempis, author of The Imitation of Christ, leaned heavily toward asceticism
Those in the Protestant churches did not appreciate Schwenckfeld because he had been condemned by Luther, whom they highly respected
Most people, however, did not know how to apply mysticism, which, though it contained some genuine things, was too mysterious
He was a highly intelligent and very knowledgeable person and was also a proficient writer and capable speaker
In the first stage of his life, he laid great emphasis on doctrines, but one day his eyes were opened to see the inner life
After he experienced such a turn, he began to appreciate the teachings of mysticism, and he also simplified them, making them practical
The main matter that Andrew Murray learned was fellowship with the Lord, that is, contact with the Lord through prayer in spirit
He paid much attention to the matters of the power of the Holy Spirit, the filling of the Holy Spirit, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
Around 1925 the Lord used some whom He had raised up on the earth to show the church the resurrection of Christ
Today when many people read this book, they overemphasize the breaking of the outer man and neglect the release of the spirit
Nonetheless, when many people read this book, they pay attention to the breaking of the outer man and neglect the release of the spirit
Only when our spirit is released, can the Holy Spirit come forth, because the Holy Spirit is imprisoned in our spirit
You may speak a great deal about Christ, but if you do not have the Holy Spirit, you do not have the reality of Christ
Nee realized that the Holy Spirit is the reality of all spiritual matters and he also recognized the need for the release of the spirit
No matter how much you preach the dealing of the cross, and no matter how much you preach concerning resurrection life, it is of no profit
The only thing that is profitable is the Lord Himself in us becoming not only our life but also our life supply
When we live by Him, what we live out is the genuine life, the genuine spirituality, and the genuine church life
Regardless of how many years you have been saved, if you do not live in spirit, you are capable of doing any kind of evil thing
If we overemphasize them, we may easily fall into Hinduism, which mainly teaches people to suffer hardship and to be saved through suffering
There is a certain famous preacher in India who brought all these Hindu teachings on suffering into Christianity
As a result, today many Hindus have accepted Christianity, but their practical lives are still according to the Hindu practice of suffering
Church history tells us that in the beginning the Roman Catholic Church taught people to improve their conduct by enduring sufferings
They even had a special kind of chair with many spikes that people would sit on when they were aroused in their fleshly lusts
In Ephesians the cross is mentioned only once in relation to the fact that Christ has slain the enmity through the cross
The enmity was slain not for redemption or for salvation but for the Jews and the Gentiles to be created in Himself into one new man
Chapter five speaks about cleansing the church by the washing of the water in the word and removing the spots and wrinkles
We mentioned the Body of Christ, but after a certain amount of speaking, we reverted back to speaking about the cross
Suppose you have a newborn child who is less than twenty-four inches long and weighs only six and a half pounds
It would be better to permit him to be a little bit naughty and to make him eat plenty of food so that he may become strong
If you only discipline him, 'break' him, and deal with him, but do not give him anything to eat, he will be finished
Chapter four speaks about the Body arriving at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
In the past when we spoke on Ephesians, we spoke concerning the Body, but we did not preach the riches of Christ
We spoke concerning the growth, yet we did not touch the matter of how we may be filled unto the fullness of God
Many of our hymns, such as those on the exhibition of Christ and the enjoyment of the riches of the land of Canaan, were written after 1960
The Body of Christ is produced not by our teachings or by our cultivation and much less by our being dealt with
In the past we saw the church only as the Body, but we did not have much impression of the church as the new man
According to the might of His strength, God caused the power to be energized in Christ in raising Him from the dead
After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus overcame Hades, the earth's gravity, and the rulers and authorities of the air
Ephesians 320 says But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power which operates in us
Verse 16 says, 'That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit'
For this reason we may read Ephesians once, twice, or even a hundred times without anything echoing within our being
After some pursuing our concepts and ideas spontaneously turn to the cultivation of our conduct because of the lack of light and revelation
The Bible contains numerous passages that apparently resemble the teachings concerning cultivating one's conduct and practicing asceticism
When we hear this, most of us immediately focus on the breaking and forget about whether or not the spirit is released
Consequently, it is common for people to desire to be broken by the cross and to learn the lesson of the cross
Again, this confirmed my observation that merely having the teachings concerning the cross and resurrection is futile
In the church are the unsearchable riches of Christ and also the great power of Christ's resurrection, ascension, and transcendence'
We have pointed out that a person cannot be made to grow by beating him or telling him to learn certain lessons
The riches and the great power in chapter three are for the Body in chapter one and the new man in chapter two
After we receive the riches and the power, our feet can walk, our hands can do things, our eyes can look at people, and our mouth can speak
You may say that you are only a little member, but even the little members are gifts given by Christ to the Body
Every saved person is a member of the Body of Christ, and every member is a gift given by the Head to the Body
If we truly want to perfect him, every day we should feed him, not only three meals but even seven meals a day
If the church does not supply the believers with the riches of Christ, it is impossible for them to be perfected
Chapter one is on the Body chapter two is on the new man and chapter three is on the supply that is the riches of Christ and His great power
Suppose a young brother is led to learn the lessons of daily being broken, bearing the cross, being pressed, and weeping
If you wanted him to stand up and speak after two years of this kind of learning, all he would be able to do would be to weep before you
Immediately after saying that grace was given to us according to the measure of the gift, Paul told us where the gifts come from
When Christ ascended to the heavens, we did not see Him, but all the angels saw Him leading a train of captives
We must realize that we were formerly Christ's enemies and were all in the same train with the devil and the rebellious angels
Since you have this knowledge, some may wonder why you are so involved with Jesus and why you go to the meeting hall every day
We have indeed been captivated by the Lord, because by His one look He has infused Himself into us as the Spirit
The stature of Christ has a measure, and we all must arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
If we eat, we will grow, and we will arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
Eventually, we will no longer be little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men
The latter half of chapter four says that we should put off the old man and put on the new man to have the church life
We also need to minister to others in order to cause the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love
In the previous message we said by way of indication by way of inference that the matter of eating is referred to in Ephesians chapter four
Ephesians 4 reveals that the perfecting of the gifts is to cause us to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things
The basic principle of eating is to take something outside of you and assimilate it into your blood cells that it may become a part of you
In Christianity today the Lord's words are neither spirit nor life but have become letter, doctrine, knowledge, and death
We really need a spirit of wisdom and revelation, which the apostle Paul prays at the beginning of Ephesians that the believers would have
It is because these things have existed in our concepts for a long time, and as a result, we do not need revelation regarding them
If you talk to monks and nuns about asceticism, they do not need any revelation and can understand immediately
Without your repeated urging and charging, they have a clear understanding of self-mortification the moment you speak about it
Without revelation it is difficult for us to understand them, and we immediately deviate from their original meaning
To remove the sheet is to unveil, to reveal; however, if there is no light and it is still dark, one still cannot see
The problem today is that within us we all have natural things, and these things are just like flypaper that one hangs to catch flies
When a person is saved and comes into the church, immediately he has the thought that from that day onward he must behave properly
They may preach from their natural concept, saying things such as: 'Since we have been saved, we should glorify God in our daily walk'
There is no need to teach people such things, because this view has been in them since long before they were saved
Some preachers may go further to say, 'We are too hard, so the Lord has to strike us and subdue us through the circumstances'
The Bible is not without revelation, but when people read the Bible, they often touch only the surface, not the substance, the revelation
We read about the unsearchable riches of Christ and the great power within us, yet these matters also just slide away
When we come to 3:20a, which says, 'To Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think,' immediately we are impressed
Similarly, concerning the phrase to Him be the glory in the church , we also may not see what this means after reading it a hundred times
We may read the verses containing the revelations in the book of Ephesians a hundred times and still not see anything
Strictly speaking, since the seed that was sown into the soil contains all the riches of life, eating is not necessary
Every seed contains all the riches of its life, and every kind of life has three characteristics: its substance, its function, and its form
A peach tree will grow fruit bearing the shape of peaches, and an apricot tree will grow fruit bearing the shape of apricots
Since the life in you is the life of Christ, regardless of how you grow, you will never grow into the likeness of the devil
From this perspective, we can say that what is needed today is not for us to eat, but for us to allow the seed to develop
In other words suppose you were not allowed to prayread to call on the Lords name to turn to your spirit or to pray what would you do
The next day you do something else to try to help it somewhat, and then you try to pull on the sprout to help it grow
The problem is that, because we do not have a strong and clear revelation, although it seems that we understand, we really do not understand
If we are truly clear, we will need to pray-read more, but the nature of our pray-reading will no longer be the same
We will need to turn to our spirit even more, but our turning now will be different from our turning before because we have seen the vision
When we see a big peach tree with hundreds of peaches on it, do not forget that five years earlier the peach tree may have been only a seed
In any case, the substance of life, the function of life, and the shape of life were all contained in that seed
We simply help them to see that Christ is already in them and that He needs the opportunity to spread out of them
Our proper living is not a matter of learning lessons nor a matter of enduring sufferings and bearing the cross
Two different Greek words are used in the New Testament for word: one denotes God's constant word and the other denotes God's instant word
In principle, of course, the words which the Lord speaks to us within will never contradict His constant words in the Bible
The Bible does not have this word, but actually in the Christian's experience of life, this kind of word may occur frequently
When the church is being sanctified, she is being cleansed, and when she is being cleansed, she is being sanctified
The combination of these twosanctifying plus cleansing and cleansing plus sanctifyingis what is called transformation in the New Testament
As referred to in the New Testament, on the one hand, transformation is a sanctifying, and on the other hand, it is a cleansing
In Greek, the meaning of nourishing and cherishing implies feeding the body so that it is always kept warm and soft
After another ten minutes the coldness will reach his knees, and fifteen minutes later the coldness will reach his thighs
Verse 11 says, 'Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil'
The reason we do not have to ask him where we should stand is because he tells us clearly in the first five chapters
Today many Christian preachers preach from Ephesians with a very natural view, saying, 'Oh, brothers, make sure that you do not fall!
We should stand in our visionsin Gods eternal purpose in the allinclusive Christ in the unsearchable riches of Christ and in the great power
If others in the church still like to hear good sermons or messages, you need to stand and not be dragged down by them
Today we must see that Ephesians is not talking about filthy things such as dancing playing cards being seduced and falling into temptations
Suppose someone else were to say, 'Our meetings have become lifeless, so we need to ask Brother So-and-so to come here'
Ephesians 6 says that we need to receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit by means of all prayer and petition
Anything that is contrary to the vision of God, the fullness of Christ, and the great power within us has to be slain
Do not kill the brothers and sisters, but kill the old way, kill the religious way, and kill the unwillingness to stand
Perhaps two months after reading this, someone will come to you and speak some persuasive words, saying, 'Look at your church here
You also need to rise up and share something one after another, sharing something that is fresh and full of supply
If everyone stands up to release Christ and minister His riches, the older ones will say, 'This meeting is really fresh!
On the one hand, we thank the Lord that the churches are solidly for the Lord's recovery and for the Lord's unique ground
Even if you threaten to break us, crush us, and make hamburgers out of us, we still will not be able to sing well
Young brothers and sisters, you must influence all the churches on the whole island of Taiwan and all those in Southeast Asia as well
