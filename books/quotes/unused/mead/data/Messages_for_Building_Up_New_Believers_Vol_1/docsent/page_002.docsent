   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF NEW BELIEVERS A Talk with Co-workers on July 12, 1950 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF NEW BELIEVERS One</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the very beginning of his Christian life, every new believer should be taught emphatically to have no trust in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose a brother is saved at the age of forty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the past forty years, he has lived in the world, squandered his days in sin, followed the customs of this age, and been bound by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For the past forty years, he has lived according to his own temperament and walked according to his own concepts, feelings, and ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now that he is saved, he absolutely should not have any further trust in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He should have a strong distrust of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christians have standards.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are standards for the Christian life, Christian ideals, and Christian ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who do not know these standards do not know the meaning of being perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They arrogantly boast about themselves and are prone to be satisfied and confident in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who do not know these standards take wrong to be right and right to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only those who have learned the lessons and who know these standards can tell others what they should not do and what they should not say.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only they can differentiate between right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The building up of a new believer consists of teaching such a one the standards of the Christian life so that he can walk accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first thing a new believer needs is a total and thorough breaking down of this past.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why did the Lord say, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens Matt 18:3 ?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that our past living was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We lived in vanity, and our former days count for nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all should have to have a fresh start.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The regeneration that is spoken of in John 3 shows us the need of a new life, while the turning and becoming like little children that is spoken of in Matthew 18 shows us the need of the nullification of our past walk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything of the past needs to be torn down and removed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The perfection of a new believer consists of the tearing down of his past item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man is saved at the age of forty, perfecting means a total destruction of everything that he has acquired during his previous forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people regret their sins but not themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We pass from death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not putting life into death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The building up of a new believer consists of identifying the things to be dealt with, the things to be eliminated, and the things to be added.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything should be judged by the biblical standard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If something does not pass this test, if a person s walk is still based on past experiences, past habits, or past concepts, he is living in gross error.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as a man believes in the Lord, he has to drop every one of his past concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regeneration gives man a new life, whereas turning to become like little children breaks down his past life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the negative side, the building up of a new believer consists of tearing down everything that he had in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the positive side, it consists of a fresh start for a new living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a new believer does not break down everything that he had in the past, he will experience much frustration in his Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The things he did in the past will continue to haunt him, and what he receives from the Lord will become a mere addition to what he already has from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The result will be a mixture of the Lord s life and his past life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He may still consider himself highly, telling others of his sincerity and patience and of his many sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He may be full of pride yet act in a humble way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He may be greedy for vainglory and earthly treasures, yet think that he is above worldly pursuits and base gain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many sisters have peculiar temperaments; it is hard for them to get along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many parents have strange ideas about their children.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They can go on this way as Christians for ten or twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why a new believer should have a strong distrust of himself from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He should put a big question mark on everything of his past.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From this point forward, he has to drop his old concepts, tear down his old ways, remove his old ideas, and get rid of everything that is old.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has to turn and become like a little child and start his life all over again.</S>
