<P>Thus, today we have to realize that Christ is our King. He reigns not only in our hearts but also in the tent of David. In the Old Testament, when the tent of David was set up, when David's kingdom was fully established, that was a great consolation and joy to the Israelites. In the coming age, when Christ reigns in the tent of David, that will be a greater consolation to Israel. Christ reigning in the tent of David signifies consolation, encouragement, and restoration. Today we are enjoying Christ as the King ruling not only in our heart but also in the tent of David. For Him to reign in us in the tent of David means that He reigns in us with a kingdom.</P><P>Isaiah 16:5 says, "Then will a throne be established in lovingkindness, / And upon it One will sit in truth / In the tent of David, / Judging and pursuing justice / And hastening righteousness." Christ's throne will be established in lovingkindness. Lovingkindness means tender affection. All of us can approach His throne because lovingkindness is there.</P><P>Christ sits upon His throne in truth. Truth here means truthfulness and faithfulness. Christ is not only living and kind but also truthful and faithful. He is the worthy One. As the One sitting upon the throne in the tent of David, He is the real David. He judges and pursues justice. To judge is to adjust and correct in order to make peace. Christ is the unique Judge in the whole universe. In our natural being, we do not treat others justly. The husbands do not treat the wives in justice, nor do the wives treat the husbands in justice. But Christ is perfectly just with everyone and pursues justice in all of His judgments. He is also the One hastening righteousness.</P><P>Isaiah 16:5 shows that with Christ there is lovingkindness, truthfulness, faithfulness, justice, and righteousness. Today Christ reigns in us in the tent of David, bringing in the kingdom with lovingkindness, truthfulness, faithfulness, justice, and righteousness. If we are under His ruling, His reigning, we will be the same as He is in these virtues.</P><P>Isaiah 24:23 confirms that when Christ will reign in the tent of David in the age of restoration, it will be Jehovah of hosts reigning because Christ is Jehovah of hosts. When Christ will reign as Jehovah of hosts in Zion and Jerusalem, the moon will be abashed, and the sun will be ashamed. For it will be Jehovah of hosts who will reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and His glory will be before His elders. When Christ reigns in the millennium, even the brightest things "will be ashamed." But even today we can enjoy Christ reigning in us as a foretaste of His reign in the coming age.</P>
