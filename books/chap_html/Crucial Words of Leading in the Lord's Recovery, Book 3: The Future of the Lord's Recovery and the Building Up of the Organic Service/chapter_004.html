<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING FORMED INTO AN ARMY<br />
TO VISIT DORMANT SAINTS</h1>
<p>From the speaking of the saints from Taipei, we can see that many of them can quote the Bible and the ministry books. Their constitution has a fragrance of the ministry. Even in the seminaries of America, the top theological country, it is difficult to find believers who can use the words <em>essential</em> and <em>economical</em> when they speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENLISTING THE SAINTS INTO AN ARMY</h2>
<p>As we consider the situation in Taiwan, we are forced to confess that we still have a serious lack. There is a Chinese saying: &ldquo;What we truly care about inwardly will be manifested outwardly.&rdquo; I have a heavy burden that I can no longer keep inside myself. On one hand, it is good that we enjoy the Lord, but on the other hand, we must go out to fight. We need to recruit brothers and sisters to join an army that will go out and fight for the Lord. The working saints from the ages of twenty-five to forty-five should be in the army; the older saints as well as the younger ones can also be in the army. We should not consider ourselves to be too old to join the army.</p>
<p>Our enjoyment of the Lord has deepened over the past few years. The prayers and praises in the table meeting are better than they were five years ago. As those who are learning and maturing, we must go out to teach what we have learned. A person must not study without imparting what he knows into others. Similarly, a person learning martial arts must not merely do exercises; he must also engage in a fight. Hence, the time has come for us to go out. We must go out to teach, and we must go out to fight.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has two thousand high quality, young working saints between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five. The church in Taipei has name cards for twenty-three thousand saints who are living in Taipei, but only a little more than three thousand saints are in our meetings. This means that eighty-five percent of our saints are not in meetings. The saints may come to a meeting once a year or once every two years, but most do not come at all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEKING THE DORMANT SAINTS</h2>
<p>It has been almost twenty-three years since I moved away from Taiwan to begin the work in America. During this time the number of people in the church in Taipei has not increased; instead, it has decreased. When I left, there were more than twenty-three thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and about four thousand were in the meetings. After more than twenty years, the situation is still the same. Some brothers say that our low numbers are because some saints passed away, others moved abroad to study, and still others have backslidden. No matter what the excuse may be, we cannot justify our numbers decreasing, instead of increasing, over a period of more than twenty years.</p>
<p>Even though we can now use terms such as <em>essential</em> and <em>economical</em> in a concise yet powerful manner in the meetings, what should we do about all the saints who are wandering and who are not in the meetings? About three thousand five hundred saints enjoy the meetings, but what will we do about the seventeen thousand five hundred who are not in the meetings? We must form an army and devise a plan to solve this problem.</p>
<p>More than one thousand people came to our last gospel meeting, and less than one hundred of them were baptized, yet we felt this was a large number. In our early years we preached the gospel on Saturday afternoons to three thousand people in the amphitheater in New Park and obtained four to five hundred response cards from every meeting. The next day we distributed the cards to the saints so that they could visit the people. Our baptism records show that the greatest number baptized at one time was more than seven hundred, and we did this in three meeting halls simultaneously. In one day we baptized more than four hundred people, and since we could not finish, we continued the next day and baptized over three hundred more. I want to show you our family history. There is nothing for us to boast about in baptizing less than a hundred people in our last gospel meeting. We must never be like the slave who received one talent and thought that the Lord was a hard Master, reaping where He did not sow and gathering where He did not winnow (Matt. 25:24). I am very happy that more than ninety people were baptized as a result of our gospel preaching, but when we think of our history, we cannot rejoice.</p>
<p>In 1949 when we arrived in Taiwan, there were only three to four hundred saints in our meetings. These were brothers and sisters who came to Taiwan with government agencies or hospitals; very few saints came on their own. In the seven years after 1949, we went from less than five hundred saints to fifty thousand; this was a hundredfold increase. At present only one out of seven brothers and sisters comes to the meetings. This has been our situation since 1965, eighteen years ago. It is as if for the past eighteen years we have been the only persons in our family, while many other brothers and sisters have left home. What should we do? We need to be formed into an army to meet this need.</p>
<p>We must consider a strategy to bring back the seventeen thousand brothers and sisters who have been absent from the meetings for a long time. We all must share this responsibility. We cannot be at peace until we find our brothers and sisters and bring them back.</p>
<p>In a routine church life we may be very busy but still be unable to bring the seventeen thousand saints back to the church life. If we would have the determination to find these saints and bring them back, even if we had to give up our jobs, we will be able to accomplish this. We cannot guarantee that all of them will return, but we will be able to recover at least forty percent&mdash;that is almost seven thousand saints. This would be a sweet endeavor.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal we must take the lead to voluntarily join the army. Let us forget our age; regardless of our age, we can still join the army We must be so absorbed in going out to find our brothers and sisters that we would not even care for sleep or meals. If our brothers and sisters do not return, we should never have peace in our hearts. We must not think that we are using too much human effort or that we are compelling people too much. We must recover our lost brothers and sisters back to God&rsquo;s house.</p>
