<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Exercising Your Speed</H2><P>In the previous two messages we have seen that we need to exercise our spirit, our mouth (our tongue), and our voice (our sound) in the practice of prophesying. In prophesying we also need to exercise our speed. In our speaking, we must adjust ourselves. We should not speak too fast or too slow; rather, we need to speak with a good rhythm and a proper speed.</P><P>Some of the saints speak much too rapidly. Thus, it is difficult to "catch" what they are saying. However, some of the brothers have learned to insert a "selah," a brief pause, at certain points in their speaking, thus affording their listeners an adequate opportunity to receive their word. This is an example of learning to exercise our speed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Exercising Your Gesture</H2><P>In prophesying we also need to exercise our gesture. Although I have been speaking for more than sixty years, I feel that I still have not learned adequately to speak with a proper gesture. This is a difficult matter. To learn to have a proper gesture requires a lifetime of exercise. Having the proper gesture is a great benefit to our speaking. If we speak with little or no gesturing, our speaking will appear to be unnatural and lifeless, and it will not be attractive. If we speak with too much gesturing, our speaking will seem to be peculiar. We all need to learn to speak with a gesture that is very spontaneous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Exercising Your Accent</H2><P>In the practice of prophesying, we also need to learn to exercise our accent. In our speaking we must have some crucial points with some crucial words. We need to learn to accent our speaking. Shouting loudly is not always a proper accent to our speaking. Sometimes we should speak a certain point slowly to make it a crucial point that can catch people's attention. In our speaking we should care not only for our rhythm, our speed, but also for our accent. We should learn to speak with a proper rhythm and a proper accent so that our listeners can hear every word. In speaking we must take care of others' ears. Exercising to have a proper speed, gesture, and accent is a great help to our speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. PRACTICING</H2><P>In addition to learning and exercising, we also need to practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Pray-reading a Portion of the Holy Word</H2><P>In our practice, first we need to learn to pray-read a portion of the holy Word. We should not merely read the Word, nor should we merely pray it. We must pray-read the holy Word.</P>
