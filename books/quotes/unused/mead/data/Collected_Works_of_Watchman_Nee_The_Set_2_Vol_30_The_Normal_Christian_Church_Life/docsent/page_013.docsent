   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE SEPARATION AND MOVEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE APOSTLES ANTIOCH THE MODEL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church in Antioch is the model church shown us in God's Word, because it was the first to come into being after the founding of the churches connected with the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Acts 2 we see the church in connection with the Jews established in Jerusalem, and in chapter ten we see the church in connection with the Gentiles established in the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was just after the establishment of these churches that the church in Antioch was founded.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In its transition stage the church in Jerusalem was not altogether free from Judaism, but the church in Antioch from the very outset stood on absolutely clear Church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is of no little significance that "the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch" Acts 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was there that the peculiar characteristics of the Christian and the Christian Church were first clearly manifested, for which reason it may be regarded as the pattern church for this dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Its prophets and teachers were model prophets and teachers, and the apostles it sent forth were model apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only are the men sent forth an example to us, but the manner of their sending forth is our example too.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the first recorded sending out of apostles by the Holy Spirit was from Antioch, we shall do well to look carefully into its details.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the completion of the New Testament the Holy Spirit has called many of God's children to serve Him throughout the world, but, strictly speaking, none of these can be regarded as our examples.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must always look at the first act of the Holy Spirit in any given direction to discover His pattern for us in that particular direction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, in order to see what example the Church must follow today in the sending forth of apostles, let us examine carefully the first recorded sending forth of workers from the first church established on absolutely clear Church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE HOLY SPIRIT'S CALL</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the first two verses of Acts 13 we read, "Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us note a few facts here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There was a local church in Antioch, there were certain prophets and teachers who were ministers in that church, and it was from among those that the Holy Spirit separated two for another sphere of service.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Barnabas and Saul were two ministers of the Lord already engaged in the ministry when the call of the Spirit came.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Holy Spirit only sends to other parts such as are already equipped for the work and are bearing responsibility where they are, not those who are burying their talents and neglecting local needs while they dream of some future day when the call will come to special service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Barnabas and Saul were bearing the burden of the local situation when the Spirit put the burden of other parts upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their hands were full of local work when He thrust them out to work further afield.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us note first that the Holy Spirit chooses apostles from among the prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These prophets and teachers ministered so wholeheartedly to the Lord that when occasion demanded they even ignored the legitimate claims of their physical being and fasted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What filled the thoughts of those prophets and teachers at Antioch was ministry to the Lord, not work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their devotion was to the Lord Himself, not to His service.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one can truly work for the Lord who has not first learned to minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was while Barnabas and Saul ministered to the Lord that the voice of the Spirit was heard calling them to special service.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was to the divine call they responded, not to the call of human need.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They had heard no reports of man-eaters or head-hunting savages; their compassions had not been stirred by doleful tales of child-marriage or foot-binding or opium-smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They had heard no voice but the voice of the Spirit; they had seen no claims but the claims of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No appeal had been made to their natural heroism or love of adventure.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They knew only one appeal the appeal of their Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was the lordship of Christ that claimed their service, and it was on His authority alone that they went forth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their call was a spiritual call.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No natural factor entered into it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was the Holy Spirit who said, "Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All spiritual work must begin with the Spirit's call.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All divine work must be divinely initiated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The plan conceived for the work may be splendid, the reason adequate, the need urgent, and the man chosen to carry it out may be eminently suitable; but if the Holy Spirit has not said, "Set apart that man for the work to which I have called him," he can never be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He may be a prophet or a teacher, but he is no apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of old all true apostles were separated by the Holy Spirit for the work to which He called them, and today all true apostles must just as surely be set apart for the work by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God desires the service of His children, but He makes conscripts; He wants no volunteers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The work is His, and He is its only legitimate Originator.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Human intention, however good, can never take the place of divine initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Earnest desires for the salvation of sinners or for the edification of saints will never qualify a man for God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One qualification, and only one, is necessary God must send him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was the Holy Spirit who said, "Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only the divine call can qualify for the apostolic office.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In earthly governments there can be no service without commission, and the same holds true in the government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The tragedy in Christian work today is that so many of the workers have simply gone out; they have not been sent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is divine commission that constitutes the call to divine work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Personal desire, friendly persuasions, the advice of one's elders, and the urge of opportunity all these are factors on the natural plane, and they can never take the place of a spiritual call.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That is something which must be registered in the human spirit by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Barnabas and Saul were sent forth, the Spirit first called them, then the brethren confirmed the call.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The brethren may say you have a call, and circumstances may seem to indicate it, but the question is whether or not you yourself have heard the call.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you are to go forth, then you are the one who must first hear the voice of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We dare not disregard the opinion of the brethren, but their opinion is no substitute for a personal call from God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even if they are confident that we have a call, and in that same confidence a company of God's people gladly sends us forth to the work, unless we ourselves know a direct speaking of God into our hearts, on the basis of the new covenant, then we go forth as the messengers of men, not as the apostles of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If God desires the service of any child of His, He Himself will call him to it, and He Himself will send him forth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The first requirement in divine work is a divine call.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everything hinges on this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A divine call gives God His rightful place, for it recognizes Him as the Originator of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Where there is no call from God, the work undertaken is not of divine origin, and it has no spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Divine work must be divinely initiated.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A worker may be called directly by the Spirit, or indirectly through the reading of the Word, through preaching, or through circumstances; but whatever means God may use to make His will known to man, His voice must be the one heard through every other voice; He must be the one who speaks, no matter through what instrument the call may come.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must never be independent of the other members of the Body, but we must never forget that we receive all our directions from the Head; so we must be careful to preserve our spiritual independence, even while we cultivate a spirit of mutual dependence among the members.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is wrong to reject the opinion of fellow workers under the pretext of doing the will of God, but it is also wrong to accept their opinions as a substitute for the direct instructions of the Spirit of God.</S>
