<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWENTY</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 20:1-31</h1><p>We come in this message to chapter twenty of the Gospel of John, a chapter concerned with resurrection. If we know the contents of this Gospel in the way of life, we shall realize that chapter twenty is a chapter of multiplication, a chapter of glorification. This multiplication for glorification was the goal of the Lord’s life on earth.<h2 class=head1>THE ETERNAL GOD BECOMING A MAN</h2><p>The Gospel of John first reveals that Christ is God, the eternal God. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (1:1). Christ’s deity is eternal and absolute. From eternity past to eternity future, He is with God, and He is God. Therefore, 1:2 emphasizes that He was in the beginning with God. As the eternal God, He is the One through whom everything came into being (1:3).<p>John 1:14 says, “The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.” This verse reveals that the Word, the eternal God, became incarnate. As this incarnate One, the Lord lived on earth among men for thirty-three and a half years. His human living is recorded in the first seventeen chapters of this Gospel. These chapters reveal the eternal God living a human life.<p>Whoever would imagine that God would become a man and live among men for thirty-three and a half years? Although this is beyond our imagining, the Gospel of John reveals that the very God, the eternal One and the Creator of the universe, became a real man with a body of flesh, blood, and bones. The name of this man was Jesus. As we read the Gospel of John, we see what wonderful things were done by Him and through Him as He lived as a man among men. Even though He was still the very God, He lived a genuine human life.<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE LIFE PASSING THROUGH DEATH</h2><p>Chapters eighteen and nineteen of John’s Gospel are quite particular. In these chapters the Lord certainly did not behave Himself as an ordinary man. However, our understanding of these chapters may be natural. When we read John 18 and 19, we may sympathize with the Lord in a natural way and pity Him for all His sufferings. But in these chapters we do not have a picture of a pitiful situation—we have a portrait of a victorious Person. Therefore, in our reading of these chapters we should not feel sad and sympathize with the Lord. Instead, we need to see that these chapters are a record of the victory of Christ’s resurrection life. John 18 and 19 are an exhibition of the unbreakable resurrection life. In everything recorded in these chapters the Lord behaved Himself as the One who is the resurrection and the life (11:25). This wonderful Person is life, and in these chapters this life is exhibited.<p>In chapter nineteen this divine life passed through death. Death did everything to Him that it was able to do, but it had no way to conquer Him or hold Him down.<p>Let us review some of the details concerning how the Lord as the resurrection and the life behaved in the presence of death. After praying concerning His glorification, the Lord boldly went to the garden for the purpose of handing Himself over to death. He knew what would happen. He even encouraged Judas, the one who betrayed Him, to act more quickly (13:27). The Lord was ready to give Himself over to those who would put Him to death. Instead of trying to escape, He went to the garden knowing that there He would be arrested.<p>In 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.” Do you know what it means for the Lord to pray that the Father would glorify the Son? This prayer means that the Father should have the Son put to death. Hence, when He prayed for His glorification, the Lord actually prayed concerning His death.<p>After uttering this prayer, He boldly went to the garden to present Himself to those who would put Him to death. As we read chapter eighteen, we should not feel sorry for the Lord. On the contrary, we should realize that here we have a description of a victorious and glorious situation. In the events described in this chapter, life is exhibited.<p>We have pointed out that the Lord’s behavior in these chapters indicates that He was not at all afraid of death. For example, 18:4 says, “Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom are you seeking?” Here we see the expression of life, and life is not afraid of death. The Lord was ready to be taken by them. His one request was that they would let His disciples go: “If therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away” (18:8). Even in the midst of that situation, the Lord cared for His disciples. The Lord exhibited Himself as life both to His opposers and to His disciples. According to the human concept, the things that were happening to Him were extremely negative. But He, as life, was not afraid of these things. What can death do to the One who is the resurrection and the life?<p>With this principle as the basis, we should read chapters eighteen and nineteen again. Then we shall see that every incident was an opportunity for life to be manifested and exhibited. According to these chapters, life was able to pass through the process of death. In chapter twenty we have the result of this process.
