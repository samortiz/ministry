   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the time of the apostasy and desolation of the church, it is not a small thing to not deny the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the fact that the Lord was saying this in a negative way, that it was a matter of not denying His name rather than a matter of exalting His name, we know the seriousness of the apostasy at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is precious enough to not deny the Lord's name negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They may not have done much work on the positive side, yet the Lord still commended them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Lord's eyes, one does not have to call down fire like Elijah did before he can be considered as great.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is great enough already when one is faithful in an unfaithful environment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God did not tell us what the remnant of seven thousand did.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible only says that they did not bow their knees to Baal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a perilous age, God is not considering what His children have done for Him but what they have not done for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since those surrounding them at that time were all Baal worshippers, for them not to worship Baal means that they have done everything there was to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are too many tares in the field today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If believers are not willing to stand for the Lord alone, they will fail along with the others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The nature of the faithful little flock today is to not be deceived and to not follow the current of the tide.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Outward manifestation of power is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is indispensable is to walk faithfully with God in the midst of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is more necessary to have the inward power than the outward power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The characteristic of the Philadelphian believers is that they have not denied the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a sinner denies the name of the Lord, he will of course perish, because a sinner can only become a child of God by believing in His name John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By His name alone are one's sins forgiven 1 John 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only by believing in His name can we receive eternal life 1 John 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"For neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved" Acts 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, what is covered in these few letters is not a question of salvation for the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a question of the saved ones exalting or denying the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is talking about things within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With regard to salvation, these have received the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet with regard to other things, they may not have done the same.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the church the main function of the Lord's name is to serve as the center of the believers' meeting Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Holy Spirit considers the Lord Jesus as the unique focus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He gathers people around the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of meeting in the Lord's name means that the Lord is the Head, the object of worship, and the center of attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It means that we come before Him to worship Him, exalt Him, preach Him, praise Him, pray to Him, and consecrate everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A meeting in the Lord's name is one where God's children come directly to the Lord for worship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no intermediary such as a man-ordained pastor or a leader to monopolize everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The system of having one leader means that this one alone can fellowship with God directly, and that all the others have to pass through him as the middle-man, the mediator, before they can come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a meeting in this person's name, because people come to listen to his preaching, to pray after his prayer, and to conduct themselves according to his direction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, this is not God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He desires to see His people coming to His Son directly to worship Him and not to be controlled by man or to take the worship of one presiding, ordained person as the worship of the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He desires to see everyone being drawn to the person of His Son and having personal fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has no pleasure in any kind of Judaistic worship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, in a truly scriptural meeting in which the center is the Lord's name, there surely can be no humanly assigned presiding person or an implicitly recognized or habitual presiding person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Neither should there be any assigned programs written, verbal, or habitual.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only the Lord Himself should be the Lord in the meeting through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He arranges all the programs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He chooses the persons plural that He wants to use.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He receives the worship from His children.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who speak do not dominate others; they are merely chosen by the Lord to represent the mind of the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone has equal opportunity, and everyone can come to the Lord directly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Bible we can see another important use of the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord's name sanctifies the believers unto Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For this reason, the disciples of the Lord are called the "Christians," which means those who belong to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ has given us His name so that we can be distinct from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, it now seems as if the Lord's name is not distinct enough anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man likes to follow the Corinthians of the day in saying that "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas" 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The distinction in denominationalism is a denial of the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word "denomination" means a name.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To join a denomination is to add to oneself a name.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The present error of man is to add to the name "Christian" the name of a denomination or a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"I am a Methodist believer," or "I am a Presbyterian believer."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why should we do this?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Is the name of Christ not sufficient to distinguish us?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Should we have a name of a denomination before we can become distinct enough?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we think that we do not have the distinction of denominations in our hearts, why then should we be in the denominations in reality?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At present, believers think that it is impossible for one not to belong to a denomination or to have another name other than the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the result of doing so is to deny the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the name of a denomination cannot include all the believers, but has on the contrary made a distinction among the believers, the retention of denominational names is division in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No matter how man explains it, the fact cannot be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Of course, the Holy Spirit is only presenting a despised little flock before us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must know that the Lord's name will not allow us to choose between two evils.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness" 2 Tim 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is a way that has no unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is characteristic of the unbelieving ones to say that no one can be perfect or that no one is without fault, but the way of unrighteousness is not a way that we have to take.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This, of course, does not mean that once the saints meet around the Lord's name sins will no longer come in. Man's flesh always brings in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, we look to the Lord and His Holy Spirit to preserve us and to keep us away from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is bad enough to have moral sins.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But sin in the church, that is, the sin of upsetting the order of the church, is even worse.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The worst sin is the sin against the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the greatest of all sins 2 John 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the test of our spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What more can one say when the heart is not proper toward Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But all those who exalt His name sincerely will see that they are particularly close to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is possible for sin to invade our meeting and to test our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, if we remain voluntarily in the position of weakness and dependence, we will be preserved in the purity of the Lord.</S>
