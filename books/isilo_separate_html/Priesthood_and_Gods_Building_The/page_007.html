<h1 class="title">THE THRONE AND THE LIVING WATER</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will look at the balance between fellowship and authority, according to the description of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF THE HOLY CITY&mdash;<br />
A THRONE AND LIVING WATER</h2>
<p>Chapters 21 and 22 of Revelation present a clear picture of the content of the New Jerusalem, the holy city. The throne of God and of the Lamb is at the center of the city; it is the peak of the city. A river of water of life proceeds out of the throne and flows throughout the entire city (v. 1). There is one street in the city, and the river is in the middle of the street. On this side and on that side of the river of life is the tree of life (v. 2). Although chapters 21 and 22 speak of many things, the main content is the throne of God and of the Lamb and the river of water of life that proceeds out of the throne. All the other items supplement these two items. For example, the tree of life and the street follow the flow of the river. Even the matters of God being light and the Lamb being the lamp are related to the flow of the river of life (v. 3; John 1:4). Without the flowing of the river of water of life, there would be no shining of light. Also, the matter of God and the Lamb being the temple is related to the throne (Rev. 21:22). God and the Lamb being the temple refers to the presence of God and the Lamb, and the presence of God and the Lamb cannot be separated from the throne of God and of the Lamb. Without the throne of God and of the Lamb, there would be no presence of God and the Lamb. Therefore, the main content of the New Jerusalem is the throne of God and of the Lamb and the river of water of life that proceeds out of the throne.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THRONE AND THE FLOWING WATER SIGNIFYING AUTHORITY AND FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>The throne and the flowing water of life signify authority and fellowship. The throne of God and of the Lamb signifies authority, whereas the flow of the water of life signifies the fellowship of life. God is God, and He is the Lamb (John 1:36). He is also life (11:25). The New Jerusalem speaks of Christ, who came as the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption through His death and to release His divine life. This picture begins with the Lamb and ends with life; it speaks of Christ coming as the Lamb of God for the purpose of flowing out Himself as life (10:10). This picture is quite profound; it presents the clear revelation in the Bible through a sign presented in a simple writing style. The whole Bible shows that God desires to be received by us and to mingle Himself with us in Christ. In order to make this receiving and mingling possible, God released Himself as life through the death of Christ as the Lamb (Rev. 5:6). Through His death, we can receive Him as life. Hence, Christ is the Lamb as well as life.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John and in Revelation, the apostle John consistently presents the matter of Christ being the Lamb and being life. The Gospel of John begins by speaking of Christ as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (1:29). The Gospel of John also records the Lord&rsquo;s words concerning His coming so that we may have life (10:10). This promise is confirmed by the Lord&rsquo;s speaking in chapter 7, when He stood and cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). John also presents a unique record of the Lord&rsquo;s death, revealing that blood and water came out of His side when He was crucified (19:34). Blood is for redemption, and water signifies the impartation of life. The sign of the New Jerusalem shows that God in Christ as the Lamb flows out as life into man. John repeatedly speaks of the relationship between the water of life and the Lamb (Rev. 7:17; 21:6; 22:1). All these verses speak of Christ as the Lamb being slain in order to release the divine life so that it can flow into man. This is the aspect of fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE COORDINATION OF THE THRONE<br />
AND THE LIVING WATER</h2>
<p>According to the picture in Revelation, the river of water of life flows out of the throne. This, in turn, signifies that the flow of life, the fellowship of life, conveys the authority of the throne. The authority of the throne is present wherever the river flows. Authority and fellowship, the two main components of the New Jerusalem, are coordinated. The authority of the throne flows to every part of the city through the fellowship of life; the entire city is in fellowship and under authority.</p>
<p>On one hand, the authority of the throne is located at the center of the city, and on the other hand, the fellowship of the river of water of life flows throughout the entire city. This picture shows that the flow of the river of water of life brings the authority of the throne throughout the entire city. In the New Jerusalem there is not only authority but also fellowship; fellowship is coordinated with authority, and authority is blended with fellowship.</p>
<p>Everything in the New Jerusalem depends upon the coordination of fellowship and authority. The water that the thirsty can drink is related to the coordination of fellowship and authority; the food in the city, that is, the fruits from the tree of life, is related to the coordination of fellowship and authority. Even the street in the city is related to the coordination of fellowship and authority. Everything related to our living, our way, and our experience of the presence of God depends upon the coordination between fellowship and authority. Without the coordination of fellowship and authority in this city, there would be no food, no drink, and no street.</p>
<p>In the church today, our spiritual food, our spiritual drink, our spiritual path, and our experience of the presence of God depend upon the coordination of fellowship and authority. If there is a full coordination between fellowship and authority in a local church, the church will be filled with living water, food, and God&rsquo;s way. There will not only be water for drinking, food for eating, and a pathway for walking but also the presence of God. Without such a coordination of fellowship and authority, the temple for God&rsquo;s dwelling will be lacking, and His presence will not be apparent. The aspect of God being the light and Christ being the lamp to shine out the glory of God is also related to the coordination between fellowship and authority. Without this coordination, knowing God as light and Christ as the lamp would not be possible. Everything in the New Jerusalem depends upon the throne and the river of water of life. There is no lack wherever the throne and the river of water of life are present.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
