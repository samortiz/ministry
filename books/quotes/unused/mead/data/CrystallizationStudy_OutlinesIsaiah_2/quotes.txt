[1]  Isaiah 2 Message One Announcing the All-inclusive Christ,
[2]  Jehovah the Savior, as the Glad Tidings Scripture Reading: Isa 40:1-26 The all-inclusive Christ is Jehovah the Savior, the glad tidings Isa 40:5, 9; 43:3, 11; 45:21; 49:26; 60:16: Jehovah means He who was, who is, and who will be Exo 3:14: God s name is I Am; His name is simply the verb to be: I Am denotes the One who is self-existing, the One whose being depends on nothing apart from Himself.
[3]  Message Two Living in the Reality of the New Creation Scripture Reading: Isa 40:3-5, 28-31 The first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah, corresponding to the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, focus mainly on the old creation, whereas the last twenty-seven chapters, corresponding to the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, center on the new creation 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15: Isaiah 40 reveals the announcing of the gospel corresponding to the four Gospels Isa 40:1-5 , salvation through regeneration corresponding to the Acts Isa 40:6-8 , and transformation corresponding to the Epistles Isa 40:28-31 ; this is the revelation of God becoming a man through incarnation so that man might become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead through regeneration and transformation as the content of God s eternal economy.
[4]  Both Isaiah 40 and the New Testament begin with the coming of John the Baptist, who ushered in the expected Christ for the initiation of the new creation vv.
[5]  Typified by Cyrus the King of Persia, Israel, and Isaiah Scripture Reading: Isa 41:2, 25; 45:13, 1; 48:14; 46:11; 44:28; 41:8-16; 42:1; 43:10; 44:1-5, 21; 46:13; 48:16; 49:1-4; 50:4-9 In Isaiah 41 through 66 Christ is revealed as the Servant of Jehovah: In the book of Isaiah Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is typified by three persons by a Gentile king, Cyrus the king of Persia; by God s chosen corporate people, Israel; and by the prophet Isaiah; all three were God s servants in the sense of a type.
[6]  All who are in Christ 1 Cor 1:30 and who are thus one with Christ to release God s people and to build up His house and His kingdom are servants of God; those who are one with Christ have become a great corporate Christ 12:12; Col 3:10-11 , the same as the individual Christ in being the testimony and servant of God: We need to be one with Christ to release God s people from the captivity of Satan back to the enjoyment of God as their possession; our preaching of the gospel is to release these captives to make them the sons of God, the members of Christ, and the constituents of the new man Isa 61:1-2; Luke 4:18-21; Matt 12:28-29; Gal 3:26; Rom 12:4-5; Col 3:10-11.
[7]  Message Four Christ as the Servant of Jehovah Scripture Reading: Isa 42:1-3; 50:4-7; 53:2-3; 41:21-29;
[8]  43:10-11; 44:8; Matt 12:18-20 The source of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is His divinity Isa 42:1, 6; 49:5, 7-8 , whereas His qualification is in His humanity, in His human virtues 42:2-4 .
[9]  In the book of Isaiah we have a detailed prophecy concerning Christ as the Servant of Jehovah: As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ is the One chosen and beloved of Jehovah; He is the One in whom Jehovah delights 42:1; Matt 12:18: Jesus Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, was God s choice among billions of human beings.
[10]  As those who are replaced by Christ and wait on Him to enjoy God s life power in grace, we are members of Christ and servants of Jehovah with Christ and in Christ in a corporate way; as members of Christ, we are types of Christ bearing a twofold testimony Isa 40:31; 1 Cor 12:12: We testify that we are nothing, that we have been fired and replaced by Christ, and that Christ is everything to us as our reality, centrality, and universality John 14:6; Col 1:18; 2:9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11; Gal 2:20.
[11]  55:1-4; Acts 13:34-35 God s full salvation is based on His righteousness and consummated in His life Rom 10:3; 3:21-28; 5:10, 17-18, 21; 1:16-17: The righteousness of God is what God is with respect to justice and righteousness 10:3; 3:21-23: Because we are fallen, God must deal with us according to His righteousness.
[12]  of Keeping the Sabbath and of Fasting Scripture Reading: Isa 55:1; 56:2;
[13]  57:15, 20-21; 58:8-14; 66:1-2 The real meaning of keeping the Sabbath is that we cease from our doing, stop our work, get ourselves fired, and enjoy what the Lord has done for us, drinking of Him, the consummated Spirit, as the waters Isa 56:2; 12:3; 55:1: Keeping the Sabbath in this way is to be terminated and replaced by Christ so that we may enter into Him and rest in Him for eternity.
[14]  God s good pleasure, the desire of His heart, is to be the fountain of living waters to dispense Himself into His chosen people so that they would become His increase as His fullness for His expression Jer 2:13; Eph 1:4-5, 9, 22-23; 3:16-19: God s intention was to dispense Himself into man as man s enjoyment and satisfaction for God s corporate expression, but man became unfaithful and forsook God for idols Jer 2:13.
[15]  a House of Prayer and the House of His Beauty Scripture Reading: Isa 57:15; 66:1-2; 56:7; 62:6-7;
[16]  60:1-3, 7, 9, 13-14, 19-21 The central thought of the Scriptures is that God is seeking a building as a living composition of persons redeemed by and mingled with Himself Matt 16:18; Eph 2:21-22; 4:16: God s intention is to have a group of people built up as a spiritual building to express Him and represent Him by dealing with His enemy and recovering the lost earth Gen 1:26; 1 Pet 2:5.
[17]  The Lord Jehovah desires to have as His dwelling place a group of people into whom He can enter Isa 57:15; 66:1-2: God intends to have a dwelling place in the universe that is the mingling of God and man, in which God is built into man and man is built into God, so that God and man, man and God, can be a mutual abode to each other John 14:2, 20, 23; 15:4; 1 John 4:13.
[18]  as the Jubilee of Grace for His Second Coming Scripture Reading: Isa 61:1-3; 65:17; 66:22;
[19]  Lev 25:8-17; Luke 4:16-22; Acts 26:16-19 Isaiah 61:1-3 refers to the ministry of Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah in His two comings: Verses 1 and 2a in this chapter refer to Christ in His first coming, in which His ministry was to announce the gospel of grace.
