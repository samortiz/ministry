<P>Brothers and sisters, when we are free, we have to learn to relax our muscles. While we are sleeping, all of our limbs should be relaxed. We should be able to stretch our capacity when there is the need for it, and when we do, we should be able to handle more stress than the strongest men. Our body has to obey us. But we cannot be under stress all the time. Our muscles and nerves often need relaxation and rest; we have to find opportunity to allow our body to rest. This is one way the body balances itself. If we do not find time to rest, we will push ourselves beyond the limit and go to an extreme. We are not men of extremes. Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to trust in the Lord regarding our body, yet at the same time we have to follow natural laws and rest. This is a very basic lesson. We have to learn to let go. If we learn to let go, we will find it easier to rest and sleep. Experienced ones have told us that counting the number of times one breathes can help a person to go to sleep. When we are asleep, our breathing is deep. It may not be that easy to control our sleep, but it is easy to control our breathing. We can count the number of times we breathe, and we should not breathe quickly, but slowly. We can learn to adjust our breathing to the sleeping mode. Our mind should be set not on sleeping but on breathing, on counting the number of breaths. First, we control our breathing to the speed we would breathe in our sleep. After a while, we will go to sleep. Many people are able to go to sleep with this method. In our sleep we breathe slowly and deeply. By controlling our breathing, making it slow and deep, we can induce sleep for ourselves. We often need to count only up to a few hundred and then we are asleep. We have to believe that the body God has created for us is good enough to go to sleep. We have to trust in God, and we also have to trust in God's law in His creation. God has created a head for us that will go to sleep, and we should be able to go to sleep. We should try to relax our whole body. This will give us rest. If we are not able to rest, we will be constantly under tension, day and night. Such a condition will not sustain us to accomplish many things. We may be sick; we may be bound by more than one illness, but if we take care of our body a little more, we will save ourselves from many worries.</P>
