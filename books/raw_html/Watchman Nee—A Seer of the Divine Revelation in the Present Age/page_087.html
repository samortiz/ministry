<P CLASS=INDENT1>Beloved brothers, the time of the Lord's coming back is fast approaching. We must be faithful. In the days ahead we may suffer more misunderstanding and more severe opposition; but since we have been destined for this we should remain faithful....Brothers, please continue to remember me in your prayers so that in all my afflictions I may be able to stand fast, faithfully bearing a good testimony for the Lord.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Just a few more miles beloved;<br>And our feet shall ache no more;<br>No more sin, and no more sorrow;<br>Hush thee, Jesus went before;<br>And I hear Him sweetly whispering,<br>"Faint not, fear not, still press on;<br>For it may be ere tomorrow;<br>The long journey will be done."</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>In the twenty-sixth issue of July&#151;August 1932, he wrote:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>This issue was completed in the midst of much suffering. I know that Satan and his evil spirits are very busy, for he is aware that the message of The Present Testimony is harmful to him. Therefore, both the message and the one who preaches it are the objects of his attack. For this reason I beg all the brothers in the Lord to supply me with more prayers.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The various temptations, oppressions, misunderstandings, and hardships which come can weaken even the physically strongest one, to say nothing of someone like me whose earthly tabernacle is often being shaken. It is difficult to become a martyr, but it is also difficult to become an apostate. It is difficult to be faithful, but even more difficult to lose chastity. To restrain our lips is indeed painful, but to vindicate ourselves does not bring joy either. An evil name brings sorrow, but a good name does not necessarily bring gladness. We care only to work faithfully, keeping the first love and maintaining a single eye while waiting for the Lord's return. Did not the Lord tell us from the outset that we must bear the cross and encounter sufferings on this earth?</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
