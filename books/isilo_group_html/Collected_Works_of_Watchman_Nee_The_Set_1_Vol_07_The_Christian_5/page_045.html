But at that time, how will the Gentiles be saved? Is it through faith (believing in the Lord Jesus as their Savior) or through works (done unto the least of the brothers)? If through works, then will the unbelievers who treat the believers well at this time be saved? Please explain in detail. (Yu, Kwangtung)</P><P>Answer: At the beginning of the great tribulation, the watchful saints will have already been raptured (Rev. 3:10). The saints who are not raptured and a small number of godly Jews will preach to the whole world the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens (somewhat different from the gospel of grace). Naturally, they will be persecuted. At that time, whoever treats these sent ones of God kindly will be saved. They will be saved because of their works; but we dare not say that they will not have any faith. By that time, the Lord Jesus will treat them according to the following principle: to receive the ones He sent, is to receive Himself. Today there is no other way to be saved except to believe in the Lord Jesus. Those who try to be saved by treating the believers well will still perish. Today is the age of grace; God only deals with man in grace. Because it is of grace, as long as you believe, you will be saved. But at the time of the great tribulation, it will be the age of law, and God will deal with man according to the law. Because it will be of the law, it will be a matter of works. Today it is utterly impossible for anyone to be saved through works (Gal. 3:11). Just as today men cannot be saved through the sacrifices (the Old Testament way of salvation), in the same way they cannot be saved through treating the believers well (the coming age's way of salvation).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SON NOT KNOWING</H2><P>Question: In Matthew 24:36 the Lord said, "But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son...." Since the Son and the Father are one, why does the Father know something but the Son not know it? Perhaps the number of the saved ones is not fulfilled, and the Father's will is not yet accomplished, and therefore, the day and the hour depend on the Father's satisfaction. Please explain in detail. (Yu, Kwangtung)</P><P>Answer: In the four Gospels this word was recorded only in Mark 13:32. (Please read the footnote on Matthew 24:36 in Joseph Shih's (?) translation.) This fully matches the nature of the Gospel of Mark which portrays the Lord Jesus as a servant. The reason the Lord said these words was not that He knew the time but would not say it, nor that the time will be decided when the Father is satisfied. In reading the Bible, the hardest thing for us to do is to differentiate between the divine nature and the human nature of the Lord Jesus. Sometimes we can differentiate between the two; at other times we cannot do it. Sometimes it seems as if we can make a distinction, and at other times it seems as if we cannot do it. Here the Lord Jesus was referring to His humanity; it shows that He Himself was a fully humble servant, who knew nothing except to accept His Master's will. When we read the four Gospels, the most important thing is to remember that the Lord Jesus has both the divine and the human nature. Sometimes they only speak of His human nature, sometimes they only speak of His divine nature, and sometimes they speak of both His divine and human natures. Those who understand this will be saved from many misunderstandings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FALSE PROPHETS</H2><P>Question: The number of gospel preachers has increased in recent years. They all use the name Jesus as their entrance into preaching. But what do the "false prophets" mentioned in the Bible refer to? What is the way to identify them? (Ju, Chekiang)</P><P>Answer: If we know what kind of persons the false prophets are, we will know how to identify them. Our Lord spoke of them (Matt. 24:24), Paul spoke of them (Acts 20:29-30; 1 Tim. 4; 2 Tim. 3), Peter spoke of them (2 Pet. 2:1), John spoke of them (1 John 2:4), and Jude also spoke of them. The characteristic of the false prophets is to tell lies! Please read Jeremiah 14:14; 23:25; 27:10, 14; Ezekiel 13:8. False prophets deviate from the Bible and reject it (Jer. 5:13; 23:16, 26, 30; 29:9; Ezek. 13:3, 6, 17). They promise people vain and fleeting prosperity and pleasure (Jer. 6:14; Ezek. 13:19; Jer. 14:13, 15-16; 23:17, 21; 27:9; 28:16). They are greedy (Jer. 6:3; Micah 3:11). The message that they preach is somewhat religious on the surface, but it actually helps people to do evil (Jer. 5:31; 23:14, 27, 32; Ezek. 13:22). Today the false prophets in the church are those who call themselves "modernists"; actually they are atheists. All their behavior is exactly the same as that of the false prophets spoken of in the Bible. They speak lies. They do not believe in the Bible. They tell people to reform themselves, and they give people empty hopes. They are greedy for glory from man. Their doctrines are only covered with a religious cloak but will cause people to perish. The Bible commands us to love our enemies, but regarding those who preach heresy, there are also some instructions (2 John 10; Jude 3). May we be faithful.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
