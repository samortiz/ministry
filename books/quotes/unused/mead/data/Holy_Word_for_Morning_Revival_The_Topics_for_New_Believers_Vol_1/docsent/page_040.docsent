   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 6 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exo 5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Let My people go that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 Cor 14:26 What then, brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let all things be done for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Called-out Assembly</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible the church is first called the assembly Matt 16:18; 18:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek word translated church in these verses is ekklesia, composed of two words: ek, out, and kaleo, called.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, according to the literal sense of the word, the church is the assembly of those called out of the world by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>159</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When did God's people begin to meet together?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In all of the fifty chapters of Genesis there is no meeting, no assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when you come to the second book of the Bible, Exodus, there was the meeting of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Exodus when God's salvation was brought in, right away there was the demand of the assembly of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A Feast unto the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, according to the appearance of the wording in Exodus, you couldn't find a word like assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet when God called Moses and sent him to deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt, He spoke in this way: "And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Let My people go that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness" 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My people is collective; it is not just one person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a collective people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses was to tell Pharaoh to let God's people go to hold a feast unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to realize that the thought of assembling, the thought of gathering, is implied in this word feast.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>160</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A rich feast is composed not only of one dish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more courses of food there are and the more variety there is, the richer the feast is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a feast is a real enjoyment, and a rich meeting should be just like this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Each saint should bring a different "dish."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our meetings need to be a real feast to both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>161</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This meeting in mutuality may be compared to the feast of tabernacles in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In that feast the children of Israel brought the produce of the good land, which they reaped from their labor on the land, to the feast and offered it to the Lord for His enjoyment and for mutual participation in fellowship with the Lord and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>162</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The good land typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today Christ is the good land to us, so we must labor on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The rain, the sunshine, the air, and the fertile soil come from the grace of God, but we need to labor to till the ground, sow the seed, and take care of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to cooperate with God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to pray and deal with many things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to learn how to trust in the Lord, abide in Him, fellowship with Him, and deal with Him and be dealt with by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a spiritual labor, not human struggling; it is not human effort but a spiritual coordination with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Day by day we all must learn to live in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we will know Christ in a practical way and experience Him in our spirit, and when we come to the meetings, we will have something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>163 First Corinthians 14:26 does tell us that whenever we come together, each one should have something.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now the Lord wants us to enter into the full reality of such a wonderful meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Goal of Our Meeting to Exhibit Christ</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The goal of our meeting is to exhibit Christ, and the Christian meeting is an exhibition of the Christian daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Christian daily life is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul said, "For to me, to live is Christ" Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ must be our daily life, and our meeting is an exhibition, a display, of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The center of this display is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whatever we pray, speak, or sing must be with Christ as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>164</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
