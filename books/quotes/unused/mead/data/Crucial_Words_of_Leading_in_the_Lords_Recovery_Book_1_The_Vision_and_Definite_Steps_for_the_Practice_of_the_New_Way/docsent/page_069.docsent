   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING A SPIRITUAL WARFARE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While resting these few days, I have felt that we have neglected the spiritual warfare, caring only for the work, because we have been busy with our work and busy following the new move under the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In particular, we have been negligent in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, I sense the attack of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has even stirred up some who oppose the new way to pray against this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, I feel in my spirit that we should all be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are busy with the Lord s work, we must realize that we are engaged in a spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The foremost need on the battlefield is to be watchful and alert, in order to know what the enemy is doing and what he intends to do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The enemy always does things in a subtle and hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not have anything particular to fellowship at this point, but I do want to unload a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I hope the co-workers, elders, and full-timers will receive a burden from the Lord to spend much time before Him to pray corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps we need to devote this whole meeting to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will see how the Lord leads us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>NEEDING ADEQUATE AND THOROUGH PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>TO WITHSTAND THE STRATEGY OF THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Over the past two months I have been leading the meetings for the co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every time we met, we were short of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We had neither the spirit of prayer nor the adequate amount of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, I am concerned that when the co-workers and elders meet together, there is a lack of prayers and, even more, a lack of weighty prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, recently when I was resting, I often felt a heavy weight on my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Deep within my spirit I sensed that this was an attack of the authority of darkness from behind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have neglected this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe there may be some who are praying counter prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, we must ask the Lord to resist prayers that are directed particularly against the work we are carrying out, against the church, and against my leading.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The prayers we utter before the Lord must stand against these counter prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May the Lord cover us and not allow the enemy to have any ground to do damage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A FEW MATTERS REQUIRING OUR PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need prayers to fight the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we also need to pray for the various aspects of the work and the different needs in the Lord s new move in this new age that have arisen because of our change in the system.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, we must pray for the approval of the construction of the meeting hall in Lin-ko.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have submitted the application, and it was received.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now is the time for the brothers and sisters to receive a burden to pray for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a crucial juncture that determines whether we will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our application is not approved, we cannot build the meeting hall, and this will delay the Lord s timing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I hope that all the churches, not simply the church in Taipei, will receive the burden to pray in one accord for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second, we need to pray for the different kinds of meetings in our practice, such as the home meeting, the small group meeting, and the meeting for teaching Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also need to pray for our general meetings such as the big Lord s Day morning meeting, the Lord s table meeting, and the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that the elders will bear this burden and press toward the goal of the new way together with the co-workers and full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that the Lord will establish all the meetings in a strong way through us and through His grace so that He may gain what He is after.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Third, this term of the full-time training will end on June 20, and the next term will begin in August.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In these days we must pray for the number of the full-time trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope that by the beginning of 1988 we will have at least one thousand full-timers who have passed through the training and are ready to be sent to different towns for the propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, in this coming term of the training we will teach different languages, including Greek, English, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All of these items require much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>PRAYER BEING THE SECRET</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>TO ACCOMPLISH GOD S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to remember that in God s work, there is no such thing as sheer luck, no such thing as gaining without effort.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, there is no guarantee that if we labor and endeavor, we will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must realize that we are engaged in spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must fight and be watchful in everything we do and in every step we take.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope that we would take this word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have been called by the Lord in His grace to gather here and receive a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must know that we need to struggle, fight, and take possession of every inch through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The last line of Hymns, #892 says, We should, we must, we can, we will, / Fulfill God s purpose faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This should be our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not listen to the lies from the authorities of darkness; instead, we should offer prayers to God in steadfast faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever we pray together, I hope that everyone will pray, not praying simultaneously but one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our prayers should not be too loud or lengthy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They should be short and living, adding to the one before, so that all the prayers can be joined together as one strong, powerful prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should pray as if we are playing basketball, knowing how to pass and how to catch the ball.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I hope that our prayers will meet God s standard and requirement and be according to His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I also beseech that we pray for the publication of our books.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The compiling of the recent messages, especially Truth Lessons, is a very heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After finishing the Gospel of Mark, I resumed the compiling of Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I was exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Last Wednesday afternoon while I was working on Truth Lessons, I suddenly felt very tired and had to stop before completing a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I had used up all my energy and could not go on any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I had to stop to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is because even though I know my own physical condition, I also realized that it was more than merely a condition in the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A spiritual battle was also being waged.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The enemy was attacking and disturbing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the one hand, in the natural realm, our strength and energy are limited, and we should not overuse our body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But on the other hand, in the spiritual realm, when this kind of thing happens, we should not rule out the attack of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, I hope that we will receive a burden to pray for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May the Lord bless the books we put out so that they can be effective and greatly used by the Lord to reach His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I repeat, regardless of the time and place, we must be led by the Lord to cry out to Him and to call on Him to touch His throne not merely the throne of grace but the throne of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I hope that each of us would pray from our spirit, and no one would be silent and not receive this burden.</S>
