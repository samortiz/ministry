Some teach that the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, is only a power, a means, or an instrument for God to do something. This is far away from the revelation of the New Testament. This all-inclusive Spirit is the compound of all that the Father is and has and all that the Father can do, is doing, and will do, plus the Son in His person and with His work, His accomplishments, His attainments, His obtainments, and with all the processes He has gone through. The Spirit is a compound of all the divine things. It is much, much more than a power, a means, or an instrument. This all-inclusive, compound Spirit is the blessing of the New Testament, and this is the blessing of the gospel which God promised to Abraham (Gal. 3:14). God promised Abraham that all the nations of the earth would be blessed through his one seed (Gen. 22:18). That one seed of Abraham is Christ (Gal. 3:16), the Son of God, and the blessing promised Abraham is this all-inclusive, compound Spirit.</P><P>The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 1:12). Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds with the blessing of the promised land. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy. The blessing of the gospel, the blessing of the New Testament, which God promised to Abraham is this compound Spirit, the totality of God the Father, of God the Son, together with the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. We all have received this blessing, and this all-inclusive blessing is in us, in our spirit (Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). God's economy is His plan to dispense Himself as the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, with all His attributes and virtues, into our spirit. When we open up ourselves to this total and aggregate Spirit, we enjoy the all-inclusive blessing of the New Testament.</P><P>To turn an electric fan manually, to "teach" it to move, is similar to the ethical teachings of husbands loving their wives, children honoring their parents, wives submitting themselves to their husbands, loving our neighbors, and being humble. All the fan needs to do is to "enjoy" the electricity and it will spontaneously turn. In the same way, what we need to do is to enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit as the "divine electricity." When we enjoy the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit, this supply strengthens, enables, and sustains us to live Christ. As we enjoy this Spirit, we spontaneously have the living needed in all our ethical relationships. Christ becomes our life within and our living without. This is not religion but God's marvelous, eternal economy.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Economy &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
