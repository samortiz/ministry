   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is not something organized or composed together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is something that is constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23; Col 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our body is not a number of bones composed together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not organized together as a carpenter would put pieces of wood together to make a table.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our body is not a composition; neither is it an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our body is a constitution.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not a matter of organization or composition, but a matter of organic constitution.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has chosen us to participate in His holy nature Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that if we are going to have God's divine nature imparted into us, we must have a union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are united to God, His nature will be ours organically.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, we the believers have been predestinated to have the sonship of God Eph 1:5 .</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we have the human life, we also have the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, when we have the divine life, we also have the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we have the divine nature, we can be holy, as He is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is according to the Father's selection and predestination, and it is accomplished through God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through His dispensing, God comes into us to be our life and our nature.</S>
