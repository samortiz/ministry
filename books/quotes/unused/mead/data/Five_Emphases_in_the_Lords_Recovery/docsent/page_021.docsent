   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING OF GOD'S ECONOMY AND OF GOD'S GOOD PLEASURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is of God's economy Eph 3:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word economy is used in Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 10 of chapter one speaks of "the economy of the fullness of the times," and 3:9 says, "And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Greek the word oikonomia has been anglicized to the present-day word economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Oiko means house or household, and nomos means law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, oikonomia is a kind of household law, household government, or household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An administration implies arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, any kind of administration is a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church is also of God's good pleasure Eph 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our God is a living God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is a living person who has a desire, a pleasure, and a will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He wishes to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What He wants to do, what He wishes to do, is His will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Based upon His desire and His wish, His will, He made a plan, and that plan is His household administration, His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He exercises Himself in this household administration as a Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the Father administrating His own household.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We believers are His children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has a big family, which Galatians 6:10 calls "the household of the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this universe there is a family of faith, including the chosen Israelites and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both were chosen by God to be His folks, His household.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Among these folks, the great Father has an administration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His administration God planned to have a group of human beings made in His image in order that this group of human beings might become a corporate vessel to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, this vessel must be in the same form as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A round container is made to contain something round.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The container must be in the form, in the image, of the content.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was why God made us in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are the container made in the image of God, who is to be our content.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In His economy, His household administration, He arranged and decided to make man not only in His image but also with a spirit as a recipient to receive Him as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God decided that man should be in His image with a spirit to receive Him as life, signified by the tree of life Gen 2:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man was to eat the tree of life, to take God into him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, man did not take in God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, man became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, in the New Testament, Jesus came and told us that He was both the life John 14:6 and the tree, the vine tree John 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we put these two things together, we realize that He is the life tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The life tree is not a tall pine, which we cannot reach.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The life tree is a vine spreading through the whole earth and so available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The tree of life in Revelation 22 is Christ, growing in the river of the water of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The river of water of life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ grows in the Spirit and even as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have the Spirit within us as the essence of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The essence is of the element, the Son, and the element is of the source, the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The issue of the Father as the source, of the Son as the element, and of the Spirit as the essence is the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Taking the Triune God into us as our life makes us the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE CHURCH BEING CONSTITUTED OF GOD THE FATHER'S NATURE AND LIFE, GOD THE SON'S ELEMENT, AND GOD THE SPIRIT'S ESSENCE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is constituted of God the Father's nature and life, God the Son's element, and God the Spirit's essence Eph 1:4-5, 10-11, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say that God the Father chose us to be holy and predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For us to be holy, to be sanctified, we need His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the whole universe, nothing is holy except God Himself in His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only the Father's divine nature is sanctified, holy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God wants to make us holy, sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, He has to impart His holy nature into us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Father also has predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For Him to make us sons to participate in His divine sonship involves His life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If He did not impart His life into us, we could not be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, for us to be sanctified, to be holy, means that we have God's holy nature; for us to be His sons means that we have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Ephesians 1:4 and 5 indicate that God the Father as the source imparts His nature and life into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Ephesians 1:7-12 speaks of the Son's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Son brings us into Himself as the element and the sphere into which we have been redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He redeemed us out of the "trash can," and the destination of His redemption is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He redeemed us out of sin, out of the world, and out of the tyranny of Satan into Himself as the element and sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By this redemption we, the fallen sinners, have been put into Christ as our element and sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>With Christ as our divine element, we have been made the inheritance of God v. 11 . We were lost, fallen, corrupt sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Corrupt sinners cannot be God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But we corrupt, sinful people have been redeemed into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ is now our element and our sphere, in which and with which we have been made a treasure unto God to be His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ as the divine element has been imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Ephesians 1:13 says that we were also sealed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Father's nature and life, the Son's element, and the Spirit's essence are imparted into us by the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When a seal with sealing ink is stamped on a piece of paper, the ink saturates the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The ink as the essence gets into the sealed material.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are the sealed material, and the Spirit brings the essence of the divine element of the divine source into us.</S>
