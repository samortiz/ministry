   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE FIVE THE PREPARATION BEFORE THE ATTACK Scripture Reading: Josh 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will consider chapter five of Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This chapter reveals that all the kings were afraid because of the miraculous crossing of the river Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before the children of Israel attacked, the Canaanites were already defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their spirit was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the Israelites had been disciplined, trained, and qualified, after crossing the Jordan they still needed further preparation before the attack.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Joshua 5 covers four matters of intrinsic significance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first item is circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Circumcision is a continuation of the burial in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By crossing the river Jordan, Israel s old man was buried and they came out to become the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was an objective work done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Israel still needed to apply it to their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, they prepared knives of flint to cut off their foreskins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This cutting was their application of what God had done in the crossing of the river Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By cutting off their flesh to roll away the reproach of Egypt, they were buried and resurrected, both actually and practically.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament circumcision means the constant application of the Lord s death to our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 6:3-4 says that we have been baptized into the death of Christ and buried with Him, but Romans 8:13 and Galatians 5:24 tell us that we should apply the circumcision of the cross to our flesh by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, our flesh has already been crucified, but in practicality we need to crucify the flesh day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the reality and practicality of remaining in the death and burial of Christ, and this is the significance of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second item of intrinsic significance in Joshua 5 is the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The feast of the Passover was held to remember Israel s redemption from the death judgment on the firstborn sons and their salvation from Egypt and from the tyranny of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a type of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the Lord s table we remember Him as the Redeemer and as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our portion today is not death but the partaking and enjoying of Christ at His table.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third item of intrinsic significance is the eating of the produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For forty years the children of Israel had been eating manna without any labor on their part.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when the manna ceased, their food could be produced only by cooperating with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The produce of the land of Canaan came out of farming.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that it was the result of man s labor and cooperation with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is in keeping with Genesis 2:5, which says that God sends the rain and man tills the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This refers to the cooperation of man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both the manna and the produce of the good land typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ in the stage typified by the produce of the good land is different from Christ in the stage typified by manna.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 6, which is not a deep chapter, speaks of Christ as the manna who came down from heaven to feed us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Epistles Christ is no longer just manna; He is the produce of the good land, prepared through our laboring cooperation with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This brings in more Christ for ourselves and others and provides a surplus to God as our offering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fourth item of intrinsic significance concerns the Captain of Jehovah s army.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The children of Israel were ready.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They had been circumcised, they had enjoyed the Passover, and they had enjoyed the produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, they still needed a Captain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then Joshua saw a vision in which Christ was unveiled as the Captain of Jehovah s army.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Joshua was the visible commander, but Christ was the invisible One.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before the children of Israel attacked the Canaanites, they were fully prepared and qualified with Christ, the embodiment of God, as their Captain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they attacked Jericho, they did this under the commanding of the Captain typified by the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The ark, a type of Christ, who was their Commander-in-chief, took the lead to attack the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To prepare to possess the good land, we need to enter into these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to deal with the flesh, enjoy the Lord s table, enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the produce of the good land, and see a vision of Christ, the embodiment of God, as our Captain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now that we have seen the items of intrinsic significance in this chapter, let us consider some of the details concerning the preparation before the attack.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I. THE REACTION OF THE KINGS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>OF THE AMORITES AND THE CANAANITES</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>TO JEHOVAH S MIRACULOUS DEED</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>FOR ISRAEL TO CROSS OVER THE JORDAN</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In verse 1 we see the reaction of the kings of the Amorites and the Canaanites to Jehovah s miraculous deed in drying up the waters for Israel to cross over the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their hearts melted, and there was no longer any spirit boldness in them because of the children of Israel.</S>
