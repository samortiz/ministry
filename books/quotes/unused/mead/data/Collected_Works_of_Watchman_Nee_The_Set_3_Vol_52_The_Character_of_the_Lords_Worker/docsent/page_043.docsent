   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider how the Lord Jesus trained His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Luke 9 records His sending forth of the twelve disciples, and chapter ten records His sending forth of the seventy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of the four Gospels, only Luke records the sending forth of the seventy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In sending forth the twelve, the Lord said, "Take nothing for the journey, neither a staff nor a bag nor bread nor money, nor have two tunics apiece" 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord told them to leave behind many things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He commissioned the seventy, He said, "Do not carry a purse, nor a bag, nor sandals" 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A common point in both cases is money.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, money should be a non-issue for a worker who sets out for his work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later the Lord asked, "When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And they said, Nothing" 22:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Following this the Lord said, "But now, let him who has a purse take it, likewise also a bag; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one" v. 36 . This is because the dispensation had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By that time the Lord Jesus had been rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While there was a chance for the Israelites to receive the Lord, there was no need for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The point to emphasize is that in carrying out his commission for the Lord, a worker should not pay attention to his wallet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His whole being should be given to the message, not to his wallet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We go out to testify that Jesus of Nazareth is God's appointed Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our being is in the message, not in the purse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, we are qualified to work only if we are completely free from money.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we go to every city and town to preach the gospel of the kingdom, we must not be like a camel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot be a camel, stuck at the eye of the needle and barred from the kingdom, while telling others of the need to enter the kingdom by violence Matt 11:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What do the words do not carry mean?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They tell us that the gospel principle contradicts the principle of the purse and the two tunics.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a man sets out to preach the gospel, he cannot set his mind on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For an ordinary journey, one needs a purse to hold his money, a staff for walking, and two tunics to change his clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these things are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the reason the Lord told His disciples to carry them in Luke 22.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why did He say that these are unnecessary when He sent out the twelve disciples in chapter nine and the seventy in chapter ten?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He forbade these things because a gospel preacher should not set his mind on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he is sent, he should go.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He should go if there are two tunics, and he should go if there is only one tunic.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He should go with or without a staff, with or without money, and with or without a purse to carry his money.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what it means to be a gospel preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the basic training the Lord gave the disciples when He sent out the twelve and then the seventy for their work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, we have to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a man's heart is on the gospel, these minor things will not be an issue to him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If these things become an issue to him, it is better that he not go out at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to preach the gospel, our clothing, our purse, and our staff must not be a concern to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they are, we cannot preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The gospel requires that we focus absolutely on the gospel; it requires so much of our attention that these things should become inconsequential to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The gospel is the only thing that should occupy our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we set out for our work, we should be happy with or without the availability of hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to stand on God's side, and we should bear a glorious testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why the Lord said, "Into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house" 10:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How dignified this is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A worker is one who dispenses peace to others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He should honor his own position before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He can be poor, but he can never lose his dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No worker can be so wrong as to give up his dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we go to a place and the people there do not receive us, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord said, "As many as do not receive you, as you go out from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them" 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you see the dignity of the servants of God?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When they are turned away, they do not feel shamed and do not complain, saying, "What bad luck.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We came to the wrong house."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead, they shake off the dust from their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They do not even take a speck of dust from that city.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's servants must maintain their dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They can be poor, but they cannot lose their dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If our mind is not fully settled about this, we cannot have a share in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As workers, we have to deal with the Lord properly regarding the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Otherwise, we cannot touch God's work, because mammon is a crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can find out more about the Lord's training of His disciples in the feeding of the five thousand and then the four thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On one of these occasions, He took His disciples with Him and preached to a large crowd of five thousand, not including women and children.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Toward the close of the day the disciples came to Him and said, "This place is deserted and the hour is already late.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Send the crowds away that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But Jesus said to them, They do not need to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You give them something to eat" Matt 14:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The disciples had hoped that the Lord would send the crowds away to get their own food.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But the Lord said, "You give them something to eat."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When one disciple heard this, he was shocked, and said, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a little" John 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>While they were counting the two hundred denarii, the Lord said, "How many loaves do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Go and see" Mark 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When they brought Him five loaves and two fishes, the Lord performed a miracle and fed them all.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Brothers and sisters, all those who are counting their two hundred denarii are not qualified to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If money means so much to us, we cannot touch God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord shows us in these verses that every worker should be glad to give away what he has.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If money means a great deal to us, we will always calculate profit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A worker should be delivered from the power of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Money should not exert any power or influence upon a worker of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>During the three and a half years the Lord was with the twelve disciples, He gave Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This was the way He trained the twelve disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He showed them that what should be spent should be spent.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God's work has nothing to do with profitability.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is wrong to view God's work with a commercial eye.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Those who are always counting their money are not God's slaves; they are mammon's slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have to learn to rescue ourselves from the power of mammon.</S>
