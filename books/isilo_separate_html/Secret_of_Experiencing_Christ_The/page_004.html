The Greek word translated "from" in these verses is para, meaning "by the side of." The sense of this Greek word is not only "from," but "from with." The Lord is not only from God, but also with God. While He is from God, He is still with God (cf. John 8:16, 29; 16:32).</P><P>The New Testament tells us that the Son was sent by the Father and also from with the Father. This means that when the Father sent Him, He sent Him with the Father Himself. For example, I may send someone to you and come with him. When he is coming to you, I am coming to you with him. This illustrates the mysterious fact that when the Father sent the Son, He also came with the Son.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Coming and Working in the Father's Name,<br>and Being Called the Eternal Father</H2><P>The New Testament also tells us that the Son came in the Father's name (John 5:43). When the Son comes, He comes with the Father and in the Father's name. Eventually, when the Son comes, the Father comes. When we have the Son, we have both the Son and the Father. We have the Son with the Father.</P><P>Furthermore, after coming, the Son worked in the Father's name (John 10:25). He not only came in the Father's name, but also did all His work in the Father's name. For this reason Isaiah 9:6 tells us that His name is called the Eternal Father. Because the Son came in the name of the Father and worked in the name of the Father, He is called the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Son and the Father Being One</H2><P>The New Testament tells us that the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30). Yes, the Son is the Son, and the Father is the Father. The Two are distinct, but They are not separate. In one sense, the Son and the Father are two, but in another sense the Son and the Father are one. We cannot understand this, but it is nevertheless a fact. We can never separate Christ from the Father, for He and the Father are one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Coinhering with the Father</H2><P>In John 14:10 and 11 the Lord told us that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him. In theological terms, this is referred to as coinherence. Coinherence means that two persons exist, or abide, in one another. The Son declared that He was in the Father and the Father was in Him. The Two coinhere; They abide in one another. This is beyond our understanding, but still it is a fact.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
