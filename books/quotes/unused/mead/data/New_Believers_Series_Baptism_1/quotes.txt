[1]  BAPTISM Scripture Reading: Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 22:16; 1 Pet 3:20-21; Rom 6:3-4; Col 2:12
[2]  First, before we are baptized, we need to be clear as to what baptism can do for us.
[3]  Second, after we are baptized, we need to look backward and ask, "What is the significance of baptism?"
[4]  As we are going to be baptized, we should ask ourselves, "What can baptism do for me?"
[5]  If you are on the world's side, no matter what kind of person you are, you are opposed to God, and you are God's enemy.
[6]  There are four major facts concerning the world as shown in the Bible: 1 The world is condemned in the eyes of God, 2 the world lies in the evil one, 3 the world has crucified the Lord Jesus, and 4 the world is at enmity with God; it is God's enemy.
[7]  I hope you can see not only that we are sinners individually and need to be saved individually, but that we also belong to a corporate body which is wrong.
[8]  Indeed, you may have believed and you may have eternal life, but are you saved in the eyes of the world?
[9]  If you are not baptized, you are not saved, because no one knows that you are different.
[10]  On the day of Pentecost, the apostles told the Jews, "Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins" Acts 2:38 .
[11]  This verse shows us again that baptism leads to salvation.
[12]  We should always remember the verse which says, "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"
[13]  God is telling them, "Do you not know that when you were baptized, you died together with Christ and were buried and resurrected together with Him?"
[14]  The emphasis of Romans 6 is death: "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"
[15]  Brothers, when we step into the water of baptism or when we look back after being believers for many years, we must remember that we are already dead.
[16]  We allowed others to bury us because we believed that we were already dead.
[17]  After baptism we must realize that we are in resurrection and that we can therefore serve God today.
