   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO STAGES OF CHRIST'S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible shows us that there are two stages in the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To understand the New Testament we must realize and comprehend these two stages of the Lord's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ's Earthly Ministry,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>from His Incarnation to His Crucifixion</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first stage was Christ's earthly ministry, from His incarnation to His crucifixion, that is, from His birth to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this first stage He ministered as a man, speaking forth God in His flesh John 8:26; 12:49-50 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, He lived for thirty years to become fully mature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Numbers 4:23, thirty years is the full age for a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the age of thirty He came out to minister for three and a half years, traveling back and forth between Galilee and Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Gospel of Matthew He spoke much concerning the kingdom, and in the Gospel of John He spoke much concerning the divine life, which is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then He went to the cross and He died an all-inclusive death to solve all the problems in the universe between God and His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After finishing His work in His death, He rested, keeping the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His Resurrection Christ Being Born</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>as the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then, from that rest He rose up in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In His resurrection He was born.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All Christians realize that Christ was born once.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was born in Bethlehem, of Mary, to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the New Testament shows us that the Lord Jesus was born a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Incarnation was His first birth, a birth in which He as God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Resurrection also was a birth to Jesus Christ as the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To this last Adam, this last man, resurrection was another birth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this birth He was born to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is clearly revealed in Acts 13:33, which tells us that Christ was born in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before His resurrection Christ was already the only begotten Son of God John 1:18; 3:16, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From eternity to eternity He is God's Only Begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in His incarnation He became a man; He put on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the only begotten Son of God, He was divine, but in His first birth He picked up humanity and put it upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, from that day forward He was no longer merely God; He was also a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was such a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, there was a problem: As a divine person He had a human part that was not divine and that had nothing to do with God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That human part was the Son of Man, not the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When He finished His earthly ministry, at the time when He accomplished God's eternal redemption, He finished His work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the end of His crucifixion He declared from the cross, "It is finished!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 19:30 because His earthly ministry, that is, the ministry for the accomplishment of redemption, was finished, consummated, completed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, He slept and He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, God's economy was not yet finished.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That was just the first part of God's economy; it was not the greatest part.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The greatest part of God's economy was yet to come.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, after He rested for three days, He rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, the New Testament says that God raised Him up; on the other hand, it also says that He Himself rose up Acts 2:24 and note 241; 10:40-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both God and He brought Him out of death, Hades, and the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1 Corinthians 15, a chapter that deals particularly with the matter of resurrection, verse 45 says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to this verse, in His resurrection, as a man, the last man, the concluding man, the last Adam, Christ became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was also born to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that in His resurrection, Christ "sonized" His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He made His humanity also a part of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now Jesus Christ as the Son of God has two natures, the divine and the human.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After His resurrection He came back to His disciples as the Spirit John 20:19-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time He asked His disciple Thomas, "Bring your finger here and see My hands, and bring your hand and put it into My side" v. 27 . This means that the resurrected Christ still had His physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot understand how the Lord can be both physical and spiritual at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nevertheless, in His resurrection Christ was born to be the firstborn Son of God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ's being the firstborn Son of God indicates that many sons of God will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His birth in resurrection and through resurrection was not just the delivery of one son; it was the delivery of the firstborn Son and of many sons as well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to 1 Peter 1:3, we all were regenerated, that is, reborn, with Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In His resurrection He was delivered as the firstborn Son of God, and we were delivered as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all were included in that great delivery Eph 2:6a , in which millions of sons of God were born.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all need to realize that the birth of the firstborn Son with the birth of the many sons created another world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this universe there is another world, a spiritual, heavenly, and divine world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The unbelievers know only this present human world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They do not know anything about the other world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But we have been regenerated out of the human world and into another world that is spiritual, heavenly, and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, Philippians 3:20 tells us that we are heavenly citizens, and Ephesians 2:6 says that we have been seated together with Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
