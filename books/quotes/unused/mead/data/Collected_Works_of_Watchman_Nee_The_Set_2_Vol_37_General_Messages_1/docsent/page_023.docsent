   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN A POOR MAN Scripture Reading: Rev 3:17 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among God's children, there is a problem of a Laodicean attitude and a Laodicean heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A man who thinks that he is rich but, in reality, is poor has a Laodicean attitude and a Laodicean heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In spiritual matters, the matter of having or not having is easy to resolve, but the matter of being poor or being rich is not as easy to resolve.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who have nothing can easily see God, but those who have a little do not easily see God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people have nothing before God, and they often meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The worst kind of people are those who have a little; they understand a little of this and a little of that.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But do they really know?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do they really understand?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No. They speak a great deal, but they have not moved a single inch or advanced a single step.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are poor ones indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The biggest problem with poverty is that a man will not easily admit that he is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have nothing readily admit that they have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If they have something, they say so, and if they do not have something, they also say so.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is very simple and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But poverty is something relative.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If Mr. A is worse off than Mr. B, it means that Mr. A is poorer than Mr. B. But Mr. B can be worse off than Mr. C, which means that Mr. B is poorer than Mr. C. It is easy to make a judgment when one has nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not so easy to make a judgment when one is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first time a child has some money, he thinks that he is the richest man in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does not know his poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he does not have any money, he easily understands that he has nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if he has a little money, it is more difficult to show him that he does not have enough money for certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In spiritual matters, God can deal with those who have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who are poor, however, are hindered by the little that they possess.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They think that they have something, and they become proud and self-sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Someone may have obeyed God only three times during the past ten years, but he never forgets that he has obeyed God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While he is talking about obedience, others who have truly learned the lesson and who are sensitive almost have to stand up and shout to him: "Do you really know what obedience is?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who talk about obedience in this way are poor men, truly poor men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people constantly talk about the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One may say that what we need before the Lord is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Another may say the same thing, but those who truly know the cross almost have to say: "Brothers, do you know what the cross is?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Just because God has dealt with you a few times does not mean that you have been thoroughly dealt with before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God dealt with you on the day that you were saved, but this does not mean that you have learned a deep lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are still very short!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who do not know the cross, yet who talk glibly about it, are indeed poor!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some brothers say that they are clear that the church is this and that; they say that they did this and that when they saw the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some sisters say that they are pursuing after the kingdom; they say that they are willing to forsake everything for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But those who know them will say that they do not know what the Body or the kingdom is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many of the things that God's children have are very cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They have cheap obedience, cheap crosses, a cheap Body, a cheap kingdom!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, they do not know obedience, the cross, the Body, or the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are poor men!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Poverty is not a hindrance if it does not come with pride.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But nothing can be done about poverty when it is in a proud person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Poverty is not the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Being like Laodicea is a problem because Laodicea was poor and proud yet thought that she was rich.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the spiritual realm, it is hard to find a person who is poor but not proud.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, it is often the rich ones who are not proud.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a pity that many of God's children go around in circles and never advance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The sole reason that they suffer loss is because they think that they have something.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people talk about the flesh, but actually they do not know what the flesh is.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many people talk about revelation, but they do not know what revelation is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They can say much about obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They can say much about the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They can say much about the cross, dealing with the self, or dealing with the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet what they say and how they speak reveal that they are poor and ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have never touched God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They speak what they do not know and only deceive themselves and those who are like them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In spiritual matters, those who think that they are rich can never make others believe that they are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the contrary, they only expose their poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church in Laodicea said, "I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing" Rev 3:17a .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This does not refer to material riches, but to spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She felt that she had something.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But God said, "You...do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked" v. 17b . Did she have something? Yes, but what she had was of no benefit to her.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If she really had something, she should have rejoiced, yet she was wretched and miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She did not behave as if she had anything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Her wretchedness and misery tell others that she was poor.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Poverty is always linked to blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Those who are spiritually poor are always blind.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The blind ones always think that they are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who have not seen the cross think that they know the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Those who have not seen the kingdom think that they know the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Those who have not seen the Body of Christ think that they know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All those who think that they have something are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whenever we truly see something, we will not dare to boast that we are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Whenever our eyes are opened, we will see that we are naked.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only the foolish ones boast of what they have.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A Laodicean is poor, but does not see his own poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is a warning to us.</S>
