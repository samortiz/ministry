   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEED TO BRING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope that the newly saved brothers and sisters will pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once you are saved, you should gather your family members together and declare to them, From this day forward, my household belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You need to declare this whether or not they belong to the Lord and whether or not they agree.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You are the head of the house and you should do this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should take the matter into your own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You should declare that your household will serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you exercise your faith to stand firm this way, you will prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If those who are saved through us are saved household by household instead of one by one, what a difference it will make!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brothers and sisters, do not be too loose with your children at home.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One of the greatest failures of the Protestants is that they are too loose with their next generation; they allow their next generation to have the freedom to choose their own faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Catholics do not have to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their increase through natural birth alone is greater than the increase the Protestants have in a lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Have you seen Catholics preaching the gospel on street corners like the Salvation Army?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No. They just propagate through natural birth, generation after generation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two become four, and four become eight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every Roman Catholic child automatically becomes a Roman Catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Catholics do not pay much attention to increase from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as a person is born into Catholicism, he is dragged into the religion whether or not he eventually becomes a true believer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is no wonder that the Catholic population exceeds the Protestant population by more than three times.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not be nonchalant in this matter, and do not allow your own children to drift away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me repeat: A new believer needs to declare right from the start that his household belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only must he be the Lord s individually; he also must declare that his household is the Lord s. Take full control of this matter, and it will be done for you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to declare again and again at home, As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All who live in this house should decide to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You should bring your family to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should not make any excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not allow anyone to drift away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Household salvation is one of the greatest principles in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once you are saved, your whole household should be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As an individual you must first stand firm for the Lord, and then your household will change.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that you will pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you do this, you will bring more people to the Lord.</S>
