[1]  In Acts 26:19 the apostle Paul said, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision."
[2]  We need the vision, and we should pray much that we may have the vision.
[3]  Only when we have the vision of Christ, the church, the Body, the self, and the world will we have the reality of what we have heard.
[4]  Colossians 1:15-18 reveals that Christ must have the first place, the preeminence, in everything.
[5]  We need to see that Christ must have the preeminence in all things, that Christ must be the essence of our daily walk, that Christ must be the reality of our ministry and service, and that Christ must be the only expression in the church life.
[6]  But when we come to the Bible after we have seen the vision of Christ and have been caught by Christ and are occupied with Christ, in our reading of the Bible we will see Christ and we will care only for Christ.
[7]  CHAPTER TWO THE VISION OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Acts 8:1; 13:1; 1 Cor 1:2; Rev 1:11
[8]  The vision of the church is neglected more by Christians than the vision of Christ is.
[9]  In a doctrinal way Christians may talk about Christ, but not even in a doctrinal way do they speak much concerning the church.
[10]  Next, we need to see that the practical expression of the church must be local.
[11]  The New Testament speaks of the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, the church in Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 , the church in Ephesus Rev 2:1 , and the church in other cities Rom 16:1 .
[12]  We also need a vision of the unity of the church, a vision of the unique oneness of the church.
[13]  When we speak here of the unity of the church, we speak of the unique unity, the only unity.
[14]  The reason for this limitation is that the church in the city, the local expression of the church, keeps the unity, the unique oneness, of the church.
[15]  As long as we have the city church in Los Angeles, we are one.
[16]  But if instead of the church in Los Angeles, we have street churches, or avenue churches, we will be divided.
[17]  We would also be divided if we had churches in different houses, for there would be a church in the house of one brother and a different church in the house of another brother.
[18]  If you go to San Francisco, you must go to the city church, the local church, the church in San Francisco.
[19]  If we are to have the practice of the church, we must take a definite standing, and this standing must not be a wrong standing but the right standing the standing on the ground of the church, the ground of unity.
[20]  We need to pray about the four matters we have covered concerning the vision of the church: the church being God's heart's desire, the practicality of the church, the locality of the church, and the definite local ground of unity.
[21]  We need to be caught, captured, by these points concerning the vision of the church.
[22]  Another example concerns a brother who, in response to our question of whether his meeting was on the ground of the church, said, "I cannot say that the meeting here is on the church ground, but we are working toward this goal."
[23]  CHAPTER THREE THE VISION OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1-2; 1 Cor 12:12-27; Eph 4:16
[24]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this precious hour that we may come to learn the way of Your recovery.
[25]  We bow before You to confess that we are still sinful, that we are still in the old nature, and that we are still so much in the self.
[26]  The first of these visions is the vision of Christ.
[27]  To have the vision of Christ is to see that Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God and the center of all things related to God.
[28]  We need to see that the church is not something "in the air" but is very real and practical.
[29]  In the New Testament we do not have much teaching about the church, but we surely have the practicality of the church.
[30]  Can you show me where the Bible tells us that we will have the proper church life, the so-called invisible yet real church life, in the future in heaven?
[31]  "He dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it" v. 12 . When Jacob awoke he said, "How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven" v. 17 . Then he called the name of that place "Bethel," which means "the house of God." Today Bethel, the house of God, is the church 1 Tim 3:15 . Wherever there is the church, the house of God, that place is the gate of heaven.
[32]  We also need to see that the church has its definite ground the ground of the unique unity.
[33]  You need to see that the church is the desire of God's heart, and you need to see that the church is practical and local.
[34]  Formerly you did not see the vision of Christ, but now you see this vision.
[35]  Whereas the substitutes are the hindrance to seeing the vision of Christ and the cost is the hindrance to seeing the vision of the church, the hindrance to seeing the vision of the Body and to practicing the Body life is the self.
[36]  Once we see the vision of Christ, we are qualified to see the vision of the church.
[37]  However, with the matter of the church, you may sense that there is a cost and that you will have to pay the price.
[38]  If you are not willing to pay the price, you may go back to the vision of Christ and say, "It is sufficient that we know Christ.
[39]  We need to learn the lessons regarding the self so that we may be built up in the Body.
[40]  As we are considering this matter of the self, I would urge you to receive more grace so that the self might be exposed.
[41]  It is not adequate that we realize that Christ is everything and then come together to practice the proper church life.
[42]  CHAPTER FOUR THE VISION OF THE SELF Scripture Reading: Matt 16:21-26; Luke 9:23-25; Gen 3:1-6
[43]  If we would see the vision of the self, we need to pay careful attention to Matthew 16:21-26, Luke 9:23-25, and Genesis 3:1-6.
[44]  This shall by no means happen to You!" v. 22 . Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men" v. 23 . Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.
[45]  Two great problems are sin in the body and self in the soul.
[46]  Because the self is something independent, the self is the greatest problem to the building up of the Body.
[47]  If you check with your experience, you will realize that when you were independent of the brothers and sisters, you had the sense that you were also independent of God.
[48]  If you are independent of the Body, you are spontaneously independent of the Lord and are in the self, no matter how many good things you intend to do.
[49]  CHAPTER FIVE THE VISION OF THE WORLD Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:15-17; James 4:4
[50]  DEADENED BY THE FLESH, THE SELF, AND THE WORLD
[51]  Man's body became the flesh, man's soul became the self, and the things of the earth were systematized to become the preoccupying world.
[52]  In the foregoing chapters we have covered the vision of Christ, the vision of the church, the vision of the Body, the vision of the self, and the vision of the world.
[53]  If you pay the price for the heavenly vision, you will "burn the bridges" behind you and will have no way to go backward.
