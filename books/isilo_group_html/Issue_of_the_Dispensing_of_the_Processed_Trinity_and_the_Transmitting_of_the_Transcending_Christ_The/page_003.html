How we thank You for the divine provision, which is so rich, so prevailing, so refreshing, and so touching. Lord, we look unto You for Your anointing on the whole congregation with every attendant, for Your anointing on every activity, and especially for Your anointing on the speaking and the hearing. Be one with us, Lord. We are here looking unto You. We like to be one with You in Your speaking. Lord, speak Your word in our speaking forth of You. Cover us. We can never forget Your enemy. Defeat him and shame him. Now is the time for the enemy to be shamed, for You to be blessed, and for all of us to be taken care of. Lord, we thank You again. Amen.</P><P>The burden of the messages in this book may be expressed in the following four statements:</P><P>1. The Father's dispensing in His choosing and predestinating issues in His many sons as His house in sanctification&#151;Eph. 1:3-6.<br>2. The Son's dispensing in His redeeming and saving issues in the believers as God's inheritance in transformation&#151;Eph. 1:7-12.<br>3. The Spirit's dispensing in His sealing and pledging issues in God as the believers' inheritance unto their perfection&#151;Eph. 1:13-14.<br>4. The transcending Christ's transmitting in His rising and ascending issues in His Body as His expression unto the believers' consummation&#151;Eph. 1:19-23.</P><P>After I wrote the notes on the book of Ephesians in our Recovery Version of the New Testament, the Lord kept working within me to show me the depths of Ephesians 1. For centuries His people have neglected and even missed the real mark in this chapter of the Bible.</P><P>The title of this book is The Issue of the Dispensing of the Processed Trinity and the Transmitting of the Transcending Christ. The issue here is the church, the Body of Christ, and this issue is of the dispensing of the processed Trinity and of the transmitting of the transcending Christ. The Trinity has been processed for His dispensing. Also, Christ today is in the highest place in the universe as the transcending One to transmit Himself to the church, His Body. There is a kind of heavenly, spiritual transmission going on all the time from and by the transcending Christ.</P><P>The title of this first chapter is "The Issue of God the Father's Dispensing Speaking Forth God's Eternal Purpose." The church as the Body of Christ is the issue of God's threefold dispensing. There are not three kinds of dispensing, but there is one dispensing which is threefold. This dispensing is of the Divine Trinity&#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father's dispensing speaks forth God's eternal purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ETERNAL PURPOSE OF GOD</H2><P>We need to know the eternal purpose of God. Our great God surely has a purpose, and His purpose is the intention of His desire. In eternity past our God had a heart's desire, and this desire became His intention. In this intention there is a purpose. The purpose of God in His intention according to His heart's desire is to have many sons. God desires to have many sons to be His expression in a corporate way.</P><P>For this reason He created the universe, and the center of His universal creation is man. For man to live, God prepared the earth, and the earth has to be under the blessing of the heavens. From the heavens the earth receives the sunshine, rain, and fresh air. Then on this earth God created man as the center. Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God so that God can produce many sons.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Issue of the Dispensing of the Processed Trinity and the Transmitting of the Transcending Christ &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
