   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WE HAVE THIS LIFE AND CAN EXPERIENCE IT EVERY DAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although this life is divine and eternal, it has come to humanity in time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It came in Jesus Christ to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said in John 10:10b, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.''</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of our sins, He had to die for our sins in order to obtain redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b to give life to us who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From then on, we have this life in us and we may experience this life daily.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. The Experiences of This Life</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our first experience of this life is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we believe in the Lord through the hearing of the gospel, the life-giving Spirit begets us and regenerates us with this life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a crucial fact related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must see and not forget this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From this point, we have a life which is divine, eternal and indestructible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may live a Christian life according to all God demands and fulfill God's purpose, because this life is capable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The soul-life and the sinful flesh may still give us trouble every day, yet this life is able to overcome and express God in us every day all day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must learn to experience this life every day to cause it to grow in us until maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. The Issues of This Life</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This life does not come into us merely to be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It issues in a Christian life that is godly, expressing all that God is, and is victorious over sin, the world, the flesh, the self, the natural life and individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It also bears fruit according to John 15, that is, to dispense this life into others through the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the church, according to God's purpose and standard, will be built.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ultimately it will produce the New Jerusalem, the mingling of the processed Triune God and His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem will be in life, full of life and expressing life for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>C. The Maintenance of This Life</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since this life is so wonderful and crucial to us Christians, we must endeavor to maintain and preserve this life at all cost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must deal with all the things that hinder us from growing in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We also must apply all the life practices such as calling on the Lord, reading the word, praying, pray-reading, singing, fellowshipping, etc. to enjoy this life every day from morning to evening.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we will be strong to experience this life in our daily life, overcoming all the negative situations in school and at home, thereby becoming proper students and children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not need to wait until we grow up or until the Lord returns to experience this life and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may grow by maintaining this life today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus God's eternal purpose, the building of His church, will be fulfilled by us Eph 4:16b .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Questions What are the three words for life and their meanings?</S>
