[3]  Volume 43 of The Collected Works contains five sections that include various messages given by Watchman Nee in 1937 and 1938.
[4]  Section Six contains messages given in Canton in the spring of 1937, including topics on the revelation of Jesus Christ, God interrupting man's speaking, and basic gospel truths.
[5]  John 3:16 says that God gave us His Son; Revelation 1:1 says that God gave us the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[6]  If we only have Christ but do not have the revelation of Jesus Christ, we still do not know who Christ is, and it is as if Jesus Christ is still behind the veil.
[7]  These ones not only have Jesus Christ today but also the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[8]  All twelve disciples had Jesus Christ, but only three had the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[9]  Having the Son of God is having eternal life, but not everyone who has the Son of God has the revelation of the Son of God.
[10]  Without the revelation of Jesus Christ, there will not be a clear and adequate realization of Jesus Christ.
[11]  I am afraid that the Jesus Christ we know is merely the Jesus Christ spoken of in the four Gospels or the Jesus Christ taught by some preachers.
[12]  According to 2 Peter 1:16-17 he said, "For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we became eyewitnesses of that One's majesty.
[13]  After the Lord was transfigured, suddenly Elijah and Moses appeared before the disciples and conversed with the Lord Jesus.
[14]  Peter must have thought, "This is such a rare opportunity for the three of us to be with the three of you."
[15]  He proposed to the Lord, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah."
[16]  CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE GOD INTERRUPTING MAN'S SPEAKING Date: April 12, 1937
[17]  God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit interrupted Peter's speaking three different times.
[18]  In Matthew 17 when the Lord was in Capernaum, the temple-tax gatherers came to ask Peter, "Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?" v. 24 . Peter said, "Yes." After Peter answered, he thought, "What if Christ does not pay the tax?" Therefore, he came into the house to tell the Lord.
[19]  God listened to the incessant speaking of Job and his friends, yet it seems that God did not have the same patience with Peter.
[20]  We should realize that God interrupts man's speaking not because He is impatient; He interrupts man's speaking because what is said should not be said.
[21]  Thank God, those of us who can read the Bible are able to know God's will, and the villagers who cannot read the Bible are also able to know God's will, because Christ lives in them.
[22]  Peter's speaking was interrupted the second time by Christ in a house in Capernaum.
[23]  Peter seemed to be the spokesman of the twelve disciples, and some came to ask, "Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?"
[24]  The incident with the temple tax occurred immediately after Caesarea Philippi, where the Lord asked the disciples, "Who do you say that I am?" and Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[25]  Therefore, after Peter proclaimed that Christ was the Son of the living God in Matthew 16, Christ said to him, "Upon this rock I will build My church."
[26]  The salvation of Christ is a faith that believes in Christ being the Son of God.
[27]  If you read the book of Romans, the Gospel of Luke, or the Epistle of First John, you will find that everything hinges on whether or not Christ is the Son of God.
[28]  If Christ had not put on human form and instead had the sun on His head, a face like lightning, and a voice like thunder, everyone would have naturally believed that He was the Son of God.
[29]  Acts 10 shows us the first time the church preached the gospel to the Gentiles.
[30]  To be a Christian is to believe in Christ, to have our sins forgiven, to have God as our righteousness, and to have Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord.
[31]  CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX MAN, SINNER, SIN, AND SINS Time: Spring 1937
[32]  The Shanghai messages have been published as The Gospel of God Volumes 28 and 29 of The Collected Works.
[33]  The following two chapters are based on the Canton messages, and they are similar in content to the first two chapters of The Gospel of God.
[34]  In the seventeen years that I have been preaching, I have never said, "If you do not sin, God will be pleased with you."
[35]  Now let us go on by asking how man sinned.
[36]  The Bible, in particular the book of Romans, tells us that the act of sin involves a process of sin.
[37]  Once we are clear concerning the scriptural distinction between sins and sin, and once we are clear concerning their difference in our living, we will see the way that God delivers us from our sinful living and sinful life.
[38]  Because of the many sins without, man needs to be justified before God, and because of the inward sin which compels him to sin, man needs to be sanctified within.
[39]  In the Bible God's love has three aspects: 1 God is love 1 John 4:16 ; His very nature is love; 2 God loves the world John 3:16 ; God's feeling toward man is love; and 3 God's love is manifested through the cross Rom 5:8 ; this is the work of God's love.
[40]  Second, God loves the world, that is, God loves man.
[41]  He thought that this might cause God to forgive him of his sins.
[42]  The Bible says that there is no need for us to beg God to change His mind.
[43]  The biggest misunderstanding man has toward God is to think that God hates man or that He wants to punish man.
[44]  We have to realize that it is we who fail to love God rather than God who fails to love us.
[45]  Third, we need to see how God's love is manifested.
[46]  We need to see the work of His love.
[47]  Romans 5:8 says, "God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[48]  Grace came in only after He died on the cross, when God put man's sins upon Christ and Christ took our sins away.
[49]  One verse which we are all familiar with and which is often used by pastors in the denominations for their benedictions is 2 Corinthians 13:14: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
[50]  If we had to do something first and then trust in the Lord for what we could not do, our salvation would be nothing more than shopping for a bargain, because we would be paying a certain amount first and then relying on Christ to pay the rest.
[51]  There is another problem that, if left unresolved, would prevent God from saving man even if He wanted to.
[52]  If the righteousness of God was left unresolved, untouched, and unsettled, that is, if God's righteous requirements were not met, He could not save man.
[53]  These two obstacles are: 1 God has to satisfy His love for man, and 2 God has to satisfy His own righteous requirements.
[54]  Every time we read about God's glory in the Bible, we should realize that it refers to God Himself.
[55]  God can save man in many ways, but no matter which way He takes, He has to do it according to righteousness.
[56]  We cannot see any unit that is bigger or smaller than the local church.
[57]  We can only read of "the church in Ephesus"; we cannot read of "such and such church in Ephesus," because "such and such church" is not qualified to be the church of God in Ephesus.
[58]  Church history during the past several centuries shows that the church was built up by special gifts of God.
[59]  I love Darby, etc. All of these spiritual giants were greatly used by God at the beginning, but gradually the only thing that was left was a denomination.
[60]  Everyone who is called to the work is on his own; no other person is responsible for him.
[61]  It is God who bears all of his responsibilities, and no one should come to me later and say, "Mr. Nee, I resign." If he wants to resign, he has to hand in his resignation to God.
[62]  Your offering is to God, and whether or not the person is faithful, he will have to settle his account before the judgment seat.
[63]  God gave us His life so that we could become His many sons.
[64]  Even though God wanted man to have His life, man not only failed to receive it, but he also sinned and fell.
[65]  But if the door is not opened, there is no way for one to enter in. If we want to be sons of God, we must first be forgiven of our sins.
[66]  His way is through the blood of the Lord Jesus.
[67]  He sent the Lord to the earth, who put on the human body, died on the cross, and shed His blood for the redemption of our sins before God.
[68]  Through the blood our sins before God are taken away, and our conscience is at peace Heb 9:14 .
[69]  He said, "If a person is sorry for his sins, Allah in heaven i.e., God will forgive him, and he will go to heaven one day."
[70]  In order for God to forgive our sins and save us, He must find a way that does not come into conflict with His nature, His righteousness, or His law.
[71]  If God forgives our sins in a loose way, He will violate the law.
[72]  How can God save us and at the same time not get into trouble Himself?
[73]  It is not difficult to forgive sins, but it is not easy to have a forgiveness in a way that is righteous and lawful.
[74]  Today God not only needs to give life to man, but He also must deal with the things that prevent Him from reaching His goal.
[75]  Tonight let us first consider the blood and resurrection, that is, the substituting death and resurrection.
[76]  I have committed sins, and because I have sinned, I am a guilty man before God.
[77]  But if God judged us, we could not bear it because we could not satisfy God's righteous requirements.
[78]  The heart is man's self, his real I. What does it mean for the Lord's blood to cleanse the conscience? It means that the blood has taken away our sins before God and that the punishment we deserved before God has been removed.
[79]  When I was in the Philippines, a sister asked me, "At the time of the flood, man could not take blood.
[80]  In the dispen- sation of the law, man could not take blood.
[81]  The blood is something man sends to God, whereas resurrection is something God sends to man after He has accepted the blood.
[82]  I believe all of us would say that Jesus was delivered because there were offenses.
[83]  God accepts the death of Christ, and we accept the resur- rection of Christ.
[84]  Last night we saw that there are four aspects to the death of Christ.
[85]  Christ died for us so that we could escape death; this is for our redemption.
[86]  What do we know about the sin that lies within man?
[87]  Paul says that this inward sin is a law in our members Rom 7:23 .
[88]  If we are rebuked in the morning, we feel unhappy; if we are rebuked in the evening, we feel unhappy; if we are rebuked today, we feel unhappy; and if we are rebuked tomorrow or the day after, we also will feel unhappy.
[89]  The holiness group says that once a person has uprooted sin, he will never sin again.
[90]  The Chinese say that since all the evil things come from the evil body, we should practice asceticism to buffet the body so that it will see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, and act no evil.
[91]  Perhaps we do not have the faith; perhaps there is doubt in our heart that there is such a thing: "I am still I. I do not feel like I am crucified." The sins of a sinner are washed away by the blood of the Lord as soon as he believes.
[92]  Last night we saw the fact concerning God crucifying our old man.
[93]  Romans 6:11 says, "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus."
[94]  We should reckon ourselves to be dead in Christ, and also reckon ourselves to be resurrected in Christ.
[95]  God says that we are dead in Christ, but Satan says that we are not dead.
[96]  If you believe that you are in Christ and that you are truly joined to Him, you will jump up and shout, "Praise God, I am dead!"
[97]  First Corinthians 1:30 says, "Of Him you are in Christ Jesus."
[98]  In other words, you are in Christ because of God's work.
[99]  I am not capable at all and cannot lift anything heavy, but I can put this bottle in the sea.
[100]  God can put me into Christ with as much ease as I put the bottle in the sea.
[101]  When I spoke about being in Christ, one of them asked me, "How can I be in Christ?
[102]  If we do not have a relationship with Christ, we will remain the same, and all that Christ has attained will have no impact on us."
[103]  Likewise, God has put us in Christ and joined us to Christ.
[104]  I hope that God will grant you light and revelation to see that you are one with Christ.
[105]  During the past few evenings we have seen four things concerning the death and resurrection of Christ.
[106]  We have already seen the first two items in detail, concerning how Christ propitiated our sins with His blood and how He crucified the old man.
[107]  The work of Christ can be divided into two parts: we in Him and He in us.
[108]  In order for us to be in Christ, we must believe, and in order for Christ to be in us, we must obey.
[109]  I will not explain this verse now even though I feel it would help you.
[110]  Let me first tell you what it means to "believe that you have received them, and you will have them."
[111]  You tell him that he is a sinner and that Jesus Christ has accomplished the work of redemption for him.
[112]  He tells you that he wants to believe, that he wants the Lord to forgive his sins, and that he wants to come to God through Christ.
[113]  He said, "Mr. Nee, I am really miserable!" I said, "You are miserable, but I am very happy." He said, "I really do not know what to do." I said, "Nothing could be better." He said, "Mr. Nee, do not make fun of me." I said, "I am very happy because this is a sickness which only the Lord can heal.
[114]  In 1929 I lived in a place about two hours away from the city of Foochow.
[115]  At that time we had a sister who had a very serious eye disease.
[116]  He told me that God had called him to preach the gospel in Ku-Tien and that when he returned God would heal him.
[117]  A living faith is not one that believes that God will heal but one that believes that God has already healed.
[118]  CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE THE REVELATION ON THE MOUNTAIN Date: August 8, 1937
[119]  The Bible tells us that the mountain is the place where one draws near to God.
[120]  If a man does not leave the plain and ascend to a higher place, he cannot draw near to God.
[121]  As far as His person goes, He is the Son of God, and as far as His work goes, He is the Christ of God.
[122]  The Bible tells us that the church is built upon the rock Matt 16:18 .
[123]  The Lord Jesus told Peter that he was a little stone and that He would build His church upon the rock.
[124]  When men know the Lord as Christ, as the Son of the living God, and when the person and work of Christ are revealed, we have the rock.
[125]  The knowledge of the Lord as Christ and as the Son of the living God is something that is not revealed by men, but by the Father who is in the heavens v. 17 . The ones who have seen this revelation are taught by God.
[126]  Let me say honestly that if a person has not received the revelation of Christ the Son of God, he is not a Christian.
[127]  Those who have seen the revelation on the mountain enter the kingdom of God, and those who have not received such a revelation are not yet regenerated; they have no part in the kingdom of God.
[128]  When we ascend to the mountain, to a higher place, we see Christ.
[129]  When she came, I said, "On behalf of the church in Shanghai I was a brother in the church in Shanghai at that time , I forbid you to cover your head again, because we do not have head-covering sisters like you among us.
[130]  You can go to God and inquire of Him directly; there is no need for your brothers to tell you anything.
[131]  May the Lord grant us mercy to have a living faith through a seeking heart so that we can be those who truly live in Christ and inherit all the promises that are prepared for us in Christ.
[132]  The Bible tells us that if we are conformed to Him in the likeness of His death, we will also be conformed to Christ in the likeness of His resurrection Rom 6:5 .
[133]  He wanted man to receive His life His uncreated life and become His sons.
[134]  After man was created, God placed him in front of the tree of life, implicitly indicating that man should eat of the tree of life, that is, man should receive God's uncreated life into him.
[135]  God is uncreated, and His intention is that the created man would receive His own uncreated life and be uplifted from the level of man to one that is before God.
[136]  Verses 49 and 50 of Luke 12 are two of the most precious verses in the Bible.
[137]  Yet man did not receive it, because "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!" v. 50 . The Lord told us that the fire was not kindled because He still had a baptism to be baptized with.
[138]  This is the highest and most crucial passage in the Bible because it touches God's goal.
[139]  Life was in Him, but unless He died, He would forever be the only One, because God had only one Son; He was the only Begotten of God.
[140]  In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus reveals that He is now in the Holy Spirit and that He is ready for us to receive Him.
[141]  Paul knew of Christ according to the flesh, but in 2 Corinthians 5:16, he said that "now we know Him so no longer."
[142]  We have seen that there are four aspects to the death and resurrection of Christ.
[143]  God does not want us merely to be humans; He wants to put His life within us and accomplish everything that we cannot accomplish by ourselves.
[144]  God's goal is with the flesh because God's life is with the flesh.
[145]  When we believe and are saved, we can come to God immediately because we are begotten by Him and share His life.
[146]  Whether or not we will receive glory and reward depends on whether we allow God's life to live within us.
[147]  Romans 3:23 tells us that all men have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[148]  Hence, the church, which is sanctified through Christ and produced through the life of Christ, is from God and of God.
[149]  Christ can call us brothers because both Christ and we come from God.
[150]  The death of Christ accomplished the aspect of God's work related to the flesh; He has put His life into the flesh so that we can now receive God's life when we eat His flesh.
[151]  The Jews did not understand this, and they asked, "How can this man give us His flesh to eat?" v. 52 . The Lord said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves" v. 53 . In this verse the Lord spoke of the flesh first and the blood afterwards.
[152]  If we receive Him with a living faith, we will see that we are not only in Christ but that Christ is also in us as our power, life, and everything.
[153]  CHAPTER SEVENTY-EIGHT THE OVERCOMING LIFE Date: August 10, 1937
[154]  Yesterday we saw that God's goal is to give us Christ to be our life.
[155]  Today we want to see why God gives us Christ.
[156]  But we have to admit that the way we live does not reflect the fact that Christ is our life.
[157]  For God to give us Christ as our life means that He has put Christ within us and has caused Him to live for us.
[158]  During the past two years, I have seen two kinds of sickness among many believers.
[159]  I said, "You can do nothing about this, and you have asked God for patience, but He has not given it to you.
[160]  The problem with us is that even though we cannot make it, we try to bear the burden ourselves and refuse to let Christ bear it for us.
[161]  We were defeated, but God has put Christ within us and has replaced our "I" with "Christ" so that now we can overcome.
[162]  God has crucified our old man through the cross of the Lord, and Christ is living within us to be our victory.
[163]  It is not a matter of living by Christ, through Christ, because of Christ, or by the power of Christ.
[164]  A man once said to me, "I want to overcome.
[165]  Then he turned to me and asked, "Mr. Nee, did I pray the right prayer?" I said, "No. God only engages in wholesale business; He is not interested in retail business." He asked, "What do you mean?" I said, "When you lack patience, you go to God for patience.
[166]  God does not dispense anything to us in a fragmentary way; whatever He gives to us is found in Christ.
[167]  During the past evenings, we have seen how the Lord Jesus gave His flesh to us as our true food, that is, how He gave His life to us to become our life.
[168]  Our victory does not depend on Christ helping, empowering, or strengthening us.
[169]  Victory is Christ in us, living for us and overcoming for us.
[170]  The Lord said to him, "You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother'" v. 20 . The Lord showed him what he should do, and the young ruler boasted that he had kept these from his youth.
[171]  The problem with the young ruler was not adultery or stealing but the matter of giving to the poor.
[172]  This was the one thing that the young ruler lacked.
[173]  We may think that we have overcome everything, but there is still one thing.
[174]  Brothers and sisters, if you have not seen tonight that one entangling sin has been following you all the time, you have surely not overcome.
[175]  If a man has not realized that there is one sin that entangles him, he has not taken the first step in the overcoming life.
[176]  God has no choice but to show us this one last sin so that we will find out whether or not we really can make it by ourselves.
[177]  Luke 18 shows the impossibility with men, while Luke 19 shows us the possibility with God.
[178]  Man cannot make it; he cannot make it by himself.
[179]  If we have a living faith in God, we will do what man cannot otherwise do.
[180]  In these two chapters the Lord shows us that He can save us from all sins because He can save us from the thing that we love the most.
[181]  The way to victory is not merely realizing that we cannot make it, but realizing that God has given us Christ, who has overcome everything on our behalf.
[182]  We cannot make it, but that is not the end. It is true that we cannot make it, but through Christ who lives in us, we can do all things.
[183]  Thank God, the things that are impossible with men are possible with God!
[184]  CONFERENCE IN PENANG, APRIL 1938 CHAPTER EIGHTY GOD IS LIGHT Date: April 1, 1938
[185]  He existed in the form of God and shared the same place and glory as God.
[186]  Having the mind which was in Christ Jesus means that this mind was once in Christ Jesus, but that today it should be in you and me.
[187]  The mind of Christ Jesus is this: He was equal with God, yet He emptied Himself of God's form, glory, and position, and took a lower position.
[188]  Christ was God, yet He gave up His deserving honor and position, and He became a man and our Savior.
[189]  Whenever we do not receive what we deserve and whenever others deal with us unjustly, we will lose our chance of bearing the cross and glorifying God if we resist, murmur, or rebel in our heart.
[190]  As long as we are righteous in ourselves, we should be contented; it should matter little whether or not others know about our righteousness.
[191]  As long as we are right in ourselves, that is good enough; it should matter little whether others say that we are right.
[192]  Jesus Christ the Son of God had no sin, yet He was crucified on the cross.
[193]  Today we will continue to consider the mind of Christ Jesus.
[194]  In humbling Himself, the Lord Jesus gave up His form of God and took the form of a slave to become a slave.
[195]  CHAPTER EIGHTY-THREE LEARNING THE LESSON OF THE CROSS Date: April 5, 1938
[196]  In Jeremiah 48:11 God said, "Moab has been at ease from his youth;/And he is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel;.../Therefore his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed."
[197]  If we do not humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and if there is no joy in us, the lees within us will never be purified.
[198]  In order for us to partake of His holiness and glory, and in order for us to learn to express the life of Christ, God chastises us and disciplines us all the time Heb 12:7, 10 .
[199]  He loves us and desires that we become useful vessels fit for His use.
[200]  In our eyes, some people are quite useless, yet God has put them among us.
[201]  CHAPTER EIGHTY-FOUR FIVE KINDS OF FORGIVENESS Date: April 6, 1938
[202]  Finally, Matthew 6:14-15 says that if we forgive others' offenses, our Father will also forgive our offenses, and if we do not forgive others' offenses, our Father will also not forgive our offenses.
[203]  If such a one is not a Christian according to our opinion, we should not receive him, because he is not one of us and has nothing to do with the Body of Christ.
[204]  Most of us have experienced the two kinds of forgiveness spoken of above.
[205]  We have obtained God's forgiveness, and His children have testified that our sins are forgiven.
[206]  Once our previous sins those we committed before we were saved are forgiven, they are forever settled before God.
[207]  When we sin our conscience condemns us, and our fellowship with God is interrupted.
[208]  However, since we are regenerated and alive and since we are able to tell right from wrong, we have to confess our sins to God one by one before we can secure our forgiveness in fellowship.
[209]  We must rise up and ask God for forgiveness, and we must recover the sweet fellowship we had with God.
[210]  May the Lord grant us the grace to be those who show mercy to others, who do not deal with others in meanness, sharpness, or severity so that we can obtain mercy from God in that day Matt 5:7 .
[211]  But of all the reasons affecting the bread-breaking meeting, none is more serious than the one spoken of in Hebrews 13:15-16: "Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.
[212]  Putting this matter in simpler terms, if we do not give, we are being unrighteous.
[213]  If we do not give, we are not doing our part, and others are paying for us to sit here.
