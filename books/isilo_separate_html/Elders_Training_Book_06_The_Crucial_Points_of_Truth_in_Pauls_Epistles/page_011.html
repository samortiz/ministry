<p>In chapter nine the point we should pick up is the matter of running the race to obtain the reward. In verse 17 Paul says that if he preaches the gospel voluntarily he has a reward; but if not of his own will, he has been entrusted with a stewardship. Paul continues to say, &ldquo;What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel&rdquo; (v. 18). Then he continues in verses 24 through 27: &ldquo;Do you not know that those who run in a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may lay hold. And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; those, therefore, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so I box, not as beating the air; but I buffet my body and lead it as a slave, lest having preached to others, I myself should become disapproved.&rdquo; The crucial point is to run the race to obtain the reward. Here Paul uses two illustrations from the Olympics: running a race and contending in a game. Both are illustrations for our Christian walk and work. Our Christian walk and work are like running in a race-course and contending in a game. The reward which the Lord will award His overcoming saints who win the race, is something in addition to salvation. We, His believers, have all received His salvation through faith in Him. This was settled once for all. But whether we shall be rewarded by Him depends upon how we run the race.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST FOR<br />
OUR FELLOWSHIP WITH ALL THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>The main point in chapter ten is the enjoyment of Christ for our fellowship with all the saints. The beginning of this chapter refers to the eating and drinking by the children of Israel. &ldquo;And all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). They ate the manna and drank the water from the rock. At the end of verse 4, Paul indicated definitely that this is a type because he said &ldquo;the rock was Christ.&rdquo; The manna must therefore also be Christ and the living water must be the very Spirit that comes out of Christ, the cleft rock. These two items are for enjoyment.</p>
<p>In verses 14 through 22 of this chapter the Lord&rsquo;s table is mentioned. According to the context of the entire chapter, our enjoyment at the Lord&rsquo;s table should equal the Israelites&rsquo; enjoyment of eating manna, the spiritual food, and drinking the spiritual drink, the living water. Today we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s table, where the manna is the bread on the table and the spiritual drink is in the cup on the table. In all of these verses are many good points which are defined either in the footnotes of the Recovery Version or in the Life-study Messages.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s people should be a people of enjoyment. Their enjoyment is of God Himself embodied in Christ. In the Old Testament, the very God was embodied in manna and in the spiritual drink that came out of the rock. Then in the New Testament, God is embodied in the bread and the cup. We eat Him, we drink Him, and thus we enjoy Him. This is for our fellowship of the blood of Christ and of the Body of Christ. This means that we have fellowship in the Body and that we have fellowship in the blood by our eating and drinking. When we enjoy the Lord by eating and drinking Him, we have the fellowship with all the saints. Our fellowship with all the saints is in our enjoyment of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL HEADSHIP</h2>
<p>In 11:3 Paul says, &ldquo;But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.&rdquo; In three aspects this is the universal headship. This is not a very interesting or exciting point, but it is something very solid which we cannot skip over. Here the headship of Christ over every man is concerning individuals. Christ is both the Head corporately of the Body, the church, and individually of the believers. He is the Head directly of every one of us. In the divine governmental ordination, woman is under the headship of man. God created the female in this way (Gen. 2:18-24; 1 Tim. 2:13). According to the nature (v. 14) created by God, woman is subordinate to man. Paul also says in verse 3 that the head of Christ is God. Christ is God&rsquo;s anointed One, appointed by God. Hence, He is under God, and God as the Originator is His Head. This refers to the relationship between Christ and God in the divine government.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S SUPPER</h2>
<p>Following the universal headship, Paul comes to the Lord&rsquo;s supper in 11:17-34. The emphasis of the table of the Lord is the fellowship of His blood and of His body (10:16-17), the participation in the Lord, the enjoyment of the Lord in mutuality, in fellowship; whereas the stress of the Lord&rsquo;s supper is the remembrance of the Lord (11:24-25). At the Lord&rsquo;s table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord&rsquo;s supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment.</p>
<p>The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup (v. 26), that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death. To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, as our life and blessing. This is to remember Him in a genuine way.</p>
<p>The thought of the apostle in using this expression &ldquo;the body&rdquo; (v. 29), not &ldquo;the body of the Lord,&rdquo; may imply the mystical Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4) in addition to the physical body of the Lord (v. 24). In taking the Lord&rsquo;s supper we need to discern the Lord&rsquo;s Body. Therefore, when we participate in the Lord&rsquo;s table, we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the one Body of Christ or any division of man (any denomination). In discerning the Body of Christ we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit. Our participation in the Lord&rsquo;s table must be the unique fellowship of His unique Body without any division either in practice or in spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
