   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Completed Son</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that before Christ's resurrection the Spirit was not completed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to see that the Son also was not completed before resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you think that the Son was completed before incarnation?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Son could not have been completed before incarnation because it was necessary for the completed Son to have not only divinity but also humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in order to be completed, the Son had to pass through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result of going through this process, the only begotten Son John 3:16 became the firstborn Son Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before incarnation, there was not the element of humanity in the only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, neither were the elements of human living, crucifixion, and resurrection in the only begotten Son before His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, there was only the element of divinity in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But now that the only begotten Son has become the firstborn Son of God, the firstborn Son includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the completed Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because it was necessary for both the Son and the Spirit to be completed, before His resurrection the Lord Jesus did not speak a clear word to His disciples concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But after His resurrection, He could tell His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the Lord's resurrection the Father is complete and both the Son and the Spirit have been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John, the Son still had not been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time He was in the flesh; He had not yet been crucified and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, the Spirit had not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in Matthew 28:19, after Christ's resurrection, the Son and the Spirit are not only complete but also completed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the Son and the Spirit have been completed, the Father did not need any completion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father remains the same because He is the source, and the source does not need completion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son, however, needed completion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the first stage He was God's only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the last stage He has become the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the only begotten Son to become the firstborn Son there was the need of completion, the need of a process.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This process includes incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After passing through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, He entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now in resurrection He is not merely the only begotten Son; He is the Firstborn among many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have pointed out, this firstborn Son of God includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now He is not only complete He is completed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hallelujah for the complete and completed Son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through the process by which He was completed, the only begotten Son not only became the firstborn Son of God, but also became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To God, He became the Firstborn; to us, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This firstborn Son of God, who is the life-giving Spirit, is now our way to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the "jumbo jet" that brings us to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we contact the life-giving Spirit, we are in the Son as the way, and immediately we are in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The life-giving Spirit is the firstborn Son of God, and the Son is one with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, when we contact the life-giving Spirit, we are in the Son, and by being in the Son we are in the Father.</S>
