<p>Question: What is the difference between submission and obedience?</p><p>Answer: Submission is a question of attitude, whereas obedience is a question of conduct. A wife has to submit to her husband. But if an unbelieving husband asks his wife to burn incense to idols, the wife should submit and yet should not obey. In this case, submitting means being meek and yielding in her attitude, while not obeying means not doing what her husband asks. If an unbelieving husband asks a believing wife to go to a dance with him, the wife can say, "I wish I could go with you, but I am really sorry that I cannot." One does not have to obey in such matters, but there should still be submission. In some matters we can only submit; we cannot obey. However, in our attitude we should always be pliable and meek. We have to ask ourselves whether we are pliable and meek. How is our spirit? This is a big question. At times we cannot obey in our conduct, but we should always be meek and submissive in our attitude.</p><p>If you can obey an order from the civil government, you should obey it. If it is something that you cannot obey, you should at least be submissive to it. If the authority comes and confiscates your possessions when you do not obey, you should smile and not resist. In regard to your parents, you must obey as well as submit. It would be marvelous if brothers and sisters would submit to one another in the church today. If there is submission in the family, many problems will be avoided. If something is wrong, you must not become angry. Man's wrath does not accomplish God's righteousness. Even if you cannot obey, you must still be submissive. You should submit to one another. Your attitude towards one another should be gentle; your voice should not be brazen as a metal bell. If a family has only "hard bones," without any "soft flesh" and if the children do not submit to their parents and the wife does not submit to the husband, there will not be joy and harmony in the family. I have been invited as a guest to many homes, but it is difficult to find peace and harmony in many of them because they do not know what submission is.</p><p>May the Lord be gracious to us to grant us a spirit of submission. In order to have a submissive spirit, a person must be dealt with by the Lord's cross. It is not easy to be without blame. We often do a proper work with an improper attitude. Moses rebuked the children of Israel as being a rebellious people (Num. 20:10). His mistake was in his attitude, whereas the mistake of the children of Israel was in their conduct. We should learn to be blameless in our attitude every day, and we should learn submission in everything.</p><p>Question: What should we do about the Weekly Memorial Service [i.e., in memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China]?</p><p>Answer: The Bible does not say that we cannot attend such functions, but the Bible forbids anyone bowing down or paying homage to anything (Exo. 20:4-5). We have to honor the civil laws, and we have to be submissive in our attitude (cf. Dan. 3:16-21).</p><p>Question: Should we salute the flag?</p><p>Answer: Our flag has a symbol of a blue sky with a white sun; it is an image of heavenly bodies. Therefore, it is wrong to salute to such a symbol. The previous flag was in the shape of five-color strips; it had nothing to do with religion. Therefore, it would not have been acting contrary to the Scripture when we saluted that flag.</p><p>Question: When Naaman accompanied his master to worship the gods in the temple, he bowed down on his knees. Later, he confessed to Elisha and asked for God's forgiveness. Elisha told him to go in peace (2 Kings 5:17-19). Why was Naaman not guilty for bowing to the idols?</p><p>Answer: Naaman's bowing to the idols was a question of duty. When his master bowed to the idols, he bent forward to give him a hand. As a result, he also bowed to the idols. His bowing had nothing to do with idols. Of course, we should stay away from any resemblance of sin. The most unsafe people in this world are those who live next to the city walls. If you want to be safe, you should not live near the border of a country. Otherwise, when the enemy comes, you will be the first one to be hit. If you want to be safe, it is better to live far from the border. The worst thing for a Christian to do is to be a borderline person. It is always to our disadvantage to engage in things that have a resemblance of sin. Those who live at the border between France and Germany travel back and forth between the two countries all the time. But they suffer in the end. If you are a borderline person, you may not fall yourself, but you will raise concerns in others.</p><p>Question: Is it all right to celebrate birthdays?</p><p>Answer: Leviticus mentions leprosy in one's garment. The garment signifies a Christian's conduct in the world. The garments of a leper have to go through fire and water. The principle of going through fire and water is having one's conduct in this world purged through judgment and cleansing.</p><p>Question: What is the date of Jesus' birthday?</p><p>Answer: There is no place in the Bible that speaks of Jesus' birth on December 25. Neither does the Bible command that man should celebrate His birthday. I have studied the Bible for many years and read through it over a hundred times. I cannot find the date that the Lord was born or any commandment for us to remember His birth. The Lord commanded men to remember His death; He never commanded men to remember His birth. Shepherds were tending the flocks in the wilderness at the time He was born. This means that sheep were grazing in the wilderness. However, there is snow in Palestine after September and before April. Sheep can only graze on grass; they cannot graze on snow or ice. Therefore, the Lord Jesus could not have been born on December 25. The most authoritative historian on the history of the Roman Empire was Edward Gibbon. He pointed out that December 25 was the greatest day of festivity in the pagan religion of ancient Rome. This was a day celebrating the birth of the sun. The shortest day of the year is December 22. Three days after the shortest day is the so-called birthday of the sun. After the Romans adopted Christianity, the Roman Emperor declared December 25 to be the day of Jesus' birth out of a need for festivities. According to Malachi, Jesus is the Sun of righteousness. The Romans therefore made the birthday of the sun the birthday of Jesus. We know that this practice is absolutely unscriptural, and we cannot accept it.</p>
