   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Light of the Lampstand Shining Continually from Evening until Morning</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sons of Israel were "to cause the lamp to burn continually" v. 2b . Verse 3 goes on to say, "Outside the veil of the testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall tend it from evening to morning before Jehovah continually; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations." This signifies that the divine light of Christ shines continually in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Aaron the High Priest Arranging the Lamps before Jehovah Continually</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"He shall tend the lamps on the pure lampstand before Jehovah continually" v. 4 . This signifies that Christ as our High Priest continually takes care of His divine light, causing it to shine for God continually.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many of us have experienced Christ's taking care of the light within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the morning we contact the Lord as the High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our contact with Him, He takes care of the light within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If in the morning we do not have any contact with the Lord, we shall be short of light the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we may not be in darkness, we shall have the sense that there is no light within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, if we spend some time with the Lord in the morning, the light will come in spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Something will be shining within us the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That shining is the very Christ whom we experienced and enjoyed in the morning tending Himself within us as the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The Arrangement of the Showbread</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Leviticus 24:5-9 shows us the arrangement of the showbread.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Twelve Cakes Made with Fine Flour, Each of Two-tenths of an Ephah</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"You shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake" v. 5 . This signifies that the resurrected Christ, the Christ who produced the church typified by the two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour 23:13, 17 , is the element that constitutes the food in full typified by the number twelve for all God's people and for God to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The number twelve in 24:5 certainly refers to the twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that this kind of food supply is sufficient to nourish all the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ's being our food is related to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that if we hope to be nourished adequately, we must live a life that is related to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Placing the Twelve Cakes in Two Rows, Six in Each Row, on the Pure Gold Table before Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"And you shall place them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure gold table before Jehovah" v. 6 . This signifies that the believers enjoy Christ in parallel for a testimony typified by the number two based on Christ's holding us up signified by the table by His pure, divine nature signified by the pure gold . 3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Putting Pure Frankincense with Each Row That It May Be a Memorial Portion for the Bread as an Offering by Fire to Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"You shall put pure frankincense with each row, that it may be a memorial portion for the bread as an offering by fire to Jehovah" v. 7 . This signifies that it is with the fragrance of His resurrection as a memorial portion that Christ becomes food to both God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, the cakes of bread were food for the high priest and for the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But verse 7 tells us that they were an offering by fire for God's food.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From this we see that what we eat is what God eats, and what God eats is what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that we as God's serving ones, the priests, are one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What we enjoy is God's enjoyment, and what God enjoys is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God and we, we and God, are one in His service.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we have the nourishment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we get into the depths of all these points, we shall realize the kind of life we should live by.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this life is an element which is the fragrance of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of enjoyment is always a memorial, something that is worthy of remembrance.</S>
