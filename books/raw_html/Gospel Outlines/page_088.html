<h1 class="title">THE WARNING TO REPENT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Luke 13:1-5</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The sins of human living
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man is born in sins.</li>
	<li>Man grows up in sins.</li>
	<li>Man lives in sins (referring to all the normal living).</li>
	<li>Man wallows in sins (referring to all the abnormal living).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The calamity of human living
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Sin is the source of disaster. Disaster is the result of sin.</li>
	<li>Because man is born in sins, grows up and lives in sins, and even wallows in sins, man is apt to fall into calamity.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s tolerance
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to the condition of man&rsquo;s sins, calamity should strike man down immediately as punishment from God. But God is so tolerant that such calamity is temporarily suspended.</li>
	<li>The reason God could suspend calamity and tolerate man is that there is a Savior in this universe, and there is redemption. According to man&rsquo;s sins the earth should be turned upside down, and man should perish forever in calamity. But because Christ as man&rsquo;s Savior has accomplished redemption, God can tolerate man and suspend calamity.</li>
	<li>God tolerates man so that man could repent.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The warning to repent
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since calamity is a result of sin, each calamity therefore is a warning, with the intent that men may be delivered from sins.</li>
	<li>Whenever you see calamity strike, whether it hits you or someone else, either a natural disaster or one caused by man, you should understand that it is God&rsquo;s warning that men should repent.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to repent
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Believe that sin has its consequence.</li>
	<li>Confess your own sins.</li>
	<li>Receive Christ and His redemption.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
