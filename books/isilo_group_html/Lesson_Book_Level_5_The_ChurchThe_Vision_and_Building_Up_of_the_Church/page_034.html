The truths in the Bible always have two sides. Brother Govett called it &#8220;the twofoldness of the truth.&#8217;&#8217; A sheet of paper has two sides as it cannot exist with one side only; likewise, the church has two aspects. Most Christians do not see the two aspects of the church, and therefore have made many mistakes concerning this matter for centuries. In order not to make the same mistakes, we must pay close attention to this truth.<h2 class=head1>I. THE TRUTH ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE</h2><p>[Most Christians would agree that they need the fellowship of a church. Actually, there are very few Christians who are not members of a church. Most Christians have a church, but the question is, do they have the proper church or an improper church? Today in every large city there are too many different so-called &#8220;churches.&#8217;&#8217; In the city of Seoul, Korea, the Roman Catholic Church is very prominent. However, it is wrong to associate the word Roman with the church. In the Bible there is no Roman Church. Colossians 3:11 tells us that in the new man there is neither Greek nor Jew. Thus, there is no such thing as the Jewish Church or the Greek Church in the Bible. Furthermore, there is no Anglican Church, no Chinese Church, no Korean Church, no Presbyterian Church, no Baptist Church, and no Pentecostal Church. All these &#8220;churches&#8217;&#8217; are improper because they are not scriptural, not according to God&#8217;s holy Word.<p>In order to know what is proper regarding the church, we need to study the Bible. I have been studying the Bible concerning the matter of the church since 1925. In this chapter I wish to present to you a brief outline of this matter. This brief, accurate, and clear outline is the cream of my nearly sixty years of study concerning the church. I am happy to present this outline to you. My desire is to impress you with the proper practice of the church life according to the Bible.<p>There is nothing wrong with the church itself, but the way Christians practice the church life might be wrong. Out of all the different ways of practicing the church life among Christians today, it is difficult to find one that is right. To be right in the practice of the church life is to be according to the Bible. The proper practice of the church life is not according to culture, not according to society, not according to any kind of religious background, and not according to our imagination; it must be absolutely according to the holy Word of God.]<h2 class=head1>II. THE UNIVERSAL ASPECT</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Including all New Testament Believers</h2><p>There is only one church in the universe; thus, the church is universal, comprising all the believers in Christ throughout time and in every place (Eph. 1:22). The universal church comprises all of God&#8217;s redeemed saints in the New Testament age. The Old Testament saints, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Moses, David, and Isaiah, were not members of the New Testament church. The New Testament church began at the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the book of Acts. John the Baptist was not in the New Testament church. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I tell you, among those born of women, there is no one greater than John; yet he who is littler in the kingdom of God is greater than he&#8217;&#8217; (Luke 7:28). This shows that John was not a member of the New Testament church.<p>At His coming back, the Lord Jesus will close the church age, and many Jews will repent. Zechariah 12 gives us the details of their salvation. The Jews will be saved, but they will not be in the New Testament church. We are the most blessed people because we are in the most blessed age, the age of the church. The church has a universal aspect, it includes Peter, John, Paul, and all the believers through the centuries. It also includes us, and it includes those who will follow us in the future.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 5: The Church-The Vision and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
