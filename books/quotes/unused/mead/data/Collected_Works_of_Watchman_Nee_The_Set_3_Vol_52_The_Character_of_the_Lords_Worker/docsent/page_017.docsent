   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean for our body to become our slave?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to understand this, we must first understand what the demands of the body are.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We shall only mention a few practical examples food, clothing, rest, sleep, comfort, and special care in times of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of these things are demands of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Making the body our slave means that, through long periods of buffeting our body during ordinary times, we are able to put it under our control at the time of a race.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are easy with our body at ordinary times, our legs, feet, lungs, and every other organ will not come under our control at the time of the race, and we will not be able to meet the demand of the race.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for our body to obey, there is the need for long periods of training.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there is no such training, it will be impossible to steer the body on the spur of the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we lack such training at ordinary times, and if we have never buffeted our body or dealt with it, it will not submit to us at a time of need.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we set out for our work, we will find that our body does not obey us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will not be able to meet the demands of the body, and we will have no control over our body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not think that a certain measure of spirituality is all that is necessary to engage in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is still the matter of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul showed us how real this problem is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am not asking whether we have a healthy body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am asking whether or not we are the master of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Will our body obey us?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If our body will not obey, we cannot serve God in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of training cannot be completed in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some spiritual problems can be solved in an instant, but the buffeting of the body requires three, five, or even ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who have developed a habit of loose living need all the more to impose a strict discipline upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, the body demands sleep under ordinary circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sleep is not wrong; it is not sinful, and the demand is surely legitimate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has divided the day from the night to provide man with the opportunity to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is right for man to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man does not sleep, how can he work?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in order for us to buffet our body and make it our slave, we should not insist on sleeping when there is the need to be awake.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what it means to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose I have scheduled eight hours of sleep every day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is right for me to take care of my body in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in order to buffet my body and make it my slave, I will act in such a way as if I am beating myself and forcing my body to follow my instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I will train myself to such an extent that if I decided not to sleep today, I could do so.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord was in the garden of Gethsemane, He took three of His disciples aside and said to them, "Watch with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He found them sleeping on His return, He said to Peter, "So were you not able to watch with Me for one hour?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Matt 26:38, 40 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord wanted them to watch with Him, but they fell asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They could not watch with our Lord for even an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is it wrong to sleep?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No, sleep is legitimate and necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if the Lord requires us to watch with Him and we cannot overcome this "legitimate" need, we will hinder His work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If any of us cannot give up our demand for sleep, we cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This does not mean that a servant of God has to go without sleep night after night.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This would be the life of an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are not angels, and we need a good night's sleep every day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But for the sake of learning to follow the Lord and to buffet our body, we should learn to forsake our sleep for a night or two when necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is what it means to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What does it mean to run the race?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Does a man run every day and every minute of the day?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Walking is ordinary, but running is something extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Walking is a daily demand; normally, we walk step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Running, however, is not a daily thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On a racecourse we have to quicken our pace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The normal capacity of the body can support our walk, but in running the body is called upon to put forth extra effort.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The normal capacity of the body has to be stretched in order to take care of the extra need.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At such times the body needs to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In running, the body is asked to supplement its normal functions with extra energy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Running imposes additional demands on the body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The demand on our body is not as strenuous during normal times of walking; it only becomes strenuous when the body has to run.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the same principle, we may need only eight hours of sleep during ordinary times.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if our work requires that we work four more hours one day, we should be satisfied with only four hours of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is what it means to run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To run the race means to meet the extra demands.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the three disciples failed to watch with the Lord, He pointed out the trouble to them: "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak" v. 41 . What good is there in having a willing spirit if the flesh is weak? A willing spirit and sleeping flesh amount to the same thing as an unwilling spirit and sleeping flesh; both amount to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not enough for the spirit to be willing; the body has to be willing as well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the body is not willing and insists on sleeping, it is no longer one's slave.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the body is not a slave, it would be futile to claim that the spirit is willing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is not to say that the body is the source of sin or that it is an encumbrance.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are saying that, for the sake of serving the Lord, there are extra demands on the body at times, and the body should rise to meet these demands.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is what it means to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must train our body not just to meet ordinary demands but to have an extra supply when there are extra demands.</S>
