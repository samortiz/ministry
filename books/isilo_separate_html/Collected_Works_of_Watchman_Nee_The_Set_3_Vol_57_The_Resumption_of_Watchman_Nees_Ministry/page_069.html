But there are two conditions to consecration without which our consecration will not be solid. The first factor has to do with the church. Consecration is not simply us handing ourselves over to the Lord, but us handing ourselves over to the church. Surely when a person consecrates himself, he hands himself over to the Lord. But no one knows when this kind of consecration has changed or has been retracted. Only the consecration that is done under the authority of the church is solid, and only this kind of consecration will last. If a man says that he is consecrating himself, yet has not handed himself over to the church, such a consecration is not solid.</p><h2 class="head1">THE THOROUGH CONSECRATION&mdash;<br />INVOLVING MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS</h2><p>The second thing about consecration is that it always touches our money and occupation. A consecration that does not result in handing ourself over to the church is not solid, and a consecration that does not touch our money and occupation is not thorough. These two subjects, money and occupation, require special attention.</p><h2 class="head1">MONEY</h2><h2 class="head2">The Relationship between God,<br />All Things, and Money</h2><p>How does God see money? Here we need to understand two kinds of relationships. The first is the relationship between God and all things. The second is the relationship between all things and money. God made from one all things (Acts 17:26). Everything a person touches with his hands and treads over with his feet is made by God. God not only made from one all things; He is even the Lord of all things. Satan is God's adversary. Yet he cannot deal with God directly. Because he cannot deal with God directly, he deals with all the things that issue from God's creation. Because Satan cannot damage God Himself, he tries to damage God's work. If Satan can snatch God's creation out of His hand, God will have failed. In order to damage God's work, Satan tries to snatch away God's creation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
