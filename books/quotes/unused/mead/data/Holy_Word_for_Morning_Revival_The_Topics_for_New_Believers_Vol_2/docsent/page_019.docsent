   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 10 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rev 1:4 ...Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 7:39 But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Seven Spirits</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the book of Revelation the Spirit is called the seven Spirits 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 , the sevenfold intensified Spirit to counteract the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The seven Spirits in Revelation 1:4 undoubtedly are the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As seven is the number for completion in God s operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God s move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In substance and existence God s Spirit is one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the intensified function and work of God s operation His Spirit is sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is like the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In existence it is one lampstand, but in function it is seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the time the book of Revelation was written, the church had become degraded, and the age was dark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God was needed for God s move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Revelation 4:5 says, And out of the throne come forth lightenings and voices and thunders.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seven lamps here refer to the seven lamps of the lampstand in Exodus 25:37 and the seven lamps of the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seven lamps of fire which are the seven Spirits of God signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Exodus 25 and Zechariah 4 the seven lamps, signifying the enlightening of the Spirit of God in God s move, are for God s building, either for the tabernacle or the rebuilding of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here the seven lamps are for God s judgment, which will issue also in God s building the building of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>92</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 5:6 tells us that the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>93 Whereas the seven Spirits as the seven lamps of burning fire are for enlightening and burning, the seven Spirits as the seven eyes of the Lamb are for observing, searching, and transfusing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>94 Eventually, these flaming eyes infuse us with all that He is, metabolically transforming us into His being....How we need to see this vision!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is God s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>95</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When all the aspects and elements of the Spirit are put together, we have a totality, an aggregate, known in the New Testament as the Spirit Mark 1:10; Matt 4:1; 12:31; John 3:5, 34; 7:39; Acts 6:3; 8:18; Rom 8:16, 23, 26, 27; Gal 3:2, 14; 5:16-18, 22, 25; 1 Pet 1:2; Rev 2:7; 14:13; 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the Bible is the book, so the Spirit of God today is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>96 John 7:39 says that the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>97 The Spirit of God was there from the beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but at the time the Lord spoke this word, the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After Jesus resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ, who was breathed into the disciples by Christ in the evening of the day on which He was resurrected John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit is now the another Comforter, the Spirit of reality promised by Christ before His death 14:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Spirit was the Spirit of God, He had only the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After He became the Spirit of Jesus Christ through Christ s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Spirit had both the divine element and the human element, with all the essence and reality of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the Spirit is now the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ as the living water for us to receive 7:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>98</S>
