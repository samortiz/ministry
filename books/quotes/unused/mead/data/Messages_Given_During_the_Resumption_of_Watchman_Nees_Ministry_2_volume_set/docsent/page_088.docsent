   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT THE SERVICE OF THE PRIESTHOOD CHURCH CONFERENCE 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:7:30 p.m., Friday, April 9, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:5; Rom 12:1, 11; Luke 19:11-17 ALL THE SAVED ONES BEING THE PRIESTS, AND</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>BEING THOSE WHO SHOULD SERVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have not been standing on this platform for over four months.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What I will speak to you tonight will not be related to anything spoken before or afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first thing I would like to speak to you is that every redeemed person is part of a holy priesthood 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here in 1 Peter it does not say a clean priesthood, but a holy priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be holy means to be separated, to be set apart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, the spiritual sacrifice mentioned in Romans 12 refers to our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first thing that the priests have to offer is their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a sacrifice is reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only is it a reasonable sacrifice, but it is one that makes you feel comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The life that a person receives from his mother's womb, the first life, has its needs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a person eats, drinks, or exercises, he feels happy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same way, the life that a person receives at regeneration, the second life, also has its definite needs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It needs to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a person has to mop the floor, the mopping nevertheless makes him feel happy within.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if he is to clean the toilet, he would do it happily.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Any service that would make a person feel happy is definitely a reasonable service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF THE SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Among all the spiritual things that the Holy Spirit has led us to know, do we know this one particular thing the service?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been taught concerning how to save souls and how to help others to be delivered from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But do we know what is the meaning of service?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being Priestly in Nature</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The service in the church is not prophetic in nature, but priestly in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the service in the church is prophetic in nature, then all the brothers and sisters would have to be prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament, the service of the priests consisted of putting forth the showbread, lighting and dressing the lamps, burning the incense, and slaughtering the bulls and goats for others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today's service in the church consists of living before God, speaking for Him, and ministering unto Him in the many small and miscellaneous affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the denominations, only the pastor gives the message.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The janitors are only the menial laborers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the service in the church is composed of the speakers, plus the piano players, plus the janitors, plus the window cleaners, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our work today is to bring in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church service is not prophetic in nature, but priestly in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The speaking occupies only a small portion of the work, and the speaker is but one of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The service of the priests included the emptying out of the animal refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In principle, it includes cooking for others, doing the laundry, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All these are the work of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The priestly services have to do with miscellaneous works.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Consecrating Oneself to Be a Living Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>for the Satisfaction of Both God and Man</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To offer up sacrifices is to offer up food for God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is God's food?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God needs to eat and to drink; He has His food in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In every age, God desires to gain some men who would consecrate themselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If no one would consecrate himself to God, God would be hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If no one would pour Himself out to God, God would be thirsty and unsatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many revival meetings use Romans 12:1 to exhort people to offer up themselves, and at the end of the exhortation they would add the words, "Be a preacher!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But after a person has become a preacher, God may be even more hungry and thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only sacrifices satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The demand within us is God's demand; our inner man represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we serve God, we are satisfying God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the meaning of a living sacrifice?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A sacrifice should be one that is dead, but a living sacrifice means sacrifices that are offered up to do some works.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While you serve and work, your spirit will become enlivened through your working.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our service to the Lord is expressed in the smallest matters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord asked Peter to fish.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was a small matter, but the principle involved is the same, and that is to satisfy man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord turned the water into wine and fed the five thousand with loaves, both of which are small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The goal of these works is not to satisfy the physical life, but to satisfy man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a man is hungry, he can eat later.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even if he does not eat, it is still all right.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The question is not one of outward eating, but one of the Lord's being satisfied and man's being satisfied through the small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the principle of service.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In itself, service is a small matter, but it satisfies both God and man.</S>
