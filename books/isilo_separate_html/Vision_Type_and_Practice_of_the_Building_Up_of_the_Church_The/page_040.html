AND ENTERING INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>We will now consider how to proceed from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies. The Holy Place and the Holy of Holies were separated by a veil. Outside the veil was the Holy Place, and inside the veil was the Holy of Holies. In order to meet God in the Old Testament times, the high priest had to pass through the veil into the Holy of Holies, because God was in the Holy of Holies behind the veil. In the New Testament, however, Hebrews 10:19 and 20 say, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; This shows that the veil into the Holy of Holies has been split and that the Lord has initiated a new and living away for us. Therefore, there is no separating veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies in the New Testament age. According to these verses, the veil is the Lord&rsquo;s flesh. Christ is the Word becoming flesh; that is, He is God becoming a man. His becoming flesh was His becoming a man. Hence, the veil refers to the natural man. Our natural man is a veil between us and God.</p>
<p>When we are in the Holy Place, we are no longer separated from God by sin, darkness, and the world. However, between us and God there is still a separation, a veil, which is our natural man, our self. This veil needs to be split; that is, our natural man needs to be broken. No matter what our condition is&mdash;whether we have shortcomings or strengths, whether we fall or stand, and whether or not we have God&rsquo;s presence&mdash;our natural man needs to be broken. The veil was hung in front of the Ark of God, where there were no problems, stains, or faults, in order to separate man from God, who was in the Holy of Holies. We may be experiencing the Holy Place, but God is in the Holy of Holies. We are outside the veil, but God is within the veil. This separating veil is neither sin nor the world; it is our intact natural man. Without being subdued or broken, our natural man separates us from God.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was a man in the flesh; that is, He had humanity. Therefore, when the Lord died on the cross, in God&rsquo;s eyes He was a man who had been split. In the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting we break the bread. The bread cannot break itself; rather, it is broken because we break it. When the Lord Jesus expired on the cross, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, not from bottom to top (Matt. 27:50-51; Mark 15:37-38). This means that the Lord&rsquo;s body was broken not by man but by God. Hence, the old creation, not just fallen man, was split from top to bottom by God.</p>
<p>Although this was accomplished on the cross, whether we experience this is another matter. Many believers have not experienced the breaking of their natural man. As a result, they have not entered into the Holy of Holies but linger outside the veil.</p>
<p>A considerable number among us may have entered into the Holy Place experientially. We experience oil being poured upon the stone and experience wood being overlaid with gold; we have become standing boards. We also have the rings of gold through which bars of acacia wood overlaid with gold can pass and bind us together. In a sense, such a condition is prevalent among us. However, we must admit that God&rsquo;s presence is not practical among us. On the one hand, when we see what the Lord has done in the church and how we have been graced, we bow our heads and worship God in the meetings. On the other hand, we have a strong sense that although we have the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar, we do not have the Ark. Our meetings are full of life, joy, and light, but God&rsquo;s presence is not strong. This is because few saints have been broken by God, and not many have experienced the splitting of the veil. We have not entered into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>Many saints have the wrong concept that a person who loses his temper and is fleshly has not been broken but that a person who is meek has been broken. Both the quick-tempered believers and the fleshly believers need to be broken. However, the meek believers also need to be broken. Even if a person were blameless before God, he would still need to be broken.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s death is typified by two things in the tabernacle. The shedding of the blood of the sacrifices on the altar in the outer court and the splitting of the veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies both typify the death of Christ. The intrinsic significance of Christ&rsquo;s death is very rich. The lamb that was killed on the altar in the outer court speaks of Christ bearing our sins, being judged by God, and shedding His blood to accomplish redemption. The splitting of the veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies speaks of God crucifying the old creation, including created man, on the cross. Even though the Lord Jesus was blameless and could stand before God and man, He still needed to be split by God. This indicates that created man needs to die.</p>
<p>The burden of this chapter is to reveal the steps of building up. The saints must experience these crucial points. The experiences of the outer court deal with our conduct. The experiences of the Holy Place are a matter of taking Christ as our life. The experiences of the Holy of Holies focus on our entering into God. In order to enter into the Holy of Holies, we not only need to be delivered from sin and the world; we also need to be split, broken. When we pass through the altar and the laver in the outer court, we deal with sin and the defilement of the world. Then we can enter into the Holy Place to experience Christ as life and to be mingled with God. At this point sin and the world no longer separate us from God who is in the Holy of Holies. However, our natural man must be broken in order for us to enter into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>After we enter into the Holy of Holies, we can touch the things within God. This is not a matter of experiencing God coming forth in Christ as our bread of life, light of life, and acceptance of life. In the Holy of Holies we enter into God and experience the hidden manna, the inner law of life, and the acceptance in resurrection. When we enter into God, we can touch the matters within Him. Only then are we truly wood in gold, that is, man in God.</p>
<p>This is the experience in Book Four of the Psalms. The first psalm of Book Four, Psalm 90, is titled, &ldquo;A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.&rdquo; This indicates that by Book Four the psalmist had entered into God; hence, he is called &ldquo;the man of God.&rdquo; Intrinsically speaking, a man of God is a person mingled with God. In Job 1:1, Job is a perfect man. In Psalm 1:1-2 the psalmist is a law-keeping, righteous man. But in Psalm 90 the psalmist is not merely a perfect or righteous man; he is a man of God, that is, a man in God and mingled with God. Therefore, the first sentence of Psalm 90 is, &ldquo;O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.&rdquo; When we dwell in God, when wood is concealed in gold, we can experience God as our dwelling place. This is where we have God&rsquo;s presence, the throne of grace typified by the expiation cover, and the cherubim of glory.</p>
<p>God has revealed this light to us from His Word not for us to understand doctrines. I believe that according to this light, He will do an intense work among us in order to bring us from the outer court into the Holy Place and then from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies. He wants us to learn to deal with sins and the world, to take Christ as life, to live before Him, to experience being mingled with Him, and to let the cross break our natural man. This breaking enables us to enter into God and touch Him. This is the way for God to practically become our dwelling place and for us to be joined by Him as one to become His dwelling place, His habitation. This is the mingling of God with man as a mutual dwelling place.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
