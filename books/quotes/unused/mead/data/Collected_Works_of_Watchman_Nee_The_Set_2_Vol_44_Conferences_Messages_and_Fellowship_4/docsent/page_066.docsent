   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brother Nee's Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>a Revelation of Crucifixion with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1927 I was in the upper room in Wen-teh Lane, and the Lord showed me that my crucifixion with Christ was an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before that time I acknowledged the teaching of our crucifixion with Christ as much as anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I could say as much as anyone else about the reason for our crucifixion with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I could preach as well as anyone else concerning the doctrine of our union with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I cannot deny that I had some experience of crucifixion, but there were problems within me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I saw that there were still many hindrances within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I tried hard to deal with them, but I could not say that I was dead; I was not there yet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I spent four months asking the Lord to show me that I was crucified with Him and to bring me into such a crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Daily I received some light, but the light was not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I studied the Bible diligently, and every time I came across the words, "I am crucified with Christ," I repeated them to myself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But I still could not believe them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was impossible for me to believe them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I prayed every day, and I dropped all my work and tried to deal with this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day I woke up, and between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning while I was in prayer, I suddenly saw that my death in Christ was something joined to Christ, in the same way that the banknote is joined to the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My eyes were opened, and these words came to my mind: "There is only one, not two."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was impossible for Christ to die without my dying as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Has Christ died?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Indeed He has!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What about me?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Immediately I jumped out of my chair and said, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have died also!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as Christ has died, I have died.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is not any more dead than I am, nor is His death any surer than my death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What God has done in Christ He has done in me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ has died; therefore, I have also died.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ resurrected; therefore, I have also resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ has ascended; therefore, I have also ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I ran down the stairs and met a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Grabbing him, I said, "Don't you know that I am dead?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I said, "Don't you know that Christ is dead?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said, "I do."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I told him, "Just as He died, I have also died."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From that day on, I have never denied what I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the inheritance we have in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not by struggling or striving that we inherit all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be those who are in Christ before we can share our inheritance with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people have made the cross a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But to others, it is a vision and a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everything God has done has been done in Christ, not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are in Christ, all these things become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>CHRIST IN CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"Christ in the Christian" has to do with what is about to come; it has nothing to do with the past.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It has to do with the present and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is in us, not for the purpose of dealing with problems, but for the purpose of imparting the power of life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we are in Christ, we enjoy His work and His experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Christ is in us, we enjoy His life and Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is in the believers to live for them and within them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the believers' inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ does not live in the believers so that they can learn to be like Christ, imitate Him, copy Him, or take Him as their pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is not living in the believers so that they will slowly advance and gradually attain after five or ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul preached Christ crucified and resurrected, not the believers crucified and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Believers do not live merely by the power of Christ; rather, Christ lives within the believers by becoming their life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has given Christ to the believers to be their life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is no need for believers to help God by exercising their will, because this fact is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Life has its law, and this law is spontaneous; it is not something that one has to work out.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The law of the Spirit of life is a natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Anything that is unnatural, that comes by struggling, striving, or laboring is not the result of taking Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not enough to merely know life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must know the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A law is something that never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Circumstance, experience, and feelings all change, but a law never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The law of gravity is the same for everything everywhere; it does not change with time or place.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do not have to worry whether the law of gravity will function; it operates spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as we live according to the law of the Spirit of life, power will come spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The secret to the Christian life is not to invoke the life of Christ but to allow the life of Christ to invoke us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we are faced with a problem, all we have to do is say to the Lord, "I cannot do it, but Your life within me can."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We do not have to exert extra energy to do anything or believe in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This life spontaneously expresses itself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is God's inheritance for us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God's inheritance is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>CHRIST AS ALL</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption spoken of in 1 Corinthians 1:30 are not things but a person.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These things all point to a person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A Christian is different from a worldly or religious person.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A Christian is a person in whom Christ operates; he is a person in whom Christ lives and on whose behalf Christ lives.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Those in the world have to struggle using their own energy, but all that a Christian needs is a little faith.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord is within us, and He is our sanctification, righteousness, humility, and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ is everything to the Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Many people emphasize faith, but their kind of faith is often nothing but a kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Many people pay attention to obedience, but the obedience they talk about is nothing but work.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>These human endeavors are not the result of Christ's operation within man.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>On the one hand, we must see that we are in Christ and that all of Christ's past experiences are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>On the other hand, Christ is in us to be our life and to live for us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All we have to do is believe in a simple way this is what Isaac represents.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is enjoyment, and this is inheriting God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Thank God that it is of God that we are in Christ and Christ is in us.</S>
