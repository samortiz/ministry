   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Fifteen REGENERATION Scripture Reading John 3:2-6; 1:12-13; 1 John 5:12;</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>36:26-27 Outline God s intention The need of God s life Born of God A new heart, a new spirit, and the indwelling Spirit Text</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With this lesson, we come to the first of five subjective aspects of God s full salvation regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regeneration means that in addition to the life we received at our birth, we receive another life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is what the Bible means when it speaks of being born again or born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regeneration is the center of our salvation experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the beginning point of our life relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. GOD S INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s intention is to have a group of people filled with Himself as their life that they may express Him in His image and represent Him with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Adam s disobedience caused him to fall into sin and to lose this birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ s death took care of all of man s problems before God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It enabled God to redeem, forgive, cleanse and justify man according to His own righteousness, not simply because He loved man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we have been brought back fully to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Until man contains God as life in order to express Him, neither God nor man can be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The next step God takes in His full salvation is to enter into man to put His life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the most crucial step.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if man were completely forgiven and reconciled, he still could not express God without receiving His life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE NEED OF GOD S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In John 3, Jesus spoke to a good man named Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was a very wise and moral man, but the Lord Jesus told him that he needed to be born of water and of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In his behavior and living Nicodemus was a moral man, but in God s eyes, he had the satanic life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of this, he needed to be born of water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jesus was speaking of the water of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Bible, baptism means termination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Termination ends our sinful and natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The satanic life and nature which Nicodemus had received from the fall in Adam had to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, the life of God, which has come from the life-giving Spirit in Christ s resurrection, could be germinated in him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BORN OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be a Christian is not a matter of being improved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be a Christian is to be born of God, which means that in addition to our human life, we receive God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we were all born in sin, we are all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can a sinner stop sinning?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not possible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can you tell a dog to stop barking and to start meowing?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What you do is governed by your life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though you are forgiven by God for your sins, your sinful nature will cause you to sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What you need is another life, a sinless life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The only life that is without sin is God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regeneration brings this life into you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the life that Adam gave up when he turned from the tree of life to the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now, by believing into Christ, we can be born of God and receive Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After receiving God s life, the satanic nature within man is gradually swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sinful, lowly men like us can now grow in God s life to become the sons of God to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A NEW HEART, A NEW SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>AND THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ezekiel 36:26-27 tells us that at regeneration, we receive three wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, we receive a new heart, a heart of flesh, to replace our old stony heart.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By experiencing the love of God in grace, our old heart, which formerly was cold and hard toward the Lord, is softened to love and desire Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Second, we receive a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is our old, deadened spirit renewed and enlivened by the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now, our spirit is alive and can fully function to contact God s Spirit and to enjoy His full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Third, we receive the Spirit of God Himself to come to indwell us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What a wonderful salvation we receive through believing in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Regeneration is the center and beginning of this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Questions What does it mean to be born again?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Why do we need regeneration?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why did Jesus tell Nicodemus that besides being born of the Spirit he also needed to be born of water?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How does this apply to us?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What does regeneration have to do with accomplishing God s purpose?</S>
