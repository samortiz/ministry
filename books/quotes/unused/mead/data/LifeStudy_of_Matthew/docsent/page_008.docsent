   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Isaac</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 1:2 says, Abraham begot Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the outstanding point here concerning Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is that Isaac was born by promise Gal 4:22-26, 28-31; Rom 9:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was the only heir Gen 21:10, 12; 22:2a, 12b, 16-18 , and he inherited the promise of Christ Gen 26:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God had promised Abraham a son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sarah, wanting to help God fulfill his promise, made a proposal to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sarah seemed to say, Look, Abraham, God promised to give you a seed, an heir to inherit this good land.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But look at yourself you are nearly ninety years of age!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And look at me I m too old!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is impossible for me to bring forth a child.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must do something to help God fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have a maid named Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She is quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely you could have a son by her Gen 16:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the natural concept, and it is quite tempting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times our natural concept has some proposal to get us out of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Often our natural concept says, Here is a good source.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But such a proposal will surely keep us from God s promise!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Abraham took Sarah s proposal Gen 16:2-4 , and the result was Ishmael Gen 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This terrible Ishmael is still here today!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Acting on Sarah s proposal did not help God; rather, it frustrated Abraham from fulfilling God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The lesson we derive from this is that, as the called race, whatever we do on our own results in an Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whatever we do on our own in the church life, even in the preaching of the gospel, will only produce an Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not produce Ishmaels!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Terminate yourself!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Did you not cross over that great river, the Euphrates?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you were called out of Babel, you crossed that great river and you were buried there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You were terminated there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not live by yourself or do anything by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, you should say, Lord, I am nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without You, I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lord, if You don t do anything, then I won t do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If You rest, I rest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, I put my trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is easy to say, but difficult to practice in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Remember what an Abraham is: an Abraham is a called one who does nothing by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God had to wait until Abraham and Sarah were through Gen 17:17; see Rom 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He waited until their natural energy had died out, until they had come to realize it was impossible for them to bring forth a child.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Abraham wanted to keep Ishmael and rely on him, but God rejected Ishmael Gen 17:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also like to keep our own work and rely on it, but God does not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, God asked Abraham to cast out Ishmael and his mother Gen 21:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was difficult for Abraham to do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But he had to learn the lesson of not living by himself, the lesson of giving up his own effort and not doing anything by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He had a son, but he had to give him up.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the lesson of Abraham and the lesson in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Participating in Christ requires that we never rely on our own effort nor on anything we are able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Just as Ishmael was a frustration to Isaac s inheriting of God s promise, so our own effort or work will always frustrate our participation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must forsake all that we are and all that we have in order to trust God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must renounce everything of our natural life; otherwise we cannot enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After our natural strength has been exhausted, the promise of God comes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After Ishmael was cast out, Isaac had the full position to participate in the blessing of God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The termination of our natural effort, the forsaking of what we can do or have done, is Isaac, the inheriting of God s promised blessing, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have been baptized into Christ Gal 3:27, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>. Having been terminated in Christ, we are now His, and we have Him as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, we are Abraham s seed, God s called race, and heirs according to God s promise Gal 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Isaac is the issue of the life and walk by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Isaac was a full type of Christ inheriting all the riches of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all must experience Christ in such a way; not by our doing, striving, or endeavoring, but simply by trusting in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our trust in Him will issue in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only Isaac is the real element of the generation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Not all the children of Abraham of the flesh are the children of God; only in Isaac will God have His children Rom 9:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, God considered Isaac as Abraham s only son Gen 21:10, 12; 22:2a, 12b, 16-18 , the only one to inherit the promise concerning Christ Gen 26:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although we are the race of Abraham today, are we walking in the way of Ishmael, or are we living in the way of Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The way of Ishmael is to fulfill God s purpose by our own energy and work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The way of Isaac is to put ourselves into God, trusting Him to do everything to fulfill His purpose for us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What a great difference between these two ways!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Ishmael has nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whatever we do, whatever we try to accomplish, has nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must have Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we would have Isaac, we must cast out Ishmael, stop our work, and place ourselves into the very working of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we let Him fulfill His promise for us, then we shall have Isaac.</S>
