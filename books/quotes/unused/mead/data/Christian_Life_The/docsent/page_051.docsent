   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY HIS RESURRECTION POWER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CHRIST CONQUERING DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND COMING OUT OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THAT HE MAY DIE NO MORE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By His resurrection power Phil 3:10a , Christ conquered death and came out of death that He may die no more Rom 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the day of His resurrection, Christ is no longer subject to death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE BELIEVERS OF CHRIST BEING RAISED UP</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>WITH CHRIST IN HIS RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The believers of Christ were raised up with Christ in His resurrection Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have seen that Christ's resurrection has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, He Himself rose up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The verb here is in the active voice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, He was raised up by God from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The verb here is in the passive voice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we do not have two aspects, two voices, to our resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We did not rise up from the dead, in the active voice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, we were raised up by God, in the passive voice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>IN SUCH A RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THREE MARVELOUS MATTERS TRANSPIRED A. Christ as the Last Adam</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Being Made a Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In such a resurrection three marvelous matters transpired.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first matter is that Christ as the last Adam, that is, as the last man in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a great truth in the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1977 we fought for the truth concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We published a booklet entitled What a Heresy Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some at that time were saying that there were two Fathers the Father in the Gospels and the Father in Isaiah 9:6 who is called the Father of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They said that the Father in Isaiah 9:6 is not the holy Father in the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, according to them, to say "the Father of eternity" is similar to saying that Edison is the father of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But there is not another Father in addition to the Father in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is heretical to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They also said that the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45b does not refer to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But besides the Holy Spirit who gives life, is there another Spirit who gives life?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, there is not.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit who gives life 2 Cor 3:6b , the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have spoken the truth concerning Christ being the Spirit in many messages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am happy to hear the saints at the Lord's table praise the Lord for becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows that we have received the spiritual education of this divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our hymnal, there are also a number of hymns which speak of Christ being the Spirit Hymns, #490, 491, 493, 539 .</S>
