   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because the Church Is the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of God Today</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to have God s habitation for His expression, there is the need of the exercise of God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis 1:26 dominion follows image and goes along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that God s kingdom goes along with His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without the kingdom as a safeguard and protection, it would be difficult for the expression of God to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Where the expression of God is, there is always the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is the church not the kingdom of God today?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yes, the church is surely the kingdom of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 3:5 says, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this verse we see that regeneration brings us into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet some say that the kingdom of God is not present today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some hold the concept that after Matthew 13 the kingdom of God was suspended.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to this concept, after the Lord Jesus presented the kingdom to the Jewish people and they rejected it, the kingdom was suspended.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if this is true, where shall we put John 3:5, which says that regeneration brings us into the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have you not been reborn?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since we have been reborn, we must be now in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 3 tells us that we have been reborn into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When an animal is born, it immediately enters into the animal kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When a man is born, he is certainly born into the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been born of God; therefore, we have been born into God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you not have the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since we have the divine life, how can we say that we are not in the kingdom of God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not be influenced by the concept that the kingdom of God is not here and that we must wait for it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although I do not say that the kingdom of God has come in every sense or in a full way, I do say that the kingdom has come already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While Matthew 6:10 says that we should pray, Thy kingdom come, Matthew 16:18-19 indicates that the kingdom comes when the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, I will build my church, and in the next verse He said, I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that the words church and kingdom are used inter-changeably, proving that the church is the kingdom and that the kingdom is also the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Peter used the keys to open the kingdom, that was the time when the church was built.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the whole book of Matthew is on the kingdom, it speaks of the church in both chapters sixteen and eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Matthew 18:15-17 we are told that if a brother with whom we have a problem will not listen to us, we should tell it unto the church and that he should hear the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If that brother neglects to hear the church, the church will look upon him as a publican or as a heathen man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Immediately after saying this, the Lord speaks of the church having the authority to bind and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We see by this that the church life is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Other New Testament books also reveal that the church life today is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Romans, a book that is on the church life, not on the kingdom, we see that the kingdom of God is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 14:17 says, The kingdom of God is...righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church life today is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The book of Ephesians also shows us that the church is the kingdom of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 2:15 speaks of the new man, Ephesians 2:22 speaks of the habitation of God in our spirit, and Ephesians 3:21 speaks of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church as the kingdom of God is found in Ephesians 5:5.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, the new man is the habitation, the habitation is the church, and the church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, the church today is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hebrews 12:28 says that we are receiving this unshakable kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not just waiting for it; we have already begun to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We see the same thing in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although many Christians hold the concept that the kingdom has not yet come but that it will come in the future, in Revelation 1:9 the Apostle John says, I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This verse indicates that John was in the kingdom already.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What was the kingdom for him at that time?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the following verses 10-13 , it was the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, the church today is the kingdom where God s authority is exercised and represented.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where God has His dominion, there is rest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So the church, being the kingdom of God today, is God s Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since the church has God s image and is God s kingdom, it is a Sabbath rest for God.</S>
