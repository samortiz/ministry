   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORK OF THE LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that 5:25-27 presents Christ in three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ was in the first of these stages, the stage of the flesh, He went to the cross and there gave Himself up for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this second stage He is sanctifying and cleansing us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we open to Him and tell Him that we are willing to take Him as our life and our person, He will work within us as the life-giving Spirit to add Himself to us and to carry away our oldness and our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the work of the living Christ in sanctification and cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>NOURISHMENT AND SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We proceed to the nourishing and the cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I was young, I spent a great deal of time studying the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, I did not understand what it meant to be nourished and cherished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But through experience I have come to know what it is to be nourished and cherished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we open to the Lord Jesus and take Him as our life and our person, He sanctifies us and cleanses us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the same time He gives us nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know this by the fact that we have a wonderful sense of satisfaction within.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satisfaction comes from nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CLEANSING AND NOURISHING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only by receiving the life supply can we endure the Lord s cleansing of our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Surgeons realize that for a patient to withstand surgery, he must have nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, blood and glucose are transfused into the patient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord s cleansing is a kind of spiritual surgery, surgery on the depths of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s cleansing is His operating.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For such an operation we surely need His nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I know of a certain brother whose natural disposition was rude, mean, and even cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes he came to me in tears distraught over the kind of person he was.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He admitted that no one could satisfy him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regarding himself as the most loathsome person on earth, he was desperate to know what to do about his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I could not do anything to help him in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But I can testify that the Lord gradually cleansed and purified him thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He loved the Lord very much and was completely open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because he gave the Lord the ground within him, the Lord could come in to sanctify him and to cleanse him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord operated on him and washed away the element of his natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to bear such extensive surgery, we need the supply of the Lord s inward nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This brother could testify of the nourishment and enjoyment the Lord gave to him as He was cleansing him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Be assured, whenever the Lord sanctifies and cleanses, He also nourishes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Any sanctification or cleansing that is not accompanied by nourishment is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the product of self-effort.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever you try to sanctify yourself or cleanse yourself, you will have the sense of spiritual starvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if the Lord does the sanctifying and the cleansing, He will supply the nourishment, and you will enjoy sweet satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more the Lord purifies you, the more of His nourishment you will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead of suffering under the process of purification, you will enjoy the Lord and His abundant life-supply.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>CHERISHED BY THE LORD S TENDER WARMTH</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the Lord nourishes us, He also cherishes us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is like a mother who cherishes her child even as she feeds him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How the little ones enjoy the warmth and comfort of their mothers!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you consider your experience, you will realize that when the Lord sanctifies, cleanses, and nourishes you, He cherishes you with His tender warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His cherishing comforts you, soothes you, and calms you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah for the Lord s sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>PLACING OUR TRUST IN THE LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the living Christ can do all this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Doctrines cannot do it and not even the Bible can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you want the sanctifying, the cleansing, the nourishing, and the cherishing, you must place all your trust in the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Tell Him, Lord Jesus, nothing can replace You.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Lord, I love You, I open my heart to You, and I give You all the ground in my being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lord, possess me and be my life and my person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Lord, I don t care about outward things, not even about the church life in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I care only that You, Lord, will be my life and my person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you contact the Lord in this way, you will discover how living, real, available, and present He is.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He will sanctify you by adding Himself to you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He will cleanse you by washing away the old element of your natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He will also nourish you with His riches and cherish you with His warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As all this is taking place within you, you will have a marvelous enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the way the Lord is preparing His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this way we are becoming the glorious church Christ will present to Himself at His coming back.</S>
