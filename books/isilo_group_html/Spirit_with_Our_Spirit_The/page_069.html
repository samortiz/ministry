The Transforming Sanctification&#151;<br>the Daily Sanctification</H2><P>Second Corinthians 4:16 says that day by day our outer man, our old man, is being consumed, and our inner man, our new man, is being renewed. We should be renewed not merely day by day but also hour by hour and even minute by minute, continuously. Our entire environment, including the people around us, is the best instrument used by God to renew us. He is transforming us inwardly and metabolically with the divine element all the time.</P><P>The transforming sanctification is the daily sanctification which reconstitutes us with the element of Christ metabolically to make us a new constitution as a part of the organic Body of Christ (1 Cor. 3:12). This is a kind of reconstitution, to discharge the old and to add in the new replacement of the element of Christ. In order for us to be the living members of Christ, we need to be constituted with Christ's element to make us a new constitution for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Conforming Sanctification&#151;<br>the Shaping Sanctification</H2><P>The conforming sanctification is the shaping sanctification to shape us in the image of the glorious Christ (2 Cor. 3:18). A fruit tree has the shaping principle of life within it. When a peach tree bears fruit, the fruit is shaped in the particular form of a peach. The regulating law of the peach life shapes the peach. In every life there is a regulating law. When the sanctifying Spirit sanctifies us, there is a shaping element to shape us into the image of the glorious Christ. This shaping makes us the expression of Christ. This is why we can manifest Christ. We express Christ because we have been shaped by the sanctifying Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Glorifying Sanctification&#151;<br>the Consummating Sanctification</H2><P>The glorifying sanctification is the consummating sanctification, the completing sanctification to redeem our body by transfiguring it (Phil. 3:21). Our vile and fallen body will be redeemed from sickness, from weakness, from death, and from lust and sinfulness to make us Christ's expression in full and in glory (Rom. 8:23). At this point God's salvation and God's sanctification to carry out God's economy have reached the highest level. This is the revelation of the divine sanctification in seven steps.</P><P>The divine sanctification, from its beginning to its ending, is altogether the fine work of the consummated, compound, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit of Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Spirit with Our Spirit &nbsp; pg 69</div><br></body></html>
