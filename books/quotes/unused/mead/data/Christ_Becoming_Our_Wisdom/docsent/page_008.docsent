   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Becoming</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need righteousness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Righteousness has a great deal to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we did not have to stand before God, the question of righteousness would not come in. Once we think about God, we think of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, when we have to meet people, we always think of our dress.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the same way, when a man meets God, he must have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without righteousness, no one can see God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, righteousness is a basic item in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The matter of righteousness involves the means by which we come to God every time we approach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a Christian has not settled this matter, he does not have a solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Christian who has doubts about righteousness cannot come to God with assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many Christians desire to grow, and they would like to go on in God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But one of the reasons they go back and forth is that they are not clear about righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Righteousness is a simple matter, yet it is foundational.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, if we are not clear about righteousness, we cannot go on in peace; we will always have trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we must be clear about the matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are often not sure by what means we can come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We think that our good behavior is our righteousness and that we come to God by good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some brothers and sisters think that if their behavior is good and they do well from morning to evening, they have righteousness that day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if their behavior is not perfect, they have a problem with righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The brothers and sisters who have this kind of thought take righteousness as their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God opens our eyes, we will see that our righteousness before God has nothing to do with our conduct; it is something else.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's light is like a knife to us; it divides our righteousness from our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Formerly, we thought that when we came to God, our conduct was our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But now we see that when we come to God, Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our righteousness is no longer our conduct; our righteousness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thank the Lord that before God, our righteousness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our conduct can improve, but our righteousness cannot improve.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our conduct is not perfect, but our righteousness is always perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our righteousness is Christ, and we can come to God through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our conduct is not blameless, but praise the Lord, our righteousness is blameless because our righteousness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to know that Christ as our righteousness is the greatest salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has settled the matter of righteousness for us, and our position before God is secured.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers and sisters, we should have good behavior, and we should behave well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should serve God more, and we should be diligent and bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we have to realize that while our conduct can improve again and again, our righteousness before God cannot improve anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The means by which we can come to God today is the same means by which we can come to Him ten or twenty years from now.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our righteousness before God is not our own conduct; it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a man does not have the revelation to see that Christ is his righteousness, he will not be able to come boldly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he sees that his righteousness is a person, that his righteousness is Christ, he will be bold in approaching God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, we must remember that when we come to God, our righteousness is not our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our righteousness is not a thing; our righteousness is a person Christ.</S>
