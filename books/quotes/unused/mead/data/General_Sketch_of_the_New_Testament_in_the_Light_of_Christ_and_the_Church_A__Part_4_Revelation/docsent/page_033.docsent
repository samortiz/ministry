   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MILLENNIAL KINGDOM In the Best Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 20:1-3 records the imprisonment of Satan for one thousand years in the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following this, verses 4 and 5 say, And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Greek, the word first here is the same word as best in Luke 15:22, which speaks of the best robe which the father gave to the returning prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, this phrase in Revelation 20:5 may be rendered the best resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Christians have a wrong concept about resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Philippians 3:11 the apostle Paul says, If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1:24-25 he says that he would remain on the earth for the Lord s testimony, and in 3:20 he indicates that we should wait for the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that Paul gave no indication here that he expected to die, yet he still aspired to attain to a certain kind of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word for resurrection in 3:11 is not the ordinary word for resurrection; it has something added to it to make it out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The out-resurrection from the dead is the outstanding resurrection, the best resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This may be compared to a graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Someone may graduate from school, but his may not be the best graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only the top few graduates have the best graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This resurrection, the best resurrection, includes not only those overcomers who have died but also the raptured living overcomers, such as the firstfruits in Revelation 14:1-5, who have part in the issue of the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With the Priesthood and the Kingship</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>for One Thousand Years</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 20:6 says, Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we have seen, the first resurrection is not the ordinary resurrection; this is the best resurrection, the resurrection with the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ones spoken of here are resurrected not only to live but also to reign, to be co-kings with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many believe that no matter what kind of Christians they are after they are saved, they will suddenly be kings when the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is ridiculous.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone who intends to be a king must be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times I look at myself and ask, Do I look like a king?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the Lord Jesus came today and put us on thrones as kings, we ourselves might tell Him that we are not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s intention is not merely to save us but to save us to be priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One born into a royal family needs much training and discipline to become a proper king.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many Christians are poor, having only been saved but never having loved the Lord or agreed to hand themselves over to Him to be disciplined and trained.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can they be His co-kings?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those in chapter twenty who live and reign with Christ are not merely the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After being saved, they passed through certain kinds of experiences which made them adequate and prepared to be kings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE LAST REBELLION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 20:7 and 8 say, And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their number is like that of the sand of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Gog and Magog are mentioned in Ezekiel 38 and 39.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ezekiel 38:2 says, Son of man, set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Magog refers to a people from the remotest part of the north Gen 10:2; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>39:1-2 , and Meshech corresponds to today s Moscow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, most Bible students agree that Gog and Magog refer to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This gives us a hint to understand today s world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, the problems between men on the earth and God will be focused on that region.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Revelation 20:8 and 9, even after the thousand-year reign of Christ, the human race on earth will still be rebellious due to the work of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 9a says, And they went up upon the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 19:14 the overcoming saints are called the armies in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After the war at Armageddon, during the thousand years, the armies of heaven become the camp of the saints who reign as co-kings with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In addition, the beloved city is Jerusalem, the dwelling place of the remnant of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These two people the camp of the saints and the beloved city will become the target for the enemy s attack.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Satan will stir up the rebellious human race to do their best to destroy the believers and the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, verse 9b continues, And fire came down out of heaven and devoured them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Following this, the devil was cast into the lake of fire, where the beast and the false prophet were v. 10 .</S>
