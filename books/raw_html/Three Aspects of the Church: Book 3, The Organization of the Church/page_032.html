<h1 class="title">SOME MATTERS RELATED<br />
TO FULL-TIME SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING FULL TIME<br />
BEING A MATTER OF COMMISSION</h2>
<p>Almost everything has its good points and its drawbacks. In the past few years, from 1952 until today, we have indeed had God&rsquo;s presence in the matter of serving full time. Many brothers and sisters have received the Lord&rsquo;s wondrous grace and brought great blessing to the church. However, there are several matters that we need to study carefully before the Lord. Some of these matters require that we be cautious, and others require that we make a few adjustments.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Everyone Needing to Serve</h2>
<p>From the beginning, based on the light that God has given us, we have seen that every saved one, regardless of his occupation, should serve the Lord. Not only apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers should serve God, but even a member who has a small gift should serve God. Those who serve in this way may not need to drop their jobs.</p>
<p>Serving God should be the primary concern, the basic work, of the believers. However, in order to make a living, the believers also need to hold jobs for their livelihood. Regardless of what kind of job a believer has, that job is only a side job. Even the sisters&rsquo; managing and care of their homes are a side job. To us the most important matter on earth is to serve God. Hence, if the Lord&rsquo;s commission requires us to use all of our time to carry it out and if the environment allows our daily needs to be met, we should serve full time.</p>
<p>There are several ways for a full-time serving one&rsquo;s needs to be met. Some may have an amount of money provided by the Lord either through an inheritance or some other source. As a result, they have sufficient money to support their living. Some may be engaged in a business in which they do not need to work hard yet can still earn a living. Some may have their needs taken care of by the church or by individual saints who follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Some also have a strong faith in the Lord that enables them to get through. All of these ways allow the needs of the serving ones to be met. As a result, these saints are not only able to but should use all of their time to serve the Lord. Nevertheless, using one&rsquo;s time to serve the Lord is not exactly the same as being commissioned by the Lord for His work. In other words, everyone should serve the Lord, but how much time each one should dedicate to the Lord&rsquo;s service depends upon how much commission that person has received from the Lord and on the financial provision of their environment.</p>
<p>Even an apostle as great as Paul was forced to make tents (Acts 20:34; 18:3) due to environmental circumstances. The commission the Lord gave Paul required all of his time; however, the environment did not enable this. Consequently, Paul had no alternative but to set apart some time to make tents. If the environment had permitted him, he surely would have used all of his time to serve the Lord. Other people who serve the Lord may have a commission that requires only part of their time, not all of their time. Thus, they can also do something on the side.</p>
<p>We currently have almost one hundred brothers and sisters serving full time on the island of Taiwan. According to our observation, we feel that it is not suitable for some to continue serving in this way. This means that some of those serving full time should find a job. Not everyone who serves full time is necessarily called to do so, but every saved one should be a serving one. The amount of time with which a person should serve is based on the amount of grace he receives from the Lord and the provisions available in his environment. After observing the situation of the brothers and sisters who have been serving full time, we feel that some of them should take a job.</p>
<p>Initially, some began to serve full time because the Lord had arranged the environment, and they themselves sensed the Lord&rsquo;s commission. After two years, however, the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement in their environment may have changed. Consequently, they need to take a job in order to earn a living. This can be compared to the apostle Paul making tents. However, in this fellowship our focus is not on the environmental arrangements but on the serving ones&rsquo; condition before the Lord and the commission that they have received from the Lord. The commission that some have received from the Lord is not sufficient for them to serve full time. Hence, they should take a job.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Serving Full Time Being<br />
Based on the Lord&rsquo;s Commission</h2>
<p>Whether we serve full time is based not on how we feel but on the amount of work and the extent of the commission that the Lord has given us. All the brothers and sisters serving full time have a strong desire to do so, and they are willing to pay the price and give up their futures for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. There is absolutely no problem in regard to their heart; however, the Lord has not measured to some of them a sufficient amount of work or given them a commission that requires them to serve full time.</p>
<p>Some saints truly love the Lord, have been shown mercy by the Lord, have received the Lord&rsquo;s grace, and are weary of the world and the things of the world. They have a strong desire to come together with others every day to pray, to read the Bible, and to live before the Lord. This kind of desire is excellent, but it may not be the Lord&rsquo;s will, because there are many lessons that can be learned while working in a job. Hence, these saints need to work under others as nurses, teachers, and clerks. Although some saints can receive a high salary by working, they choose to not have a job because despite the difficulty in maintaining their living, they are content to serve full time. They feel that it is wonderful to not need to contact and strive with unbelievers. If they were to work as teachers, they would have to learn how to deal with the principal, the dean of academics, and other colleagues. For them, this is too troublesome. In addition, they would have to deal with many other matters in society that are bothersome. Instead of struggling and striving every day, they would rather contact the saints, preach the gospel, read the Bible, and pray. Actually, this lifestyle can be compared to entering a monastery. Without God&rsquo;s commission, they may merely become the same as nuns and monks.</p>
<p>In the Catholic Church many people enter monasteries for the same reason. They consider that the best human life is to be a monk or nun. By living such a life, they do not need to worry about their living, to struggle for worldly possessions, and to strive with those in the world. Instead, they need only to read the Bible in ease and comfort, living a &ldquo;transcendent&rdquo; life. From the standpoint of religion, this is quite good, and from the viewpoint of human philosophy, it is also not bad. However, spiritually such a life has little value. Ultimately, the question is not whether one way of life is better than another, but whether we are living according to the Lord&rsquo;s will for us and taking the way that the Lord desires us to take.</p>
<p>If the sisters like to stay at home and take care of the housework and serve their family, this is surely a proper human endeavor. However, some sisters feel that it is too troublesome to stay at home and do housework, serving their husband and children. They would rather serve the Lord full time. If this is the case, their serving is absolutely not according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading but an excuse for them to avoid human responsibility.</p>
<p>We may be able to conduct ourselves in a certain way, but we should not take our conduct as a teaching to speak to people or to instruct others. For instance, if a sister is single, she may tell others that it is best for females to remain single and that it is wrong for them not to remain single. We cannot criticize such a sister for being single. However, she should not take her condition of being single as a doctrine and instruct others to follow it. This is wrong. A sister should not serve full time in order to avoid the troubles of housework and of serving her husband and children at home. To serve full time in this way is comparable to living a life in a monastery. It is absolutely not according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>Serving full time is for only one kind of person, a person to whom God has given a work, a commission, that requires all of his time and who has an arrangement in his environment for his living. The basic condition is to have a commission. Consequently, some who are serving full time should not continue to serve full time because they have not been given much commission. Their heart toward the Lord is very good, their condition is also very proper, and there is no problem in regard to their person, but evidently, the commission they have received does not require all of their time. If such a person can hold a part-time job and serve part time, the benefits to both him and the church will be great.</p>
