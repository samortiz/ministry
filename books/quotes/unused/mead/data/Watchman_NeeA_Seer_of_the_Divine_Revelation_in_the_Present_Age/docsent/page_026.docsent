   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 1923 Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi invited me to preach in Kien-ou in the north of Fukien province.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I had only about fifteen dollars in my pocket, one-third of the traveling expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I decided to leave on Friday evening and continued my prayer on Wednesday and Thursday.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The money, however, did not come in. I prayed again Friday morning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not only was no money forthcoming, but also I had a feeling within that I should give five dollars to a certain co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I recalled the Lord's words: "Give, and it will be given to you."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I had not been a money lover, but on that day I really loved money and found it extremely difficult to give.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I prayed to the Lord again, "O Lord, if You really want me to give away five dollars, I will," but I was still rather unwilling inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was deceived by Satan into thinking that after praying I would not have to give away the five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was the only time in my life that I shed tears over money.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, I obeyed the Lord and gave the five dollars to that co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the money was given, I was filled with heavenly joy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the co-worker asked why I gave him the money, I said, "You need not ask; you will know later."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Friday evening I prepared to begin my journey.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I said to God, "Fifteen dollars was already insufficient, and You wanted me to give away five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Won't the sum be even more inadequate?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now I don't know how to pray."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I made up my mind to go first to Shui-Kow by steamer and then to Kien-ou by a small wooden boat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I spent only a little for the journey to Shui-Kow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the steamer was about to arrive, I felt that if I would not pray according to my own concept, the result would be much better.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So I said to the Lord, "I do not know how to pray; please do it for me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I added, "If You will not give me the money, please provide a boat for me with a little fare."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I arrived in Shui-Kow, many boatmen came to solicit business.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One asked only seven dollars for my passage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This price was beyond expectation; the usual fare was several times more.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I asked the boatman why his price was so low, and he replied, "This boat is hired by the magistrate, but I am allowed to take one passenger only for the space at the stern, so I do not care how much the fare is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But you have to provide your own food."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Originally, I had fifteen dollars in my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After giving five dollars to a co-worker and spending a few dimes for the journey by steamer, seven dollars for the small wooden boat, and a dollar or so for food, there was still a dollar thirty left when I reached Kien-ou.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise Him that His ordering is always good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After I completed my work at Kien-ou and was ready to return to Foochow, the problem arose again: I did not have sufficient funds for traveling expenses to return.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I had decided to leave on the following Monday, so I continued praying until Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This time I had a feeling of certainty in my heart, recalling that before I left Foochow, God had asked me to give five dollars to a co-worker, which I then begrudged giving.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time I read Luke 6:38: "Give, and it will be given to you," and I laid hold of this sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I said to God, "Since You have said this, I beseech You to provide me with the necessary money for traveling expenses according to Your promise."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On Sunday evening a British pastor, Mr. Philips, a true brother, assuredly saved and loving the Lord, asked Brother Weigh and me to dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At dinner Mr. Philips told me that he and his church had received great help through my messages, and they offered to be responsible for my traveling expenses both ways.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I replied that there was already someone who had accepted this responsibility, meaning God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then he said, "When you get back to Foochow, I will give you The Dynamic of Service written by Mr. Paget Wilkes, a gospel messenger greatly used by the Lord in Japan." I soon felt that I had missed a great opportunity; what I needed then was money for traveling expenses, not a book.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I somewhat regretted that I had not accepted his offer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After dinner Brother Weigh and I returned home together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I had refused Mr. Philips's offer for my traveling expenses so that I might look solely to God for help; nevertheless, there was joy and peace in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brother Weigh was unaware of my financial situation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I had a slight thought of borrowing money from him for my expenses and then reimbursing him when I returned to Foochow, but God would not allow me to divulge this matter to him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I was under full conviction that God in heaven is forever dependable, and I wished to see how He was going to provide for me.</S>
