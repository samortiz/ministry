<h1 class="title">HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14; 4:14, 24; 6:35, 57b, 63; 7:37-39; 10:9, 16; 15:5; 17:21, 23; 20:22; 21:15, 17</h1>
<p>The book of Ephesians shows that God has a plan to dispense Himself as the riches of Christ into us for the producing of the church as the fullness of Christ and of God (3:8, 10; 1:22-23; 3:19). The way to take Jesus Christ into us is by eating (John 6:57). By eating Jesus as our spiritual food, we grow in His life. A baby boy has all the necessary organs, but he cannot function adequately because he lacks the growth in life. So you have to feed him in order that he may grow. This growth will bring him the proper functions in all his organs. Then this little boy will become a functioning one. We all are the members of Christ, and we are complete in our organs. But we may still be short of function because we do not have the adequate growth in life. So we all need to eat Jesus, to take Jesus into us as our nourishment, that we may grow. By this growth we will have the function, and by this function the Body is directly built up in love (Eph. 4:16). This is the Lord&rsquo;s building of His church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING FLESH,<br />
FULL OF GRACE AND REALITY</h2>
<p>Now we come to the last of the four Gospels. John is the final word of all the Gospels. The final word is always the final decision. To know what is here in this Gospel is not so easy. John&rsquo;s long Gospel is of twenty-one chapters, and the many things contained in this book are profound.</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; No one can understand or apprehend this verse in a full way. It is difficult to say what the beginning is and who the Word is. First, the Word was with God, so it seems that the Word and God are two, but eventually the Word is God. This means that the Word and God are one. It is really hard to say whether They are one or two. If you say one, I say two. If you say two, I say one. This is so profound. We do not know so much, but we do have so much. When you are invited to a feast, you may have many courses about which you know very little. You may not know so much about them, but you have them. It is the same in the spiritual realm. We may not know what the beginning is, but we have the beginning. We do not fully know the Word, but we have the Word.</p>
<p>John 1:14 says that the Word, who was God, became flesh, and He was full of grace and reality. He was not full of doctrines and gifts, full of teachings and ordinances, full of forms and regulations, or full of miracles and signs. He was full of grace and reality. Grace is God enjoyed by us. Full of grace means full of enjoyment. Reality, or truth, is God realized by us.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate in the following way. In order to make bread, grains of wheat are ground into powder. Then the powder is blended and baked to become bread. So we could say, &ldquo;In the beginning was the wheat, and the wheat was the fine flour, and the wheat became bread, full of enjoyment.&rdquo; Once, I was invited to take care of a conference in Copenhagen. Every morning the saints there served us different kinds of Danish bread for our enjoyment. If you enjoy the bread, you get the reality. The reality is the rich nourishment of all the ingredients of the wheat. This is an example of the Word becoming flesh, full of grace and reality for our enjoyment and realization.</p>
<p>In this light we can see how much Christianity has missed and how much it has frustrated us from the enjoyment of such a wonderful and unsearchable Christ. Christ is God Himself. There is no God without Christ. He is the rich embodiment of God for our enjoyment (Col. 2:9). But we have to realize that He is not the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God but the processed God. He is the very God who has been &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; processed. Most of the foods we eat are processed, especially bread. Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (John 6:35). Christ today is not the uncooked dough but the bread. Bread is something made of wheat through a process. As long as the wheat remains raw, it can never be bread. If the wheat is going to be bread for your enjoyment, surely it has to be processed. It has to be cooked.</p>
<p>Christ is also the Lamb of God (1:29). The lamb of the passover was processed. It was slain, and the meat of the lamb was roasted with fire. Then the redeemed people struck the blood on their homes and ate the processed meat, not the raw meat (Exo. 12:6-8). Christ was also processed as the real Passover lamb (1 Cor. 5:7). He was slain, killed on the cross. He was processed by being &ldquo;burned&rdquo; on the cross. The holy fire of God fell upon Him and burned Him. He was really roasted. Christ was the roasted mutton.</p>
<p>When we enjoy Christ, we get the reality, which may be likened to the realization of all the ingredients of wheat. There are many ingredients in wheat, but without enjoying them, these ingredients are not yours; they are not real to you. But after you enjoy the bread, the ingredients of the wheat become real to you, and this is the reality. In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of enjoyment and reality. In John 1 we are told that Christ was God Himself processed for our enjoyment. If we get this enjoyment, surely we get the reality, which is the nourishment of all that Christ is, the ingredients of the riches of Christ. If we enjoy Him, we get the reality.</p>
