   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH'S PREPARATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE LORD'S RETURN The Need for Maturity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a strong link between the readiness of the church and the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We fully believe that this is the time for the church to prepare itself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order for God's children to be reaped, they must first mature Mark 4:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>D. M. Panton illustrates this by the picture of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The day of harvest is not determined by the farmer but by the crop.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The farmer does not set a date for harvesting with no regard whatsoever for the ripeness of the crop.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The crop must mature before the harvest can come.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Similarly, the day of rapture is determined by the church, not by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a very definite day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the church is not mature, the harvest will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Forsaking Everything to Meet the Lord's Demand</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We bear a heavy responsibility today for the maturity of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For many years we strove for perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you and I neglect our responsibility today, I do not know how long we will delay the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let me say a strong word: If we want to follow the Lord, we must tell Him that we will forsake everything to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have any reservation at all, we will lose our joy and power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The power of the early church was in the poverty of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The degradation of the church today is in its abundance of rich people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we drop everything to meet the Lord's demand today, our eyes will be opened to a glory that has never before been seen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning God's will, we should not shrink from anything, and we should not question or withhold anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What God wants today is not ours, that is, what we have; He wants us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wants us to offer ourselves to Him, to give ourselves to His gospel, to His will, and to the gaining of sinners' souls.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Witness often says that as soon as money leaves the church, souls are added from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One consecration is not good enough; we need to continue the practice of forsaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may say that we have given up everything without reservation, but according to God we still may have many reservations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not know of them because His light has not touched us yet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are willing to be continually under His light, He will shine on us again and again, and we will have to drop something further.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever there is new light, we have to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the way to meet the requirement of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the past two years, I have been very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I feel that Ephesians 4 and 5 are very close to us; they are no longer so far away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are not a hard yoke to us; they have become an easy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a very short while, the Lord will gain the glorious church, but the glory will be experienced only by some.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Others will miss it because they have cared too much for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we all come up to this standard, it will be easy for God to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I wish that all of us here tonight would become desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I wish all of us would give our all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May we all pray to the Lord, "Do not pass me by.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not leave me here.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Just as You have made others partakers, make me a partaker.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You are not a respector of persons; do not leave me behind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as You have granted others the grace to catch up, grant me the same grace."</S>
