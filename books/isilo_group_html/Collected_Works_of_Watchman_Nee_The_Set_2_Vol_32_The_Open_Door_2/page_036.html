His wonderful grace has come also to Feng-Jiang. We also thank and praise Him for sending Brother Chen Ke-san and Sister Bau Hsu-min to come and edify us. We also thank and praise the Lord that two brothers and sisters were baptized in the meeting hall on June 11. In particular we thank and praise Him that He recovered His table on June 12 so that we can practice fellowship and remember and worship Him. Please pray for the meetings here. May the Lord be merciful to preserve the meeting until His return, amen. July 7 (Thursday) was our regularly scheduled prayer meeting. All the brothers and sisters fasted and prayed. Although the amount we offer is small, the thought behind it is sincere. Please find X dollars sent to you via the post office, and please direct it to brothers and sisters in difficulty.</p><p>Chen Bing-jiu, Keh Chang-chai, and Chen Tuo-sien, July 12</p><h2 class="head2">Wu-Chow, Kwangsi Province</h2><p>Dear Brothers Kwang-hsi and Hsi-wen:</p><p>Through your letters I learned that you preached in Ku-Jiu and Lin-An and were blessed by the Lord. Furthermore, the bread-breaking meeting has started in Ku-Jiu. Thank and praise the Lord that He has enlightened His children and attracted sinners to come under His name. I left for the south on April 14, going through Hanoi, Liang-Shan, and Lung-Chow. From there I traveled by bus to Ch'ang-Wu and arrived here on the twenty-second. Along the way I witnessed the Lord's protection. Thank and praise Him.</p><p>On May 1 (Lord's Day) we began to have the bread-breaking meeting in my home. In addition to myself, Brother Lin Dao-liang (who is a teacher at the Bible school here) comes to join us often. Brother Mu and I have written a letter to Brother Philip Luan inviting him to come and pioneer in Wu-Chow. The Lord willing, this wish will soon be realized. Presently, I am renting an apartment with Brother Mu, which we secured on the day we arrived. There are six rooms (all on the third floor with water and electricity). The sitting room, when opened up, can hold thirty to forty people. The rent is $12.50 plus water and electricity. In considering the world trend, believers all realize that the night is dark and the day is near. We should do our best to testify for the Lord and preach the gospel. During my long travel, I had many opportunities to preach the gospel to individual travelers and to sow gospel seeds. May the Lord water these seeds so that they can grow. I have witnessed to six or seven of my colleagues at work. Most of them are willing to accept without much resistance. I hope that in the future they will solidly receive the Lord's salvation. Yesterday morning Sisters Lin Siu-jieh and Hu Hwei-ying from Shanghai came here via Hong Kong at the recommendation of Brother Luan. The same day they took up jobs at the Nan-ning Railroad Hospital. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord. Peace to you. The brothers and sisters and Brother Mu charge me to greet you.</p><p>Brother Lin Yau-huei, June 7</p><h2 class="head2">Shu County, Anhwei Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Lan:</p><p>On May 18 my whole family moved into the refugee relief center. Although we passed through danger, the Lord protected us, and we are finally safe. Brother Yuan Lin-shu is in the villages and has visited us twice at the relief center. We are told that the brothers and sisters in the villages are also safe. Brother Chang Yun-siu and his family moved into the second relief center and are also safe. Thank the Lord. Greetings to you in the Lord. All the brothers and sisters send their greetings to you.</p><p>Brother Hwang Tse-hou, July 9</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
