Not Being Ruled by Man Directly<br />
but Sent by the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Perhaps some may say that Paul led a group of co-workers and that everything was under his direction. Although this is not altogether wrong, if we consider carefully the record in the Bible, we cannot find a definite verse that indicates that Paul was directing his co-workers. He did write to Timothy, saying, &ldquo;Be diligent to come to me quickly;...the cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:9, 13). In 1 Corinthians Paul severely rebuked the Corinthian believers, but when he wrote the book of 2 Corinthians, he was apprehensive and sorrowful within, anxiously awaiting the arrival of Titus so that he would know the condition of the Corinthian believers (2 Cor. 2:13; 7:6). At the end of 1 Corinthians, Paul indicated that he had hoped that Apollos would go to comfort the Corinthian believers, but Apollos was not willing. Regarding this Paul said, &ldquo;Concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity&rdquo; (16:12). This is a strong proof that every co-worker has the liberty in the Holy Spirit in his work. According to our natural concept, we may think that Paul took the lead in the work in the same way that the pope does today; however, this understanding is not correct. If the pope were to say to a bishop under him, &ldquo;Go and pay a visit to Corinth,&rdquo; I doubt that any bishop would be like Apollos and dare say to the pope, &ldquo;It is not at all my desire to go now; I will go later when it is convenient for me.&rdquo; This proves that Paul did not direct the co-workers.</p>
<p>In the Catholic Church the Virgin Mary, the so-called mother of God, is considered to be without the sinful nature. Beginning in the Middle Ages, a great controversy began concerning whether or not Mary was without original sin. Finally in 1854, Pope Pius IX broke the deadlock and made it church dogma that Mary was without original sin. From then on, all Catholics and Catholic theologians must say that the Virgin Mary was without the sinful nature. Even Madame Guyon, author of <em>Sweet Smelling Myrrh,</em> obeyed the pope to the uttermost. Although the pope put her into prison, she still obeyed him. This is not according to the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Leadership in the New Testament Ministry<br />
Relying on the Teaching of the Apostles</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Apostles&rsquo; Teaching Not Allowing Man<br />
to Teach Things That Are Different<br />
from God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>The example concerning Paul and Apollos shows that Paul was not the directing one. In other words, a matter was not settled simply because Paul said something. In sending co-workers to particular places, Paul did not insist; rather, he gave the brothers absolute freedom. In the matter of speaking the truth, however, he was unyielding. In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul told Timothy, &ldquo;Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things.&rdquo; From the context, these different things refer to the law, Old Testament genealogies (v. 4), and profane and old-womanish myths (4:7). According to Paul&rsquo;s thought, we should speak only God&rsquo;s economy, which is in faith; that is, we should speak only the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Hence, we draw the conclusion that it was the apostles&rsquo; teaching that took the lead in the New Testament, not Paul as an individual. The apostles&rsquo; teaching, the truth, the faith, the teaching of God&rsquo;s economy took the lead in the New Testament ministry.</p>
