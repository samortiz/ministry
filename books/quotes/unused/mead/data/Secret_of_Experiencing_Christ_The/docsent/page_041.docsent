   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE SECRET OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN GALATIANS Scripture Reading: Gal 1:4, 13-14; 2:19, 21; 4:21; 5:2-4, 17, 24; 6:13-15; 2:20; 3:2, 5, 14, 23; 4:6; 5:5-6, 16, 18, 25; 6:8, 18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Four books in the New Testament Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians may be considered the heart of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In recent years the Lord has shown us vision after vision and given us revelation upon revelation from these books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we are still short of adequate spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This has caused me to seek a way to have more experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Little by little, the Lord has unveiled the secret of experiencing Himself as found in these books.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My burden in these chapters is not related to doctrine or even to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, my burden is on the secret of experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE PRESENT EVIL AGE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to see the secret of experiencing Christ, we need to consider the negative things Paul deals with in these books.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These negative things are related to Paul's purpose in writing these Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The negative things in the book of Galatians are all part of one thing "the present evil age."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1:4 Paul says that Christ "gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What Paul terms the present evil age is the most serious negative matter covered in Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 6:14 Paul refers to this evil age as the world: "But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the context of 6:14 makes clear, the world here is the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the religious world in 6:14 is the present evil age in 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This religious world, the present evil age, includes Judaism, the law, circumcision, and tradition as four of its basic constituents.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The major roles in the religious world are portrayed by the "I" and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The "I" is the fallen man, and the flesh is the expression of "I."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, "I" and the flesh are one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 2:20 Paul says that the "I" has been crucified, but in 5:24 he speaks of the flesh being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The cross, therefore, is the termination both of the "I" and of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The four constituents of the religious world plus the "I" and the flesh are the negative things found in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All these negative things are substitutes for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this book Paul reveals to us that Christ must now replace Judaism, the law, circumcision, and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, Christ must replace the "I" and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to this book, Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Having accomplished redemption to fulfill God's economy, Christ has become the all-inclusive Spirit, the blessing promised by God to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a Christ must replace all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He must be the all-inclusive replacement; He must replace our religion, law, ritual, and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He must also replace our "I" and our flesh.</S>
