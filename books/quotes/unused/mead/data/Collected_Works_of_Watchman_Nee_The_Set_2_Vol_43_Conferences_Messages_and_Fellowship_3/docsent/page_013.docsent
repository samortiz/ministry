   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Loving the World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, God loves the world, that is, God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today many do not believe that God loves them and will save them freely.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They think that they must go through many sufferings before they can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Martin Luther was like this before he was enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He knelt on the stairs of the cathedral, fasted, prayed, and afflicted his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He thought that this might cause God to forgive him of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the concept and practice of many Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They think that they must beg and implore before God will change His heart and mind to forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is man's biggest misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible says that there is no need for us to beg God to change His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His love is not affected by what we have done; He loves the world to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's nature is love; love is even God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's feeling toward man is just love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The biggest misunderstanding man has toward God is to think that God hates man or that He wants to punish man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One time I came across 1 John 4:16 and John 3:16 and became almost ecstatic with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I put down the Bible in the house and ran out to the streets of Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I said to the first person I saw, "Do you know that God loves you?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then I said the same thing to the second person I saw.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I know of a young man in America whose parents were very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The family's whole livelihood depended on the little work that the aging father did.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day the young man said to his father, "I am going to leave home."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His father asked, "Why are you leaving home?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said, "Because this family is too poor; there is not enough money for food and clothing."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the father heard this, tears came down his face.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The next morning the father got up and prepared some food for the son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Handing a parcel to the son, he asked when the son would be leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The son said that he was leaving that very day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The father put the package in the son's hand and accompanied him for a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They walked on the village road without saying a word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the son was about to bid farewell, the father said, "In my whole life, I have never wanted to be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But last night I hated myself for not being rich.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because we are poor that you are leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I feel very sad.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am giving you all that I can give you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have put the best items in here."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They continued walking together for another two or three miles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Finally, the father gave a silver coin to his son, saying, "Perhaps you will need some money.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For the last four or five years, you have not seen any silver coins, only copper coins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here is a silver coin today; it is passed on to you from your mother.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Good-by, my son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May God bless you."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At this point the young man saw something.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He realized how much his father loved him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even though his family was very poor, he felt that he had no choice but to accept the parcel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then he left his father and went to a big city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He worked as a chief editor for a newspaper and earned a great deal of money.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Soon he forgot his poor family.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later, the newspaper business closed, his money ran out, and he became sick.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One day he took the parcel that his father had given him and went to an inn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As he was lying in the inn, he began to realize that his condition was worse than when he was at home.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He did not know whether he could return home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He thought, "I cannot go home, because I did not treat my father well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps my father hates me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I did not send any money home when I was making all the money in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I did not correspond with anyone in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I wonder if I still have my father's love."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Later, he became so sick that he thought he should go home to see his father before his death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He gathered his luggage and returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When he got to the house, he did not go in immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He took a peek from the outside of the house and saw his father, who had aged even more.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The furniture inside the house was as old and worn as it was before.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He saw his aging father eating alone and looking very devastated.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then his father picked up his Bible and began to pray, saying, "May You be gracious to save and bless my son.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May he not suffer because of the poverty at home.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May he find happiness and no longer suffer so much hardship."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the son heard his father's prayer from the outside, he knew his father still loved him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He opened the door and entered the house, weeping and saying to his father, "From now on, even if I become the richest person in the whole world, I am not going to leave."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a picture of man today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He thinks that God does not love him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to realize that it is we who fail to love God rather than God who fails to love us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are the ones who reject God; God has never rejected us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord said to Jerusalem, "How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Matt 23:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord is willing, but we are not willing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God never fails to love us; it is we who fail to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Human beings have no love; it is impossible for us to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, God is love; it is impossible for God not to love.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As far as God's love is concerned, the second greatest revelation in the Bible is that God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God's feeling toward man is forever love.</S>
