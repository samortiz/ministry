<h2 class="head1">PROCLAIMING THE WORD,<br />
BEING READY IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON</h2>
<p>Paul told Timothy, &ldquo;Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; convict, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:2). We should not say that it is winter and that we need to wait for spring to sow the seed. Rather, we are peculiar farmers; to us every day is for sowing the seed and for reaping the harvest. &ldquo;In season&rdquo; is when we have the opportunity, and &ldquo;out of season&rdquo; is when we do not have an opportunity. Whether or not we have the opportunity, we need to be ready. To &ldquo;be ready&rdquo; means being urgent, attentive, and on the alert. We can compare this kind of readiness to instant tea or coffee. Whenever we need some tea or coffee, it can be ready instantly. We need to be &ldquo;instant&rdquo; preachers, ready without need of further preparation. We should be ready at any time and in any place. We are ready at the supermarket, the bus station, the office, and the classroom. We must not say that we are not ready or that there are no opportunities. Every occasion&mdash;spring, summer, fall, and winter&mdash;is the time for us to be ready. This is not the religious way of preaching. This is the proper Christian living. There is no other way to take. We need to have this kind of gospel living. We should not say that this is not the right place, the right time, or the right person for the gospel. Every place is the right place, every time is the right time, and every person is the right person. We must be instant, ready, urgent, and attentive in season and out of season.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT EXPECTING A GREAT REVIVAL<br />
BUT BEARING FRUIT IN A NORMAL WAY</h2>
<p>In the two Epistles to Timothy there are no miracles. If we have miracles, then we do not need to be in season and out of season. We can simply pray for three nights, and something will come down from heaven. However, the gospel is not that way. Many Christians have prayed in a superstitious way, expecting a great revival to come, but the result has been poor. If, on the contrary, Christians will have a normal living of the gospel, it will be sufficient for each one to bring only one person to the Lord each year. Then within twenty-five years the whole world will be evangelized. Even in our own locality, if we all bear one fruit in a year, our numbers will double until the whole city will be evangelized. This is much greater than the biggest revival.</p>
<p>The subtlety of the enemy causes us to be too farsighted, looking to the future while neglecting the present. We do not need to look to tomorrow, and there is no need to pray for three years for a great revival to come. We should simply live for today and take care of one &ldquo;Nicodemus.&rdquo; Many of us have been in Christianity for many years, and until today we are still under the influence of its traditional concepts, understanding, and teaching. We must be rid of all these concepts. We should care only for today, not for tomorrow. Perhaps this evening we will meet one of our relatives. Then we should spend some time to take care of him. This is a normal, daily gospel living, not a movement or special activity. The Lord Jesus went to Samaria in a very normal way and waited at Jacob&rsquo;s well for someone to draw water. Then He asked her for water, not in the way of preaching or of a movement but as part of His normal daily living. This daily living was His gospel preaching. Because He was living in this way, God sent the right people to Him, and He brought people to God. If we would all live in this way, God will send His chosen ones to us. Then every year we will reap fruit. However, because we have been influenced by the wrong concept, we have not borne fruit in a normal way. Our time has been wasted in vain expectations, and we have not lived out our duty. If we have the proper living, day by day and one by one people will be brought to the Lord and into the church life. This is the proper preaching of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FEEDING THE LORD&rsquo;S LAMBS<br />
ACCORDING TO THE NORMAL PROCESS OF LIFE</h2>
<p>John 4 speaks concerning reaping the harvest, John 15 concerning bearing fruit, and John 21 concerning feeding the lambs (vv. 15-17). No one can feed a lamb once for all in a miraculous way. If we try to do this, we will kill the lambs. Rather, we need to feed them daily, several times a day, just as mothers feed their children meal after meal. We need to turn from the miraculous concept to the life concept. The Gospel of John is a book on life. Reaping a harvest, bearing fruit, and feeding lambs are all processes of life. These are all related to a daily living in the way of life, not a mere work, activity, or movement in a miraculous, religious way. If we receive the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and enjoy His grace, we will all be built up in this life, and we will bear fruit and even double each year in a normal way. Then in less than ten years the entire city we live in can be converted. This instant and constant way is solid, rich, and prevailing. This must be our living day and night. By living this way and being such persons, we will constantly enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence, supply, and all the riches of the life of Christ. We will have much to minister to the saints and much with which to function. This will enrich and uplift our meetings, and it will make us living and joyful.</p>
<p>A family that has only the older generation with no children is not a joyful one. There is no doubt that to care for children is a bother. Because my grandchildren are much trouble, they can stay with me for only short periods of time. Nevertheless, I love them all. How poor it would be if at my age I had no children or grandchildren! My highest joy, however, is all the dear saints. We are a big family with all ages. Even a few new ones added to the church will make the meetings new, fresh, uplifted, and enriched. If the &ldquo;older generation&rdquo; of saints were the only ones who met all year round, we will all be disappointed, but if every Lord&rsquo;s Day we have several new ones, our spirit will be uplifted. To bear fruit in this way is the normal living of the church life. We must all be built up in the living of the gospel.</p>
