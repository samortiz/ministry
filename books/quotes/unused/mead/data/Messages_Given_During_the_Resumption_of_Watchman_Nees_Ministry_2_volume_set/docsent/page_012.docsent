   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Having an Ambition to Obey God Absolutely</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians walk according to their own tastes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is like those who have a sweet tooth devouring sweet things when they see them and rejecting spicy things that are served to them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person can be fussy with food, but he cannot be a Christian in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A person can be a "pew-Christian," a "Sunday-going Christian," but such a one will never afford God the way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may say that you are willing and that you hope the Lord will help your weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God will surely not listen to such a prayer because by praying in this way you have opened a back door already; you have made provision for yourself to disobey already.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should have the ambition to say, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not need Your help.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as You give me a feeling, I will obey."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The gospel has been preached in Hong Kong for over a hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here are over a million people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But too few people are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even among us tonight, we have only one to two hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the reason for this slow increase?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a small thing for you to answer my question today, but how would you answer the Lord that day at the judgment seat?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no need to wait for that day; even today, it is hard for us to give an answer to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no need for those who do not obey their inner feelings to vindicate themselves; there is no need for them to tell God that they are serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many who have proclaimed themselves to be believers, and it is not necessary for you to tell others that you are zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if you truly give yourselves to the Lord, you will see many people saved through you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you want to love the Lord, love Him in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you want to love the world, love it all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A man can only be one person at a time; he cannot be two persons at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He cannot love the Lord and love the world at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some people are eight different persons all at one time; their hearts are in eight different places.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One place may be their children.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Another place may be their money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is better for these people to put their hearts in one place and to love God with a single heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>D. Being Simple, Not Analyzing,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>and Walking Step by Step</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>according to the Feelings of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to be a Christian, a person must be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As soon as a feeling comes, we should obey.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as another feeling comes, we should obey again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the Christian way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You do not need to worry if this or that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if you are wrong, you need not be afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as you feel peaceful in your heart, you can go on.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as you remain simple, and as long as you are for God and are pure toward Him, you do not need to analyze too much.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have to realize that sometimes God gives us uneasy feelings within; He also makes us uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever you feel uncomfortable about something, do not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you practice this, after a while, your emotions, desires, and thoughts will become one with God, and spontaneously God will fill you up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>E. Studying the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>to Allow God's Word to Check</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>the Feeling in Your Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the same time, you must study the Bible thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This allows the Holy Spirit to have a chance to enlighten you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible confirms our feelings and tells us whether they are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be a Christian, a person must not only walk according to the teachings of the Bible, but walk according to the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A weighty and proper Christian is one who reads the Bible, on the one hand, and walks according to the inner feelings, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you do not walk according to your feelings, you are merely a dead Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must all learn to take care of this crucial matter: to go along with the inner feeling.</S>
