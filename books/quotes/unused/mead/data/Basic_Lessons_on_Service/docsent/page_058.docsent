   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The meat of the cattle of the peace offering for thanksgiving is good for only one day v. 15 . It can last only one day because the motive of this offering is shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is presented out of the offerer's emotion, so it does not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our experience testifies of this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes we offer something to the Lord out of our emotions, but within a short time it disappears.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The peace offering for thanksgiving is something emotional, whereas the one for a vow is something of the will and is stronger and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to help the saints to realize that an emotional offering is good, but it does not last too long.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to go deeper to present a voluntary offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because He is the Lord and we are His redeemed, we should do something in a voluntary way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no emotion involved here, but something strongly motivated from our will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This offering can last for two days because it is stronger.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The entire congregation enjoys the meat of the cattle, but they do not have a share of the cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The condition for the entire congregation to enjoy, to participate in, the peace offering is that they must be clean.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First Corinthians 5 points out that today we are keeping the real Feast of Unleavened Bread.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to keep this feast without any leaven, that is, without any sinful things.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such ones have no share in the enjoyment of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This strongly indicates that today any saint who is still involved in sinful things cannot have the fellowship of the Lord's table.</S>
