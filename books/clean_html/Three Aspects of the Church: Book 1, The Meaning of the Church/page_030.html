<h2 class="head3">The Created Aspect<br />
and the Fallen Aspect of Man</h2>
<p>Boaz married Ruth, a Moabitess. The Moabites were the shameful descendants of Lot. Genesis 19:30 through 33 and 36 through 37 show that Moab was born through incest between Lot and his eldest daughter. This incident was shameful and improper. Hence, the Bible records that a Moabite was not to enter the congregation of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation, and that none of their descendants were to enter the congregation of Jehovah forever (Deut. 23:3). This was Ruth&rsquo;s background.</p>
<p>Originally, Ruth had nothing to do with God&rsquo;s blessing, was not able to enter the congregation of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation, and was forsaken and separated from God&rsquo;s holy people. However, Boaz redeemed Ruth because she belonged to Elimelech, a man of his same family (Ruth 2:1). Ruth was the wife of Elimelech&rsquo;s second son, Mahlon (1:1-4). This relationship provided a connection for redemption. Ruth was a Moabitess, but through her marriage to a man of the same family as Boaz, she was joined to his family and, thus, had the position and right to be redeemed by Boaz. If a Japanese girl, who originally had nothing to do with the Chinese, married a man from China, she would be legally associated with and considered to be of China. As a result, after the death of her Chinese husband, she would have the legal right to inherit her husband&rsquo;s possessions. Ruth&rsquo;s redemption was based on the fact that she had this type of association with someone of Boaz&rsquo;s family. Thus, she had the legal position to be redeemed by Boaz.</p>
<p>Boaz redeemed Ruth based on the Jewish law. If an Israelite took a wife and died without a son, his brother should take her as his wife and raise up a seed to him. If he did not have a brother, his nearest kinsman should take her as his wife. The firstborn of the woman would then be counted as the offspring of her deceased husband (Lev. 25:25; Deut. 25:5-6). This is the law that God ordained for the children of Israel, and based upon this law, Boaz redeemed Ruth.</p>
<p>The background of Ruth was shameful. This shameful background typifies our shameful background prior to redemption. Our origin was exactly the same as the descendants of Lot, the Moabites, who were not allowed to enter the congregation of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation. According to this aspect of our background, we absolutely do not have the position to receive redemption. Formerly Ruth had nothing to do with Boaz; in the same way, we had nothing to do with Christ. We had nothing to do with Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing, and God had no obligation to redeem us. Ruth&rsquo;s background speaks of the corrupted and fallen aspect of our being; God will not save this aspect of our being.</p>
<p>Our being, however, has another aspect; that is, we as descendants of Adam are of the same family as Christ. Christ became flesh and was a descendant of Adam. According to the aspect related to the fall, we are Moabites who have nothing to do with Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing, but according to the aspect of our being the descendants of Adam, we are related to Christ and are able to receive God&rsquo;s redemption. The principle of redemption is not to save the sinful aspect of man but to save the aspect of man that was created and later fell into sin. The Lord became a man, not a sinner. Thus, the Lord is joined to us only in the aspect of our created humanity, not in the aspect of our fallen humanity. The fallen aspect is related to Moab, but the created aspect is related to Ruth&rsquo;s husband, Boaz.</p>
<p>Romans 7 reveals that the old man, the created man, was our husband. Bible readers throughout the ages have had a controversy over Romans 7 regarding whether the husband mentioned there refers to the law or to the flesh. In a sense, the law and the flesh are inseparable. The law was given because of man&rsquo;s flesh. If there were no flesh, the law would not be needed. Ephesians 2 says that the cross abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances in the flesh, meaning that it abolished the flesh upon which the law of the commandments in ordinances was based. Hence, we cannot separate the law from the flesh; the law and the flesh are actually one. Some believe that the husband spoken of in Romans 7 refers to the law, while others consider him to be the flesh. However, according to the viewpoint of the entire Scripture, the husband in Romans 7 refers to the created yet fallen old man.</p>
<p>Our fallen aspect is typified by the Moabites, and our created aspect is typified by Ruth&rsquo;s husband. Ruth&rsquo;s husband being the kinsman of Boaz typifies that our created aspect is of the same family as Christ. Based on this aspect, we have the position to be redeemed. Christ can redeem us and must redeem us because we have a created aspect. As fallen Moabites, we have a husband according to creation.</p>
<p>If Ruth did not have an Israelite husband, who was of the same family as Boaz, she would have had nothing to do with Boaz, and Boaz would not have had the obligation, responsibility, right, and position to redeem her. Boaz had the right to redeem Ruth because she had married a husband from the same family as Boaz. This type reveals that Christ redeemed us because we fallen sinners, fallen Moabites, have a created husband, a created element in us. In terms of our created aspect, Christ and we are of the same family; Boaz and we are of the same family. Hence, we have the position to be redeemed, and He has the obligation to redeem us. He must redeem us, and we should be redeemed by Him.</p>
<p>We should never regard Ruth the Moabitess and her husband as two persons but as one person. By being one person with her husband, Ruth was related to Boaz; otherwise, Ruth the Moabitess would have had nothing to do with Boaz, and Boaz would not have had any obligation and right to do anything for Ruth. They would have had nothing to do with one another. However, because Ruth married a man from Judah and had become one with the people of Judah, she had the right to be redeemed, and Boaz had the obligation to redeem her. This signifies that without the created element, the created aspect, fallen people would have nothing to do with Christ.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2 says that it is not to angels that Christ gives help; instead, He gives help to the seed of Abraham (v. 16), to men with blood and flesh. Ruth was redeemed because of her husband, not because she was a Moabitess. In the fall the created aspect of Adam became the fallen aspect of &ldquo;Moab&rdquo;; thus, there is still a need for Christ to redeem the created aspect. Hence, Ruth&rsquo;s redemption was based upon her being of the same family as Boaz.</p>
<p>Our created aspect is the same as Christ&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same&rdquo; (v. 14). Because angels do not have blood and flesh, they and Christ are not of the same family. Thus, Christ does not have any obligation to save the angels, and the angels do not have the right to enjoy Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Only Adam&rsquo;s descendants, who are of the same family as Christ, have been given the right to enjoy His redemption, and He is obligated to redeem us.</p>
<p>Just as Rebekah had to be of the same family as Isaac, Ruth had to be of the same family as Boaz in order to be redeemed by him. This shows that Christ became a man so that we might become His relatives. Once Christ became a man, He had the obligation to redeem man so that man could have the right to receive and enjoy His redemption.</p>
