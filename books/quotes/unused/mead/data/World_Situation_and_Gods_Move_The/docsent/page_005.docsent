   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With the coming of the Reformation the Bible was released.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This, coupled with the free thinking that developed once Catholicism's hold on the mind was broken, led Christians to the discovery of many new truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seemed that everyone who discovered a new truth became the founder of a new denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There were a number of Brethren churches which began during this period of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Grace Brethren and the Mennonites were two of them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All these newly formed denominations were persecuted by both the Catholic Church and the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was true of the state churches even in northern Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These freethinking Christians were thus in peril for their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Moravian Brethren</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At this very time God raised up Count Zinzendorf, a wealthy German who owned a large estate in Saxony.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He invited the persecuted Christians to come and stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From many places they came, but mostly from Moravia.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With their varied denominational backgrounds, they were soon quarreling about the presbytery, baptism, and other doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Finally, Zinzendorf called the leaders together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He reminded them how they had come together as brothers to escape persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They must stop their dissenting ways, he said, and sign a contract to cease arguing and simply be one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This they agreed to do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After that they had the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There was a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, hundreds of the so-called Moravian Brethren went out to other lands, especially to the newly found land of America.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even today there are a number of Moravian Churches in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On one of these ships bound for America was John Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A great storm arose, causing the passengers to fear for their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wesley, a revivalist but not sure of his salvation, noticed a group of passengers praying together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result of his contact with these Moravian Brethren, Wesley eventually came into assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After a time in America, he returned to England and then went on to Saxony to spend time with the Moravians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Had he not been burdened for England, he would have liked to remain with them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was the time of the French Revolution.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those revolutionary ideas were gaining ground in England, and there was fear that the government itself might be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was through the preaching of John Wesley and George Whitefield, those powerful open-air evangelists, that the gospel prevailed over the revolutionary tendencies and England was spared.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>British society was changed as a result of their work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The practice of the church life by those with Count Zinzendorf marked a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was good, but it was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their light was limited, but we consider that theirs was the first practice of the church life in the Lord's recovery after the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Brethren</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>About a century later, in the 1820s, God raised up the Brethren in England, under the leadership of John Nelson Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Oh, the light that flooded in!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Luther had unlocked the Bible from prison, but it remained for Darby and his contemporaries to open it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even today the best theological seminaries follow the Brethren teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet, they would not take the Brethren way in the matter of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Brethren movement, according to an article by D. M. Panton, was stronger and more prevailing than the Reformation under Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To the world, however, it was unknown.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was because the early Brethren would have nothing to do with the worldly ways the Reformation had followed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Martin Luther gained the support of princes and other worldly rulers to advance the cause of the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Newspapers were printed for the first time in the 1500s; these were used to spread propaganda for the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Brethren had no publicity; everything about them was kept covered.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is hard to find a photograph, for example, of J. N. Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They did not have biographies nor autobiographies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A number among them who were lords and ladies renounced their titles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When Jamaica in the British West Indies suffered a ruinous storm during the last century, the British Brethren assemblies sent aid to the believers there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The amount they sent greatly surpassed what the British government provided.</S>
