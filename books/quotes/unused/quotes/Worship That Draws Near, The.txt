Some may feel that they have not done well during the previous week, that they have disobeyed God's word, or that they have backslidden
As a result of these feelings, a person can be frustrated from worshipping God and drawing near to Him in a spontaneous and sweet way
Many people think that they can worship God when they have some merit when they have performed good works or when they deserve Gods praise
Others think that because they have not performed well and have done many things that displease God, they cannot come to God to worship Him
Hebrews 10:19 says, 'Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus'
Good works, zeal, or spiritual experiences cannot qualify us to come before God or make us more worthy to draw near to Him
Some may say that God is too gracious in this way, but we must realize that it is through the blood that we are qualified to worship
If God were to forgive our sins carelessly and allow us to come before Him to worship Him carelessly, that would indeed be great grace
Everyone who comes before God must have the blood; everyone needs the cleansing of the blood before he can come before God
If anyone bases their worship on the works they have performed during the previous week, they do not know what worship means
They could not worship directly or even slaughter the goats and bulls themselves; they had to depend on the priests to do this for them
It is true that the Old Testament divides the worshippers into the congregation, the priests, and the high priest
Some have thought that a person receives forgiveness through the blood but that he worships and draws near to God through his works
Others think that they have not done well and therefore are not worthy to worship; they cannot sing and have no faith to pray
If you have to wait until you are able to do these things, you will wait until you are raptured before you can worship Him
