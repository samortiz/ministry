   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RICHES IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is Spirit, yet this God is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that the Son with the Father is realized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This Spirit eventually became the Spirit of Jesus Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before Christ was crucified and resurrected, such a Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It became such a Spirit only after Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Spirit, the third of the Godhead, is the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only God Himself but also all the riches of the Godhead are in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fact that this Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ indicates that Jesus and Christ are realized in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today our Jesus is realized in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, God, the Father, the Son, Jesus, and Christ are all realized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because Jesus is a man, humanity is also included in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since this Man has passed through crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, all these are now included in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, this wonderful Spirit has become intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the Spirit revealed in the Bible, the first aspect of the focus of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever God is, is in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Father, the Son, Jesus, Christ, humanity, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are all implied in this wonderful Spirit that has been intensified to become the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need such a full definition of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to accept the vision of this Spirit found in the Bible and then pray ourselves into the realization of this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because this Spirit is so rich and bountiful, Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason the supply of this Spirit is bountiful is that the Spirit includes God, the riches of the Father and the Son, the element of Jesus' humanity, and the element of Christ, the anointed One of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This Spirit also includes crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All this is found in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Spirit is not merely a power, but a person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This wonderful Spirit has been intensified sevenfold to become the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth Rev 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today the very Spirit we have received into us is such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May we all have a thorough and rich revelation of this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE DIVINE SPIRIT MINGLED WITH THE HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The divine Spirit is in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we have not only the divine Spirit in our spirit but also the mingling of the divine Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, the two spirits are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some are opposed to the concept of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who oppose this wonder how it is possible for the divine Spirit to be mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the divine Spirit and the human spirit can be one spirit, then why can they not be mingled?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without mingling, how could the two spirits become one?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord that these two spirits have been mingled into one spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reason that in the verses concerning our walk in the spirit, it is difficult for the translators to determine whether to render pneuma as "Spirit" or as "spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, to walk according to the Spirit means to walk according to both the divine Spirit and the human spirit, according to the two spirits mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The two spirits are mingled not in the heavens nor outside of us but within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the focus of the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever God intends to do or accomplish is related to this focus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would have certain basic spiritual experiences, we must have a clear understanding that the focus of God's economy is the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>LIVING ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who live according to the flesh and the lusts of the flesh are the lowest type of people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who live according to the mind and the will are somewhat higher.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Humanly speaking, those who live according to the conscience which is part of man's spirit, may be considered the highest type of people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we are even higher than this, for we live not only according to the conscience but according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we are on the highest level.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here, on this level, we have the Christian life and also the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the focus of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should walk according to this, that is, according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should be a person in such a spirit as was the apostle John in Revelation 1:10 .</S>
