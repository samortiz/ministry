[1]  THE OUTLINE Principles concerning the organization of the church: Being according to life.
[2]  CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:24, 27-30; Eph 2:20-22 THE BIBLICAL VIEW CONCERNING
[3]  Strictly speaking, the Bible does not use the phrase the organization of the church .
[4]  This is because the church is not actually an organization.
[5]  Nonetheless, due to the limitation of human understanding, it is necessary to use the term organization so that we can properly explain the church.
[6]  Hence, according to spiritual fact, the church is not an organization, yet for the purpose of explanation and clarification, it seems necessary to use the term organization.
[7]  Not only does the Bible say that the church is the Body; it also says that the church is a household, a temple of God, and the dwelling place of God 2:19-22 .
[8]  For the past two thousand years, Satan has done two kinds of work in regard to the organization of the church.
[9]  On one hand, he replaces what is God-made with what is man-made, producing a well-ordered and hierarchical organization.
[10]  More than twenty years ago, when we were still young and had only recently been raised up by the Lord, we thought, due to the deep influence of Christianity, that all the saved ones were equal before God and that there was no need for any human arrangement or organization.
[11]  Some saints, in terms of their knowledge of God and what they have received from God and been entrusted with by God, are not that great; nevertheless, we cannot deny that each one has a particular function.
[12]  Whether we speak of the church as the Body or as a house, both are the issue of growth.
[13]  The organization of the church issues from the growth in life, and the arrangement in the organization is altogether a matter of the authority of God.
[14]  In the church the authority of God is the Holy Spirit.
[15]  When a brother is appointed to be an elder, those appointing him should ask, Is the authority of the Holy Spirit in this brother?
[16]  I am not afraid of making a wrong arrangement; I am afraid that the arrangement might come out of my authority and not out of God s authority.
[17]  As those who submit to authority, the saints also need to check whether they are submitting to man s authority or God s authority.
[18]  Although there is such a thing as place or position in the organization of the church, our emphasis should be function, not position.
[19]  The organization of the church must be according to life and according to the authority of God; moreover, it must also be according to function and ministry.
[20]  The distinction between function and ministry is that function is general, whereas ministry is specific.
[21]  For a person to have a ministry in the church requires that he be deep in the Lord, having passed through a great deal of God s constituting work, and having been dealt with by God to a great extent.
[22]  What a beautiful sight it would be if all the brothers who are elders would grow in life, be subject to the authority of the Holy Spirit, bear the mark of having been passed through and dealt with by God, allow the cross and Christ s life to deal with and work on their character, have the authority of God, function, and bear their responsibility as elders.
[23]  We realize that this matter is solemn because we have seen the danger; that is, we have seen that if we are not cautious and serious in taking care of this matter, we will become a dead organization in which there is no life of God, no authority of the Holy Spirit, no function that is according to the Lord s dealing, and no ministry that has been constituted of the Holy Spirit.
[24]  When we speak of coordination and service in the church, we cannot avoid using the term organization.
[25]  When the responsible brothers are arranging the services in the church, such as assigning a brother to be responsible in a district, a sister to be a deaconess, or a saint to be responsible for a specific service, they must be serious before the Lord and say to Him, Lord, the authority is in Your hand.
[26]  All the brothers and sisters who are arranged to serve should not consider that since it is the arrangement of the elders, they should simply obey.
[27]  This is to submit to the authority of man, not of God.
[28]  We are not submitting to the authority of man but to Christ, the Head of the church, recognizing His authority in the church.
[29]  However, when we submit to the elderly brothers and the elders based on God having the authority and Christ being the Head of the church, our submission to them is the result of our submission to the authority of the Head.
[30]  The young brothers and sisters may be too young in the Lord to be in a position of representing authority, but if they truly know the authority of the Head and submit to those who represent authority, they will cause others to sense Christ the Head in them.
[31]  If Paul had spoken in this way, it would have indicated that he was a person who knew neither God s life nor God s authority and had neglected function and ministry.
[32]  If the organization of a church is according to life, the authority of God, function, and ministry, and has a three-dimensional order, the church will be strong and functioning.
[33]  The previous chapters cover five points related to the organization of the church.
[34]  Having seen these five basic points clearly, we now come to the practice related to the organization of the church.
[35]  Some people think that it is sufficient to be spiritual and that there is no need to study in-depth the outward matters such as the organization of the church.
[36]  Even though the Bible does not contain a charter for the organization of the church, it does contain the fact of the organization of the church.
[37]  The basic constituents of the church are people who have the life of God, that is, who are God mingled with man and man mingled with God.
[38]  If there is only man, there is no church, and if there is only God, there is also no church.
[39]  In order to know God, a person must know the church, and in order to know man, a proper man, he must also know the church.
[40]  THE UNIVERSAL AND LOCAL ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH The Definition of These Two Aspects
[41]  The basic constituent of the church is a matter of the mingling of God and man, but the existence and expression of the church are related to its universal and local aspects.
[42]  In itself the church is not local but universal.
[43]  In the universe there is only one church, just as there is only one Christ.
[44]  The church has both a universal and a local aspect, and its organization also has a universal and a local aspect.
[45]  In terms of organization, the apostles are related to the universal church.
[46]  The basic constituents of both the universal church and the local churches are the same; that is, in both its universal and local aspects the church is constituted of people who have the life of Christ.
[47]  In the organization of the church there is a distinction between office and gift.
[48]  An office is a matter of authority, whereas a gift is a matter of spirituality.
[49]  The problems that the church has encountered throughout the centuries have been due to a lack of either spirituality or authority; that is, there have been problems in regard to either the gifts or the offices.
[50]  In other words, we want to find out why God desires that there be organization in the church.
[51]  Since the authority of the apostles comes from the Head, the source of authority in the organization of the church is surely the Head.
[52]  The Corinthians questioned the apostleship of Paul, and he responded by saying, If to others I am not an apostle, yet surely I am to you; for you in the Lord are the seal of my apostleship 9:2 .
[53]  He asked them, Are you not my work in the Lord? v. 1 . This means that if he were not an apostle, how could the Corinthians have become believers? If he were not their father, how could there be believers in Corinth? The believers in Corinth were the seal of Paul s apostleship, that is, of his being a father.
[54]  If a person preaches the gospel to the natives of Taiwan, labors for the Lord among them, saves and raises up some to serve God, and establishes a church, undoubtedly he is an apostle to these ones.
[55]  Concerning what we do, we need to ask ourselves whether the work is ours or the Lord s, and whether it is we who want to do it or the Lord who wants us to do it.
[56]  THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH 3 Proving an Apostle
[57]  The most difficult matter in regard to the organization of the church is the offices.
[58]  If we acknowledge that he is a worker sent by the Lord, that he is of the Lord, and that his work is according to the Lord s desire, we cannot deny that he has authority.
[59]  Those Who Are under the Work of an Apostle
[60]  The basic principle is that the Lord is the unique source of everything.
[61]  An apostle is one who is sent by the Lord to do a work.
[62]  Since he is sent by the Lord to do a work, he surely has received authority from the Lord.
[63]  Hence, if we are under a person s work, accept his work, and receive benefit from his work, we must submit to the authority that he has been given to carry out the work.
[64]  If we say that we are apostles, is it because we have a high opinion of ourselves and want to assume a position to rule over others, or is it because the Lord has sent us and given us the authority to do the work that He desires us to do?
[65]  In summary, an apostle is not appointed by man; rather, he is acknowledged by man.
[66]  However, those who acknowledge an apostle do not become an authority to the apostle; rather, they submit to the apostle s authority.
[67]  An apostle is one who absolutely submits himself to God and who receives his work and commission from the Lord.
[68]  For the work to be normal and the church to be strong, those sent by the Lord must be dealt with by the Lord, and those who receive the work must learn certain lessons before the Lord.
[69]  If we deny the authority of God in one of God s servants, we should utterly reject that person s work.
[70]  If God s children are afraid to receive the authority of one of God s servants because they are afraid of being ensnared and controlled by someone who assumes to have authority, they should examine or test that person.
[71]  THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH 4 A SUPPLEMENTARY WORD
[72]  In the organization of the church there is the need for both gifts and offices.
[73]  Most of the problems that have arisen throughout the ages in regard to the organization of the church are related to offices, not gifts.
[74]  God carries out the appointment of elders and deacons in this way so that His authority in the church will not suffer loss, and there will be no confusion in the church.
[75]  THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH 5 Elders and Deacons Those Who Appoint Elders
[76]  A person fulfills his office in the church by life and gifts, not by authority.
[77]  The authority of the apostles is so definite that if an elder sins and the church is not able to solve the problem, the church should bring the accusation against the sinning elder to an apostle 1 Tim 5:19 , in the same manner as if they were going to court.
[78]  In the church, however, the appointment of elders is not in the hands of the saints but in the hands of God or, we can say, in the hands of the apostles who were appointed by the Head.
[79]  of the Elders and Deacons Submitting to the Authority of the Holy Spirit
[80]  There are several high spiritual requirements related to the offices in the church.
[81]  If he is not in the Holy Spirit, even if he were the top apostle, he should not appoint elders.
[82]  In making an appointment, an apostle should not consider a person s position, reputation, ability, or wealth; instead, he should consider whether or not this person submits to the authority of the Head, that is, the authority of the Holy Spirit.
[83]  A person may be qualified to be an elder in a small local church, one that is newly raised up, but he may not be qualified to be an elder in a larger church, one that has more experience in life.
[84]  In the appointing of elders, the two crucial matters to consider are the matters of authority and life.
[85]  Once these two matters are clear, there can be an additional consideration, that is, how much function a brother has.
[86]  If two persons are similar in their submission to authority and in their condition of life, yet one has a greater function than the other, then the one with the greater function should be appointed.
[87]  In the appointment of elders one should pay attention to function, but function is not a crucial matter.
[88]  Because the elders submit to authority, they are qualified to represent authority in the church.
[89]  If those who appoint elders, those who are appointed elders, and those who receive the elders are all in the Holy Spirit, others will see God s authority, God s government, in the church, and there will be a free way for the authority of the Head to be realized in the church.
[90]  Romans 6:23, which uses the word gift, says, The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[91]  In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said, By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
[92]  If we compare John 10, 14, 15, and 16 to chapter 1, we will see that God Himself is grace and that grace is the life of God, the Holy Spirit of God.
[93]  Two Verses That Speak of the Relationship between Gifts and Grace
[94]  In the New Testament two verses speak of the relationship between gifts and grace.
[95]  The first verse is Ephesians 4:7, which says, To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
[96]  Gifts are given according to and based upon the grace within.
[97]  After a person has a gift, God needs to continue to supply that person with grace.
[98]  If a person s gift is great, God will supply him continually with a great amount of grace.
[99]  We cannot speak of the organization of the church apart from God s authority and God s grace.
[100]  All that is left is a social group, a societal organization, not the genuine church with a proper organization.
[101]  When we carry out our offices in the church, we must ask ourselves whether or not we are submitting to God s authority and whether or not we are living in fellowship with God.
[102]  If we do not submit to God or live in fellowship with God, whatever we do will be worthless, even if it is scriptural.
[103]  In contrast, if we submit to God s authority and experience His grace, the condition among us will be according to the intrinsic principles of the Bible, even if our knowledge of the Bible is inadequate.
[104]  In contrast, if we do not submit to God s authority or experience God s grace but are merely according to the principle of the letter in the Bible, sooner or later we will have disputes, and problems will arise among us.
[105]  THAT REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION THE OUTLINE There being no organizational unification among the churches: The examples in the Bible.
[106]  He took care of the church in Ephesus, the church in Antioch, the church in Corinth, and the churches in many other places; nevertheless, there is no record of unification among the churches under his care.
[107]  The Lord has truly been merciful to us regarding the matter of finances, and by His mercy our finances are not organizationally unified.
[108]  No one can tell us how much is received in offerings each month from all the churches.
[109]  Although we may see a monthly financial report from a church, we have no way of knowing the amount enclosed in the envelopes that are designated for individuals and the amount given directly to the needy saints.
[110]  Initially, we did not have this concept; however, it is possible that a kind of mixture has been brought into the church, that is, the concept that a certain local church is the center.
[111]  If any person or local church among us gives people the wrong impression, leading them to believe that he or the church where he meets is the center that controls everything, this is absolutely wrong.
[112]  Strictly speaking, the church should not have a unification of administration and practice; however, it is dangerous to overemphasize this to the point that there is no oneness.
[113]  In the past few years, from 1952 until today, we have indeed had God s presence in the matter of serving full time.
[114]  Many brothers and sisters have received the Lord s wondrous grace and brought great blessing to the church.
[115]  From the beginning, based on the light that God has given us, we have seen that every saved one, regardless of his occupation, should serve the Lord.
[116]  Not only apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers should serve God, but even a member who has a small gift should serve God.
[117]  Everyone who serves the Lord has to learn how to do things earnestly.
[118]  TO FULL-TIME SERVICE 2 GIVING ALL THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
[119]  Moreover, we should not take the presence of the full-time serving ones as a reason to lessen the responsibility of or reduce the opportunity for other brothers and sisters to serve.
[120]  I hope that all the churches will be more proper before the Lord in the matter of material offerings.
[121]  Some of the churches in various localities have been doing well in this matter, and we thank God for this from the bottom of our heart.
[122]  Some brothers and sisters have also been quite faithful toward the Lord in the matter of material offerings.
[123]  Today I must say a frank word: Since we all love the Lord and serve the Lord together, and we agree that serving full time is the proper way to render much supply to the churches, we should not put aside or ignore the daily needs of the full-time serving ones.
[124]  I do not want to speak on my behalf, but I must speak on behalf of the young full-time serving ones and the Lord s church so that the church would be strengthened in this matter.
[125]  In principle, a person s character determines whether he will be successful and effective in his work or activities.
[126]  Hence, as we learn to serve the Lord, we need to have much fellowship with the Lord and look to Him for His mercy and grace.
[127]  If we have seen the types and the plan concerning the church, we will have a clear understanding of the church.
[128]  In other words, the church is the joining of God to man and man to God.
[129]  Much of what we are and have is still natural, and very little is in resurrection.
[130]  This is because the shining in us is not sufficiently strong.
[131]  In our practical experience we seldom condemn, reject, or put aside what is of us, that is, what we originally are and have by birth.
[132]  THE CHURCH BEING SPIRITUAL Resurrection and the Holy Spirit Being Inseparable
[133]  Everyone who has experienced resurrection and the Holy Spirit knows that resurrection and the Holy Spirit cannot be separated.
[134]  In incarnation God became a man, the Lord Jesus, and in resurrection the Lord Jesus became a life-giving Spirit.
[135]  The church is in resurrection, and it is spiritual and heavenly.
[136]  Ephesians 1 and 2 clearly show that the church is seated together with Christ in the heavenlies 2:6 and that all the blessings that God has bestowed upon the church are spiritual blessings in the heavenlies 1:3 .
[137]  According to the position of the church and the blessings that the church has received, the church is truly in a heavenly realm.
[138]  According to place, the church is still on earth and not in heaven, but according to its nature, the church has been brought into the heavenly realm through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
[139]  The main significance of the church being heavenly is that it is under God s authority.
[140]  The church is heavenly not because it does not have a board of directors, does not elect elders by voting, and does not collect donations.
[141]  Neither is it heavenly because it has a group of elders who have been appointed by apostles and who manage church affairs nor because it puts out an offering box during the meeting for the saints to give willingly.
[142]  Whether or not a church is heavenly is determined not by whether things are done one way or another or by whether they are done in a way that is scriptural or unscriptural but by whether they are carried out in submission to God s authority.
[143]  CHAPTER SEVEN RECEIVING PEOPLE IN THE CHURCHES AN EXPLANATION OF THE FACT AND THE PRINCIPLE
[144]  We now come to the question concerning our receiving of people in the churches, that is, how to determine whether to baptize someone.
[145]  This matter is clear to us in principle, but we still need to carefully consider its practical aspect.
[146]  We should not baptize those who receive the Lord Jesus nominally but do not receive God s life and have no inward relationship with the Lord.
[147]  In our practice, however, we have baptized some who we thought were saved but who did not actually have a relationship with the Lord or have God s life within them.
[148]  What portion of salvation do we obtain through believing?
[149]  NEEDING TO TOUCH A PERSON S INNER FEELING WHEN RECEIVING HIM
[150]  Like every other spiritual matter, the receiving of people is not so simple.
[151]  When we receive people, the most crucial matter is to sense their inner feeling.
[152]  The Lord burdened us to spend some specific time to look to Him.
[153]  If our body is able to make it, we will kneel down before the Lord and fast and pray for three mornings.
[154]  We must ask the Lord for His blessing and grace that the church would be well pleasing to Him on the earth, that whatever should be used would be used by Him, that whatever should be blessed would receive His blessing, that whatever should be released for the Lord s gospel would be released, that those who should fight for the Lord would fight for Him absolutely, and that those who should testify for the Lord would testify for Him faithfully.
[155]  The Lord has been working among us and leading us throughout the years.
[156]  Now many brothers and sisters have been brought to the point where they must pass through a crisis; that is, there is a problem within them that must be resolved.
[157]  By the Lord s mercy, some saints have a fearful heart before the Lord.
[158]  A person who is unwilling to submit to the Lord s shining cannot be helped by anyone.
[159]  We may pray for him, speak to him, or fellowship with him, but time after time we will realize that his problem remains.
