   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE MAJOR GROUPS WITHIN CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During the process in which the church became the Roman Catholic Church, strong distinctions developed among the various groups within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The transmutation of the organization of the church began from when Bishop Clement suggested that the system of the Jewish priesthood be brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once the transmutation started, those in the church who lived before the Lord began to differ from the majority in their thought.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who went along with the transmutation gained more and more power, while those who stood against the transmutation became small and hidden before God; they lived before God, serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who accepted the transmuted organization of the church organized themselves into the catholic church in approximately A.D. 250, when Cyprian was bishop of Carthage in northern Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The catholic church united all the churches in the world, and the word catholic is still used by the Roman Catholic Church to indicate that the entire world is unified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PURE IN HEART</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people who lived before the Lord separated themselves from the catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although there were sects within the church, there were no major divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, after the catholic church was formed, the sectarianism within the church was clearly manifested, and two lines developed within Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The catholic church, because of its organization and methods, was easily utilized by the Roman government.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the catholic church continually gained status and power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In contrast, those who stood apart from the catholic church had a pure heart for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They rejected the world to follow the Lord in a simple way and to live a pure life before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their stand for the Lord distinguished them not only from those in the catholic church but also from most people in society; therefore, these pure-hearted believers were not welcomed by human society, and history records very little concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These hidden people lived before the Lord, did not announce themselves to outsiders, and did not live according to the fashion of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This made them unwelcome in society, and few people paid attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Secular historians naturally ignored them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because most early church historians were members of the Roman Catholic Church, they did not mention those who served the Lord out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Roman Catholic Church tried to destroy any books written by those who were pure in heart; therefore, few records have been left to us by the pure-hearted ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, from the little we have, it is clear that they testified boldly for the Lord even though the Roman Catholic Church frustrated and persecuted them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After that there were two major groups within Christianity the high-class, powerful Roman Catholic Church and the lowly, hidden, pure-hearted believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Constantine came to power, he united Christianity with the Roman government.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This union was with the so-called catholic church; at that time no other organization or group could match the splendor and power of the catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later, even the emperors had to kneel before the archbishops and kiss their hands in a gesture of respect and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows that the catholic church was highly respected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In such a situation the believers who were pure in heart were troubled both by the Roman government and the catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In general, the Roman government at that time was not opposed to Christianity; on the contrary, it welcomed Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the Roman government troubled the pure-hearted Christians because it was united with the catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the Roman government could influence the catholic church, the catholic church could also influence the government.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the catholic church was against the pure-hearted believers, the Roman government stood with the catholic church and followed it to oppose them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, although the Roman government accepted Christianity, which it had formerly opposed, its acceptance was conditional.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They welcomed the Christians who were in the catholic church but not those who were pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the two groups of Christians were clearly divided.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One group was the unified catholic church with its rigid organizational system, and the other group consisted of scattered believers without any organization, those who were pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This separation was primarily in the matter of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the organization of the catholic church, the patriarchs were in the highest position.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The position of the pope developed out of the patriarchal system.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Originally, there were five patriarchs, one in Rome in the West and four in the East in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The four patriarchs in the East took the patriarch of Constantinople as their head; each patriarch governed an administrative district that was composed of several provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The patriarch of Rome had many clergy under him; these clergymen were called cardinals and had the authority to elect the patriarch.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These cardinals later became the seven cardinal bishops in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Each patriarch had several archbishops under him; each archbishop governed an archdiocese.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Each diocese had a governing bishop, and in the bishop s absence, the monsignors stood in for him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The monsignors were chief elders who would chair the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Under the monsignors were the deacons, the lowest ones in the hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This was the organization of the catholic church that tried to unify all the churches on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the pure-hearted believers did not want a unification of the whole earth, and they did not accept the hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, they began to have their own separate meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The catholic church excommunicated the pure-hearted believers, accusing them of preaching heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From then on, there were two clear lines among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One line was organized and visible, enjoying a high status in the world; the other line was hidden, without any organization, having been rejected by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These two lines have continued to this day.</S>
