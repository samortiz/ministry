   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Full of Gospel Messages, Gospel Parables,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Gospel Cases</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Gospel of Luke contains many gospel messages, gospel parables, and gospel cases.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The gospel messages are found in 4:16-21; 7:41-43; 12:14-21; and 13:2-5; the gospel parables, in 10:30-37; 14:16-24; 15:3-32; and 18:9-14; and the gospel cases, in 7:36-50; 13:10-17; 16:19-31; 19:1-10; and 23:39-43.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>None of these messages, parables, or cases is recorded in the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these gospel messages, parables, and cases are recorded uniquely in Luke s narration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we spend time to consider these gospel messages, gospel parables, and gospel cases, we shall be helped in our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Written to Mankind in General</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Gospel of Luke is written to mankind in general.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead of being written to a particular kind of people, it is written to the entire human race.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Luke 2:10 indicates this: And the angel said to them: Do not fear, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which will be to all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Bearing a Gentile Characteristic</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather Than a Jewish One</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Gospel of Luke bears a Gentile characteristic rather than a Jewish one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One strong indication of this is 4:25-27, where the Lord refers first to the widow of Sidon and then to Naaman the Syrian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Sequence of Morality,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not of Historical Events</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead of being written according to the sequence of historical events, the Gospel of Luke is written according to the sequence of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, many readers of the New Testament do not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we read the Gospel of Luke, we shall find certain cases that are recorded in a sequence different from that in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason for this is that Mark was written according to the sequence of historical events.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But Luke narrates the stories in his Gospel according to the sequence of morality, not of history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this respect Luke is similar to Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matthew s sequence is the sequence of doctrine concerning the kingdom, and Luke s sequence is the sequence of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore neither Luke nor Matthew was written according to the sequence of historical events.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A particular case that illustrates the fact that the Gospel of Luke was written according to the sequence of morality is that of Judas leaving the Passover feast.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the Gospel of Mark, Judas did not participate in the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Luke seems to indicate that Judas was present for the Lord s supper and left afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There has been discussion among Bible students regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to see the different views presented in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Matthew we have the view of doctrine; in Mark, the view of historical events; and in Luke, the view of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Gospel of Luke emphasizes the morality of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My burden in this message is to point out that the Man-Savior and His salvation are in the highest standard of morality.</S>
