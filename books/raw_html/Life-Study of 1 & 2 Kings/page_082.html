<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE REIGN OF ZECHARIAH OVER ISRAEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Reigning for Six Months</H2><P>Zechariah began to reign in Samaria in the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah and reigned for six months (v. 8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Doing What Was Evil in the Sight of Jehovah</H2><P>Zechariah did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he caused Israel to sin (v. 9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Shallum Conspiring against Him</H2><P>Shallum conspired against Zechariah, struck him down before the people, and reigned in his place. This was in fulfillment of God's word spoken to his forefather Jehu that, because of his faithfulness to God, his sons would sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation (vv. 10-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE REIGN OF SHALLUM OVER ISRAEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Reigning for One Month in Samaria</H2><P>Shallum reigned for one month in Samaria, in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah (Azariah) king of Judah (v. 13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Murdered by Menahem</H2><P>Menahem came up from Tirzah, murdered Shallum, and usurped his throne (vv. 14-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE REIGN OF MENAHEM OVER ISRAEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Capturing Tiphsah and Its Borders</H2><P>Because those in Tiphsah did not open to him, Menahem captured Tiphsah and its borders, slaughtered all the people, and ripped open the pregnant women (v. 16). It is hard to explain why, having the law of God, he could be so evil and unrestrained.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Reigning for Ten Years in Samaria</H2><P>Menahem began to reign over Israel from the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah and reigned for ten years in Samaria (v. 17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Doing What Was Evil in the Sight of Jehovah<br>throughout All His Days</H2><P>Menahem did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah. Throughout all his days he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he caused Israel to sin (v. 18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Pul King of Assyria Coming against the Land</H2><P>Pul king of Assyria came against the land, and Menahem gave him quite an amount of money exacted from Israel, from all the great men of wealth. Then the king of Assyria returned and departed from the land (vv. 19-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Sleeping with His Fathers</H2><P>Menahem slept with his fathers and was succeeded by Pekahiah his son (vv. 21-22).</P>
