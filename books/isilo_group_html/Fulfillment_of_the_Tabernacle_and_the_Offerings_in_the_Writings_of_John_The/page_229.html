In these messages we have considered the signs in the twenty-one chapters of this Gospel. In the two foregoing messages on chapter twenty-one, we pointed out that this chapter is actually an aggregate sign, for everything in it is part of a composite sign.<p>We have seen that in this chapter the Lord reminded Peter of his calling and Peter&#8217;s denial and then restored him and charged him to feed His sheep. We have also seen that according to the Lord&#8217;s word in 21:18-22, some believers will die to glorify God, and others will live until His coming. Furthermore, we pointed out that chapters twenty and twenty-one cover a broad span, a span that begins with the discovery of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection and ends with His coming back. Between these two events are all the matters related to the Christian life. In this concluding message let us consider some other important matters revealed in chapter twenty-one of the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE PRESENCE</h2><p>If we study this chapter carefully, we shall see an apparent contradiction in the Lord&#8217;s words recorded here. On the one hand, the Lord said to Peter, &#8220;Follow Me&#8221; (vv. 19, 22). On the other hand, the Lord referred to His coming back (vv. 22-23). If I had been Peter, I might have said to the Lord, &#8220;Lord Jesus, why do You talk about Your coming? Does this mean that You intend to leave us?&#8221;<p>Let us suppose that Peter asked such a question and that the Lord Jesus gave the following answer: &#8220;Yes, I shall leave you for hundreds of years. Then after those centuries have passed, I shall come back.&#8221; If the Lord had given such an answer and if I had been Peter, I would have said, &#8220;Lord, if You will be absent from us, why do You ask me to follow You? How can I follow You if You leave us?&#8221;<p>Apparently the Lord&#8217;s words concerning following Him and concerning His coming are contradictory. In order for us to follow the Lord, it is necessary that He be present with us. But in order for Him to come back, it is necessary that He go away from us. How can we reconcile these things?<p>The Lord was present with the disciples. How, then, could He say, &#8220;Until I come&#8221;? Since He was present with them, He did not need to come. If the Lord meant that He would leave the disciples and later come back to them, how could He say, &#8220;Follow Me&#8221;? How could the disciples follow Him if He was not present with them? The answer to all these questions is the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence. According to His visible presence, He would leave and come back later. But according to His invisible presence, He would be with them all the time. On the one hand, He would be with them; on the other hand, He would be away from them. Therefore, they could both follow Him and wait for His coming back.<p>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus remained with the disciples for forty days (Acts 1:3-4) in order to train them to realize, practice, and live by His invisible presence. In verse 23 the Lord indicates that some of His believers will follow Him to death for the glory of God and that some will live until He comes.<p>According to the Lord&#8217;s visible presence, He is away from us. At the time of His coming back, the Lord&#8217;s visible presence will be recovered. In the meantime, according to His invisible presence He is with us. Because the Lord was in Peter, Peter could follow Him. This means that he could follow the Lord as the One who dwelt in him.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_228.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_230.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 229</div><br></body></html>
