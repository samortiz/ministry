   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-FOUR OVERFLOWING TO SPEAK Scripture Reading: Eph 5:18b-19; 1 Cor 14:1, 5, 23-24, 31-32</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 5:18 Paul charges us to be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As members of the Body of Christ, we need to be filled in our spirit unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are filled in spirit, that with which we are filled will overflow from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 19 refers to this overflow: Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not overflow by meditating or by sitting silently in the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the contrary, we overflow by speaking to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are filled in spirit unto all the fullness of God, we shall spontaneously speak to one another concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Speaking, therefore, is the way to overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A SPEAKING GOD AND A SPEAKING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christians must be a speaking people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not be dumb, or silent, for the God we worship is the speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Idols, on the contrary, do not speak; they are dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1 Corinthians 12:2 Paul mentions dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because idols cannot speak, those who worship idols are also dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A dumb god needs dumb worshippers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you visit a country where there is the practice of idol worship, you can see that idol worshippers worship their gods in a dumb way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But our God is not dumb; He is the speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, those who worship Him must also speak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, many who attend the so-called services in Christianity do not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, they worship the Lord in a dumb way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is our situation in the meetings of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Are we silent, or are we bubbling over with words about the Christ we have experienced in our daily life?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the meetings we should praise the Lord and speak of what He is to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians realize that their religious services should not be altogether silent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, they arrange to have soloists, quartets, and choirs to provide music.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They also may hire outstanding preachers to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, most of the people sit silently in the pews, and, for the most part, are dumb worshippers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The very architecture of many places of Christian worship is conducive to silence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, many spontaneously become quiet when they enter Catholic cathedrals.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The steep roof, the dimly-lighted atmosphere, and the stained glass windows all encourage dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some worshippers may burn candles before images or pray in front of statues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How devilish!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In principle, this is the same as the idol worship practiced in pagan countries.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Much of Christianity has been permeated by the concept of silent worship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In effect, many who attend the Christian services are dumb worshippers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since our God is a speaking God, we as His worshippers must also speak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At times, we should even make a joyful noise to the Lord, as we are charged to do in Psalm 100:1.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a number of other verses we are told to do the same thing Psa 66:1; 81:1; 95:2; 98:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Often when we come together we should make joyful noise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we speak to one another of our experiences of Christ, we should not wait for some kind of formal beginning of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To do this is to remain under the influence of traditional Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have been set free from tradition, we shall speak spontaneously as we come together in the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some may even begin to speak on the way to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The meetings need to be filled with speaking concerning the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ephesians 5:19 also refers to singing and psalming to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such singing and psalming are not only the overflow of being filled in spirit, but also the way to be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we are filled in our spirit unto all the fullness of God, the first thing we shall do is speak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we shall sing and psalm with our heart to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many pride themselves on being scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I wonder, however, if they are scriptural according to 5:19.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This verse, found in a book that deals with the church, tells us that after we have been filled in our spirit unto all the fullness of God, we need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many who regard themselves as scriptural are scriptural only in a traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are not scriptural according to Paul s word in verse 19.</S>
