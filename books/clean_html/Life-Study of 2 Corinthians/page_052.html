<h2 class="head1">INSCRIBING CHRIST INTO THE SAINTS</h2><p>Paul also knew how to use the divine typewriter to write Christ on others. Whenever he was with the saints, he would write Christ upon them. Paul knew Christ in a detailed way. He also knew how to write living letters of Christ. If Paul were to speak with you for a period of time, a certain amount of Christ, perhaps a paragraph, would be written on your heart.</p><p>In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul uses the word &ldquo;inscribe&rdquo; to portray the way he wrote living letters of Christ. His writing did not merely write Christ on the saints; it inscribed Christ into them. In my ministry I also endeavor to follow Paul to inscribe Christ into the saints. It is not my desire merely to pass on doctrine. I do not even like to talk about being one spirit with the Lord simply as a doctrine. Rather, I care for the writing of Christ in life. Then the saints will receive not only the knowledge of doctrine, but the actual inscribing of Christ in their hearts.</p><p>Suppose a brother learns the doctrine that he is one spirit with the Lord. But this doctrine may not help him in his relationship with his wife. However, if a brother has Christ inscribed into him, he will experience being one spirit with the Lord in his married life. This is a proof that he has been helped by the ministry that inscribes Christ into his being.</p><p>Paul, a pattern of living Christ for the church, was made competent, sufficient, qualified, to write living letters. His qualification was of Christ and of all that Christ is. In Paul&rsquo;s spiritual writings, Christ was every letter, word, sentence, paragraph, and chapter.</p><p>This inscribing of Christ into others is a deeper aspect of living Christ for the church.</p><p>My concern is not only for living Christ, but also for inscribing Christ into the saints. This inscribing of Christ into others is not for my work; it is for the church so that God&rsquo;s administration may be carried out and His eternal purpose may be fulfilled.</p><p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has a very promising future. The future is bright because Christ is all the letters of the heavenly alphabet. I believe that in the years to come the Lord will use many of the saints to inscribe Christ into others. These saints will not preach the gospel merely in a doctrinal way; they will write Christ into the inner being of others. Those who hear such a preaching of the gospel may not remember all the doctrinal points, but they will not be able to erase the Christ who has been written into them.</p><p>We also may forget many of the messages we have heard. Nevertheless, Christ has been inscribed into us, and He remains in our being. Even if you rebel against the Lord, you will not be able to remove what has been inscribed of Christ into you. Some have written to me saying that they are not able to forget the Christ I ministered to them. Even though they do not agree with me in certain matters, they still appreciate my ministering Christ to them. This proves that we cannot erase the Christ who has been inscribed into our being.</p><p>Religion is a matter of mere doctrine, not of the experience of Christ. Many are still arguing over doctrines. But in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we care for Christ in a deep way, not in a superficial way. We want to go deeper than the feathers and skin to touch the meat of Christ, to experience Christ as the deep things of God to be our portion.</p><p>I came to this country with a positive burden to write Christ into others. Sinners are not the only ones who need to have Christ written on them. Even pastors, theologians, and professors need more of Christ written into their being. Some have spent a great deal of time to gain academic knowledge, but they do not have much of Christ written into them. Some have a thorough knowledge of the Greek language; however, they do not experience Christ as all the letters of the heavenly alphabet.</p><h2 class="head1">LETTERS OF CHRIST READ BY OTHERS</h2><p>On the one hand, we should seek to write Christ on others; on the other hand, we are living letters of Christ, living epistles, and others can read the Christ who has been inscribed into us. Young people, when you visit your parents, be assured that they are reading the Christ who has been written into you. They may read you in a secret way, without letting you know that they are reading you. Some may even oppose you and criticize the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I would encourage you not to be bothered by this kind of opposition or criticism. Instead of being offended or discouraged, you need to realize that your parents are reading the Christ who has been inscribed into you. Sometimes even opposition is a sign that others are reading us.</p><p>I know of many cases of parents who eventually turned to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery because of what they read of Christ in their children. A father may repent, weep in the presence of his son, and say to him, &ldquo;Son, I am sorry for the way I offended you. Over the years I opposed you and even rebuked you. But all the time I was reading you. I must admit that I saw something in you. What I have seen in you now causes me to weep before you and before the Lord. I would like to go with you to one of the church meetings.&rdquo; Parents who oppose their children may later come into the church life. It may take time for a young person to exhibit before his parents the Christ who has been written into him. But after a while the parents will be convinced of the genuineness of this experience of Christ.</p><p>Young people, when you visit your parents, you should exhibit Christ to them, but you should not perform in any way. Neither should you try to defend the Lord&rsquo;s recovery by arguing with your parents or by claiming to know many things. Simply be what you are. In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul says, &ldquo;By the grace of God I am what I am.&rdquo; When you visit your parents at home, simply be what you are by the grace of God. Christ has been inscribed into you. Others will be convinced not by your performance, but by what you are. What a young person is in his being especially convinces his parents, for every parent desires good things to happen to his children. Eventually, if you continue to have Christ written upon you and manifest this Christ to your parents, they will be convinced and may even decide to follow you into the church life.</p><p>The important matter is that Christ is inscribed into us. The more Christ is written into our being, the more others will be able to read Him in us.</p>
