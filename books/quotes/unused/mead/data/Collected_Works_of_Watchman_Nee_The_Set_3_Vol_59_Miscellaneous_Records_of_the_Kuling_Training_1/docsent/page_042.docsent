   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OFFERING OF STRANGE FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY AARON'S SONS, NADAB AND ABIHU</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The evening before last we read Leviticus 8 concerning the sanctification of the house of Aaron for the holy priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter nine goes on to speak of Aaron and his house offering sacrifices and the commencement of their priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter ten we find Nadab and Abihu with strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should first go back to chapters eight and nine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please note 8:2a, 6, 12-14a, 18, 22b-24, 27, 30-31, 36; 9:1, 8-9, 12, 18.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Reason for Being Consumed</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>on Account of the Strange Fire</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everyone who is learning to take the way of God's service has to see the seriousness of the story of Nadab and Abihu!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They offered strange fire, which was not according to God's command.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am afraid you do not see the seriousness of this offense.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God chose Aaron to be the high priest; He did not choose his sons to be the high priests.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Aaron's sons became priests by virtue of being in their father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Aaron was the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God chose Nadab and Abihu because Aaron's house was right in the sight of the Lord, not because they were right in God's sight personally.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God chose the sons of Levi because of their ancestor; the choosing was unrelated to the sons themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Aaron's sons became priests after their father's footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible is careful to point out that in their priestly service, it was Aaron with his sons who handled the sacrifices on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God appointed Aaron to be the authority, and his sons were to be under his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Leviticus 9:8-9, 12 tells us that Aaron was the one who offered sacrifices; his sons were only his helpers and learners.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God had no intention that Nadab and Abihu would do anything by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They saw what Aaron did, and they thought they could do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They began to do what God had not commanded them to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They offered strange fire, which was not according to God's command.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before Aaron moved, they should not have moved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Aaron did not order them to offer the sacrifice; they did it of their own accord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nadab and Abihu should have followed Aaron alone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, they thought that they could offer sacrifices as well, and they did so without Aaron's command.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They were not acting under authority when they offered their sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First Samuel 15:22 says that "to obey is better than sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this instance there was sacrifice but no obedience and no submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was actually rebellion against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason fire came from God and consumed them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's Work Being a Coordination with Authority</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our service to God is realized through our coordination with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This can be seen in the service of Aaron and his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some people have to find the proper authority above them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their place is to remain under others as helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Others have to stand above men and serve as authorities to many.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our work must be carried out in a good order and in coordination with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Unless we work this way, our endeavor will not be pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have read the story of Nadab and Abihu for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to clearly see that for Nadab and Abihu to act independently of Aaron was the same as for them to act independently of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Leviticus 8 and 9 Aaron and his sons were referred to repeatedly in the matter of the offering of sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's work is carried out in the principle of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No one can be responsible for a work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, three, five, eight, or ten people have to work together like a family.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some should stand in the place of Aaron, while others should stand in the place of his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God sanctified both Aaron and his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Leviticus 9 we see Aaron offering sacrifices as a priest and his sons helping him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But after Nadab and Abihu saw how Aaron offered sacrifices, they thought they could offer sacrifices in a similar manner.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The result was judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Any service that has not been touched by authority is an offering of strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Anyone who says, "Since So-and-so can do it, I can do it as well," is in rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The same thing can be said of those who should follow others but do not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some have challenged Leviticus 8 and 9, saying, "If Aaron's sons were simply following Aaron, why did they need to be under authority?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Aaron's sons might have said, "What is so special about the sacrifices?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can offer the same."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But remember, if we behave like Aaron's sons when they followed behind their father, we will bring blessing to others, and our service to God will be acceptable to Him; but if we take the initiative and shake off Aaron's authority, we will be offering strange fire, and the result will be death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have often felt that an atmosphere of independent evangelism has developed in China since 1926 and 1927.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Independent evangelism, however, means independence from coordination and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such practice has inflicted great loss on the church in China.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Much blessing has been lost because of a lack of vision in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to see that in our service we must join ourselves to the authority that God has established.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to see the seriousness of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In our service to God, there is the need of coordination with authority.</S>
