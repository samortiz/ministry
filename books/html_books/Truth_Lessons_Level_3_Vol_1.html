The divine revelation in the Bible is not only presented in plain words but also portrayed in types. A picture or portrait is better than a thousand words. In particular, since the revelation in the holy Word concerning the mystery of Christ and the church is spiritual and abstract in nature, it cannot be thoroughly made clear by words; it needs to be portrayed and indicated by figures. Among the types in the divine revelation, the first are the light and the tree of life, which typify Christ as light and life; the significance revealed in these types must be high and great.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE LIGHT</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Christ as the Light of the Universe</h2><p>First, the light typifies Christ as the light of the universe. The light-bearers, such as the sun and the stars, are merely shadows, but the body is Christ. He is the true light of the universe. He is the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings (Mal. 4:2). He is also the bright morning star (Rev. 22:16b), appearing privately to His lovers before the darkest hour, prior to dawn. Furthermore, He is the great light that dispels the death and shadow in man (Matt. 4:16).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Christ as the Source of All Lights</h2><p>Psalm 36:9b says, &ldquo;In Your light we see light.&rdquo; We can see light only in the light of Christ. When Christ comes to us, He brings light to us that we may know ourselves thoroughly, see our true condition, and realize the corruption of our flesh. If we want light, we must receive Christ and touch Christ. Christ always brings light to us and shines on us in every way (Eph. 5:14). Therefore, Christ is the source of all lights.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Christ as the Light of the World</h2><p>In John 8:12 Jesus spoke to the people, saying, &ldquo;I am the light of the world.&rdquo; Also, in 9:5 He said, &ldquo;While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&rdquo; As the light of the world, Christ enables us not to remain in darkness but to walk in the day that we may not stumble (John 11:9) or lose our direction, not knowing where we are going (John 12:35). We were once darkness (Eph. 5:8a), but now we have become sons of light by believing into Christ as the light (John 12:36b). We even are the light (Matt. 5:14); that is, we are luminaries holding forth the word of life (Phil. 2:15-16), shining forth Christ to enlighten this dark world.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Christ as the Light of Life</h2><p>Christ as the light is the light of life (John 8:12; 1:4). The entire Bible shows us that life comes from light. When light comes in, life comes in. Where light is, there is life. The amount of light there is determines the measure of life that is present. Genesis chapter one tells us that before the work of God&rsquo;s restoration began, the earth was waste and dark, that is, full of death. Hence, the first step of God&rsquo;s work was to command light to come forth. When light comes, it dispels death, which belongs to darkness, and begins to bring in life. Therefore, life comes after light and begins with light.</p><p>God commanded light to come forth on the first day, issuing in the plant life, which is the lowest life, a life without consciousness. This is a type of Christ as the light of life that shined on us and brought the life of God into us when we were newly saved. However, the life we received then was a life in its initial stage, which is neither solid nor shaped. On the fourth day God commanded the sun, the moon, and the stars to shine forth with a light that is more definite and concrete than the light of the first day. Consequently, a higher life was brought in; not only was there the life of animals such as birds, fish, and beasts, but there was the life of man, who is like God. This signifies that we have received a stronger, more definite, and more solid enlightening, and the life in us grows and bears a shape, which means that Christ has grown and is &ldquo;formed&rdquo; in us (Gal. 4:19). Finally, on the seventh day God, signified by the tree of life, came forth, and as the highest light He brought the life of God, which is the highest life, signified by the tree of life. When light shines to its utmost degree, life also reaches its apex. When light is perfect, life also is complete. This signifies that when Christ as the light of life shines within us to the utmost degree, our spiritual life becomes full and mature to the extent that we are exactly like God. This is the highest result of Christ as the light of life imparting life to man.</p><p>Furthermore, the light of life indicates that light issues from life and belongs to life. Where life is, there is light. Christ first came to be our life, and then this life became the light in us (John 1:4-5). This light of life is subjective and inward, and it is within us.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Christ as the Embodiment of God,<br />Who Is the Source of Life</h2><p>The tree of life is a symbol, signifying that God is life and the source of life (cf. Psa. 36:9; John 1:4; 10:10b; 11:25; 14:6; 1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4). This God became flesh (John 1:14) and was embodied in Christ (Col. 2:9). The Gospel of John tells us that in Him was life (John 1:4), He came that we may have life (John 10:10), and He is life (John 11:25). Hence, the tree of life mentioned in Genesis 2 typifies Christ as the embodiment of God, who is the source of life.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Christ Being the Life and Also the Vine Tree; These Two Combined Equaling the Tree of Life</h2><p>Christ is the life; He is also the true vine in the universe (John 15:1). These two combined equal the tree of life.</p><h2 class="head3">1. To Be Life to the Believers in the Church Today</h2><p>Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life. This indicates that Christ as the tree of life is life to the believers in the church today. That Christ is our life indicates that we are to enjoy Him daily as the food supply in our spirit, take Him as life and live by Him, and live Him in our daily life to experience Him, so that all that He is and has attained and obtained may become our subjective experience. Thus, we can grow in His life to have His image and be like Him (2 Cor. 3:18), and we can bear the fruit of life as His spreading in life (John 15:5).</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Be the Enjoyment of Life<br />in the Paradise of God to the Overcomers<br />in the Kingdom in the Future</h2><p>Christ is life to the believers in the church today, and He will be the enjoyment of life in the Paradise of God to the overcomers in the kingdom in the future (Rev. 2:7b). This is the reward that the Lord promised to the overcoming believers in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, that is, a particular enjoyment of Christ as the life supply.</p><p>God&rsquo;s original intention was that man should eat of the tree of life (Gen. 2:9, 16). Because of man&rsquo;s fall, the way to the tree of life was closed to man (Gen. 3:22-24). Through the redemption of Christ, the way by which man could touch the tree of life was opened again (Heb. 10:19-20). But in the church&rsquo;s degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life. Hence, the Lord promised to grant as a reward to the overcomers, those who overcome all the distractions in the church&rsquo;s degradation and enjoy Christ as the tree of life, to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, which will be the supply of life for them to reign in the kingdom (Rev. 20:4b).</p><h2 class="head3">3. Ultimately, to Be the Enjoyment of Life to God&rsquo;s Redeemed in the New Jerusalem for Eternity</h2><p>Eating the tree of life was not only God&rsquo;s original intention for man but will also be the eternal issue of God&rsquo;s redemption. In the ultimate manifestation of the New Jerusalem, all God&rsquo;s redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life in full, which is Christ with all the divine riches as their life supply for eternity (Rev. 22:2).</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Satan as the Source of Sin and Evil</h2><p>The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signify two persons in the universe&mdash;God and Satan. The tree of life typifies Christ as the embodiment of God, who is the source of life; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil typifies Satan as the source of sin and death. The content of the tree of life is God&rsquo;s life; the content of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is Satan&rsquo;s evil life, nature, and character&mdash;these three equaling sin and death. Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, yet what entered into him was sin, which resulted in death (Rom. 5:12). Romans &mdash;&mdash;8 shows us that sin is like a person who can enter (5:12), reign (v. 21), lord it over people (6:14), deceive and kill people (7:11), and dwell in people, causing them to do things against their will (vv. 17, 20). This indicates that sin must be the embodiment of Satan, the evil one. It is dormant within the flesh of fallen man, but when it is aroused by man&rsquo;s willing to do the good, it becomes the evil (v. 21), which results in death (5:12). Therefore, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil must be a type of Satan as the source of sin and evil.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Knowledge, Good, and Evil of the Tree<br />of the Knowledge of Good and Evil<br />Being in Contrast to the Life of the Tree of Life</h2><p>Since the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of sin and evil, what it includes&mdash;knowledge, good, and evil&mdash;must also come out of Satan as the evil source. Satan is the adversary of God, and knowledge, good, and evil of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are in contrast to the life of the tree of life. All these&mdash;knowledge, good, and evil&mdash;are distractions and frustrations that prevent people from receiving and enjoying the life of the tree of life and thus cause them to be alienated from God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Life Being Dependent upon God;<br />Knowledge, Good, and Evil Being<br />Independent of God</h2><p>The life of the tree of life is dependent on God, whereas the knowledge, good, and evil of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are independent of God. Anything we do in dependence upon the Lord is in the principle of the tree of life. Anything we do independently of the Lord is in the principle of the tree of knowledge. Independence is a spiritual insulation that disconnects us from the life of God.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Evil Being Independent of God as the Source of Life;<br />Since Good Is Also Independent of God as Life,<br />It Is Ranked with Evil</h2><p>The Greek word for <em>evil</em> means <em>that which is evil in character.</em> This must be the evil life, nature, and character of Satan himself. This evil is independent of God as the source of life. Since good is also independent of God as life, it is ranked with evil. If men do evil, they will fall under the judgment of God. But even if men do good, since they do it independently of God, the good they do is also ranked with evil; hence, they likewise will fall under the judgment of God.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Knowledge Being Independent of the Life of God;<br />Hence, It Being Ranked Also with Good and Evil</h2><p>Knowledge appears to be something good. Almost everyone likes knowledge and has a craving for knowledge. Even the majority of Christians are greedy for it. However, behind knowledge is death. Second Corinthians 3:6 says that &ldquo;the letter kills.&rdquo; The letter is knowledge. Therefore, knowledge is independent of God and is also ranked with good and evil, which are independent of God as life.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil<br />Bringing In Death, Signifying That<br />Death Comes Out of Satan</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Death Coming from Sin</h2><p>Adam took in Satan by eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Thus, through the one man, Adam, sin entered into the world (Rom. 5:12); that is, sin entered into man to dwell in man&rsquo;s body (7:17). At the same time, this sin brought in death, and death came through sin (5:12). Furthermore, the wages of sin is death (6:23a). The wages that man earns for committing sins is death, first in his spirit and then in his body.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Since Satan Is the Source of Sin,<br />He Is Also the Source of Death</h2><p>Satan is the source of sin, and death came through sin. Moreover, Satan also has the might of death (Heb. 2:14). Therefore, he must also be the source of death.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Today This Death Damages Man<br />and Causes Man to Die</h2><p>Because of the fall of man and the entering in of sin, death passed on to all men and reigned in man (Rom. 5:12, 14). This death daily entangles man and damages man, causing man to become weak and wither up and bringing every part of man into a failing state. Finally, death brings man&rsquo;s body into death and causes man&rsquo;s soul and spirit to perish in the suffering section in Hades (Luke 16:22-24). This is the first death.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Eventually, This Death Will Become<br />the Second Death of Those Who Commit Sins,<br />That Is, the Eternal Death of Their Whole Being&mdash;<br />Spirit, Soul, and Body&mdash;in the Lake of Fire</h2><p>Hebrews 9:27 says, &ldquo;It is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment.&rdquo; Therefore, man&rsquo;s first death is not the ultimate end. At the end of the millennial kingdom, at the conclusion of the old heavens and old earth, all the dead who have not been saved through faith in the Lord Jesus will be resurrected and will pass through the judgment before the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-13). This judgment will result in their being cast into the lake of fire (v. 15). This is the second death of those who commit sins. Their spirit, soul, and resurrected body will die eternally in the lake of fire to suffer eternal torment.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>Among the types in the divine revelation in the Bible, the first are the light and the tree of life, which typify Christ as light and life. The light typifies Christ as the light of the universe, the source of all lights, the light of the world, and the light of life. As the light of the universe, He is the reality of all light-bearers. As the source of all lights, He brings light to us and enlightens us in every way, that we may know ourselves and see our true condition. As the light of the world, He enables us not to remain in darkness but to walk in the day. He also causes us who believe into Him to become sons of light, even to become the light, shining forth Christ to enlighten this dark world. As the light of life, He dispels death, which belongs to darkness, and brings life to man, and He causes life to grow in His believers even unto full maturity, to the extent that they are exactly like God.</p><p>The tree of life typifies Christ as the embodiment of God, who is the source of life. He is life to the believers in the church today, He will be the enjoyment of life in the Paradise of God to the overcomers in the kingdom in the future, and eventually, He will be the supply of life to God&rsquo;s redeemed in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</p><p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil typifies Satan as the source of sin and evil. Knowledge, good, and evil of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are in contrast to the life of the tree of life. Life is dependent on God; knowledge, good, and evil are independent of God. Moreover, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil brings in death, signifying that death is of Satan. Today this death damages man and causes man to die. Eventually, this death will become the second death of those who commit sins, that is, the eternal death of their whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;in the lake of fire to suffer eternal torment.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state what Christ is as typified by the light.</li><li>What does the tree of life typify?</li><li>How does Christ as the tree of life become the life and enjoyment to the believers?</li><li>What does the tree of the knowledge of good and evil typify?</li><li>Show the contrast between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil as types.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON TWO</h1><h1 class="title">ADAM AND EVE</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Adam typifying Christ:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>As the center of God&rsquo;s creation.</li><li>As the Head of all God&rsquo;s creation.</li><li>As the One who bears God&rsquo;s image and likeness.</li><li>As God&rsquo;s representative.</li><li>As the Head of all men.</li><li>As God becoming the unique male in the universe.</li><li>As the One whom none among God&rsquo;s creation can match as a counterpart.</li><li>As the One who flowed out the water of life to produce the church as His counterpart.</li></ol></li><li>Eve typifying the church:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Which came out of Christ.</li><li>Which has the same character, life, and nature as Christ.</li><li>Which is joined to Christ to become one with Christ.</li><li>Which becomes the Body of Christ to be His counterpart:<ol class="decimal"><li>As His reproduction.</li><li>As His multiplication.</li><li>As His increase.</li><li>As His fullness.</li><li>As His expression.</li></ol></li><li>Which ultimately will consummate in the New Jerusalem:<ol class="decimal"><li>As the universal bride.</li><li>As the wife of the Lamb.</li><li>As the expression of the fullness of the Triune God.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>Among the types in the Old Testament concerning Christ and the church, after the light and the tree of life, there are Adam and Eve. Christ is light and life in order that those who are enlightened by Him and who receive Him as life may become His church as His counterpart. Therefore, it is spiritually significant that the types of Adam and Eve follow the types of the light and the tree of life.</p><h2 class="head1">I. ADAM TYPIFYING CHRIST</h2><p>In the Bible Adam as the first man is a type of the Christ who was to come (Rom. 5:14). As a type of Christ, Adam prefigured Christ. Whatever purpose God had for Adam and whatever work He did in Adam were to be carried out in and through Christ. Adam was the head of the old collective man, that is, mankind. Whatever he did and whatever happened to him are participated in by all mankind. Christ is the Head of the new corporate man, that is, the church. Whatever He did and whatever happened to Him are participated in by all His members.</p><h2 class="head2">A. As the Center of God&rsquo;s Creation</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s creation Adam was the center of all creation. God first established the heavens and prepared the earth, and then He created man. He first made the light, the expanse, and the land, and then He created the grass, the herbs, the trees, the fish, the birds, the cattle, the beasts, and the creeping things. Eventually, He created Adam. Thus we see that the heavens are for the earth, and the earth with the different kinds of living things is for man. Therefore, man is the center of God&rsquo;s creation. This is a type of Christ as the real center of God&rsquo;s creation, because in Him, through Him, and unto Him all things were created, the things in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, lordships, rulers, or authorities. He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him (Col. 1:16-17). Moreover, the purpose of God&rsquo;s creation is to glorify Him (v. 18). He is the center of the entire creation of God and He is also the holding center.</p><h2 class="head2">B. As the Head of All God&rsquo;s Creation</h2><p>Adam was created as the head of the human race, and the human race was the center of God&rsquo;s creation. Therefore, Adam was the head of God&rsquo;s creation. This is a type of Christ as the Head of all God&rsquo;s creation. Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation.&rdquo; Christ as God is the Creator. However, as man, sharing the created blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14a), Christ is also part of the creation, and He is the Firstborn of all creation, having the preeminence in all creation.</p><h2 class="head2">C. As the One<br />Who Bears God&rsquo;s Image and Likeness</h2><p>Adam was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to God&rsquo;s likeness (Gen. 1:26). This typifies that Christ bears God&rsquo;s image and likeness. Colossians 1:15 says that Christ &ldquo;is the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; God is invisible. But Christ, who is the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance (Heb. 1:3), is His image, expressing what He is. John 1:18 also says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son [Christ], who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; Actually, Christ was the very image in which Adam was created (Gen. 1:27; Rom. 5:14); Christ is the image of God (2 Cor. 4:4).</p><h2 class="head2">D. As God&rsquo;s Representative</h2><p>After the creation of Adam, God wanted man to have dominion over all the living created things in the seas, in the air, and on the earth (Gen. 1:26, 28). God wanted the man whom He had created to be His representative to execute His authority and rule for Him on the earth. Therefore, man was not only created to express God but also given the authority to represent God to rule over all. This is a type of Christ as God&rsquo;s expression and also as God&rsquo;s representative. Christ as God&rsquo;s Anointed was anointed and commissioned by God for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s purpose in dealing with God&rsquo;s enemy to recover the enemy-usurped earth and bring in God&rsquo;s authority.</p><h2 class="head2">E. As the Head of All Men</h2><p>Adam was the first ancestor of the human race. When he was created, the entire human race, which was included in him, was created by God (Gen. 1:26). Thus, he became the head of all men. This is a type of Christ as the head of every man (1 Cor. 11:3). In Ephesians 1:22-23 the headship of Christ over all things is to His Body, the church. In 1 Corinthians 11:3 the headship of Christ over every man is related to individuals. Christ is the Head of the church corporately and of the believers individually. He is the Head of every one of us directly; as such, He has been the One appointed by God in the divine administration to rule over all men.</p><h2 class="head2">F. As God Becoming the Unique Male<br />in the Universe</h2><p>Adam was the only male in God&rsquo;s creation at that time, typifying Christ as God becoming the unique male in the universe. In the Old Testament many times God likened Himself to a husband and His people to a wife (Isa. 54:5; 62:5; Jer. 3:14). The New Testament many times also reveals Christ as the Bridegroom who marries the bride (Matt. 9:15; Mark 2:19; Luke 5:34; John 3:29; 2 Cor. 11:2; Rev. 19:7). Christ is the unique male in the universe; He is the unique object of our pursuit and the One to whom we eternally belong.</p><h2 class="head2">G. As the One Whom None among God&rsquo;s Creation<br />Can Match as a Counterpart</h2><p>After Adam was created, God said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart&rdquo; (Gen. 2:18). Then God brought to Adam every beast and every bird that He had created. And Adam gave names to all of them, but he did not find a complement, a counterpart, to help him (vv. 19-20). This typifies that none among God&rsquo;s creation can match Christ as His counterpart, for none was out of Christ, and none had the same character, life, or nature as Christ to be a perfect match to Him.</p><h2 class="head2">H. As the One Who Slept in Death<br />and Whose Side Was Opened</h2><p>Because none among the creation could match Adam to be his complement, his counterpart, God caused him to fall into a deep sleep and opened his side (Gen. 2:21). This is a type of Christ sleeping in death and being pierced in His side (John 19:34). At the end of the crucifixion of Christ, a soldier pierced His side with a spear, causing His side to be opened and to flow out blood and water (John 19:34). Blood is the negative aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death; it is for redemption, which is for the purchasing of the church (Acts 20:28). Water is the positive aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death; it is for imparting life, which is for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-30).</p><h2 class="head2">I. As the One Who Flowed Out the Water of Life<br />to Produce the Church as His Counterpart</h2><p>With the rib which was taken out of Adam, God built a woman as Adam&rsquo;s counterpart (Gen. 2:22-24). The rib taken out of Adam signifies the flowing water and the unbroken bone mentioned in John 19:34 and 36. When Christ died on the cross, His side was pierced and the water of life came out, strong as an unbreakable bone, to produce the church as His counterpart. Thus, the sinner whom God created and who became fallen, after being redeemed and transformed by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, becomes the woman in the universe to be married to Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">II. EVE TYPIFYING THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Which Came Out of Christ</h2><p>Just as Adam is a type of Christ, Eve is a type of the church. Eve was built by God with a rib taken out of Adam. Therefore, Adam said that Eve was &ldquo;bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh&rdquo; (Gen. 2:21, 23). Eve&rsquo;s coming out of Adam in this way typifies that the church comes out of Christ in the same way. The church is produced by the life-dispensing water which flows out of Christ. Hence, the church has the essence of Christ and comes out of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Which Has the Same Character, Life,<br />and Nature as Christ</h2><p>Eve received her life from Adam; she was the bone of Adam&rsquo;s bone and the flesh of Adam&rsquo;s flesh. Hence, she had the same character, life, and nature as Adam. In like manner, the church comes out of Christ and has the same character, life, and nature as Christ. Therefore, in this respect Eve is a type of the church, which has the same character, life, and nature as Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Which Is Joined to Christ<br />to Become One with Christ</h2><p>Eve not only came out of Adam but also was brought to Adam (Gen. 2:22) to be joined to Adam and to become one flesh with Adam (v. 24). In like manner, the church is joined to Christ and becomes one with Christ. Only Eve, who came out of Adam, could be joined to Adam; likewise, only the church, which comes out of Christ, can be joined to Christ. As Adam and Eve were joined to become one complete unit, Christ and the church are also joined to become one complete unit. However, Adam and Eve were joined to become one flesh, whereas Christ and the church are joined to become one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Which Becomes the Body of Christ<br />to Be His Counterpart</h2><p>Eve was a part of Adam&rsquo;s body as Adam&rsquo;s counterpart, typifying that the church is Christ&rsquo;s Body as Christ&rsquo;s counterpart. Ephesians 1:22b-23a says, &ldquo;The church, which is His Body.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s Body is not an organization but an organism constituted of all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head. The church is this organic Body. Moreover, the church as the Body is also the counterpart of Christ (Eph. 5:31-32) to match and complement Him completely.</p> <h2 class="head3">1. As His Reproduction</h2><p>Eve was Adam&rsquo;s reproduction, Adam&rsquo;s duplication, signifying that the church is Christ&rsquo;s reproduction, Christ&rsquo;s duplication. The church comes out of Christ and has the same character, life, and nature as Christ. In the church there is only Christ and there is no element other than Christ. Therefore, the church is Christ&rsquo;s reproduction, Christ&rsquo;s duplication.</p><h2 class="head3">2. As His Multiplication</h2><p>As Eve was Adam&rsquo;s multiplication, the church is Christ&rsquo;s multiplication produced through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead (1 Pet. 1:3). Christ was the unique grain that fell into the ground and died, and in resurrection He brought forth many grains (John 12:24), that is, many believers, to constitute the church as the Body of Christ to be His multiplication.</p><h2 class="head3">3. As His Increase</h2><p>As Eve was Adam&rsquo;s increase, the church is Christ&rsquo;s increase. John 3 shows that Christ is immeasurable and unlimited (vv. 31-36). Such a One needs a universal increase to be His bride to match Him (vv. 29-30). Hence, God first regenerates us through His Spirit (vv. 3-6) that we may have the eternal life of Christ (vv. 15-16, 36a). Then He fills us with His unlimited Spirit (v. 34) that we may become the bride, the increase, of the all-inclusive Christ, who is above all (vv. 31-35).</p><h2 class="head3">4. As His Fullness</h2><p>Just as Eve became the fullness of Adam, the church becomes the fullness of Christ. Ephesians 1:23 shows us that Christ is the One who fills all in all and that the church is His fullness. Christ, who is the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such a great Christ needs the church to be His fullness. The fullness of Christ issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). Through the enjoyment of Christ&rsquo;s riches the church becomes His fullness.</p><h2 class="head3">5. As His Expression</h2><p>Just as Eve was Adam&rsquo;s expression, the church is Christ&rsquo;s expression. The fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ. The fullness does not refer to the riches of what Christ is; it refers to the expression of those riches. When we enjoy the riches of Christ, we become His fullness that He may have a full expression.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Which Ultimately Will Consummate<br />in the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Eve as the counterpart of Adam ultimately typifies the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2, 9-10). As the bride of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ, her Husband, and becomes His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, and became his counterpart. She is prepared by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">1. As the Universal Bride</h2><p>The New Jerusalem as the universal bride (Rev. 21:2) is a living composition of all the saints redeemed by God throughout all generations. In the entire Bible, God likens His chosen people to a spouse (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32) for His satisfaction in love. Eventually, the saints throughout the generations, who have been chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified by God, will constitute the New Jerusalem to be the universal bride of the unique male in the universe&mdash;Christ&mdash;that He may have the full satisfaction in love.</p><h2 class="head3">2. As the Wife of the Lamb</h2><p>Revelation 21:9 shows us that this universal bride is also the wife of the Lamb. A bride is mainly for the wedding day, whereas a wife is for the entire married life. The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennial kingdom for one thousand years, which is like one day (2 Pet. 3:8), and will be the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, to the ages of the ages without end.</p><h2 class="head3">3. As the Expression<br />of the Fullness of the Triune God</h2><p>The New Jerusalem takes God as her center, substance, element, and essence. She has gold, signifying the divine nature of God, as her city proper (Rev. 21:18); she has pearls, signifying Christ&rsquo;s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, as her gates (v. 21); she has precious stones, signifying the Spirit&rsquo;s work of transformation, as the wall and the foundation (vv. 18, 14, 19); she has the Triune God as her temple and her light (vv. 22-23); she has the throne of the Triune God as her center (22:1); and she has the flow of the Triune God as her supply (v. 1). Thus, ultimately, the New Jerusalem, typified by Eve, is the full expression of the Triune God in eternity.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>In the Bible Adam as the first man is a type of the Christ who was to come. He typifies Christ: as the center of God&rsquo;s creation, in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created; as the Head of all God&rsquo;s creation, the One who has the preeminence in all creation; as the One who bears God&rsquo;s image and likeness to express what God is; as God&rsquo;s representative, anointed and commissioned by God to carry out God&rsquo;s purpose; as the Head of all men, appointed by God in the divine administration to rule over all men; and as God who became the unique male in the universe to be the universal Bridegroom to marry His redeemed people as His bride. Among God&rsquo;s creation, none could match Christ as His counterpart. Hence, Christ slept in death and His side was opened to flow out the water of life, which produced the church as His counterpart. Thus, the sinner whom God created and who became fallen, after having been redeemed and transformed by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, becomes the woman in the universe to be married to Christ.</p><p>Just as Adam is a type of Christ, Eve is a type of the church. Eve typifies the church. The church came out of Christ, has the same character, life, and nature as Christ, and is joined to Christ to be one spirit with Christ. The church is also the Body of Christ to be His counterpart as His reproduction, multiplication, increase, fullness, and expression. Eve as the counterpart of Adam ultimately typifies the New Jerusalem, the universal bride, constituted with the saints throughout the generations, who have been chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified by God, to be the bride of Christ in the millennium and the wife of the Lamb for His satisfaction in eternity, to the ages of the ages without end. The New Jerusalem takes the Triune God as her center, substance, element, and essence to be the full expression of the Triune God in eternity.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the different aspects in which Adam serves as a type of Christ.</li><li>What is the significance of the type in which Adam&rsquo;s side was opened and a rib was taken out to build a woman?</li><li>What is typified in Eve&rsquo;s coming out of Adam and being joined to Adam?</li><li>Explain how Eve is a type of the church which becomes the Body and the counterpart of Christ and which ultimately will become the New Jerusalem.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE SACRIFICIAL SKINS, THE SACRIFICES,<br />THE BURNT OFFERINGS,<br />AND THE SEED OF THE WOMAN</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Concerning Christ&rsquo;s redemption:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The sacrificial skins&mdash;the skins of the sacrifices with which Adam and Eve were clothed:<ol class="decimal"><li>The condition of Adam and Eve before the fall.</li><li>After they sinned, having the sinful conduct, the sinful nature, and the consciousness of sin.</li><li>The fallen Adam and Eve making skirts to cover their shame because of their consciousness of sin.</li><li>God clothing them with coats made of the skins of sacrifices, typifying:<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>That God caused Christ to be sacrificed for sinners as the substituting Lamb.</li><li>That God made Christ the righteousness of the sinners who believe in Him that they may be justified and live before God.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>The sacrifices&mdash;the firstlings of the flock with their fat offered by Abel:<ol class="decimal"><li>Abel living before God by offering sacrifices according to God&rsquo;s way of redemption.</li><li>The firstlings of the flock which he offered, typifying Christ, who is unto God, who lives for God, and who is gentle and tender.</li><li>The fat which he offered, being the fatness of the sheep, typifying the tender merits of Christ.</li><li>The Christ-redeemed sinners needing to live before God by such a Christ.</li></ol></li><li>The burnt offerings&mdash;offered by Noah:<ol class="decimal"><li>Noah being saved by God from the old age of corruption into the new age of restoration.</li><li>Building an altar to offer sacrifices as burnt offerings.</li><li>This being the accomplishment of the initial types of Christ&rsquo;s redemption:<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>The burnt offering typifying the perfect Christ becoming a sweet-smelling savor unto God.</li><li>That the earth might remain before God, signifying that the earth might minister to God.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Concerning Christ&rsquo;s salvation:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The seed of the woman&mdash;the one who would save man:<ol class="decimal"><li>Typifying Christ, who was born of a virgin.</li><li>To bruise the head of the serpent for man, typifying that Christ would destroy Satan.</li></ol></li><li>The ancient serpent&mdash;the one who was to be destroyed:<ol class="decimal"><li>Signifying the subtle one, the devil, Satan.</li><li>To bruise the heel of the seed of the woman, typifying that Satan would hurt Christ, who caused Satan&rsquo;s death.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>From the types in the previous lesson we see that the significance of God&rsquo;s focusing on man in His creation of the universe and all things is that He desired to prepare for Christ a counterpart, that is, the church. In order to become the church as the counterpart of Christ, the God-created yet fallen man needs to be redeemed, to be saved, and to live before God by Christ as a burnt offering to God for God&rsquo;s sweet satisfaction. Therefore, in the revelation of the Bible, following the type of Adam and Eve for Christ and the church, there are the initial types of Christ&rsquo;s redemption and salvation.</p><p>In the Bible, God used the skins of the sacrifices with which God made coats for the fallen Adam and Eve to put on, the sheep with their fat which Abel offered to God, the burnt offerings which Noah offered to God, and the seed of the woman who would bruise the head of the serpent, as the primitive types concerning Christ&rsquo;s redemption and His salvation. These may be called the initial types of Christ&rsquo;s redemption and His salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">I. CONCERNING CHRIST&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Sacrificial Skins&mdash;the Skins of Sacrifices<br />with Which Adam and Eve Were Clothed</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Condition of Adam and Eve before the Fall</h2><p>Before the fall, Adam and Eve, the first ancestors of mankind, were in a state of innocence; they were sinless and had no consciousness of sin. Therefore, although they were both naked, they were not ashamed (Gen. 2:25).</p><h2 class="head3">2. After They Sinned,<br />Having the Sinful Conduct, the Sinful Nature,<br />and the Consciousness of Sin</h2><p>Adam and Eve were tempted by the serpent, Satan the subtle one, and disobeyed God&rsquo;s command so that they rejected the tree of life, which signifies God as life, and took in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan as the source of sin and death (Gen. 2:8-9, 17; 3:1-7). Thus, they sinned before God. Their offense and disobedience (Rom. 5:18-19) constituted their sinful conduct. Furthermore, the evil nature of Satan, which they received into them by their committing sin and by their fall, became their sinful nature (Rom. 5:12, 19). After they had sinned in this way, they became sinners, having the sinful conduct outwardly, the sinful nature inwardly, and the consciousness of sin.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Fallen Adam and Eve<br />Making Skirts to Cover Their Shame<br />because of Their Consciousness of Sin</h2><p>After they sinned, the fallen Adam and Eve became conscious of their sin and realized the shame of their nakedness. Hence, they took the leaves of a fig tree to make skirts for themselves to cover their shame. This indicates that sinful men tried to remove the shame of their sin by the works of their own hands and by the human cultivation of their conduct. However, in doing this they were not able to cover their nakedness in the eyes of God. After the fall men needed a bleeding sacrifice for redemption. Thus, their attempt to cover their shame with a product of the vegetable life could never work.</p><h2 class="head3">4. God Clothing Them with Coats<br />Made of the Skins of Sacrifices, Typifying:</h2><h2 class="head4">a. That God Caused Christ to Be Sacrificed<br />for Sinners as the Substituting Lamb</h2><p>Since the skirts of fig leaves which fallen men made for themselves could not cover their shame, God came to seek them and clothed them with garments made of the skins of a slain sacrifice for their covering. This slain, bleeding sacrifice typifies Christ as the substituting Lamb for sinners (John 1:29), who was killed and who shed His blood to make propitiation for the sins of man before God. On the cross He was man&rsquo;s Substitute and bore man&rsquo;s sins. He, the righteous One, was judged on behalf of the unrighteous (1 Pet. 3:18) by the righteous God according to His righteousness, that He might remove the barrier of man&rsquo;s sins, to save man and bring him to God.</p><h2 class="head4">b. That God Made Christ the Righteousness<br />of the Sinners Who Believe in Him<br />That They May Be Justified and Live before God</h2><p>God clothed Adam and Eve with the garments which He made of the skins of sacrifices to cover their shame before God that they might be not only justified but also redeemed by God. The skin of the sacrifice is a type of Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness, who has become the righteousness of the sinners who believe in Him that they may be justified and live before God. Second Corinthians 5:21 says, &ldquo;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&rdquo; Sin came from Satan, who rebelled against God. This sin, which came out of the evil one, entered into man (Rom. 5:12) and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God&rsquo;s judgment. Hence, through incarnation Christ became one with us in the flesh and was made sin on our behalf to be judged by God (Rom. 8:3). Moreover, in resurrection He joined us to Himself and made us the righteousness of God in Him. It is through this righteousness that we live before God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Sacrifices&mdash;the Firstlings of the Flock<br />with Their Fat Offered by Abel</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Abel Living before God by Offering Sacrifices<br />according to God&rsquo;s Way of Redemption</h2><p>Abel was the second son of Adam and Eve. He inherited the way of redemption which was accomplished by God and passed down to him by his parents, and he lived before God by offering sacrifices. His presenting of sacrifices was not his own invention, nor was it according to his own concept, thought, or way, but according to God&rsquo;s revelation. He realized that as a fallen man he could not cover his sin with his own work and by his own conduct. He needed to depend on the bleeding sacrifice to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirement that he might be accepted by God and live before God to have fellowship with God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Firstlings of the Flock Which He Offered,<br />Typifying Christ, Who Is unto God,<br />Who Lives for God, and Who Is Gentle and Tender</h2><p>The sacrifices offered by Abel to God were the firstlings of his flock (Gen. 4:4). According to Numbers 18:17, the firstling of a sheep was not to be eaten by the Israelites; it had to be offered to God. Hence, the firstlings of the flock offered by Abel were a type of Christ, who is unto God, who lives for God, and who is gentle and tender. Christ, as the eternal Son of the living God, became flesh to be the Son of Man. As such, He is One who is unto God, who lives for God, and who is gentle and tender. On the cross He offered Himself without blemish to God to accomplish God&rsquo;s will, and He became a sweet savor to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire. Furthermore, He offered Himself once for all as the one sacrifice for sins (Heb. 9:14; 10:12) to take away the sins of the world (9:28) and accomplish an eternal redemption for us (v. 12). We believers, whose sins He bore and whom He redeemed, are in Him, and through our union with Him, He has become our living to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire and be accepted by God.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Fat Which He Offered,<br />Being the Fatness of the Sheep,<br />Typifying the Tender Merits of Christ</h2><p>In addition to the firstlings of the flock, Abel offered the fat of the sheep to God (Gen. 4:4). The fat he offered was altogether for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. The fat is the sweetness of the sheep; it is a type of the tender merits of Christ offered to God for His satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Christ-redeemed Sinners<br />Needing to Live before God by Such a Christ</h2><p>Abel was accepted by God and lived before God by offering the firstlings of the sheep and the fat of the sheep, which were types of Christ, according to God&rsquo;s way of redemption. This indicates that we sinners who have been redeemed by Christ should live before God by such a Christ. When we live Him through our union with Him, we are altogether unto God and live for God so that, like Him, we may be accepted by God and may satisfy God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Burnt Offerings&mdash;Offered by Noah</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Noah Being Saved by God from the Old Age<br />of Corruption into the New Age of Restoration</h2><p>Noah inherited the God-given spiritual blessings from his forefathers, such as Adam, Abel, Enosh, and Enoch. Furthermore, by faith he became one whom God considered righteous (Heb. 11:7), and he walked with God in the midst of an adulterous and corrupt generation. He received the revelation from God, and he believed and obeyed this revelation. He worked together with God to build the ark, which signifies God&rsquo;s salvation, so that he was not only delivered through the ark from God&rsquo;s judgment but also saved through water from the old age of corruption into the new age of restoration.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Building an Altar to Offer Sacrifices<br />as Burnt Offerings</h2><p>After Noah came out of the ark, recognizing that the redemption and the living experienced by his forefathers was acceptable to God, he built an altar and offered different kinds of clean cattle and birds as burnt offerings to be a sweet-smelling savor to God. By this he satisfied God&rsquo;s heart so that the earth could remain before God (Gen. 8:20-22).</p><h2 class="head3">3. This Being the Accomplishment<br />of the Initial Types of Christ&rsquo;s Redemption</h2><h2 class="head4">a. The Burnt Offering Typifying the Perfect Christ<br />Becoming a Sweet-smelling Savor unto God</h2><p>The altar is a type of the cross of Christ. The burnt offering is a type of the perfect Christ, signifying that those who have been redeemed by Him and who live by Him may become a sweet-smelling savor for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. Ephesians 5:2 says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.&rdquo; Christ, as One who is perfect and without blemish and who lives absolutely for God, gave Himself up for us as a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor. When we experience Christ in His experience and offer the Christ whom we have experienced, presenting Him to God as our burnt offering according to our experience of Him, we also will become a sweet-smelling savor before God for God&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head4">b. That the Earth Might Remain before God,<br />Signifying That the Earth Might Minister to God</h2><p>Noah built an altar and offered sacrifices as burnt offerings, which gave a sweet-smelling savor that satisfied God&rsquo;s desire and, at the same time, made it possible for the earth to remain before God. That the earth might remain before God signifies that the earth might minister to God that He might carry out on the earth His eternal plan, which He purposed in Christ, that is, to produce a group of people who can make God&rsquo;s heart feel sweet and become the church for His satisfaction, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as His full expression on the new earth for eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">II. CONCERNING CHRIST&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2><p>The record in the Bible concerning the fall of Adam and Eve shows us not only the initial types of Christ&rsquo;s redemption but also the types of Christ&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Seed of the Woman&mdash;<br />the One Who Would Save Man</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Typifying Christ, Who Was Born of a Virgin</h2><p>In Genesis 3 Adam and Eve were tempted by the serpent, and as a result they sinned and became fallen. However, God did not reject them; instead, He began to carry out His salvation for them. He promised them that the seed of the woman would come as the one who would save them from the corruption and bondage of the serpent. This seed of the woman is the incarnated Christ, who was born of a woman, even a virgin (Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:23; Gal. 4:4), to be the Savior of fallen men.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Bruise the Head of the Serpent for Man, Typifying That Christ Would Destroy Satan</h2><p>In Genesis 3:15 God told the serpent that the seed of the woman would bruise its head. When Christ as the seed of the woman was on the earth, He exercised authority to bind the strong man, that is, the serpent, Satan&mdash;the evil one&mdash;and plunder his goods, the fallen people, who are under his bondage and for his use (Matt. 12:29). Eventually, Christ bruised the head of the ancient serpent through His death on the cross and destroyed the devil, who has the might of death, altogether abolishing him and bringing him to nought (Heb. 2:14). Since Christ destroyed Satan in our flesh and also destroyed the power of sin, which is the sinful nature of Satan in us, He saves us from the slavery of death and releases us (Heb. 2:15).</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Ancient Serpent&mdash;<br />the One Who Was to Be Destroyed</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Signifying the Subtle One, the Devil, Satan</h2><p>In Genesis 3 the serpent in the garden of Eden as the embodiment of the evil one signifies the subtle one, the devil, Satan. He was a murderer from the beginning and is also a liar (John 8:44). He is called &ldquo;the tempter&rdquo; (Matt. 4:3), who in a subtle and crafty way seduced the God-created man and thereby caused him to sin and fall. By doing this, Satan injected himself into man and caused man to have the serpentine poison, the evil nature, in the flesh, possessing the serpentine nature. Thus, man became a serpent and belonged to Satan (Matt. 23:33; 3:7). When Christ was lifted up on the cross in the form of the flesh of sin, the ancient serpent, Satan, was judged and completely destroyed through the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Bruise the Heel of the Seed of the Woman,<br />Typifying that Satan Would Hurt Christ,<br />Who Caused Satan&rsquo;s Death</h2><p>When Christ as the seed of the woman bruised the head of the ancient serpent, Satan, through His death in the flesh on the cross, the serpent also bruised His heel. This refers to Satan&rsquo;s hurting of the Lord Jesus by nailing His feet to the cross (Psa. 22:16). For the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s redemption, Christ tasted death for us, the fallen sinners, to cause the death of Satan and destroy the serpentine nature in our flesh that we may be freed altogether from Satan&rsquo;s poison. What a salvation this is!</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>In the Bible, God used the skins of the sacrifices with which He made coats for the fallen Adam and Eve to put on, the sheep with their fat which Abel offered to God, the burnt offerings which Noah offered to God, and the seed of the woman who would bruise the head of the serpent, as the primitive types concerning Christ&rsquo;s redemption and His salvation. God&rsquo;s clothing Adam and Eve with coats made of the skins of sacrifices typifies that God caused Christ to be sacrificed for sinners as the substituting Lamb. Thus, Christ was made the righteousness of the sinners who believe in Him, and the sinners are justified and may live before God. The firstlings of the flock offered by Abel were a type of Christ, who is unto God, who lives for God, and who is gentle and tender, that He might be the living of the believers, whose sins He bore and whom He redeemed, to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire and be accepted by God. The fat which Abel offered is a type of the tender merits of Christ offered to God for His satisfaction. This indicates that we sinners who have been redeemed by Christ should live before God by such a Christ so that, like Him, we may be accepted by God. After Noah was saved by God from the old age of corruption into the new age of restoration, he built an altar to offer sacrifices as burnt offerings to be a sweet-smelling savor to God. By doing this, he satisfied God&rsquo;s heart that the earth might remain before God. This is the completion of the initial types of Christ&rsquo;s redemption.</p><p>In the fall of Adam and Eve there are not only the initial types of Christ&rsquo;s redemption but also the types of Christ&rsquo;s salvation. God promised them that the seed of the woman would come to save man from the corruption and bondage of the serpent. This seed of the woman is a type of Christ, who was born of a virgin, as the Savior of fallen men.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</p><ol class="decimal"><li>In the Bible, what are the primitive types God first used concerning Christ&rsquo;s redemption and His salvation?</li><li>Briefly explain the type of God&rsquo;s clothing Adam with coats made of the skins of sacrifices.</li><li>What is the significance of the type seen in the firstlings of the flock and their fat offered by Abel?</li><li>What is the significance of the type seen in the burnt offerings presented by Noah?</li><li>Briefly explain the significance of the seed of woman as a type of Christ&rsquo;s salvation.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE ARK AND THE GOOD LAND</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The ark typifying Christ as the salvation of God&rsquo;s elect:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The redeeming aspect of Christ&rsquo;s salvation.</li><li>The saving aspect of Christ&rsquo;s salvation:<ol class="decimal"><li>Saving God&rsquo;s elect from God&rsquo;s punishment.</li><li>Saving God&rsquo;s elect from the corrupted generation.</li><li>Ushering God&rsquo;s elect into a renewed age.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>The good land typifying the riches of Christ as the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s elect:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The riches of the good land:<ol class="decimal"><li>Water&mdash;waterbrooks, springs, and fountains.</li><li>Food&mdash;wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive trees, milk, and honey:<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Two kinds of grain&mdash;wheat and barley.</li><li>Four kinds of trees&mdash;vines, fig trees, pomegranates, and olive trees.</li><li>Milk and honey.</li></ol></li><li>Minerals&mdash;stones, mountains, iron, and copper:<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Stones and mountains.</li><li>Iron and copper.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>The enjoyment of the good land:<ol class="decimal"><li>Eliminating the idols and all things related to idolatry.</li><li>Being in the place which God chose.</li><li>Presenting the riches of the good land as offerings to God and enjoying them with Him.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>The ark, which God prepared through Noah for His elect, and the good land, the land of Canaan, into which God led His elect, are intimately related to the security and enjoyment of God&rsquo;s elect. Both are types of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE ARK TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />AS THE SALVATION OF GOD&rsquo;S ELECT</h2><p>The ark is a type of Christ as the salvation of God&rsquo;s elect (1 Pet. 3:20-21). Noah built the ark which eventually saved him not only from God&rsquo;s judgment but also from that crooked and perverted generation. The ark which he built terminated the old generation and ushered in a new one. That was the kind of salvation that Noah built. It was not merely a salvation from eternal perdition but a salvation from the crooked and perverted generation. Christ as the salvation of God&rsquo;s elect is also of two aspects: the redeeming aspect and the saving aspect.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Redeeming Aspect of Christ&rsquo;s Salvation</h2><p>The first aspect of Christ&rsquo;s salvation is the redeeming of God&rsquo;s elect from God&rsquo;s condemnation and judgment. God&rsquo;s chosen people were under the corruption of the corrupted generation. Hence, they were condemned by God and deserved God&rsquo;s judgment. The ark which Noah built was pitched inside and outside with pitch. Pitch is a type of the redeeming blood. Noah was saved from God&rsquo;s judgment by the pitch that was on the ark. Through His redeeming death on the cross, Christ, our Redeemer, has redeemed us from God&rsquo;s eternal condemnation and judgment by resolving the case of sin that we had before God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Saving Aspect of Christ&rsquo;s Salvation</h2><p>The second aspect of Christ&rsquo;s salvation is the salvation of God&rsquo;s elect from God&rsquo;s punishment and the corrupted generation and the ushering of God&rsquo;s elect into a renewed age.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Saving God&rsquo;s Elect from God&rsquo;s Punishment</h2><p>The ark saved the whole family of Noah from the pounding and drowning of the flood. This is a type of the salvation of Christ that saves God&rsquo;s elect from God&rsquo;s punishment. In the days of Noah, people were befuddled by eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage; they did not know that judgment was coming, until the flood came and destroyed them all (Luke 17:26-27). Likewise, people today are befuddled by the necessities of this life and do not know that God&rsquo;s judgment will come upon them by the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. Just as Noah was saved by the ark that was built by his work, so we must also work out our own salvation (Phil. 2:12) that at the Lord&rsquo;s coming we may be saved from God&rsquo;s punishment and not suffer the plagues that the world will suffer.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Saving God&rsquo;s Elect<br />from the Corrupted Generation</h2><p>The ark built by Noah eventually not only saved him from God&rsquo;s judgment but also saved his family of eight from that evil generation. This is a type of Christ&rsquo;s salvation that not only delivers us out of eternal perdition but also saves us from the corrupted generation. Whoever is saved will by no means perish. However, we need the further and higher salvation that saves us from the corrupted generation. This salvation is the corporate Christ whom we are building. We need not only to preach the individual Christ but also to build the corporate Christ, the church. This Christ may be considered today&rsquo;s ark. Through this Christ as salvation thousands of people have been saved not only from God&rsquo;s judgment but also from the crooked and perverted generation.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Ushering God&rsquo;s Elect into a Renewed Age</h2><p>The ark saved Noah and his whole family from the evil generation and ushered them into a new age that they might live an altogether new life for God and before God. In like manner, Christ&rsquo;s salvation also saves God&rsquo;s chosen people from the corrupted generation and ushers them into a renewed age, into the new realm of resurrection. Noah and his household passed through the flood waters by being in the ark. After the flood, the ark rested on the mountain of Ararat. Their passing through the flood was a type of baptism; the ark&rsquo;s resting upon the mountains was a type of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection; and the living of Noah&rsquo;s family of eight after the flood was a type of the church life. Through baptism we buried the old community and the old society, and in resurrection we have entered into another community, another society, which is the church life.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE GOOD LAND TYPIFYING THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br />AS THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD&rsquo;S ELECT</h2><p>The purpose of Christ in saving God&rsquo;s chosen people into a new age is that they may enjoy the riches of Christ in the new age. The ark rescued the whole household of Noah and brought them to the new earth. After this, the good land afforded Noah&rsquo;s descendants, the descendants of Abraham, the enjoyment of all the riches of the new earth (Gen. 12:1, 5-8). This is a type of the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) as the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s elect through His salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Riches of the Good Land</h2><p>The riches of the good land typify the all-inclusiveness of Christ. Christ, as the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23), is the all-inclusive One. In the Old Testament, besides the good land of Canaan there is no other type that depicts Christ as such an all-inclusive One.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Water&mdash;Waterbrooks, Springs, and Fountains</h2><p>Deuteronomy 8:7 says that the good land is &ldquo;a land of waterbrooks, of springs and of fountains.&rdquo; The fountain is the source; the spring is the emergence; and the waterbrook, the stream, is the flowing forth. The Lord Jesus said that out of the innermost being of those who believe into Him will flow rivers of living water. Hence, the fountains, the springs, and the waterbrooks (streams) typify the supply of the life of Christ as the living water within us, which makes us feel refreshed and watered and also flows out of us to water others. Furthermore, <em>fountains, springs,</em> and <em>waterbrooks</em> are all in the plural, indicating that Christ within us is like many fountains and many springs, from which many streams of water flow out to be our spiritual supply in many ways and many aspects.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Food&mdash;Wheat, Barley, Vines, Fig Trees,<br />Pomegranates, Olive Trees, Milk, and Honey</h2><p>In the good land there are eight kinds of rich foods, of which there are two kinds of grain, four kinds of trees, and milk and honey.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Two Kinds of Grain&mdash;Wheat and Barley</h2><p>John 12:24 shows us that the Lord is the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died and was buried. Hence, the wheat represents the Christ who was incarnated to be a man and who fell into the ground to die and be buried. It typifies the Christ who was incarnated, the Christ who died, and the Christ who was buried.</p><p>Barley denotes Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and typifies the resurrected Christ. In the land of Canaan barley is the first among the grains to ripen. In Leviticus 23 the Lord charged the Israelites that when the harvest time came, the firstfruits of the harvest had to be offered to God, and the firstfruits were clearly barley. First Corinthians 15:20 says, &ldquo;But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; This clearly indicates that the firstfruits of the harvest typify Christ as the firstfruits of resurrection. Hence, barley typifies the resurrected Christ. The barley loaves with which the Lord fed the five thousand (John 6:9) typify Christ in His resurrection as the life supply to His believers.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Four Kinds of Trees&mdash;Vines, Fig Trees,<br />Pomegranates, and Olive Trees</h2><p>In Judges 9:13 the vine said, &ldquo;Shall I leave my new wine, which cheers God and men...?&rdquo; This depicts the Christ who sacrificed everything of Himself so that out of His sacrifice He produced the new wine to cheer God and men. Therefore, the vine typifies Christ as the One who cheers God and men.</p><p>The fig tree represents sweetness and good fruits. Judges 9:11 says, &ldquo;But the fig tree said to them, Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit...?&rdquo; Hence, the fig tree typifies the sweetness and satisfaction of Christ as our supply.</p><p>The pomegranate represents the abundance and beauty of life. When we see a ripe pomegranate and its seeds, we surely have the impression that pomegranates are full of life. If we enjoy and experience Christ as the wheat, the barley, the vine, and the pomegranate, the beauty of Christ and the abundance of His life will be manifested through us. This is the experience of Christ as the pomegranate.</p><p>The olive tree produces olive oil. Zechariah 4:12-14 says that there are two olive trees before the Lord, which are the two sons of oil. This is a type of Christ as the Son of oil, the One anointed with the Spirit of God. He is a man full of the Holy Spirit; He is the olive tree, the Son of oil. We are told in Judges 9:9 that olive oil is used for honoring God and men. This indicates that if we would serve the Lord and help others, we must do it by the Holy Spirit. We must be one who is filled with the Holy Spirit. If we enjoy Christ as the wheat, the barley, the vine, the fig tree, and the pomegranate, we will surely have the olive oil and will enjoy Him as the olive tree; that is, we will be filled with the Holy Spirit and we will honor both God and men.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Milk and Honey</h2><p>Milk and honey are produced out of the mingling of two lives, the vegetable life and the animal life. In Deuteronomy 8:8 honey is put together with the plants: first wheat, barley, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree, and then honey. And in Deuteronomy 32:14, milk is put together with the animals: the cattle, the flock, the milk, and the fat. This is because, for the most part, honey has to do with the plant life, and the greater part of milk is related to the animal life. Honey is derived mainly from the plant life&mdash;the flowers and the trees&mdash;and it involves a part of the animal life&mdash;the bees. When these two lives are mingled together, honey is produced. But honey, for the most part, belongs to the vegetable life. Milk is also the product of both the animal life and the vegetable life, but it belongs mainly to the animal life: it is produced from the grazing in the pasture (vegetable life) by the cattle and the flock (animal life).</p><p>Hence, milk and honey speak forth the goodness and sweetness of the life of Christ. Such experience is produced from the two aspects of the life of Christ, the generating life (the vegetable life) and the redeeming life (the animal life). The more we experience Christ as wheat, barley, and so forth, and at the same time as the cattle and the flock, the more we will enjoy Christ as milk and honey.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Minerals&mdash;Stones, Mountains, Iron, and Copper</h2><p>The final aspect of the riches in the good land is minerals, including stones, mountains, iron, and copper. These are for the building, for the kingdom, for fighting, and for security, indicating that some elements in the life of Christ are both materials for God&rsquo;s building and weapons for spiritual warfare.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Stones and Mountains</h2><p>Stones signify Christ as building material for God&rsquo;s dwelling place. He is the foundation stone, the cornerstone (Isa. 28:16; Psa. 118:22), and the topstone. First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; This clearly indicates that Christ is the stone for God&rsquo;s building. If we experience Him as the stone living in us, He will make us, who were people of clay, living stones, transformed by His stone nature, that we may be built together with others as a spiritual house upon Him as both the foundation stone and the cornerstone.</p><p>Stones are always related to mountains and hills. If we want rocks, we must have mountains. Mountains and hills in the Scriptures always signify resurrection and ascension. If we want to be transformed from a piece of clay into a stone, we must be in the resurrection life. If we are living and walking in the resurrection life, we are enjoying the reality of the mountains and the hills, and with these mountains and hills inevitably there are stones.</p><p>Mountains and hills are for the building of the house, the city, and the kingdom of God. In Palestine most of the cities are built upon hills and mountains. A city is the center and symbol of a nation, a kingdom. This means that spiritual authority, the heavenly authority, is always in resurrection. If we are in the resurrection life of Christ, we will have the authority of heaven. Daniel 2 shows us that Christ is the stone that is cut out without hands and becomes a great mountain, which is the kingdom of God on earth (vv. 34-35).</p><h2 class="head4">b. Iron and Copper</h2><p>The Bible tells us that Christ will rule the nations with a rod of iron. Iron, therefore, stands for the authority of Christ. All authority both in heaven and on earth has been given to Christ (Matt. 28:18). He has been exalted to the heavens, to the right hand of God (Acts 2:33; 5:31), and has been made Head over all things (Eph. 1:22). He has the iron. The rod of iron is in His hand (Rev. 19:15).</p><p>Copper stands for the judgment of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s judging power and judging authority issue from the trials that He suffered. His feet are like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace (Rev. 1:15; 2:18). The feet represent the walk, the life on earth. The walk and life of the Lord on earth were refined by God. He was even tested by the enemy and by mankind. By all these tests, the Lord&rsquo;s life and walk were proved and came forth as perfect, bright, and shining. He has the qualification and the position to judge others.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Enjoyment of the Good Land</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Eliminating the Idols and<br />All Things Related to Idolatry</h2><p>Our enjoyment of the produce of the good land typifies our enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ. In order to participate in the enjoyment of the good land, we must first eliminate idols and all things related to idol worship. Deuteronomy 12:2-3 says, &ldquo;You shall completely destroy all the places where the nations whom you will dispossess have served their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every flourishing tree. And you shall tear down their altars and crush their pillars; and their Asherahs you shall burn with fire, and the idols of their gods you shall cut down; and you shall destroy their name from that place.&rdquo; Before they could fully enjoy the riches of the good land, the children of Israel had to completely destroy the places where the nations worshipped their false gods. The worship centers of the pagans had to be completely destroyed. The idols and their names all had to be eliminated from the good land. Today, if we want to enjoy the riches of Christ, we too must eliminate the idols in Catholicism and in the Protestant denominations, any name that is set up other than the name of Christ, and every pagan practice that has been adopted, such as Christmas and Easter.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Being in the Place Which God Chose</h2><p>Deuteronomy 12:5 says, &ldquo;But to the place which Jehovah your God will choose out of all your tribes to put His name, to His habitation, shall you seek, and there shall you go.&rdquo; Moreover, 14:23 says, &ldquo;And you shall eat before Jehovah your God, in the place where He will choose to cause His name to dwell, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil and the firstborn of your herd and flock, that you may learn to fear Jehovah your God always.&rdquo; The children of Israel had no right to keep the firstborn of their cattle and the top tenth of their produce for themselves. They were not allowed to eat these things at home; they could enjoy them only in the place where God chose to put His name.</p><p>In the same principle, we cannot enjoy the choice portion of Christ unless we gather together with the saints on the ground of oneness chosen by God. God prohibits us from abusing His grace. We must go to the meetings of the church in oneness to enjoy the top portion of Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Presenting the Riches of the Good Land<br />as Offerings to God and Enjoying Them with Him</h2><p>The best produce of the good land must be brought to the unique place of God&rsquo;s choice and presented to God as offerings to be enjoyed with Him (Deut. 12:5-7, 13-14, 17-18). The children of Israel were required to set aside the top tenth of the produce of the land and the firstborn of the cattle as well. Three times a year&mdash;at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles&mdash;they brought the tithes and the produce to the house of God in Jerusalem, the unique place of God&rsquo;s choice, and offered them on the altar. There was a portion for God, a portion for the priests, and a portion for the one who presented the offering. Hence, during the feasts, they enjoyed these riches before God and with God. This signifies that God&rsquo;s people should offer the riches of Christ to God on the ground of oneness for their enjoyment with God and with all the people, to be the fellowship between them and God and the mutual fellowship among themselves.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The ark is a type of Christ as the salvation of God&rsquo;s elect in two aspects: the redeeming aspect and the saving aspect. The redeeming aspect is to redeem God&rsquo;s elect from God&rsquo;s condemnation and judgment. The saving aspect is to save God&rsquo;s elect from God&rsquo;s punishment that they may not suffer the plagues that the world will suffer; it is also to save them from the crooked and perverted generation and to usher them into a renewed age, into a new realm of resurrection, that they may live a new life, the church life, before God and for God.</p><p>The good land typifies the riches of Christ as the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s elect. Christ has saved God&rsquo;s chosen people into a new age that they may enjoy the riches of Christ in the new age. Christ is all-inclusive and unsearchable, and the good land of Canaan is the type of such an all-inclusive One. The riches of the good land include water&mdash;waterbrooks, springs, and fountains, typifying the supply of the life of Christ as the living water within us, which makes us feel refreshed and watered and which also flows out of us to water others. There are eight kinds of rich food in the good land. Among them there are two kinds of grain: wheat, typifying the Christ who was incarnated, the Christ who died, and the Christ who was buried, and barley, typifying the resurrected Christ. There are four kinds of trees: the vine, typifying Christ as the One who cheers God and man, the fig tree, typifying the sweetness and satisfaction of Christ as our supply, the pomegranate, typifying the abundance and beauty of Christ&rsquo;s life, and the olive tree, typifying Christ as the Son of oil, a man full of the Holy Spirit. Finally, there are milk and honey, signifying the goodness and sweetness of the life of Christ, produced by His generating life&mdash;the vegetable life&mdash;and by His redeeming life&mdash;the animal life. The final stage of the riches in the good land is the minerals, including stones, mountains, iron, and copper. These are for the building, for the kingdom, for fighting, and for security, indicating that some elements in the life of Christ are both materials for God&rsquo;s building and weapons for spiritual warfare.</p><p>In order to participate in the enjoyment of the good land, we must first eliminate idols and all things related to idol worship. Moreover, we must be in the place of God&rsquo;s choice and we must present the riches of the good land as offerings to God and enjoy them with Him. This shows that if we want to enjoy the riches of Christ, we must eliminate the idols in Catholicism and in the Protestant denominations, any name that is set up other than the name of Christ, and every pagan practice that has been adopted. Moreover, we must gather together with the saints on the ground of oneness chosen by God and present the riches of Christ that we may enjoy them in the presence of God with God and with all the people.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Which aspects of Christ does the ark typify?</li><li>What is the difference between the redeeming aspect and the saving aspect of Christ&rsquo;s salvation?</li><li>Which aspect of Christ does the good land typify?</li><li>Briefly describe the all-inclusive Christ as typified by the riches of the good land.</li><li>Briefly state the requirements and the types for the participation in the enjoyment of the good land.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">MELCHISEDEC</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Melchisedec&rsquo;s status typifying what Christ is:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Being without father, without mother, without genealogy, and having neither beginning of days nor end of life.</li><li>As the king of righteousness and of peace.</li><li>As the priest of the Most High God:<ol class="decimal"><li>A High Priest of the eternal order.</li><li>According to the power of an indestructible life.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>What Melchisedec was to Abraham typifying what Christ is to the believers:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Ministering bread and wine to God&rsquo;s chosen people.</li><li>Blessing God&rsquo;s victor:<ol class="decimal"><li>The greater blessing the lesser.</li><li>Receiving tithes from God&rsquo;s victor.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>The order of arrangement in the revelation of the truths in the Bible is always marvelous. In the biblical types, after the ark and the good land, which typify the salvation of Christ and His riches, there is Melchisedec, who typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s High Priest. While Abraham and his household were dwelling in the good land and were enjoying all the riches therein, suddenly they were attacked and disturbed by Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him. After Abraham defeated Chedorlaomer and the other kings, Melchisedec, the priest of the Most High God, went forth with bread and wine to meet, comfort, and bless Abraham. This is a type of Christ as God&rsquo;s High Priest comforting and blessing those who are His elect and who enjoy the riches of Christ and fight for God.</p><h2 class="head1">I. MELCHISEDEC&rsquo;S STATUS TYPIFYING WHAT CHRIST IS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Being without Father,<br />without Mother, without Genealogy,<br />and Having neither Beginning<br />of Days nor End of Life</h2><p>Concerning Melchisedec, Hebrews 7:3 says, &ldquo;Being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God.&rdquo; For all the important persons in Genesis there is a genealogy, but not for Melchisedec. In the divine writing the Holy Spirit sovereignly gives no account of the beginning of Melchisedec&rsquo;s days nor of the end of his life, that he might be a proper type of Christ as the One who is without beginning and without ending, the eternal One. This corresponds with the presentation in chapter one of the Gospel of John, which declares that the Son of God is eternal, having neither beginning nor end and being without genealogy.</p><h2 class="head2">B. As the King of Righteousness and of Peace</h2><p>The name <em>Melchisedec</em> first is interpreted &ldquo;king of righteousness,&rdquo; and then also &ldquo;king of Salem,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;king of peace&rdquo; (Heb. 7:2). Melchisedec typifies Christ as the King of righteousness who made all things right with God and made all things right with one another. Righteousness issues in peace (Isa. 32:17). As the King of peace (cf. 9:6), Christ, through righteousness, brings in peace between God and us.</p><h2 class="head2">C. As the Priest of the Most High God</h2><h2 class="head3">1. A High Priest of the Eternal Order</h2><p>Melchisedec was the priest of the Most High God (Gen. 14:18; Heb. 7:1). This is a type of Christ as God&rsquo;s High Priest of the eternal order. Hebrews 6:20 says that Christ has &ldquo;become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec.&rdquo; According to the Bible, there are two orders of the priesthood, one being the order of Aaron and the other, the order of Melchisedec. The order of Melchisedec came before the order of Aaron and is higher than the order of Aaron. The order of Aaron was for the priesthood that was only in humanity, whereas the order of Melchisedec is for the priesthood that is in both humanity and divinity. Aaron was established in honor to be the high priest only for his lifetime, for he was prevented by death from continuing. But as the Son of God, Christ was ordained in glory to be our High Priest forever (Heb. 5:4-6). With Him there is no preventing by death (7:23). He is forever our High Priest (v. 17), appearing before God on our behalf (9:24) and praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God&rsquo;s eternal purpose (7:25).</p><h2 class="head3">2. According to the Power of an Indestructible Life</h2><p>Hebrews 7:16 says, &ldquo;[Christ] has been appointed not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life.&rdquo; Christ was appointed a High Priest not according to the powerless letters of law but according to the powerful element of an indestructible life, which nothing can destroy or dissolve. This life is endless, being the eternal, divine, uncreated life, and the resurrection life, which passed through the test of death and Hades (Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18). It is by such a life that Christ ministers today as our High Priest. Hence, He is able to save us to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25).</p><h2 class="head1">II. WHAT MELCHISEDEC WAS TO ABRAHAM<br />TYPIFYING WHAT CHRIST IS<br />TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Ministering Bread and Wine<br />to God&rsquo;s Chosen People</h2><p>When Abraham returned from his slaughtering of Chedorlaomer and his allied kings, Melchisedec went forth to meet Abraham, who had fought for God and won the victory, and to minister to him bread and wine (Gen. 14:18). This is a type of what Christ ministers to His believers at His table. According to Matthew 26, on the night before He left His disciples, the Lord Jesus &ldquo;took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body. And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (vv. 26-28). The bread on the Lord&rsquo;s table is a symbol signifying the Lord&rsquo;s body, which was broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it. By partaking of His broken body, we participate in His life. The cup signifies our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s blessing. Hence, the cup is called &ldquo;the cup of blessing&rdquo; (1 Cor. 10:16). In it are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion (Psa. 16:5). In Adam our portion was the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath, which would have sent us to the lake of fire to suffer the torment of eternal perdition (Rev. 14:10; 21:8). However, God made the Lord Jesus drink the cup of wrath on the cross for us (John 18:11), causing Him to suffer God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on our behalf and to taste the torment of perdition of the lake of fire. The Lord Jesus shed His blood to redeem us from our sins, thereby enacting the new covenant for us and bringing us instead the cup of salvation (Psa. 116:13) as the cup that runs over (23:5). In this cup of salvation are all the blessing of God and even God Himself as our portion. Christ as our Melchisedec today brings His life and all God&rsquo;s blessings with Him to His table to minister to us. At the Lord&rsquo;s table, the life signified by the bread and the blessings signified by the cup are the constant supply to us of our Lord as our High Priest.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Blessing God&rsquo;s Victor</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Greater Blessing the Lesser</h2><p>When Melchisedec came to meet the victorious Abraham, he blessed Abraham with the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth (Gen. 14:19), as the blessing. This proves that he was greater than Abraham, since it is customary for the lesser to be blessed by the greater (Heb. 7:7). This signifies the greatness and superiority of Christ, the perpetual, great, and kingly High Priest, who blesses us.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Receiving Tithes from God&rsquo;s Victor</h2><p>Abraham gave tithes of the choice spoils to Melchisedec (Gen. 14:20; Heb. 7:2, 4). This fact proves the greatness of Melchisedec. Christ, as a Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, is greater than the priests of the tribe of Levi, who also paid tithes to Melchisedec through their father Abraham (Heb. 7:9), since they were in Abraham&rsquo;s loins when he met Melchisedec (v. 10). This shows us that such a great Christ is worthy to receive offerings and honor from all the victorious ones.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>Melchisedec&rsquo;s status typifies what Christ is. Without father, without mother, without genealogy, and having neither beginning of days nor end of life, Melchisedec typifies Christ, the Son of God, who is the eternal One, having neither beginning nor end. The name <em>Melchisedec</em> is interpreted &ldquo;king of righteousness,&rdquo; and then also &ldquo;king of Salem,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;king of peace,&rdquo; signifying that Christ as the King of righteousness and peace brings in peace between God and us through righteousness. Melchisedec is also a priest of the Most High God, signifying that Christ as God&rsquo;s High Priest of the eternal order is not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life. It is by such a life that Christ ministers today as our High Priest. Hence, He is able to save us to the uttermost.</p><p>What Melchisedec was to Abraham typifies what Christ is to the believers. When Abraham returned from his slaughtering of the kings, Melchisedec went forth to meet him and minister to him bread and wine. This signifies that Christ brings His life and all God&rsquo;s blessings with Him to His table to minister to us. At the Lord&rsquo;s table, the life signified by the bread and the blessings signified by the cup are the constant supply to us of our Lord as our High Priest. Furthermore, Melchisedec blessed Abraham, proving that he was greater than Abraham, and he also received offerings from Abraham. This signifies the greatness and superiority of Christ, the perpetual, great, and kingly High Priest, who blesses us and who is worthy to receive offerings and honor from all the victorious ones.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Which aspects of Christ are typified by the status of Melchisedec?</li><li>Briefly explain the priesthood of Christ as typified by Melchisedec.</li><li>Briefly explain how what Melchisedec was to Abraham is a type of what Christ is to the believers.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON SIX</h1><h1 class="title">SARAH AND HAGAR</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Sarah symbolizing the covenant of God&rsquo;s promise:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>God&rsquo;s promise being fulfilled by God&rsquo;s grace for those who inherit the promise.</li><li>Not by the energy of man&rsquo;s flesh.</li><li>Only those who are born of God&rsquo;s promise, who are born according to the Spirit, being able to inherit God&rsquo;s promised good land&mdash;Christ.</li></ol></li><li>Hagar symbolizing the covenant of law:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Bringing forth children unto slavery according to the law of Mount Sinai.</li><li>Being born according to man&rsquo;s flesh, not according to God&rsquo;s grace.</li><li>Having no share in God&rsquo;s promised good land.</li></ol></li><li>The covenant of God&rsquo;s promise confirmed with the covenant of circumcision:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Circumcision signifying the putting off of the flesh by the cutting off of the cross.</li><li>Circumcision on the eighth day after birth signifying the receiving of the dealing of the cross in resurrection.</li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>After Melchisedec as a type of Christ as God&rsquo;s High Priest, we have Sarah and Hagar as types of the two covenants which God made with His chosen people concerning their inheriting of the good land. These are signified by Abraham&rsquo;s wife and his concubine.</p><h2 class="head1">I. SARAH SYMBOLIZING<br />THE COVENANT OF GOD&rsquo;S PROMISE</h2><p>The two women, Abraham&rsquo;s wife Sarah and his concubine Hagar, recorded in Genesis 21, symbolize two covenants (Gal. 4:24). One is the covenant of promise given to Abraham, which is related to the new testament, the covenant of grace; the other is the covenant of law given to Moses, which has nothing to do with the new testament. Sarah, the free woman, symbolizes the covenant of promise, and Hagar, the maidservant, the covenant of law.</p><h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Promise Being Fulfilled<br />by God&rsquo;s Grace for Those Who Inherit the Promise</h2><p>Genesis 17:15-19 shows us that God definitely promised that Abraham would have a son, Isaac, and that this son would be born of his wife, Sarah. God&rsquo;s promise of a seed to Abraham was altogether worked out by God&rsquo;s grace. In Genesis 18:14 God said to Abraham, &ldquo;At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.&rdquo; This means that Isaac&rsquo;s birth was a birth at the appointed time, at the time of life, according to God&rsquo;s promise. It was not by the natural energy of Abraham and Sarah; it was the issue of the visitation of God&rsquo;s grace. God&rsquo;s promise is fulfilled by God&rsquo;s grace for those who inherit the promise. This grace is the very Christ Himself who brought with Him God&rsquo;s grace (John 1:14). He supplies God&rsquo;s chosen people with all that He is to fulfill for them God&rsquo;s promise.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Not by the Energy of Man&rsquo;s Flesh</h2><p>God&rsquo;s promise is not fulfilled by the energy of man&rsquo;s flesh. When God promised that Isaac would be born of Sarah, Abraham, being old and well stricken in age, considered his body as already dead, and Sarah&rsquo;s womb also was deadened (Gen. 18:11-14). It was only after they became nothing and were void of strength that God came in to carry out His promise by His grace. This shows us that it is God who promises and it is also God who fulfills what He has promised. Man&rsquo;s flesh is of no use at all. Abraham brought forth a seed, Ishmael, by the endeavor of the human flesh, but Ishmael was rejected by God (17:18; 21:10) and could not fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. Likewise, whatever we do, whether good or bad, by the strength and ability of our natural man cannot fulfill God&rsquo;s promise to us. God desires that we only receive His grace and cooperate with Him and not do anything by ourselves.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Only Those Who Are Born of God&rsquo;s Promise,<br />Who Are Born according to the Spirit,<br />Being Able to Inherit<br />God&rsquo;s Promised Good Land&mdash;Christ</h2><p>In Genesis 21:12 God said to Abraham, &ldquo;For in Isaac shall your seed be called.&rdquo; Isaac was born of the free woman, Sarah, through promise. This means that he was born through God&rsquo;s power in grace, which is implied in God&rsquo;s promise (Gal. 4:23); that is, he was born according to God&rsquo;s Spirit of life (v. 29). Only the children of promise were accounted as Abraham&rsquo;s seed (Rom. 9:8), and only they could inherit the good land that God had promised to Abraham for the accomplishment of His purpose. The good land, which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ, was given by God as an inheritance to His children of promise, in which and by which they might live to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy, to gain the kingdom for God, to build God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and to express God&rsquo;s glory.</p><h2 class="head1">II. HAGAR SYMBOLIZING THE COVENANT OF LAW</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Bringing Forth Children unto Slavery<br />according to the Law of Mount Sinai</h2><p>Hagar, the concubine of Abraham, signifies the covenant of law. Hence, the position of the law is like that of a concubine. As such, the law has no rightful position in God&rsquo;s economy. Like Sarah, grace brings forth children unto sonship; like Hagar, the law brought forth children unto slavery. Galatians 4:24 says, &ldquo;One [covenant] from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto slavery, which is Hagar.&rdquo; Mount Sinai is the place where the law was given (Exo. 19:20; 24:12). The covenant of law, symbolized by Hagar, brings God&rsquo;s chosen people into the bondage of the law, making them slaves under the law, separated from the grace of God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Born according to Man&rsquo;s Flesh,<br />not according to God&rsquo;s Grace</h2><p>Galatians 4:23 says, &ldquo;The one of the maidservant was born according to the flesh.&rdquo; Abraham brought forth Ishmael through the maidservant Hagar by his fleshly effort and not by God&rsquo;s grace. Therefore, Ishmael, as the issue of man&rsquo;s fleshly effort according to the law, was rejected by God. When man ignores the work of God&rsquo;s grace and attempts to do something by himself to please God, this brings in the law and joins man to the law. Thus, what is brought forth in this way cannot remain in God&rsquo;s economy, and it is of no use for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose.</p><p>According to God&rsquo;s intention, the covenant of promise came first (Gen. 12:2, 7; 13:15-17; 15:4-21). God had no intention of bringing in the law or of having man endeavor to keep it for the fulfillment of His purpose. Rather, through the effort of man&rsquo;s flesh, the covenant of law, signified by Hagar, was brought in to frustrate God&rsquo;s work of grace.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Having No Share in God&rsquo;s Promised Good Land</h2><p>In Genesis 21:10 Sarah said to Abraham, &ldquo;Cast out this maidservant and her son, for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit with my son Isaac.&rdquo; The bondwoman Hagar symbolizes the covenant of law, the position of which is like that of a concubine (Gal. 4:22, 24-25). Therefore, what was brought forth through her was not accepted as an heir to the inheritance and had no share in God&rsquo;s promised good land.</p><p>By this we see that the two kinds of children brought forth by the two covenants, the covenant of God&rsquo;s promise and the covenant of law, signified by Abraham&rsquo;s wife Sarah and by his concubine Hagar, are different in nature. Those brought forth by the covenant of law are born according to the flesh; those brought forth by the covenant of promise are born according to the Spirit. The children born according to the flesh have no right to participate in God&rsquo;s promised blessing, but the children born according to the Spirit have the full right to inherit God&rsquo;s promised blessing. We, the believers in Christ, are not children of the maidservant but of the free woman (Gal. 4:31). We are not children of the law under the slavery of the law but children of grace under the freedom of grace to enjoy the God-promised all-inclusive Christ with all His riches.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE COVENANT OF GOD&rsquo;S PROMISE<br />CONFIRMED WITH THE COVENANT OF CIRCUMCISION</h2><p>After God called Abraham, He gave him the promise, which concerned mainly the seed and the land (Gen. 12:1-2, 7; 13:15-17), and then He confirmed the promise by making a covenant with him (15:4-5, 18-21). However, after Abraham received the covenant, he accepted his wife&rsquo;s proposal and by his own flesh he brought forth Ishmael through his maidservant Hagar. This was a serious offense against God&rsquo;s economy for His eternal purpose, and it interrupted the fellowship that came from God. For a long period of thirteen years, Abraham, a man called by God, missed God&rsquo;s presence. It was not until he was ninety-nine years of age that God appeared to him again.</p><p>Then God revealed to Abraham that His name is El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient Mighty One, implying that He would be the source of the rich supply of grace to keep His covenant for the fulfillment of His purpose. Moreover, He again made a covenant with him (17:1-2, 4). In making this covenant, God used circumcision as evidence of the covenant to confirm the covenant of promise which He gave to Abraham. This shows us that although the promise of the good land given by God to His chosen people had been made a covenant by God to His elect, there was still the need to confirm the covenant of God&rsquo;s promise with the covenant of circumcision. Circumcision was the procedure which God&rsquo;s chosen people had to pass through to inherit God&rsquo;s promise. It signifies that God&rsquo;s elect in the New Testament must pass through the dealing of the cross so that they may inherit and enjoy all the riches in Christ promised by God.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Circumcision Signifying the Putting Off<br />of the Flesh by the Cutting Off of the Cross</h2><p>The covenant of promise was confirmed by God with the covenant of circumcision. As far as the faithful God is concerned, there was no need for this confirmation. However, as far as Abraham was concerned, the covenant of promise needed to be confirmed again, because he had used his natural strength by his flesh to produce Ishmael. Since this was the cause of the trouble, God confirmed His covenant by having Abraham circumcised to cut off the flesh. God said to Abraham, &ldquo;You shall keep My covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations. This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your seed after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised&rdquo; (Gen. 17:9-10).</p><p>In the Bible, the spiritual meaning of circumcision is to put off the flesh. Colossians 2:11 says, &ldquo;In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.&rdquo; The circumcision that is the putting off of the body of the flesh was not made with hands; it was accomplished by the death of Christ. The cross of Christ gets rid of our old man and our self (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20). When we believe and are baptized into Him, we put off the flesh by experiencing the cutting off of the cross of Christ (Col. 2:11), that we may participate in the fullness that is in Him (vv. 9-10) for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s purpose.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Circumcision on the Eighth Day after Birth<br />Signifying the Receiving of the Dealing<br />of the Cross in Resurrection</h2><p>In the covenant of circumcision which He made with Abraham, God required His people to be circumcised on the eighth day after their birth (Gen. 17:12). The eighth day is the first day of the week, the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Matt. 28:1, 6). Circumcision on the eighth day signifies the receiving of the dealing of the cross of Christ in resurrection. We were buried together with Christ in baptism for the termination of our flesh; we were also raised together with Him for the germination of our spirit (Col. 2:12). Now, in Christ&rsquo;s Spirit of resurrection we need to live a crucified life, putting to death our flesh and cutting off our flesh, that the God who has the all-sufficient supply may come into us to be our everything for the accomplishment of His economy.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>Abraham&rsquo;s wife Sarah and his concubine Hagar typify the two covenants which God made with His chosen people concerning their inheriting of the good land. Sarah symbolizes the covenant of God&rsquo;s promise, and Hagar, the covenant of law. God&rsquo;s promise is fulfilled not by the energy of man&rsquo;s flesh but by God&rsquo;s grace for those who inherit the promise. It is God who promises, and it is also God who fulfills what He has promised. Man&rsquo;s flesh is of no use at all; it cannot fulfill God&rsquo;s promise to us. Moreover, only the children of promise are accounted as Abraham&rsquo;s seed, and only they can inherit the God-promised good land (Christ), in which and by which they live for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose.</p><p>Since the covenant of law is signified by Hagar, the position of the law is like that of a concubine. As such, the law has no rightful position in God&rsquo;s economy. Furthermore, those brought forth by the covenant of law are born according to the flesh; they are not accepted as heirs to the inheritance and have no share in God&rsquo;s promised good land.</p><p>God used circumcision as evidence of the covenant to confirm the covenant of promise that He gave to Abraham. Circumcision was the procedure which God&rsquo;s chosen people had to pass through to inherit God&rsquo;s promise. It signifies that the New Testament believers must pass through the dealing of the cross to put off the flesh that they may inherit and enjoy all the riches in Christ promised by God. Circumcision was performed on the eighth day, signifying that we must receive the dealing of the cross in resurrection for the cutting off of our flesh, that the God of all-sufficiency and bountiful supply may come into us to be our everything for the accomplishment of His economy.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain the status and significance of Sarah and Hagar.</li><li>Use Abraham as an illustration to explain briefly how God accomplishes His promise not by the energy of man&rsquo;s flesh but by the grace of God.</li><li>God said to Abraham, &ldquo;In Isaac shall your seed be called.&rdquo; Explain the meaning of this word.</li><li>Briefly state the position of the law and its issue as signified by Hagar.</li><li>Briefly explain the significance of God&rsquo;s using of the covenant of circumcision for the confirmation of the covenant of His promise.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE RAM PROVIDED BY GOD</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>A ram (a male sheep):<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>A male signifying Christ as the strong One.</li><li>A sheep signifying Christ as the meek, gentle, and perfect One.</li></ol></li><li>Typifying Christ as the One provided by God:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Leaving the freedom of His divinity.</li><li>His fighting power being caught in His humanity.</li></ol></li><li>Typifying Christ as the Substitute of those who inherit God&rsquo;s promised inheritance:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Dying on their behalf to satisfy God&rsquo;s requirement.</li><li>Living on their behalf to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire:<ol class="decimal"><li>That they may live to righteousness.</li><li>That they may become the righteousness of God.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>God&rsquo;s covenant of promise is for God&rsquo;s chosen people to inherit the inheritance promised by God, and God&rsquo;s covenant of circumcision is a confirmation of His covenant of promise. Those who inherit the promised inheritance according to this covenant should live for God as His burnt offering to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire. However, God&rsquo;s chosen people cannot be the burnt offering to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire by themselves; they must take Christ as their Substitute. God wanted Abraham to offer his son Isaac, who would inherit God&rsquo;s promised inheritance, as a burnt offering to God. When Abraham acted according to God&rsquo;s command and offered Isaac on the altar as a burnt offering, he saw a ram which God had provided as a burnt offering for his son Isaac, and he went and took it as a substitute for his son (Gen. 22:1-13). This typifies that Christ replaces God&rsquo;s chosen people, who would inherit God&rsquo;s promised inheritance, as the burnt offering to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire.</p><h2 class="head1">I. A RAM (A MALE SHEEP)</h2><h2 class="head2">A. A Male Signifying Christ as the Strong One</h2><p>According to the God-created nature, a male signifies one who is strong, and a female signifies one who is weak and yet has the ability to reproduce. First Peter speaks of the female as the weaker vessel (3:7). Hence, the ram, the male sheep, which is a type of Christ as the burnt offering, signifies Christ as the strong One.</p><h2 class="head2">B. A Sheep Signifying Christ<br />as the Meek, Gentle, and Perfect One</h2><p>A sheep signifies that Christ is One who is meek, gentle, and perfect. &ldquo;He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth&rdquo; (Isa. 53:7). He &ldquo;being reviled did not revile in return; suffering, He did not threaten&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:23a). &ldquo;He will not cry out, nor lift up His voice, / Nor make His voice heard in the street. / A bruised reed He will not break; / And a dimly burning flax He will not extinguish&rdquo; (Isa. 42:2-3). This shows Christ&rsquo;s meekness and gentleness. He said, &ldquo;I am meek...in heart&rdquo; (Matt. 11:29a). He did not resist opposition, nor did He want to do anything for Himself or expect to gain something for Himself. He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father. The lamb for the burnt offering had to be without blemish (Lev. 1:10), that is, without any defect or problem. This also shows Christ&rsquo;s perfection and blamelessness.</p><h2 class="head1">II. TYPIFYING CHRIST AS THE ONE PROVIDED BY GOD</h2><p>The ram that replaced Isaac on the altar was provided by Jehovah God. Abraham called the name of the place where he offered the sacrifice Jehovah-jireh, which means &ldquo;Jehovah will provide.&rdquo; The ram provided by God typifies Christ as the One provided by God to replace God&rsquo;s chosen people, those who would inherit God&rsquo;s promised inheritance, as the burnt offering for God&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Leaving the Freedom of His Divinity</h2><p>As the Lamb provided by God, Christ was sent by God to the world. He left the freedom of His divinity and was confined in the flesh of humanity which He put on in His incarnation. He was the infinite God in eternity, yet He was willing to become a finite man in time to be limited by time and space. He even suffered hunger, thirst, and weariness, and was tempted in all respects like us. This is His leaving the freedom of His divinity to be restricted in His humanity as the Lamb of God to be offered to God as a burnt offering.</p><h2 class="head2">B. His Fighting Power<br />Being Caught in His Humanity</h2><p>The ram was caught in a thicket by his horns (Gen. 22:13). In the Bible horns signify fighting power. The thicket signifies humanity. To be caught in a thicket is to be caught by humanity. Christ as the Lamb of God was willing to have His fighting power caught in His humanity that He might be offered as our Substitute. It is in His humanity that we met Him and received Him as our Substitute.</p><h2 class="head1">III. TYPIFYING CHRIST AS THE SUBSTITUTE<br />OF THOSE WHO INHERIT<br />GOD&rsquo;S PROMISED INHERITANCE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Dying on Their Behalf<br />to Satisfy God&rsquo;s Requirement</h2><p>As the ram was killed on the altar instead of Isaac, so Christ, the Lamb of God, was crucified on the cross for us (2 Cor. 5:14). We all should have gone to the cross, but God replaced us with the Lamb of God. Christ as the Lamb of God lived in the world as a man absolutely for God. He offered Himself as a sacrifice without blemish to God for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s will, and He became a sweet savor to satisfy the requirements of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and glory. We are also accepted in Him by God through our union with Him (Heb. 10:5-8).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Living on Their Behalf to Satisfy God&rsquo;s Desire</h2><p>In His resurrection, Christ, who died on the cross for us, is now in us living on our behalf to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire. In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; We have died in Christ through His death, but now He lives in us through His resurrection. On the one hand, we have been terminated, but on the other hand, we still exist. However, we do not exist apart from Christ; rather, we live because of Him and we live with Him (John 14:19). Hence, we have one life and one living with Him. Christ lives in us as our life; we live Christ without as His expression (Phil. 1:21a) for the satisfaction of God&rsquo;s desire.</p><h2 class="head3">1. That They May Live to Righteousness</h2><p>First Peter 2:24 says, &ldquo;That we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness.&rdquo; Righteousness is a matter of God&rsquo;s government. Christ died for us that we might live to righteousness, that is, that we might live rightly under the government of God. This means that, governmentally, we are right with both God and men according to God&rsquo;s righteous and strict requirements, that is, that we live in a way that matches the righteous requirements of His government.</p><h2 class="head3">2. That They May Become the Righteousness of God</h2><p>Christ died for us not only that we might live to righteousness but also that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21). Christ was made sin for us by becoming one with us through His incarnation. Through His death He was condemned in the flesh as sin for us by God that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God&rsquo;s righteousness. By this righteousness we are accepted by God and live a life that satisfies God&rsquo;s righteous requirements as God&rsquo;s burnt offering in Christ to satisfy God&rsquo;s heart.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>God wanted Abraham to offer his son Isaac, who would inherit God&rsquo;s promised inheritance, as a burnt offering to God. When Abraham acted according to God&rsquo;s command and offered up Isaac, God provided a ram as a burnt offering for his son Isaac, and Abraham took the ram as a Substitute for his son. This typifies that Christ replaces God&rsquo;s chosen people, who would inherit God&rsquo;s promised inheritance, as the burnt offering to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire. A male typifies Christ as the strong One, and a sheep typifies Christ as One who is meek, gentle, and perfect. The ram was provided by Jehovah God, and it was caught in a thicket by its horns, typifying that Christ was provided by God and, having left the freedom of His divinity, His fighting power was caught in His humanity that we might meet Him in His humanity and receive Him as our Substitute. On the one hand, He died for us to satisfy the requirements of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and glory, that we may also be accepted in Him by God through our union with Him. On the other hand, He lives for us to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire that we may live to righteousness and become the righteousness of God. By this righteousness we are accepted by God and live a life that satisfies God&rsquo;s righteous requirements as God&rsquo;s burnt offering in Christ to satisfy God&rsquo;s heart.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly describe the Christ who is signified by the ram.</li><li>Briefly explain how the ram that replaced Isaac on the altar was a type of Christ as the One provided by God.</li><li>The ram that replaced Isaac to be offered on the altar was a type of Christ as the Substitute of those who inherit God&rsquo;s promised inheritance.

Following that, we have another type, a type portraying Christ and the church, symbolized by the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah.</p><h2 class="head1">I. ISAAC TYPIFYING CHRIST</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Inheriting All That the Father Has</h2><p>Isaac as the son brought forth by Abraham through his wife Sarah became the unique seed to inherit all that his father had. When Abraham&rsquo;s old servant was securing a wife for Isaac, he testified that his master had given all that he had to his son (Gen. 24:36). Genesis 25:5 also tells us that &ldquo;Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.&rdquo; Hence, Isaac became the one who inherited his father&rsquo;s riches. Isaac&rsquo;s inheriting of all that his father had is a type of Christ&rsquo;s inheriting all that God the Father has. John 3:35 says, &ldquo;The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand.&rdquo; Furthermore, in John 16:15 the Lord said, &ldquo;All that the Father has is Mine.&rdquo; Hence, Christ not only has received all that was given by the Father but has also inherited all that the Father has.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Obtaining the Church,<br />Which Is of the Same Blood and Flesh as He Is</h2><p>Abraham sent his oldest servant, who ruled over all that he had, charging him to take a wife for Isaac not of the daughters of the Canaanites but of Abraham&rsquo;s kindred (Gen. 24:2-4). As a result, Isaac took Rebekah as his wife, who was of his father&rsquo;s house and of his kindred. This typifies that Christ desires to obtain the church, which is of the same blood and flesh as He is, to be His counterpart. The counterpart of Christ must come from Christ&rsquo;s race, not from the angels nor from any other creatures, but from the human race. Hebrews 2:14 says, &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same.&rdquo; Through Christ&rsquo;s becoming a man of blood and flesh, the human race has become Christ&rsquo;s race. Christ&rsquo;s desire is to obtain the church, which is of the same blood and flesh as He is, to be His beloved counterpart for the satisfaction of His heart&rsquo;s intent.</p><h2 class="head1">II. REBEKAH TYPIFYING THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Chosen and Prepared by God</h2><p>Just as Isaac is a type of Christ, so Isaac&rsquo;s wife Rebekah is a type of Christ&rsquo;s counterpart, the church. Rebekah was chosen to be Isaac&rsquo;s wife by the old servant whom Isaac&rsquo;s father, Abraham, sent to the place from where he was called out by God. Rebekah never dreamed that she would be selected to be Isaac&rsquo;s wife. What happened to her altogether did not depend on her. It all depended on God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement (Gen. 24:14), for she was the one chosen and prepared by God to be given to Isaac. This typifies that the church is chosen and prepared by God to be given to Christ. Ephesians 1:4 says, &ldquo;Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world.&rdquo; This shows that before He created us, God chose us according to His infinite foresight to match Christ as His corporate bride.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Receiving the Holy Spirit<br />as a Seal and as a Pledge</h2><p>When Rebekah had provided sufficient water for the camels, the old servant took a gold ring weighing half a shekel and put it on Rebekah&rsquo;s nose (Gen. 24:22, 47). Half a shekel signifies the first taste, the foretaste, indicating that another half, the full taste, is coming. The gold ring signifies the sealing Spirit. This is a type of the church&rsquo;s receiving the Holy Spirit as a seal and a pledge. Ephesians 1:13-14 says that in Christ we have been &ldquo;sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise, who is the pledge of our inheritance.&rdquo; To be sealed with the Holy Spirit is to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God. The Greek word for <em>pledge</em> also means &ldquo;foretaste, guarantee.&rdquo; God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a pledge of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we will inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Receiving the Spiritual Gifts</h2><p>The old servant gave Rebekah not only a gold ring but also two gold bracelets for her hands weighing ten shekels (Gen. 24:22, 47). Moreover, when the old servant went to Rebekah&rsquo;s house, he brought forth articles of silver, articles of gold, and raiment and gave them to Rebekah (v. 53). The bracelets on her hands weighing ten shekels signify that we have received the gifts of life and thus can fulfill the requirements of God&rsquo;s commandments and fully fulfill the heavenly function. The articles of gold, the articles of silver, and the raiment all indicate the riches of Christ. This typifies that the church has received the spiritual gifts and the riches of Christ from the Holy Spirit. At the time of our salvation, we not only receive the Holy Spirit as a seal and a pledge, but we also receive the spiritual gifts and the riches of Christ from the Holy Spirit for us to carry out the heavenly function and enjoy the riches of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Willing to Forsake Her Relatives<br />and Be Given to Christ</h2><p>After Rebekah received and enjoyed these riches, she was willing to leave her father&rsquo;s house immediately and be given to Isaac (vv. 54-58). This typifies that the church is willing to forsake her relatives in the flesh and be given to Christ. Today, although we have never seen Christ, we are attracted by Him and we love Him (1 Pet. 1:8) because of the Spirit&rsquo;s testifying in us on behalf of Him. Hence, we are willing to forsake the world and our relatives and be given to Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Following the Holy Spirit to Go to Christ</h2><p>After Rebekah decided to leave her father&rsquo;s house to be given to Isaac, she rode on a camel and followed the old servant to go to Isaac (Gen. 24:61). This is a type of the church&rsquo;s following the Holy Spirit to come to Christ. According to Leviticus 11, a camel is unclean, yet it is useful. Many of today&rsquo;s conveniences are not clean in the eyes of God. Nevertheless, through them we can follow the Holy Spirit to travel through the desert to come to Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Being Married to Christ<br />as His Beloved Counterpart</h2><p>One day Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide, and he lifted up his eyes and saw that camels were coming. When Rebekah lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, she took her veil and covered herself. Isaac brought her into his mother&rsquo;s tent, took her as his wife, and loved her (Gen. 24:63-67a). Rebekah was married to Isaac at eventide, and she was loved by him. This typifies that at the close of this age the church will be married to Christ as His eternally beloved counterpart (Rev. 19:7).</p><h2 class="head2">G. For Christ&rsquo;s Full Satisfaction</h2><p>After Rebekah was brought to Isaac, Genesis 24:67b says, &ldquo;Isaac was comforted after the death of his mother.&rdquo; Rebekah was given to Isaac and married to him, and the two became one flesh. Thus, Isaac was comforted, and she also enjoyed all the riches which Isaac had inherited from his father. This typifies that the church is given to Christ to become one with Him as His beloved counterpart for His full satisfaction and thus to be able to enjoy all the riches which He has inherited from God the Father.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>Isaac and Rebekah are a type of Christ and the church. Isaac inherited all that his father Abraham had and took Rebekah as his wife, who was of his father&rsquo;s house and of his kindred. This is a type of Christ&rsquo;s receiving all that was given to Him by the Father and inheriting all that the Father has, and also of His obtaining the church, which is of the same blood and flesh as He is, to be His beloved counterpart for the satisfaction of His heart&rsquo;s intent.</p><p>As Isaac&rsquo;s wife, Rebekah is a type of the church as Christ&rsquo;s counterpart. Rebekah was chosen to be Isaac&rsquo;s wife by the old servant whom Isaac&rsquo;s father, Abraham, sent to the place from where he was called out by God. This typifies that the church is chosen and prepared by God to be given to Christ. Rebekah received a gold ring from the old servant, typifying that the church has received the Holy Spirit as a seal and a pledge. The old servant also gave her gold bracelets of ten shekels in weight for her hands; he also brought forth articles of silver, articles of gold, and raiment and gave them to her. This signifies that the church has received the spiritual gifts and the riches of Christ from the Holy Spirit, that she may carry out the heavenly function and enjoy the riches of Christ. After receiving and enjoying the riches, Rebekah was willing to leave her father&rsquo;s house immediately and follow the old servant to go to Isaac and be married to Isaac to be loved by him. He was comforted, and she also enjoyed all the riches which Isaac had inherited from his father. This signifies that the church is willing to forsake her relatives in the flesh and follow the Holy Spirit to come to Christ. Moreover, at the close of this age, the church will be married to Christ to be His eternally beloved counterpart for His full satisfaction and thus be able to enjoy all the riches which He has inherited from God the Father.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>In the case of Isaac and Rebekah, briefly describe the Christ typified by Isaac.</li><li>Briefly explain how Rebekah typifies the church chosen and prepared by God.</li><li>Briefly explain how Rebekah is a type of the church&rsquo;s having received the Holy Spirit as a seal and a pledge and having also received the spiritual gifts.</li><li>Briefly explain how Rebekah is a type of the church&rsquo;s willingness to leave her relatives and follow the Holy Spirit to go to Christ.</li><li>Briefly explain how Rebekah is a type of the church&rsquo;s being married to Christ to be His beloved counterpart for Christ&rsquo;s satisfaction.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE LADDER SET UP ON THE EARTH<br />AND REACHING TO HEAVEN<br />AND BETHEL</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven typifying Christ as the way for the communication between God&rsquo;s elect on the earth and their God in heaven:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Set up on the earth and reaching to heaven, signifying that Christ brings the earth into communication and union with heaven.</li><li>The angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder, signifying that the ministering angels serve from the earth to heaven for the sake of God&rsquo;s elect.</li><li>God speaking to Jacob above the ladder, signifying that God converses from heaven with His elect on the earth through Christ.</li></ol></li><li>Bethel as God&rsquo;s house on the earth typifying the church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Produced by the pouring of oil on the stone, signifying that the church is formed by the pouring of the Holy Spirit on the believers as stones.</li><li>As the gate of heaven, signifying that the church is the entrance leading to heaven.</li><li>Becoming the hope of God&rsquo;s wandering elect, signifying that the church is the home and the hope of the roaming and wandering believers.</li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>After Isaac and Rebekah as a type of Christ and the church, we have the ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven in Jacob&rsquo;s dream and Bethel as the house of God on the earth as types portraying Christ and the church in another aspect.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE LADDER SET UP ON THE EARTH<br />AND REACHING TO HEAVEN TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />AS THE WAY FOR THE COMMUNICATION<br />BETWEEN GOD&rsquo;S ELECT ON THE EARTH<br />AND THEIR GOD IN HEAVEN</h2><p>Genesis 28 shows us that Jacob was forced to leave his home and family, and from Beersheba he went toward Padan-aram. He came into a situation where he was lonely and helpless. Because the sun had set, he took a stone and made it his pillow, and lay down in that place to sleep. In his dream he saw a ladder set up on the earth with its top reaching to heaven and the angels of God ascending and descending on it (vv. 10-12). The dream that Jacob had was fulfilled in the New Testament, in John 1:51, where the Lord Jesus said to Nathanael, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; The Son of Man here is the ladder in Genesis 28:12. This reveals that the ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven which Jacob saw in his dream typifies Christ as the way for the communication between God&rsquo;s elect on the earth and their God in heaven. Through Christ as the heavenly ladder, the living way (John 14:6), God and we, we and God, can have contact and communication with one another.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Set Up on the Earth and Reaching to Heaven,<br />Signifying That Christ Brings the Earth<br />into Communication and Union with Heaven</h2><p>Christ as the heavenly ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven signifies that He brings the earth into communication and union with heaven. He is the One who brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven. First, through His incarnation He brought heaven to earth; then, He went through death and resurrection to join earth to heaven. Now He is not only in heaven but also on earth. Christ has been set up on the earth and has reached into heaven for the purpose of bringing God to us and bringing us to God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Angels of God Ascending and Descending<br />on the Ladder, Signifying That<br />the Ministering Angels Serve from the Earth<br />to Heaven for the Sake of God&rsquo;s Elect</h2><p>On the ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven the angels of God were ascending and descending. The angels of God are the ministering spirits, sent forth for service for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation (Heb. 1:14). They ascend and descend on Christ as the heavenly ladder, signifying that they serve from the earth to heaven for the sake of us, God&rsquo;s elect.</p><h2 class="head2">C. God Speaking to Jacob above the Ladder,<br />Signifying That God Converses from Heaven<br />with His Elect on the Earth<br />through Christ</h2><p>In his dream Jacob saw Jehovah standing above the ladder and speaking to him, giving him the promise concerning his seed and the land and giving him also the blessing for his living (Gen. 28:13-15). This signifies that God converses from heaven with His elect on the earth through Christ. Hebrews 1:2 says that God &ldquo;has...spoken to us in the Son [Christ].&rdquo; Today, in the New Testament age, God is speaking through Christ that we may know God&rsquo;s intention and enjoy God&rsquo;s promise and supply.</p><h2 class="head1">II. BETHEL AS GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE ON THE EARTH<br />TYPIFYING THE CHURCH AS<br />GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE ON THE EARTH</h2><p>In Genesis 28:16-17 Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, &ldquo;Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it.&rdquo; And he was afraid and said, &ldquo;How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.&rdquo; Jacob&rsquo;s calling that place the house of God must have been the result of a revelation from God. This indicates that Christ, as the ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven, keeps heaven open to earth and joins earth to heaven for the producing of the house of God, Bethel, which is God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Today this dwelling place is the church (Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Tim. 3:15).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Produced by the Pouring of Oil on the Stone,<br />Signifying That the Church Is Formed<br />by the Pouring of the Holy Spirit<br />on the Believers as Stones</h2><p>Genesis 28:18-19 goes on to say, &ldquo;And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head, and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel.&rdquo; And he vowed a vow to God, saying, &ldquo;This stone, which I have set as a pillar, will be God&rsquo;s house&rdquo; (v. 22). First, he made the stone his pillow. Next, he set the stone up for a pillar. The pillow is for man&rsquo;s rest, and the pillar is for God&rsquo;s building. Jacob&rsquo;s making the pillow-stone a pillar signifies that, first, Christ is the stone as the lodging for the wandering believers, and then He is the material for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth. He is a living stone, and those who draw near to Him also become living stones to be material for God&rsquo;s building (1 Pet. 2:4-5).</p><p>Jacob poured oil on the stone and made it Bethel, the house of God. Here oil signifies the Spirit as the ultimate expression of the Triune God for reaching people. The stone signifies a transformed believer. Thus, the stone which was set up as a pillar and which had the oil poured upon it, symbolizes that the transformed believers are one with the Triune God so that they become the house of God. In John chapter one we see also that prior to the mentioning of Christ, the heavenly ladder, as the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s dream (v. 51), there is the mentioning of the outpouring of the Spirit (v. 33) and the stone for building (v. 42).</p><p>We were made of dust (Gen. 2:7). Our life and nature were natural. However, at the time of our regeneration Christ was wrought into us as the divine element within us to be the pillow-stone for rest in our human life and to transform us into stones as pillars for the building of God&rsquo;s house. Furthermore, He pours the Holy Spirit upon us for us to be mingled with the Triune God for the constituting of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth&mdash;Bethel&mdash;the house for the mutual enjoyment and mutual satisfaction of God and man.</p><h2 class="head2">B. As the Gate of Heaven, Signifying That<br />the Church Is the Entrance Leading to Heaven</h2><p>Jacob called the place where he met God the house of God and the gate of heaven (Gen. 28:17b). Although that place was on the earth, it was joined to heaven. This signifies that the church, constituted with the transformed believers, is not only the house of God but also the entrance to heaven; it is the house of God that brings the earth into union and communication with heaven. Here, the believers are one with Christ, in union with Christ, and in communication with heaven, and here also the earth is joined to heaven and heaven is brought to the earth.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Becoming the Hope of God&rsquo;s Wandering Elect,<br />Signifying That the Church Is the Home and<br />the Hope of the Roaming and Wandering Believers</h2><p>In Genesis 28 Jacob was homeless and without rest (vv. 10-11). He had lost nearly everything and had no hope and no future. Under such a circumstance he was met by God. As a result, he saw the vision of a ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven and he also received the revelation concerning God&rsquo;s dwelling place, Bethel. Thus, Bethel became the hope of God&rsquo;s wandering elect, who left their home and wandered about, sleeping at night in the open air. This signifies that the church is the home and the hope of the roaming, wandering believers. Before we enter the church life, we do not have real satisfaction and rest; we are always suffering hardships and wandering about. However, when we come to Bethel, the house of God, and set up our pillow-stone for rest, which is the subjective Christ within us, as a pillar to be the material for the building of God&rsquo;s house, we experience the pouring forth of the Holy Spirit and enjoy the satisfaction and rest of God&rsquo;s house.</p><p>Jacob&rsquo;s dream was fulfilled first when the children of Israel erected the tabernacle in the wilderness after their being delivered out of Egypt; that was God&rsquo;s first house among men. Later, when the children of Israel built the temple in the good land, God had a more solid house on the earth. In the New Testament the church is the house of God. Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth the New Jerusalem will be God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place (Rev. 22:1-3), where God and we, we and God, will enjoy eternal rest and satisfaction. Today we are in the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s dream. We have not only the heavenly ladder, the stone, the pillar, and the oil, but also Bethel, the house of God. This house is a mingling of divinity with humanity, a composition of the Triune God and the transformed believers, as the place of rest and satisfaction for both God and man, a place where heaven and earth are merged.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven in Jacob&rsquo;s dream and Bethel as the house of God on the earth are types of Christ and the church. The ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven typifies Christ as the way for the communication between God&rsquo;s elect on the earth and their God in heaven. The ladder&rsquo;s being set up on the earth and reaching to heaven signifies that Christ brings the earth into communication and union with heaven. The angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder signifies that the ministering angels serve from the earth to heaven for the sake of God&rsquo;s chosen people. God&rsquo;s speaking to Jacob above the ladder to give him the promise concerning his seed and the land and to give him also the blessing for his living signifies that God speaks from heaven to His elect on the earth through Christ that they may know God&rsquo;s intention and enjoy God&rsquo;s promise and supply.</p><p>Bethel as God&rsquo;s house on the earth typifies the church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth. That Bethel was produced by the pouring of oil on the stone signifies that the church is formed by the pouring of the Holy Spirit on the believers as stones. That place was also the gate of heaven, signifying that the church, which is composed of the transformed saints, is not only the house of God but also the entrance leading to heaven that the earth and heaven may be in union and communication with one another. Eventually, Bethel became the hope of God&rsquo;s wandering elect, who left their home and wandered about, sleeping at night in the open air, signifying that the church is the home and the hope of the roaming, wandering believers.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain how the ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven is a type of Christ as the way for the communication between God&rsquo;s elect on the earth and their God in heaven.</li><li>Briefly explain the significance of the ladder&rsquo;s being set up on the earth and reaching to heaven.</li><li>What is the significance of God&rsquo;s speaking to Jacob above the ladder?</li><li>Briefly state the significance of how Bethel is produced by the pouring of oil on the stone.</li><li>Briefly state the significance of Bethel&rsquo;s being the hope of God&rsquo;s wandering elect.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON TEN</h1><h1 class="title">JOSEPH</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Joseph in what he was and in his sufferings typifying Christ:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>As the Beloved of God the Father.</li><li>Hated, rejected, and put to death by His brothers in the flesh.</li><li>Numbered with two criminals.</li><li>Released from the place of death.</li></ol></li><li>Joseph being made the ruler of a nation and becoming one who distributed food to save people from dying of famine typifying Christ being exalted by God and made:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The Leader with authority to rule over all things.</li><li>The Savior who gives people the bread of life to save them from death.</li></ol></li><li>Joseph taking an Egyptian woman as his wife typifying Christ acquiring the Gentile church.</li><li>Joseph making himself known to his brothers typifying Christ meeting with the children of Israel.</li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>After showing us how the ladder and Bethel signify another aspect of Christ and the church, Genesis goes on to show us how Christ was exalted by God and made the Ruler and the Savior. This is signified by the life of Joseph.</p><p>I. JOSEPH IN WHAT HE WAS<br />AND IN HIS SUFFERINGS<br />TYPIFYING CHRIST</p><h2 class="head2">A. As the Beloved of God the Father</h2><p>According to the biography of Joseph recorded in the Bible, he was altogether perfect, without defect. Joseph is the perfect one in the Old Testament, and Christ is the perfect One in the New Testament. Hence, Joseph is the perfect type of Christ. Genesis 37:3 says that Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons. The Gospel of Matthew also records that after the baptism of the Lord Jesus and at the time of His transfiguration, God the Father declared, saying, &ldquo;This is My Son, the Beloved&rdquo; (3:17; 17:5). This indicates that according to what Joseph was, he typifies Christ as the Beloved of God the Father.</p><p>B. Hated, Rejected, and Put to Death<br />by His Brothers in the Flesh</p><p>Joseph was a type of Christ as the Beloved of God the Father, yet he was hated, rejected, and put to death by his brothers in the flesh (Gen. 37:4-5, 8, 18-28). His brothers could not speak peaceably with him because of their father&rsquo;s partial love for him and because he brought to their father evil reports regarding them (vv. 2-4). Furthermore, he told his brothers that in his dreams they, signified by the sheaves and the stars, bowed down to him. This caused his brothers to hate him more and to envy him (vv. 5-11). Later, when he went to see his brothers according to his father&rsquo;s will, they conspired against him to slay him. They said to one another, &ldquo;Here comes this master of dreams. Now then, come and let us slay him...&rdquo; (vv. 19-20). Eventually, because of Judah&rsquo;s proposal, he was sold to the Ishmaelites (vv. 25-27) and thus escaped death. Then he was brought down to Egypt, sold to an officer of Pharaoh&rsquo;s (v. 36), and later was delivered into the prison of death (39:20). Thus, he was hated and rejected by his flesh brothers, and eventually he was delivered by the world, signified by Egypt, into the prison of death.</p><p>Likewise, Christ as the Beloved of God the Father was sent to minister to God&rsquo;s children (John 6:38), yet they hated Him. According to the record of the Gospels, the Jewish leaders hated Christ, conspired against Him, and plotted to kill Him. Eventually, He was betrayed by Judas, one of His twelve disciples, and was arrested by the Jewish leaders (Matt. 26:47-56), who delivered Him to Pilate (27:1-2) of the Roman government, signifying the world, and thus He was crucified (v. 35).</p><p>C. Numbered with Two Criminals</p><p>During the period of his imprisonment, Joseph was confined with two criminals, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker of the king of Egypt, one of whom was restored and the other executed (Gen. 40:1-23). These two criminals typify the two criminals who were crucified with Christ. After Christ was betrayed, He was put into the place of death (Acts 2:23). He was crucified between two criminals and was numbered with them. One of them was saved and the other perished (Luke 23:32, 39-43).</p><p>D. Released from the Place of Death</p><p>Joseph&rsquo;s coming out of the prison of death (Gen. 41:14) typifies Christ&rsquo;s release from the place of death (Acts 2:24). After Christ was crucified, He stayed in Hades for three days. In those three days the power of death did its best to imprison Him. But it was impossible for Him to be held by death because He is not only life but also resurrection. Therefore, He walked out of death. To Him, this walking out of death was His resurrection. As Joseph was released from prison, so Christ was also released from death.</p><h2 class="head1">II. JOSEPH BEING MADE THE RULER OF A NATION<br />AND BECOMING ONE WHO DISTRIBUTED FOOD<br />TO SAVE PEOPLE FROM DYING OF FAMINE TYPIFYING CHRIST BEING EXALTED BY GOD AND MADE:</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Leader with Authority<br />to Rule over All Things</h2><p>On the same day Joseph was released from prison, he was given authority to become the actual ruler over the whole land of Egypt (Gen. 41:40-44). In like manner, after His resurrection Christ was given authority (Matt. 28:18). Acts 2:36 says that the crucified and resurrected Christ has been made both Lord and Christ. Hence, Joseph&rsquo;s being made the ruler of a nation typifies Christ&rsquo;s being exalted by God and made the Ruler over all things (Matt. 28:18; Acts 2:36; Rev. 3:21).</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Savior Who Gives People<br />the Bread of Life to Save Them from Death</h2><p>Regarding Joseph&rsquo;s being the sustainer of life to distribute food, the record of the Bible is marvelous. Pharaoh had two dreams, the first of cows and the second of ears of corn (Gen. 41:1-7). Both the cows and the grain are good for food, and they represent the animal life and the vegetable life. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, before the fall man ate only of the vegetable life (1:29). After the fall, however, man was told to eat meat because of the need for the shedding of blood for redemption (9:3). Thus, the fallen man had to take as his supply the vegetable life and the animal life. At the Lord&rsquo;s table we see the bread and the blood. The blood comes out of the Lord&rsquo;s sacrificial life for redemption, and the bread comes from His regenerating life for life&rsquo;s reproduction. In John 1:29 John the Baptist said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb.&rdquo; This is the animal life for redemption. In John 12:24 the Lord compared Himself to a grain of wheat falling into the earth to reproduce by life. This is the vegetable life for regenerating. Both kinds of life are mentioned in Genesis 41.</p><p>Hence, Joseph&rsquo;s becoming the One who distributed food to save the people from dying of famine typifies Christ&rsquo;s being exalted by God to become the Savior who gives life to people to save them from death.</p><h2 class="head1">III. JOSEPH TAKING AN EGYPTIAN WOMAN<br />AS HIS WIFE TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />ACQUIRING THE GENTILE CHURCH</h2><p>Although Joseph was rejected by his brothers, after he was released from prison and enthroned with authority in Egypt, he took as his wife Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On. Joseph&rsquo;s wife was a heathen, an Egyptian. This also is a type portraying how Christ, in His resurrection and exaltation after the time of His rejection by the Israelites, has acquired the Gentile church in the Gentile land.</p><p>Of his wife, Asenath, Joseph begot two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. The name Manasseh means &ldquo;causing to forget.&rdquo; With the birth of Manasseh Joseph forgot all his afflictions. This indicates that when the church is productive, Christ will declare that He has forgotten His afflictions. The name Ephraim means &ldquo;fruitful.&rdquo; Joseph not only forgot his afflictions but was also fruitful. This indicates that when we preach the gospel and produce fruit, Christ will be happy and declare, &ldquo;There is no more affliction but fruitfulness.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">IV. JOSEPH MAKING HIMSELF KNOWN<br />TO HIS BROTHERS TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />MEETING WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h2><p>The Scriptures prophesy that the children of Israel will be forced to turn to Christ just as Joseph&rsquo;s brothers were forced to turn to Joseph for food (Gen. 42:1-5). Zechariah 12:10 says, &ldquo;They will look upon Me, whom they have pierced; and they will wail over Him with wailing as for an only son and cry bitterly over Him with bitter crying as for a firstborn son.&rdquo; In Romans 11:26 Paul says, &ldquo;And thus all Israel will be saved, as it is written, &lsquo;The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.&rsquo;&rdquo; In the future, Israel will be forced to turn to Christ.</p><p>When Joseph&rsquo;s brothers turned to him, Joseph recognized them, but they did not know him (Gen. 42:8). Hence, Joseph tested them again and again (42:9-16; 44:1-13), disciplined them (42:17-24), and repeatedly showed love to them (42:25; 43:29-34). However, they did not know him and were ignorant of his love. Eventually, Joseph acknowledged his ignorant brothers (45:1-4), and his brothers also recognized him (45:15). All these things are types. Joseph&rsquo;s making himself known to his brothers in his reigning is a type of Christ&rsquo;s meeting with His flesh relatives, the children of Israel, when He will obtain the kingdom. At that time, the nations will gather together to besiege Jerusalem. At the very moment of peril, Christ will descend and His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split at its middle toward the east and toward the west into a very great valley. Then the persecuted Israelites will flee into the valley (Zech. 14:1-5). At that time they will lift up their heads to look and they will see the Messiah, their Deliverer, Jesus the Nazarene, whom they had pierced. Then they will repent and turn to the Lord and be saved. The Lord will send His angels to gather them together from the four winds to the good land that God gave to their forefathers (Matt. 24:30-31).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The life of Joseph signifies how Christ was exalted by God and made the Ruler and the Savior. In what he was and in his sufferings Joseph typifies Christ as the One who was beloved of God the Father, yet hated, rejected, and put to death by His brothers in the flesh. During the period of his imprisonment in the prison of death, Joseph was confined with two criminals, one of whom was restored and the other executed. This typifies Christ, who was crucified with two criminals, one of whom was saved and the other perished. Later, Joseph&rsquo;s coming out of the prison of death typifies Christ&rsquo;s release from death.</p><p>After Joseph was released from prison, he was immediately given authority to become the actual ruler over the whole land of Egypt. This is a type of Christ&rsquo;s being exalted by God and made the Leader with authority to rule over all things. Furthermore, Joseph became one who distributed food to save people from dying of famine, typifying that after His exaltation Christ has become the Savior who gives life to people to save them from death. After he was released from prison and enthroned with authority, Joseph took Asenath, an Egyptian woman, as his wife, typifying that after His resurrection Christ has acquired the Gentile church in the Gentile land.

THE LION OF JUDAH TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />AS THE ULTIMATE OVERCOMER</h2><p>Genesis 49 gives a record of the mature Jacob&rsquo;s prophesying with blessing concerning his twelve sons. In Jacob&rsquo;s prophecy he likened Judah to a lion (v. 9). The lion of Judah typifies Christ as the ultimate Overcomer. Revelation 5:5 reveals that Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah has overcome. He has accomplished everything that God required of Him. He took away sin, solved the problem of the world, defeated Satan, abolished death, and eliminated every negative thing.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Young Lion Signifying Christ<br />in His Freshness and Strength<br />Overcoming All the Enemies</h2><p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Judah is a young lion; / From the prey, my son, you have gone up.&rdquo; The young lion signifies Christ in His freshness and strength overcoming all the enemies. The lion stayed on the mountain, but he came down from the mountain to capture his prey as food. After he seized his prey, he went back to the mountain to enjoy it. When Christ was on earth and was crucified on the cross, He was a young lion seizing the prey. Ephesians 4:8 says, &ldquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive.&rdquo; <em>Those taken captive</em> refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and took them to Himself. This indicates that He conquered and overcame Satan, who had captured them by sin and death. As the young lion, He has overcome all His enemies.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Couching Lion<br />Signifying Christ in His Skillfulness<br />Resting in the Enjoyment of the Fruit<br />of His Victory</h2><p>Verse 9 goes on to say, &ldquo;He couches, he stretches out like a lion.&rdquo; The couching lion signifies Christ in His skillfulness resting in the enjoyment of the fruit of His victory. The young lion in his freshness is for fighting and for gaining the victory. The couching lion is skillful, indicating that he has gained the victory and devoured the prey and that he is now resting in satisfaction. Christ is now the One enjoying His rest in the heavens. After gaining the victory and enjoying the prey, He is satisfied. This rest and satisfaction is the issue of Christ&rsquo;s victory.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Lioness Signifying Christ<br />in His Strong Producing</h2><p>Verse 9 also says that Judah was like a lioness. The lioness signifies that Christ in His strong producing has produced many overcomers. Hence, Christ is not only the fighting lion and the resting lion but also the producing lioness. We are lion cubs produced by Him, and the church is lion country. Toward men we are lambs following the Lamb; but toward Satan we are lion cubs. We are overcomers produced by the overcoming Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Judah&rsquo;s Hand Being<br />on the Neck of the Enemies Indicating<br />that He Has the Power<br />to Capture the Enemies</h2><p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies.&rdquo; Judah&rsquo;s hand being on the neck of the enemies indicates that he has the power to capture the enemies, making them powerless to resist and thus gaining the final victory over them. Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah is the ultimate Overcomer.</p><h2 class="head2">E. No One Daring to Rouse Judah Up<br />Indicating That His Terrifying Power<br />Subdues Everything</h2><p>The last part of verse 9 says, &ldquo;Who will rouse him up?&rdquo; Some versions say, &ldquo;Who dares to rouse him?&rdquo; No one daring to rouse him up indicates that his terrifying power subdues everything. After His death and resurrection Christ has received all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). Furthermore, God has exalted Him to the highest place (Phil. 2:9), far above all rule and authority and power and lordship (Eph. 1:21). Hence, all things are subjected under His feet (v. 22), subdued under His terrifying power.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Praise and Worship to Judah<br />by His Brothers<br />Signifying Praise and Worship<br />to Christ by God&rsquo;s People</h2><p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Judah, your brothers will praise you; / ...Your father&rsquo;s sons will bow down before you.&rdquo; This indicates that Judah&rsquo;s brothers would praise and worship him for his victory and reigning. That praise and worship were rendered to Judah by his brothers signifies that praise and worship will be rendered to Christ by God&rsquo;s people. Christ is worthy to receive praise and worship from all of us who are saved by His grace.</p><h2 class="head1">II. SHILOH TYPIFYING CHRIST AS THE PEACE-GIVER</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Scepter and the Staff Signifying Ruling<br />as King and Bringing in Peace</h2><p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;The scepter will not depart from Judah, / Nor the ruler&rsquo;s staff from between his feet, / Until Shiloh comes, / And to Him shall be the obedience of the peoples.&rdquo; This prophetic blessing also concerns Christ. Christ&rsquo;s victory brings in Christ&rsquo;s kingdom. In His victorious resurrection Christ received all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18), and after His ascension He also received the kingdom. The fact that the nations today use Christ&rsquo;s calendar is proof that they are under the jurisdiction of Christ. Christ is the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5b).</p><p>The scepter in verse 10 is a symbol of the kingdom, and it denotes kingship, signifying Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, Christ&rsquo;s kingship. For the scepter never to depart from Judah means the kingship will never depart from Christ. <em>Staff</em> is synonymous with <em>scepter,</em> and it refers to the ruler&rsquo;s staff. Christ is the Ruler who has the authority, the staff and scepter of the kingship. The ruler&rsquo;s staff will not depart from between his feet. The words <em>between his feet</em> are a poetic term denoting seed or posterity. This means that Judah has the kingship, and rulers will come out of his posterity. Christ is also his descendant, who became the Lion of the tribe of Judah. He has won the victory and is exercising His kingship. When Christ comes again as Shiloh, the Peace-giver, He will be the Prince of peace, who will bring peace to the whole earth. At that time the whole earth will enjoy peace; nations will not lift the sword against nations, nor will they learn war anymore (Isa. 2:4). When we are under the heavenly ruling of Christ in the church life today, we enjoy Him as Shiloh, as our Peace-giver.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Peoples Being Obedient to Shiloh<br />Signifying All Nations<br />Coming to Christ and Obeying His Kingship<br />in Peace and Security</h2><p>The last part of verse 10 says, &ldquo;To Him shall be the obedience of the peoples.&rdquo; The peoples here are equivalent to the nations. At the second coming of Christ, all nations will come to Christ and obey Him, submitting themselves under His kingship, in peace and security. They will come and appear before Him to receive God&rsquo;s instructions (Isa. 2:2-3; 11:10). Then the kingdom on earth will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever (Rev. 11:15).</p><p>Among the eleven types in Genesis which we have covered in these lessons, only Sarah and Hagar are types of two covenants, the covenant of promise and the covenant of law, while all the rest are types and portrayals either of Christ or of Christ and the church.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The lion of Judah and Shiloh typify Christ&rsquo;s victory and peace. The lion of Judah typifies Christ as the ultimate Overcomer, who has accomplished everything God required of Him. He took away sin, solved the problem of the world, defeated Satan, abolished death, and eliminated every negative thing. The young lion signifies Christ in His freshness and strength overcoming all the enemies; He rescued us from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and took us to Himself. The couching lion signifies that Christ in His skillfulness is resting in the enjoyment of the fruit of His victory; now He is enjoying His rest and satisfaction in the heavens. The lioness signifies that Christ in His strong producing produces many overcomers to deal with the enemy, Satan. Judah&rsquo;s hand would be on the neck of his enemies and no one would dare to rouse him up; his brothers would praise and worship him. All these things signify that Christ has the power to capture the enemy that all things may be subjected under His feet and subdued under His terrifying power; in His victory and reigning He will receive praise and worship from God&rsquo;s people.</p><p>Shiloh typifies Christ as the Peace-giver. In His victorious resurrection Christ has received all authority in heaven and on earth, and after His ascension He has also received the kingdom. When Christ comes again as Shiloh, the Peace-giver, He will be the Prince of peace, who will bring peace to the whole earth. Moreover, all nations will come to Christ and obey Him, submitting themselves under His kingship, in peace and security. Then the kingdom on earth will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain the three aspects in which the lion of Judah typifies Christ.</li><li>What are the significances of Judah&rsquo;s hand being on the neck of the enemies, no one daring to rouse him up, and his being praised and worshipped by his brothers?</li><li>Briefly explain the type of Shiloh and the spiritual significance of the scepter and the staff.</li><li>What will be the situation on the whole earth when Christ as the Peace-giver comes again?</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON TWELVE</h1><h1 class="title">ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB<br />WITH JOSEPH</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Chosen and called by God the Father:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Chosen&mdash;seen in Jacob.</li><li>Called&mdash;seen in Abraham.</li></ol></li><li>Redeemed and made an heir by God the Son:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Redeemed&mdash;seen in Isaac.</li><li>Made an heir&mdash;seen in Isaac.</li></ol></li><li>Transformed into a prince of God by God the Spirit:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Transformed&mdash;seen in Jacob.</li><li>Into a prince of God:<ol class="decimal"><li>Reigning over the entire land of Egypt through Joseph.</li><li>Blessing the whole earth through Joseph.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph as the last four main persons in Genesis constitute a complete type portraying the different stages and aspects of the experiences of a complete person chosen, called, redeemed, and transformed by the Triune God.</p><p>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph are a complete unit in the experience of life. We should not consider them as separate individuals, but as different aspects of one complete spiritually mature person&rsquo;s complete experience of God. Hence, although the Triune God is one God, He became the God of three persons&mdash;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Exo. 3:15). The Triune God in three aspects is for the complete experience in three sections of a person who is mature in life.</p><h2 class="head1">I. CHOSEN AND CALLED<br />BY GOD THE FATHER</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Chosen&mdash;Seen in Jacob</h2><p>In Jacob we clearly see God&rsquo;s selection (Gen. 25:21-26). Romans 9:10-13, referring to Jacob and Esau, says, &ldquo;Rebecca ... having conceived by one, Isaac our father, though the children had not yet been born nor had done anything good or bad (that the purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works but of Him who calls), it was said to her, &lsquo;The greater shall serve the less&rsquo;; as it is written, &lsquo;Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.&rsquo;&rdquo; Jacob was chosen before his birth. It was not of his own works, nor was it the issue of his own struggle and strife, but of God who calls. God&rsquo;s selection altogether depends on His pleasure and mercy (Rom. 9:15-16).</p><p>In like manner, we believers were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). God the Father&rsquo;s choosing is His selection. He exercised His divine foreknowledge (1 Pet. 1:2) and chose us out of numberless people, not because of our works but absolutely because of His mercy.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Called&mdash;Seen in Abraham</h2><p>God the Father called us according to His selection. Calling is the beginning of God&rsquo;s work of recovery, and its starting point was Abraham. When the man whom God created for Himself fell and forsook God, God came in to call man that He might have a new beginning with fallen man. He called and transferred man from the created Adamic race to the called Abrahamic race, from the life of the old creation to the life of the new creation, for the fulfilling of His eternal purpose in the creation of man.</p><p>Abraham was called twice. The first time was in Ur of the Chaldees in Mesopotamia. The God of glory appeared to him there, telling him to come out from his land and his relatives and go into the land which God would show him (Acts 7:2-4). The second time was in Haran, where God called him again to leave not only his land and kindred but also his father&rsquo;s house, and from where God removed him into the good land of Canaan. Moreover, God promised to make him a great nation and a blessing to all the families of the earth (Gen. 12:1-3).</p><p>We, the believers in Christ, have also been called by God the Father (1 Thes. 2:12; 2 Tim. 1:9). In eternity past God the Father chose us, and then in time He called us according to His purpose (Rom. 8:28) and grace (2 Tim. 1:9-10) through His own glory and virtue (2 Pet. 1:3) that we might be regenerated and saved to have a new beginning and to partake of His glory. As the God of glory, He cannot be defeated and He does not give up. No matter what our condition is in the way that we follow Him, His calling is irrevocable (Rom. 11:29) and it has such a great hope (Eph. 1:18).</p><h2 class="head1">II. REDEEMED AND MADE AN HEIR BY GOD THE SON</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Redeemed&mdash;Seen in Isaac</h2><p>Following the calling of God the Father is the redemption of Christ the Son. This is because the man whom God created became fallen and forsook God before he was called. Therefore, after God the Father&rsquo;s calling of man, God the Son&rsquo;s redemption is needed to bring man back to God. This is seen in Isaac. In testing Abraham, God charged him to offer Isaac, his only son whom he loved, for a burnt offering (Gen. 22:1-2). By faith Abraham obeyed God and brought Isaac to the place of which God had told him and built an altar there. As he was preparing to offer up Isaac, he experienced God&rsquo;s provision of a ram as a replacement of his son Isaac (22:9-13). The ram which was killed instead of Isaac is a type of Christ. Just as the ram was killed and sacrificed instead of Isaac, so Christ, the Lamb of God, became our Substitute (1 Pet. 3:18) through His crucifixion on the cross for our redemption. In Genesis 22:8 Abraham prophesied that God would provide Himself the lamb for a burnt offering. Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be the redeeming Lamb for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:19-20; John 1:29). This was done according to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and plan; it did not happen accidentally. Hence, in God&rsquo;s eternal view, Christ was slain and became the redemption to God&rsquo;s people from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8), that is, from the fall of man.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Made an Heir&mdash;Seen In Isaac</h2><p>Isaac, who was born of grace and redeemed by God, became the unique heir of Abraham&rsquo;s possessions (Gen. 21:9-12; Gal. 4:30). He was born according to God&rsquo;s promise by God&rsquo;s visitation; hence, he was the proper, legal heir to inherit his father&rsquo;s possessions. All that his father had was his. It was absolutely and unconditionally by grace, not by his effort, that he became the heir of his father&rsquo;s riches. The record of Isaac&rsquo;s life shows that his life was a life of rest and enjoyment. Throughout his entire life he never suffered thirst, for wherever he went there was a well for his enjoyment (25:11; 26:18-33). He secured a choice bride without doing anything (24:61-67). He prayed to God and gained twin sons (25:20-26). Moreover, he was blessed by God in receiving a hundredfold harvest and becoming great (26:12-14). Isaac inherited not only all that his father had but also the promise which God had given to his father concerning the good land and the unique seed, which is Christ, in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed (26:3-5).</p><p>We, the New Testament believers, are children born according to promise. Like Isaac, we are born not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit, as heirs of God (Rom. 8:17), having the full right to participate in God&rsquo;s promised blessing (Gal. 4:28-30), that is, to enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit (Gal. 3:14) with all the riches of Christ. We simply need to be the same as Isaac, destined to be a person of rest and enjoyment, always living under the provision of God&rsquo;s grace and enjoying all the promised blessings of God the Father.</p><h2 class="head1">III. TRANSFORMED INTO A PRINCE OF GOD<br />BY GOD THE SPIRIT</h2><p>The work carried out by the Triune God in us may be divided into three stages: first, God the Father&rsquo;s choosing and calling us; next, God the Son&rsquo;s redeeming us and making us heirs; and finally, God the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming us and making us kings of God. We were chosen and called by God the Father; we were also redeemed and made heirs by God the Son; and now we are in the process of being transformed by God the Spirit that we may become kings of God. This experience is seen in Jacob with Joseph. Jacob stands for the transformed life, and Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the transformed life.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Transformed&mdash;Seen in Jacob</h2><p>Our proper and complete experience of the Triune God is from our being chosen by God to our becoming kings of God, both of which are clearly seen in Jacob. Jacob was born a supplanter. When he was in his mother&rsquo;s womb, he fought with Esau over who would be great, and he held on to Esau&rsquo;s heel, not wanting to let Esau come out first. From the beginning he was such a person, one who was full of human strength and the natural life. He was also subtle and crafty, skillful in scheming, and capable in exercising his mind. He subtly acquired the birthright from his brother and, by cheating, obtained his father&rsquo;s blessing. Later, he was forced to leave his loving mother and his father&rsquo;s house. From then on, God&rsquo;s disciplining and dealing hand was always on him (Gen. 25:22&mdash;32:32). Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty Jacob arrived at his uncle Laban&rsquo;s home, and under Laban&rsquo;s squeezing hand he served Laban for twenty years, during which time his wages were changed ten times and he went through all kinds of sufferings (31:38-41). The envy, competition, and wrestling between his two wives, Leah and Rachel, in bearing children (29:31&mdash;30:24) also put him in a predicament. All these grindings in the environment were used by God to deal with Jacob from all sides in order to transform him.</p><p>Genesis 32:22-32 relates a crucial experience in the life of Jacob, God&rsquo;s chosen one. While Jacob remained alone at the ford of Jabbok, God came in the form of a man to wrestle with him in order to expose his natural life. Moreover, God touched the hollow of his thigh and made him crippled. God changed his name to Israel, indicating that, having been dealt with directly by God, his life was broken and was no longer whole but was genuinely transformed.</p><p>After we have been regenerated and saved, God the Spirit enters into us to be our life and to carry out a transforming work in us. Through the working together of all things (Rom. 8:28), the direct dealings of God, and the dispensing of the divine element by the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18), we are being transformed metabolically until we are conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son (Rom. 8:29).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Into a Prince of God</h2><p>Eventually, under God&rsquo;s leading and shepherding for his whole life, Jacob, who had been a supplanter, became Israel (meaning &ldquo;the prince of God&rdquo;&mdash;Gen. 32:28), a matured prince of God. When he went down to Egypt and met Pharaoh, he blessed him (47:7, 10). As Jacob was dying, he leaned on the top of his staff and worshipped the God whom he had experienced in a full way in a life of sojourning. Furthermore, he prophesied concerning his twelve sons and blessed them (ch. 49). God honored this matter and certainly fulfilled the blessings pronounced by Jacob. This indicates that Jacob&rsquo;s life had reached maturity so that he could reign for God and bring blessings to his sons and to the whole earth.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Reigning over the Entire Land<br />of Egypt through Joseph</h2><p>The three sections of the experiences of one complete person mature in spiritual life, signified by the three persons&mdash;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&mdash;eventually produce the mature Israel. Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature Israel. This is proved by the fact that the biography of Joseph in the last fourteen chapters of Genesis was considered a part of the record of Jacob (37:2a).</p><p>From his youth Joseph was loved by Jacob, his father, even more than his brothers. Although he ministered to his brothers according to his father&rsquo;s will, he was hated and harassed by his brothers. He was rejected by them and sold and brought down to Egypt. Eventually, he was put into prison and suffered all kinds of trials. However, God was with him, showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison; whatever he did, God caused it to prosper. By interpreting the cupbearer&rsquo;s dream and Pharaoh&rsquo;s dreams, he was released from the prison of death and given authority over the whole country and thus became the actual ruler over Egypt. This typifies that all those who are mature in life will reign for God to rule over the whole earth (Rev. 2:26). At His coming back Christ will establish the millennial kingdom on the earth, in which all those who have been perfected and have matured in life throughout the generations will be co-kings of Christ (Rev. 20:6) to rule over the nations on the earth.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Blessing the Whole Earth through Joseph</h2><p>By the wisdom and authority given by God, Joseph reigned in the maturity of life. He not only ruled over the whole land of Egypt but also blessed the whole earth by ministering food to people for their existence. Genesis 41:56-57 says, &ldquo;And when the famine was over all the face of the earth, Joseph opened all the storehouses....And all the earth came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain.&rdquo; This signifies that all those who have been chosen, called, redeemed, and transformed by the Triune God and have thus become mature will reign for God with the rich life supply of Christ to satisfy people&rsquo;s need.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph constitute a complete type portraying the different stages and aspects of the complete experiences of a person chosen, called, redeemed, and transformed by the Triune God. God the Father&rsquo;s selection is seen in Jacob: Jacob was chosen before his birth; it was not of his own works but of God who calls. This signifies that we believers were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world, not because of our works but absolutely because of His mercy. God the Father&rsquo;s calling is seen in Abraham: Abraham&rsquo;s being called was God&rsquo;s new beginning among men; it was also a transfer of race and a transfer of life. This signifies that we, the believers in Christ, have been called by God the Father according to His purpose and grace that we might be regenerated and saved to have a new beginning and to partake of His glory. God the Son&rsquo;s redemption and His making us heirs are seen in Isaac: When Abraham was preparing to offer up Isaac, God provided a ram to be killed to replace Isaac. This signifies that Christ became our Substitute through His crucifixion on the cross for our redemption. Isaac was born according to God&rsquo;s promise by God&rsquo;s visitation and thus became an heir to inherit all that his father had and the promise which God had given to his father concerning the good land and the unique seed. This signifies that we, the New Testament believers, are children born according to promise to be heirs of God participating in God&rsquo;s promised blessing, that is, enjoying the all-inclusive Spirit with all the riches of Christ. God the Spirit&rsquo;s transformation is seen in Jacob: Jacob was born a supplanter, full of human strength and the natural life. He was broken and experienced genuine transformation after going through God&rsquo;s grindings in the environment and God&rsquo;s direct dealings. This signifies that after we believers have been regenerated and saved, God the Spirit enters into us to be our life and to carry out a transforming work in us. Through the working together of all things, the direct dealings of God, and the dispensing of the divine elements by the Spirit, we are being transformed metabolically until we are conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son. Finally, Jacob&rsquo;s life reached maturity and, through Joseph, he reigned over the whole land of Egypt and blessed the whole earth. This signifies that at the time of Christ&rsquo;s coming back, all those who are mature in life will be co-kings of Christ in the millennial kingdom to rule over the nations on the earth and will reign for God with the rich life supply of Christ to satisfy people&rsquo;s need.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Explain how God the Father&rsquo;s selection is seen in Jacob and what its significance is.</li><li>Explain how God the Father&rsquo;s calling is seen in Abraham and what its significance is.</li><li>Briefly explain how God the Son&rsquo;s redemption and His making us heirs are seen in Isaac and fulfilled in the New Testament believers.</li><li>Briefly explain how God the Spirit&rsquo;s transformation is seen in Jacob and fulfilled in the New Testament believers.</li><li>Explain how the mature Israel&rsquo;s becoming a prince of God and his reigning over the whole land of Egypt and blessing the whole earth through Joseph will be fulfilled in the New Testament believers.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">MOSES</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Moses typifying Christ as the Apostle:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Sent by God.</li><li>Bringing God to His chosen people and bringing God&rsquo;s chosen people into the rich supply of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</li><li>Faithful to God in all the house of God.</li><li>Christ having more honor and being worthy of more glory than Moses.</li><li>Christ being the Son of God over God&rsquo;s house; Moses being a servant of God for a testimony of the things to be spoken later.</li></ol></li><li>Moses typifying Christ as the Prophet of God:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Raised up by God.</li><li>Speaking for God, speaking forth God, and revealing God to His elect.</li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>The types in Exodus are of another line, mostly unveiling Christ as the supply to His believers. First of all, Moses is a type of Christ as the Apostle who brought God to us (Heb. 3:1) and the Prophet who spoke forth God (Acts 3:22-23).</p><h2 class="head1">I. MOSES TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />AS THE APOSTLE</h2><p>The Apostle is the One who was sent to us from God and with God (John 6:46; 8:16, 29). As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness. This is typified by Moses, who was sent by God to serve the house of God (Heb. 3:2-6).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Sent by God</h2><p>In Exodus 3:10 God said to Moses, &ldquo;I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.&rdquo; This shows us that Moses was sent by God to the children of Israel to deliver them out of the tyranny of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Christ as the Apostle sent by God came from God and with God to us (John 8:16, 29) that He might deliver us from the usurpation of Satan and the satanic world (John 17:15-16).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Bringing God to His Chosen People<br />and Bringing God&rsquo;s Chosen People<br />into the Rich Supply of God&rsquo;s Full Salvation</h2><p>Moses was sent by God and God was with him (Exo. 3:12). Hence, when he was sent to the children of Israel, he brought God to them. Furthermore, he would not only bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, the land of slavery, but he would also bring them into Canaan, a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey (Exo. 3:8, 10, 17). Milk and honey signify the two aspects of the riches of Christ&rsquo;s life: the animal life, representing the redeeming life, and the vegetable life, representing the generating life. These two aspects of the riches of Christ are the riches of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Therefore, Christ as the Apostle came from God and with God to us in order to bring God to us and to bring us into the rich supply of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Faithful to God<br />in All the House of God</h2><p>Moses as one sent by God to take care of God&rsquo;s house was faithful to God in all God&rsquo;s house. In Old Testament times the house of God was the house of Israel (Lev. 22:18; Num. 12:7). This typifies that Christ as the Apostle sent by God for God&rsquo;s house, the church, was faithful to Him who constituted Him (Heb. 3:2).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Christ Having More Honor and<br />Being Worthy of More Glory Than Moses</h2><p>Hebrews 3:3-4 says, &ldquo;He [Christ] has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by as much as He who built the house has more honor than the house. For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.&rdquo; This clearly indicates that Christ, who built God&rsquo;s house, is God, and as such, He has more honor and has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, who was built as a part of God&rsquo;s house.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Christ Being the Son of God<br />over God&rsquo;s House;<br />Moses Being a Servant of God for a Testimony<br />of the Things to Be Spoken Later</h2><p>Hebrews 3:5 says, &ldquo;Moses...as a servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken later.&rdquo; <em>Servant</em> here is a designation that implies dignity and freedom. <em>Testimony</em> may also be rendered <em>prefigure.</em> Hence, although Moses was an honorable servant of God, he was merely a type of the real, typical, and genuine Apostle sent from God. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;But Christ...as a Son over His [God&rsquo;s] house.&rdquo; <em>House</em> in Greek denotes <em>family,</em> referring to the members of the house. God&rsquo;s house is not a physical house but a living family; God dwells in His living family, His folks. His folks are His house. Hence, God&rsquo;s house is a living constitution constituted with the many children of God in the Father&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Such a house is built up, ruled over, and taken care of by Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is the Apostle sent by God. Christ is not only building up this house but also ruling over and taking care of it, carrying it on with Him to walk and move with God the Father. This is typified in the Old Testament by Moses, who took care of all God&rsquo;s house, the house of Israel, and led them to walk with God.</p><h2 class="head1">II. MOSES TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />AS THE PROPHET OF GOD</h2><p>A prophet is God&rsquo;s spokesman, not mainly to predict things that are coming but to speak for God and speak forth God by God&rsquo;s revelation. In his forty years of leading the children of Israel, Moses continually spoke to them for God, and especially in Deuteronomy he repeatedly spoke God&rsquo;s words to them. Although it was Moses who spoke, he did not speak his own words; he spoke God&rsquo;s words. He spoke for God, spoke forth God, and spoke God into the children of Israel. Every word he spoke also became God&rsquo;s word. As such a prophet Moses was also a type of Christ (Acts 3:22-23).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Raised Up by God</h2><p>In Deuteronomy 18:15 Moses said, &ldquo;Jehovah your God will raise up for you a Prophet from your midst, from among your brothers, like me; you shall listen to Him.&rdquo; Here it indicates that Moses&rsquo; being a prophet was not of his own doing or of his own making; he was raised up by God. So also is Christ as God&rsquo;s Prophet.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Speaking for God, Speaking forth God,<br />and Revealing God to His Elect</h2><p>Deuteronomy 18:18 says: &ldquo;A Prophet will I raise up for them from the midst of their brothers like you; and I will put My words in His mouth, and He will speak to them all that I command Him.&rdquo; Moses was raised up by God as God&rsquo;s prophet. In his forty years of leading the children of Israel, he was God&rsquo;s spokesman, speaking for God to them all that God commanded him. Likewise, when Christ was on the earth, He spoke to His disciples for God; His teaching was not His but was according to what the Father had taught Him (John 7:16; 8:28b). He did not speak from Himself; as the Father said to Him, so He spoke (John 12:49-50). As God&rsquo;s Prophet, He spoke for God, spoke forth God, and revealed God to the disciples. Today He is still in us speaking for God, speaking forth God, and speaking God into us.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>Moses is a type of Christ as the Apostle who brought God to us and the Prophet who spoke forth God. Moses typifies Christ as the Apostle who was sent by God and who came from God and with God to deliver us from the usurpation of Satan and the satanic world. Moreover, He was faithful to God in all God&rsquo;s house to bring God to us and to bring us into the rich supply of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Christ as the Builder of God&rsquo;s house is God and has more honor and has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, who was built as a part of God&rsquo;s house. Furthermore, although Moses was an honorable servant of God, he was merely a type of the real, typical, and genuine Apostle sent from God. However, Christ as the Son of God is not only building up God&rsquo;s house but also ruling over and taking care of it, carrying it on with Him to walk and move with God the Father.</p><p>Moses typifies Christ as the Prophet of God. Moses&rsquo; being a prophet was not of his own doing or of his own making; he was raised up by God. Moreover, he spoke for God to His elect, spoke forth God, and revealed Him to them. When Christ was on the earth, He spoke to His disciples for God; He did not speak from Himself, but as the Father said to Him, so He spoke. Today Christ is still in us speaking for God, speaking forth God, and speaking God into us.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain how Moses was a type of Christ as the Apostle who was sent by God and who brought God to His elect.</li><li>In being an Apostle, how was Christ superior to Moses?</li><li>Briefly explain how Moses was a type of Christ as God&rsquo;s Prophet.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE PASSOVER,<br />THE CROSSING OF THE RED SEA,<br />AND THE EXODUS FROM EGYPT</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Passover typifying Christ as the believers&rsquo; redemption and supply:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The lamb without blemish being killed and shedding its blood, typifying that the sinless Christ died and shed His blood for the believers.</li><li>The blood of the lamb being put on the door, typifying that the blood of Christ was put before God for the believers&rsquo; redemption.</li><li>The flesh of the lamb being eaten by the children of Israel for their supply, typifying that Christ enters into the believers to be their life supply:<ol class="decimal"><li>With unleavened bread, typifying that Christ is received by the believers as the life that delivers them from sin and purges away their sin.</li><li>With bitter herbs, typifying that the sinless life of Christ gives the believers a bitter feeling toward sin.</li></ol></li><li>Those who enjoyed the Passover continuing with the observance of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, typifying that those who enjoy Christ&rsquo;s redemption and supply go on to live and enjoy a life of purging away sin.</li></ol></li><li>Israel&rsquo;s crossing of the Red Sea typifying the believers&rsquo; baptism:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The children of Israel being baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea, typifying that the believers have been baptized into Christ in the Spirit and in the water.</li><li>The water of the Red Sea drowning the Egyptian army, typifying that the death of Christ has destroyed the power of the world for the believers.</li><li>The Red Sea delivering the children of Israel out of the hand of the Egyptians, typifying that baptism saves the believers from the power of the world.</li></ol></li><li>Israel&rsquo;s exodus from Egypt typifying the believers&rsquo; breaking away from the world:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>That the children of Israel might be severed from Egypt, typifying that the believers may be separated from the world.</li><li>That the children of Israel might be able go on a journey to sacrifice to God, typifying that the believers may be able to follow the Lord to worship God.</li><li>That the children of Israel might be able to enter the good land to enjoy its riches, typifying that the believers may be put in Christ to enjoy all His riches.</li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>In Exodus, first there are the types that show us the statuses of Christ as God&rsquo;s Apostle and Prophet (Exo. 3:10; 4:12). Then, there are different types to show us that Christ is God&rsquo;s full salvation and its rich supply. The first type in this category is the Passover. The Passover is a type of Christ as the believers&rsquo; redemption and supply. Those who enjoy Christ as their redemption and supply should be delivered and separated from the world. This is typified by the exodus of the children of Israel.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE PASSOVER TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />AS THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; REDEMPTION AND SUPPLY</h2><p>The Passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is a clear, suitable, and even all-inclusive type of the redemption of Christ. The word <em>Passover</em> means that the judgment of God passes over us. First Corinthians 5:7 says, &ldquo;Our Passover, Christ,...has been sacrificed.&rdquo; In the Passover, Christ is not only the lamb of the Passover but also the Passover itself. Hence, the Passover adequately typifies Christ as the believers&rsquo; redemption. Furthermore, the flesh of the Passover lamb for the supply of the children of Israel typifies Christ as the believers&rsquo; supply.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Lamb without Blemish<br />Being Killed and Shedding Its Blood,<br />Typifying That the Sinless Christ Died and<br />Shed His Blood for the Believers</h2><p>The lamb as the Passover sacrifice was without blemish, a male of the first year (Exo. 12:5a). To be without blemish is to be perfect. This signifies that Christ is perfect, without fault (John 8:46). To be of the first year is to be fresh and not used for any other purpose. In the sight of God, when the Lord Jesus was crucified, He was of the first year. He was fresh, never having been used for another purpose. The Passover lamb could be taken either from the sheep or from the goats (Exo. 12:5b). According to Matthew 25, sheep represent those who are good, and goats, those who are evil. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He was both a sheep and a goat. On the one hand, in Himself Christ was altogether good; on the other hand, as the One who knew no sin He was made sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21) to be our Substitute. The Passover lamb was examined for four days and killed by the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel on the fourteenth day of the first month (Exo. 12:2-3, 6). Likewise, Christ was examined by the Jewish priests and the Roman governor, and He was proved to be faultless, without blemish (John 18:38b; 19:4, 6). However, He was delivered for crucifixion in the midst of the unjust crying of the crowds (Matt. 27:20, 22-23). Hence, the lamb without blemish as the Passover sacrifice which shed its blood by being killed typifies that the sinless Christ died and shed His blood for us.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Blood of the Lamb Being Put on the Door,<br />Typifying That the Blood of Christ Was Put<br />before God for the Believers&rsquo; Redemption</h2><p>After the Passover lamb was killed, every household had to take of the blood and put it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses. While Jehovah God was smiting all the firstborn of the land of Egypt, when He saw the blood on the door, He passed over that house (Exo. 12:7, 13, 23). The blood of the Passover lamb typifies the redeeming blood of Christ. First Peter 1:19 shows us that we were redeemed &ldquo;with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.&rdquo; The blood of the lamb was put on the door of the house in which the lamb was eaten for the deliverance of the children of Israel. This typifies that Christ&rsquo;s blood was put before God for the believers&rsquo; redemption (Matt. 26:28).</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Flesh of the Lamb<br />Being Eaten by the Children of Israel<br />for Their Supply, Typifying That Christ Enters<br />into the Believers to Be Their Life Supply</h2><p>The blood of the Passover lamb was to be put on the door, whereas the flesh of the lamb was to be eaten by the children of Israel (Exo. 12:8). The flesh of the lamb being eaten for their supply typifies that Christ enters into the believers to be their life supply. In John 6 the Lord said, &ldquo;Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man...you do not have life within yourselves....My flesh is true food&rdquo; (vv. 53, 55). Flesh here signifies the life of Christ. The life of Christ is edible; it is our life supply. Therefore, we have the blood of Christ for redemption and the life of Christ for the life supply.</p><p>Exodus 12:8-9 goes on to show us the way to eat the flesh of the Passover lamb: it must be roasted with fire. Fire here signifies God&rsquo;s holy wrath exercised in judgment. When Christ was on the cross for the believers&rsquo; redemption, the holy fire of God judged Him and consumed Him. Also, the lamb was not to be eaten raw. To eat the lamb raw is not to believe in Christ&rsquo;s redemption but to merely regard Christ as a model or example of human living for one to imitate. Moreover, the lamb was not to be boiled with water. To eat of Christ as if He were boiled with water is to regard His death on the cross not as death for redemption but as martyrdom. Furthermore, the lamb was to be eaten with its head, legs, and inwards. The head signifies wisdom, the legs signify activity and move, and the inwards signify the various inward parts of Christ&rsquo;s being. This indicates that we need to take Christ as a whole, in His entirety. Finally, nothing of the lamb was to be left until morning. This indicates that we are to receive Christ in a full way, not partially; we must not allow anything of Christ to be left over.</p><h2 class="head3">1. With Unleavened Bread,<br />Typifying That Christ Is Received by the Believers<br />as the Life That Delivers Them from Sin<br />and Purges Away Their Sin</h2><p>The children of Israel were to eat the flesh of the lamb with unleavened bread. This typifies that Christ is received by the believers as the life that delivers them from sin and purges away their sin. First Corinthians 5:8 says, &ldquo;So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&rdquo; The feast here refers to the Feast of Unleavened Bread as the continuation of the Passover (Exo. 12:15-20). When we enjoy Christ as our Passover, we must purge away everything sinful, and we must continually enjoy Christ Himself as the life that delivers us from sin and purges away our sin so that we may be delivered from the bondage of the law of sin (Rom. 8:2).</p><h2 class="head3">2. With Bitter Herbs,<br />Typifying That the Sinless Life of Christ<br />Gives the Believers a Bitter Feeling toward Sin</h2><p>The children of Israel were to eat the flesh of the lamb also with bitter herbs. This typifies that the sinless life of Christ gives the believers a bitter feeling toward sin. When we receive Christ as our supply, we receive a life that delivers us from sin and purges away our sin. This life, which is sensitive to sin, to any kind of wrongdoing, to anything of the self, gives us a bitter feeling toward sin and a repentance for sin.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Those Who Enjoyed the Passover<br />Continuing with the Observance<br />of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,<br />Typifying That Those Who Enjoy<br />Christ&rsquo;s Redemption and Supply Go On<br />to Live and Enjoy a Life of Purging Away Sin</h2><p>The Passover was on the fourteenth day of the first month and lasted only one day. Following this, there was the Feast of Unleavened Bread as the continuation of the Passover. The Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted for seven days (Exo. 12:15, 18), a period of completion, signifying the entire period of our Christian life, from the day of our conversion to the day of rapture. Those who enjoyed the Passover continued with the keeping of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This typifies that those who enjoy Christ&rsquo;s redemption and supply go on to live and enjoy a life of purging away sin. In 1 Corinthians 5:8 the apostle Paul said that we must not keep the feast with old leaven, the sin of our old nature, but with unleavened bread, which is the Christ of our new nature as our nourishment and enjoyment. Only He is the life supply of sincerity and truth, absolutely pure, without mixture, and full of reality. Day by day we must enjoy such a Christ as our feast, as the rich supply of life, that we may live a life that purges away sin.</p><h2 class="head1">II. ISRAEL&rsquo;S CROSSING OF THE RED SEA<br />TYPIFYING THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; BAPTISM</h2><p>Israel&rsquo;s crossing of the Red Sea in Exodus 14 is a type of the New Testament believers&rsquo; baptism. In His creation God prepared the Red Sea to serve as a baptistry for His chosen people. Then during the exodus He led the people to this baptistry. This was according to the plan of God, which was to bring His chosen people into a situation that they might be completely delivered from the power of the world unto Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Children of Israel Being Baptized<br />unto Moses in the Cloud and in the Sea,<br />Typifying That the Believers<br />Have Been Baptized into Christ<br />in the Spirit and in the Water</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 10:1-2 Paul says, &ldquo;All our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.&rdquo; <em>In the cloud</em> signifies in the Spirit, and <em>in the sea</em> denotes in the water. Moses was a type of Christ and a representative of Christ. Hence, the children of Israel being baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea typifies that we have been baptized into Christ in the Spirit and in the water.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Water of the Red Sea<br />Drowning the Egyptian Army,<br />Typifying That the Death of Christ Has Destroyed<br />the Power of the World for the Believers</h2><p>When the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, the Egyptian army, horses, and chariots that pursued them also went into the sea after them. The Lord confused the army of the Egyptians and took off their chariot wheels. Then God commanded Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea so that the waters would come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. When Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them (Exo. 14:22-28). This is a clear picture which shows that Satan and the power of the world have been buried and terminated in baptism. Hence, the water of the Red Sea drowning the Egyptian army typifies that the death of Christ has destroyed the power of the world for us.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Red Sea Delivering the Children of Israel<br />Out of the Hand of the Egyptians,<br />Typifying That Baptism Saves the Believers<br />from the Power of the World</h2><p>Since the water of the Red Sea drowned the army of the Egyptians and terminated them, it delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Egyptians, thus drawing a clear line of separation between the children of Israel and the Egyptians. Likewise, since in baptism the power of the world is terminated, baptism saves the believers from the power of the world. Hence, the Red Sea delivering the children of Israel out of the hand of the Egyptians typifies that baptism saves the believers from the power of the world.</p><h2 class="head1">III. ISRAEL&rsquo;S EXODUS FROM EGYPT TYPIFYING<br />THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; BREAKING AWAY FROM THE WORLD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. That the Children of Israel Might Be<br />Severed from Egypt, Typifying That the Believers<br />May Be Separated from the World</h2><p>When God delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Egyptians (Exo. 3:8), that was His deliverance of His chosen people from the usurpation and tyranny of Pharaoh and Egypt. Pharaoh was the ruler of Egypt, and Satan is the ruler of this world (John 12:31). Pharaoh is a type of Satan, and Egypt is a type of the world. God&rsquo;s causing the children of Israel to be severed from Egypt is a type of God&rsquo;s causing the believers to be separated from the world. Every aspect of the world today, such as the pressure on the job, the danger of losing a job, and the competition for entrance into college, is a form of usurpation and tyranny. God has separated us from the world and delivered us from Satan and his world so that we are no longer under their bondage.</p><h2 class="head2">B. That the Children of Israel Might Be Able<br />to Go on a Journey to Sacrifice to God,<br />Typifying That the Believers May Be Able<br />to Follow the Lord to Worship God</h2><p>In Exodus 3:18 God told Moses to say to Pharaoh, &ldquo;Now let us go a three days&rsquo; journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.&rdquo; The term <em>wilderness</em> is used here in a positive sense; it signifies the realm of separation. A three days&rsquo; journey signifies a journey in resurrection. After their crossing of the Red Sea and their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel were separated from Egypt and they entered into the wilderness by a three days&rsquo; journey that they might sacrifice to God. This typifies that after our breaking away from the world through baptism, we enter into a new realm that we may be able to follow the Lord to worship God (John 12:26).</p><h2 class="head2">C. That the Children of Israel Might Be Able<br />to Enter the Good Land to Enjoy Its Riches,<br />Typifying That the Believers<br />May Be Put in Christ to Enjoy All His Riches</h2><p>In Exodus 3:8 God said to Moses, &ldquo;I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey.&rdquo; When God led the children of Israel out of Egypt, He severed their relationship with the world and enabled them to go on the journey to sacrifice to God. Furthermore, He enabled them to enter the good land to enjoy the riches there that He might establish His kingdom on the earth and build His dwelling place. The enjoyment of the children of Israel was of three stages. The first stage was the enjoyment of the Passover lamb in Egypt; the second, the enjoyment of the manna and the living water in the wilderness; and the third, the enjoyment of the rich produce of the good land. After their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel were able, eventually, to enter the good land to enjoy its riches. This typifies that after our breaking away from the world, eventually we are put in Christ to enjoy all His riches.</p><p>Colossians 2:6-7 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.&rdquo; Here Paul shows us that God has planted us in Christ as the good land. Furthermore, we have been rooted in Christ that we may absorb all His riches as nourishment. These riches become the element and substance by which we grow and build up the Body of Christ as God&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s kingdom (1 Tim. 3:15; Rom. 14:17).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The Passover is a type of Christ as the believers&rsquo; redemption and supply. In the aspect of redemption, the lamb without blemish was killed and its blood was shed, typifying that the sinless Christ died and shed His blood for the believers. The blood of the lamb was put on the door, typifying that the blood of Christ was put before God for the believers&rsquo; redemption. In the aspect of supply, the flesh of the lamb was eaten by the children of Israel for their supply, typifying that Christ enters into the believers to be their life supply. The flesh of the lamb was to be eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, typifying that the believers need to receive Christ as the life that delivers them from sin and purges away their sin and as the sinless life that gives them a bitter feeling toward sin. Those who enjoyed the Passover continued with the observance of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, typifying that those who enjoy the redemption and supply of Christ go on to live and enjoy a life that purges away sin.</p><p>Israel&rsquo;s crossing of the Red Sea is a type of the New Testament believers&rsquo; baptism. The children of Israel were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea, typifying that the believers are baptized into Christ in the Spirit and in the water. The water of the Red Sea drowned the Egyptian army and delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Egyptians, typifying that the death of Christ has destroyed the power of the world for the believers and thus delivers them from it.</p><p>Israel&rsquo;s exodus from Egypt typifies the believers&rsquo; breaking away from the world. God led the children of Israel out of Egypt that they might be severed from Egypt, go on the journey to sacrifice to God, and eventually be able to enter the good land to enjoy its riches. This typifies that God leads the believers to break away from the world that they may be severed from the world, that they may be able to follow the Lord to worship God, and that they may be put in Christ to enjoy all His riches.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain how the Passover is a type of Christ as the believers&rsquo; redemption.</li><li>Briefly explain how the Passover is a type of Christ as the believers&rsquo; supply.</li><li>Briefly explain how Israel&rsquo;s crossing of the Red Sea is a type of the New Testament believers&rsquo; baptism.</li><li>Briefly explain how Israel&rsquo;s exodus from Egypt is a type of the believers&rsquo; breaking away from the world.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE PILLAR OF CLOUD AND<br />THE PILLAR OF FIRE</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The pillar of cloud:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Typifying the Spirit.</li><li>First being the cloud and then becoming the pillar of cloud, standing firm with strength.</li></ol></li><li>The pillar of fire:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Typifying the Word.</li><li>First being the fire and then becoming the pillar of fire, standing firm with strength.</li></ol></li><li>Both the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire being the glory as the manifestation of God&rsquo;s presence with His redeemed:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Appearing as a pillar of cloud for covering by day.</li><li>Appearing as a pillar of fire for shining by night.</li></ol></li><li>The pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire being not only for guidance but also for protection and fighting:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Protection.</li><li>Fighting.</li></ol></li><li>The children of Israel having the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire leading them, protecting them, and fighting for them all the way from the crossing of the Red Sea to the crossing of the Jordan River.</li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>God led the children of Israel in their crossing of the Red Sea and journeying in the wilderness with the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire as the guidance (Exo. 13:21-22). Both the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire are types with rich spiritual significance.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE PILLAR OF CLOUD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying the Spirit</h2><p>In biblical typology the cloud signifies the Spirit. Sometimes the Spirit comes to us as the cloud to cover and shelter us. After keeping the Passover, the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea and went out of Egypt under the covering and sheltering of the pillar of cloud to run the race in the wilderness. Likewise, after we, the New Testament believers, take Christ as our Passover (1 Cor. 5:7), the Spirit of God comes to be with us that we may be freed from the usurpation and enslavement of the world, and to lead us to run the Christian race (9:24-27), just as the pillar of cloud led the children of Israel.</p><h2 class="head2">B. First Being the Cloud and<br />Then Becoming the Pillar of Cloud,<br />Standing Firm with Strength</h2><p>The cloud that covered and sheltered the children of Israel became the pillar of cloud that guided them. First the cloud was above them, and then it appeared before them and became the pillar of cloud that stood firm with strength. All the New Testament believers have the indwelling Spirit with them, who not only shelters them but also guides them (Rom. 8:14; Heb. 12:1). The Spirit&rsquo;s leading of the believers is as definite and strong as the pillar of cloud.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE PILLAR OF FIRE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying the Word</h2><p>In the daytime it was the pillar of cloud that led the way for the children of Israel, and in the night it was the pillar of fire. The cloud signifies the Spirit; the fire signifies the Word of God, which is a shining light to us, the believers. Second Peter 1:19 says that the word in the Scripture, as a lamp shining in a dark place, gives forth spiritual light to shine over the believers&rsquo; footsteps. Moreover, Psalm 119:105 says, &ldquo;Your word is a lamp to my feet / And a light to my path.&rdquo; Whenever we are in darkness, the Lord&rsquo;s word is the fire, the burning fire, the brightening light, shining over us and guiding us that we may take the way before us in the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p><h2 class="head2">B. First Being the Fire and<br />Then Becoming the Pillar of Fire,<br />Standing Firm with Strength</h2><p>The children of Israel could journey not only in the daytime but even in the night because the fire gave them light. This fire became a tall pillar of fire, standing firm with strength, leading them in their journey on God&rsquo;s way. In the dark night, as long as we have the word of the Lord, we can have the Lord&rsquo;s definite and strong guidance, as the pillar of fire, to overcome all the darkness, that our faith may be established and we may go on boldly.</p><p>The two pillars, the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, that guided the children of Israel in their journey actually were one. When night came, the cloud became the fire. But when day dawned, the fire became the cloud. Whether as the cloud or the fire, God&rsquo;s guidance is always a pillar. In the Bible a pillar denotes strength. Hence, God&rsquo;s guidance to us is strong; it stands upright, firm, and solid. Not only so, both the cloud and the fire are symbols of God, for He is both the Spirit and the Word (John 4:24; 1:1). Furthermore, the Word is also the Spirit (John 6:63; Eph. 6:17). The Lord, the Spirit, and the Word are one to lead us and guide us continually. In our Christian journey there should be no difference between day and night. Whether it is day or night, whether it is clear or dark, God guides us through His Spirit and His Word that we may walk firmly on the way in which He leads.</p><h2 class="head1">III. BOTH THE PILLAR OF CLOUD<br />AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE BEING THE GLORY AS<br />THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD&rsquo;S PRESENCE<br />WITH HIS REDEEMED</h2><p>Israel, God&rsquo;s redeemed, had God&rsquo;s leading and guidance in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire all the way from their going out of Egypt and their crossing of the Red Sea to their journeying in the wilderness. After the setting up of the tent of meeting, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle (Exo. 40:34-35). The cloud was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys (v. 38). This indicates that the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire are the glory as the manifestation of God&rsquo;s presence with His redeemed.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Appearing as a Pillar of Cloud<br />for Covering by Day</h2><p>God was with the children of Israel day and night, never departing from them. In the day God&rsquo;s presence appeared as the pillar of cloud to cover and shelter them. Today He is the same to us, the believers. The Spirit of God as the pillar of cloud is the economical Spirit to be poured upon us, to fill us outwardly, for our work and move (Acts 1:8; 2:17). First Peter 4:14 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.&rdquo; The Spirit of God covers and shelters us all the time everywhere as the pillar of cloud, bringing to us God&rsquo;s intimate and glorious presence.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Appearing as a Pillar of Fire<br />for Shining by Night</h2><p>When the dark night descended on them, the pillar of cloud that covered God&rsquo;s redeemed in the daytime became the pillar of fire to give forth light to shine over them (Exo. 40:38). This shining light comes mainly from the Word of God. The glory as the manifestation of God&rsquo;s presence is not only in His Spirit but also in His Word (2 Pet. 1:19). The word of the Scripture as God Himself is like a pillar of fire in the night to us. It conveys the light of life to shine in our darkness, leading us to walk in God&rsquo;s way of light.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE PILLAR OF CLOUD AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE<br />BEING NOT ONLY FOR GUIDANCE BUT ALSO<br />FOR PROTECTION AND FIGHTING</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Protection</h2><p>When the children of Israel went out of Egypt boldly, Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, made ready his horses and chariots and took his army with him to pursue them and, eventually, arrived at the place of their encampment. &ldquo;And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. And the cloud was there with the darkness, yet it gave light by night to them. Thus one did not come near the other all night&rdquo; (Exo. 14:19-20). This shows us that the cloud and the Angel of God, who is the very God Himself, moved together to protect God&rsquo;s people. Furthermore, the pillar that protected the children of Israel was like a wall of separation that separated the two camps. On the side of the Egyptians there was darkness, but on the side of the Israelites there was light. This pillar of cloud, a pillar that gave light, not only guided God&rsquo;s people but also protected them from the hand of the Egyptians.</p><p>On our way of following the Lord, the light which we receive from the Lord through the Spirit and the Word first guides us. Then when opposition rises up against us, the guiding light becomes the protecting light to save us from the persecution and attack of the opposers. As long as we are guided by the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, even if we are opposed, we are still in the light, but the opposers are in darkness. Consequently, the opposers will perish, but we will be completely unharmed.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Fighting</h2><p>The pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire not only protected the children of Israel but also fought the battle and gained the victory for them. After the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground, the Egyptians also went in after them into the midst of the sea. &ldquo;And at the morning watch Jehovah looked down upon the camp of the Egyptians in the pillar of fire and of cloud and threw the camp of the Egyptians into confusion. And He caused their chariot wheels to swerve and made them drive with difficulty&rdquo; (Exo. 14:24-25). The Egyptians were drowned and buried in the Red Sea; there remained not so much as one of them. So the children of Israel were altogether saved.</p><p>Whenever we suffer opposition or attack, we do not need to fear or do anything. We have God&rsquo;s pillar of fire and of cloud, the glory as the manifestation of God&rsquo;s presence, to guide and protect us and to fight for us to deliver us from the hand of our enemy that we may enjoy His full and complete salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAVING<br />THE PILLAR OF CLOUD AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE<br />LEADING THEM, PROTECTING THEM, AND<br />FIGHTING FOR THEM ALL THE WAY<br />FROM THE CROSSING OF THE RED SEA<br />TO THE CROSSING OF THE JORDAN RIVER</h2><p>In Deuteronomy 1 Moses said to the children of Israel, &ldquo;Do not be terrified, neither be afraid of them. Jehovah your God, who goes up before you, He will fight for you according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes, and in the wilderness,...who went before you in the way, to seek out for you a place for you to camp, in the fire by night to show you by which way you should go and in the cloud by day&rdquo; (vv. 29-33). In all the way that the children of Israel journeyed, from the crossing of the Red Sea to the crossing of the Jordan River, it was God Himself who led them and carried them (v. 31). In the pillar of cloud by day and in the pillar of fire by night, God protected them and shined over them by the manifested glory of His presence; He sought out a place for them to camp and fought for them to overcome all their enemies.</p><p>This picture clearly portrays that from the time we were baptized into Christ, we, the New Testament believers, have the Spirit of God (the pillar of cloud) covering and sheltering us, and we also have the Word of God (the pillar of fire) giving forth light to shine on us and to lead us on the proper way. In the entire course of our journey we should neither act according to man&rsquo;s opinion and choice nor depend on our own method and strength. Rather, we should allow the Spirit of God and the Word of God to lead us, protect us, and fight for us. In this way we are able to get through any environment, encounter, and even hardship and opposition to reach God&rsquo;s purpose and accomplish God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>God led the children of Israel in their crossing of the Red Sea and their journeying in the wilderness with the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire as the guidance. The pillar of cloud typifies the Spirit, and the pillar of fire typifies the Word. Both the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire were the glory as the manifestation of God&rsquo;s presence with His redeemed. In the day God&rsquo;s presence appeared as the pillar of cloud for covering and sheltering, signifying the Spirit of God as the economical Spirit being poured upon us, filling us outwardly, for our work and move, and also covering and sheltering us all the time everywhere to bring to us God&rsquo;s intimate and glorious presence. In the night God&rsquo;s presence appeared as the pillar of fire shining forth, signifying the Word of God that conveys the light of life to shine in our darkness, leading us to walk in God&rsquo;s way of light. The pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire were not only for guidance but also for protection and fighting. When opposition rises up against us, this guiding light becomes the protecting light to save us from the persecution and attack of the opposers and to fight for us to gain the victory. The children of Israel had the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire leading them, protecting them, and fighting for them all the way from the crossing of the Red Sea to the crossing of the Jordan River. This portrays that after we, the New Testament believers, are baptized into Christ, we have the Spirit of God covering and sheltering us, and we also have the Word of God giving forth light to shine on us and lead us on the proper way.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the significance, in typology, of the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire.</li><li>Briefly explain how the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire are the glory as the manifestation of God&rsquo;s presence with His redeemed.</li><li>Briefly explain how the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire protect God&rsquo;s redeemed and fight for them.</li><li>The children of Israel had the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire leading, protecting, and fighting for them all the way from the crossing of the Red Sea to the crossing of the Jordan River.

The Red Sea became a separating line to them. After they had crossed this separating line, they entered into the wilderness and traveled in it to follow the journey of God that they might sacrifice to God at the place where He appointed (Exo. 3:18). In their journeying in the wilderness, because of the desolate environment and its hardships, they had all kinds of needs for their living. Hence, in this lesson we will go on to see the supplies that they needed. The supplies they received consisted of six items, every item of which being a type of Christ as the supply that we need for us to take the journey of God after we have been saved.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE TREE THAT MADE THE BITTER WATERS SWEET</h2><p>The first thing that the children of Israel needed in their journey in the wilderness was water (Exo. 15:22-26). They went three days in the wilderness and found no water. When they came to Marah, there were waters, but the waters were bitter. (<em>Marah</em> means &ldquo;bitterness.&rdquo;) They murmured against Moses, and Moses cried out to Jehovah. Then Jehovah showed him a tree. When Moses cast the tree into the waters, the waters were made sweet. Thus, the problem of the thirst of the children of Israel was solved.</p><h2 class="head2">A. This Tree Typifying the Cross of Christ</h2><p>The tree that healed the bitter waters is a type of the cross on which Christ suffered the bitterness of death. The cross of Christ was constituted of wood; hence, it is also called &ldquo;the tree&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:24). This cross is the healing cross.</p><h2 class="head3">1. To Be Enjoyed after a Journey of Three Days</h2><p>Exodus 15:22 says that the children of Israel &ldquo;went three days in the wilderness.&rdquo; Three days signify resurrection, indicating that the children of Israel walked in resurrection. We have to be in resurrection to experience Christ&rsquo;s death. In our natural life we have no way to participate in Christ&rsquo;s death; in the resurrection life of Christ we can enjoy all that He has accomplished for us in His death.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Christ Having Suffered the Thirst of Death<br />on the Cross on Our Behalf</h2><p>All our thirst is due to our sins; thirst to the uttermost is death. Christ suffered the penalty of sin for us on the tree, that is, on the cross, and tasted death on our behalf (Heb. 2:9) in enduring the thirst of death (John 19:28), and thus saved us from the thirst of death.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Taking the Cross of Christ&rsquo;s Suffering Death<br />in Our Bitter Situations</h2><p>As we run and follow the way of God after we are saved, we always have hardship in our circumstances. When we encounter hardships, if we take the cross of Christ and apply it to our circumstances, the sensation of the bitter situations will be made sweet.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Healing by the Cross of Christ<br />Being Made a Statute and an Ordinance<br />for Our Healing</h2><p>According to the case here at Marah concerning the changing of bitter waters into sweet waters, God made a statute and an ordinance for the healing of the children of Israel. That is, if they would diligently give heed to God&rsquo;s commandments and keep all His statutes, God would be their healing and would save them from the diseases of the Egyptians (Exo. 15:25b-26). This signifies:</p><h2 class="head3">1. Christ&rsquo;s Death on the Cross<br />Healing Our Sicknesses</h2><p>Since Christ bore up our sins on the cross, He also bore up our sicknesses, which come from sin (Isa. 53:4-5). Hence, whenever we have sickness, we should take the cross on which Christ suffered the bitterness of death on our behalf and apply it to every aspect of our being. Then the resurrection life of Christ becomes our healing power, and He becomes our Healer.</p><h2 class="head3">2. If We Diligently Keep God&rsquo;s Word,<br />We Will Be Spared the Diseases<br />of the Worldly People</h2><p>Because the worldly people generally despise and disobey God&rsquo;s word, they are plagued by sicknesses. If, contrary to what they do, we give heed to God&rsquo;s word in the resurrection life, God will become our healing and spare us from the diseases and plagues inflicted upon the worldly people.</p><h2 class="head1">II. TWELVE SPRINGS OF WATER</h2><p>At Marah God made the bitter waters sweet with a tree; at Elim God gave them twelve springs of water (Exo. 15:27a) to fully meet the need of the thirst of the children of Israel.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Twelve</h2><p>The number twelve signifies completeness, fullness, and perfection in God&rsquo;s eternal administration. According to the Bible, twelve is composed of four times three. Three signifies the Triune God, and four signifies the creatures, especially man. Hence, twelve also signifies the mingling of the Triune God with man. The twelve springs of water indicate that the full supply given by God here to the children of Israel in their need for water was for the mingling of God with man and according to God&rsquo;s eternal administration. Hence, it is complete, full, and perfect.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Springs of Water</h2><p>Here it is not merely water but springs of water which issued from the fountainhead, flowing forth to supply the need of God&rsquo;s chosen people. Twelve springs of water signify the resurrection life, which is the Spirit, flowing out from God into us for the mingling of divinity with humanity. This mingling will carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy and reach the full extent of God&rsquo;s administration.</p><h2 class="head1">III. SEVENTY PALM TREES</h2><p>At Elim, God prepared for the children of Israel not only twelve springs of water but also seventy palm trees (Exo. 15:27b). The springs of water are for the quenching of thirst, whereas the palm trees are for a shade, a shelter from heat.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Seventy</h2><p>The number seven signifies the completeness of God&rsquo;s dispensing in time. The book of Revelation speaks of seven churches, seven golden lampstands, seven Spirits, seven lamps of fire, seven eyes, seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. All these sevens are related to God&rsquo;s dispensing in time. The number ten signifies perfection, fullness. Hence, seventy signifies absolute completeness in time for God&rsquo;s dispensing in full.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Palm Trees</h2><p>Palm trees have deep roots that reach far to the source of the water under the earth. Hence, they can survive under the scorching sun and bring forth an abundance of leaves as a shelter from heat, a place for cooling. In the Bible palm trees signify life that is flourishing (Psa. 92:12), rejoicing in life&rsquo;s satisfaction (Lev. 23:40; Neh. 8:15), and victory (John 12:13; Rev. 7:9). This life carries out God&rsquo;s ministry dispensationally in time. This refers to the supply of Christ in resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE MANNA</h2><p>The first thing that the children of Israel needed in their journey through the wilderness was the thirst-quenching water and the cooling shade. After this, what they needed very much was food to satisfy their hunger. Therefore, the next thing that was supplied for their life necessities was manna, the heavenly bread.</p><h2 class="head2">A. A Type of Christ</h2><p>Manna is a type of Christ (John 6:31-35, 48-51, 57-58). As the real manna, Christ was sent by God the Father that God&rsquo;s chosen people might live by Christ. Although the children of Israel had had their exodus from Egypt, they were still Egyptian in their constitution. They needed to change their constitution that they might become materials for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation. God gave them manna to change their diet that they might become a new constitution through their eating. Today Christ has come from God to be our real food, and God has changed our food from something worldly to Christ Himself. We need to eat Him that He may enter into us organically to become our inner constituents that we may be built as God&rsquo;s habitation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Unique Food for God&rsquo;s Elect</h2><p>In the wilderness God gave the children of Israel nothing to eat besides the manna. According to Numbers 11:6, the people said that &ldquo;there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.&rdquo; This indicates that, besides Christ, God did not give us anything as our food supply. Christ is the unique food given to us by God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Coming Down from Heaven</h2><p>Manna was the food which God rained from heaven for His chosen people; it was the heavenly food to sustain and supply them for their existence. This is a type of Christ as the bread of life sent from heaven by God the Father (John 6:35, 51) to be man&rsquo;s life supply in the form of food that we may eat Him and live.</p><h2 class="head2">D. With the Dew</h2><p>From Exodus 16:13-14 we see that manna came with the dew: &ldquo;In the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. And when the layer of dew lifted, there upon the surface of the wilderness were fine round flakes.&rdquo; This small, round thing was manna. Numbers 11:9 also says, &ldquo;When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it.&rdquo; According to the Bible, the dew signifies daily grace, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. Psalm 133:3 mentions &ldquo;the dew of Hermon / That came down upon the mountains of Zion.&rdquo; The dew of Hermon signifies grace which comes down from the heavens. According to Lamentations 3:22 and 23, God&rsquo;s mercy, like the dew, is fresh every morning. Mercy in the Old Testament eventually issues in grace in the New Testament. Grace is God reaching us. When God reaches us in a positive manner, full of mercy and compassion, He becomes grace to us. Manna coming down with the dew signifies that Christ as our heavenly bread of life comes to us through grace.</p><h2 class="head2">E. In the Morning</h2><p>Exodus 16:21 says that the children of Israel &ldquo;gathered it morning by morning.&rdquo; The fact that manna came in the morning indicates that it gives us a new beginning. We may also say that every new beginning brings us fresh manna. If we desire to enjoy Christ as the real manna, we must be prepared for a new beginning. Furthermore, whenever we enjoy Christ as our daily food, He brings us a new beginning every day.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Small</h2><p>Manna was something small, signifying the smallness of Christ. Christ was a descendant of David, a descendant of a royal family. However, He was born in a manger, and He was raised in the home of a carpenter in a small, despised town. This indicates that the Lord did not make a display of His greatness. Rather, He preferred to be small in the eyes of man.</p><p>According to John 6, the crowd wanted to enthrone the Lord Jesus as a king, but He fled from man&rsquo;s exaltation of Himself. The next day He returned and presented Himself as the bread of life, which was as small as the manna (v. 35). He did not want to be a king; He wanted to be food that we may receive Him as our life and life supply. As the real manna, Christ is small enough for us to take in, digest, and assimilate.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Round</h2><p>In Exodus 16:14 we see that manna was round. The roundness of manna signifies that Christ is eternal, without beginning or ending. Christ is eternal food with an eternal nature for eternal supply without limitation. Christ and His word are perfect and full. By eating Him we are transformed and become eternal, perfect, and full.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Like Frost</h2><p>The manna was also like frost (Exo. 16:14). Frost is something between dew and snow. Frost not only refreshes people but also kills germs. As the real manna, Christ not only refreshes us but also kills the negative things within us.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Like Coriander Seed</h2><p>In Exodus 16:31 and Numbers 11:7 we are told that the manna was like coriander seed. Although the coriander seed is small, it is full of life. This indicates that as food Christ is full of life, and He brings the life element into our being and thereby grows in us.</p><h2 class="head2">J. Its Appearance like That of Bdellium</h2><p>In Numbers 11:7 we are told that the appearance of manna was like the appearance of bdellium. There are two kinds of pearls: one kind is produced by oysters, and the other is produced by the secretion of resinous gum from trees. Both kinds of pearls are bright and transparent. The Hebrew word rendered <em>appearance</em> in this verse means &ldquo;eye.&rdquo; Manna has an eye which is like the eye of a pearl. Every piece of manna looked like an eyeball&mdash;round, bright, and transparent. Christ as the real manna is transparent. When we eat Christ, we become living creatures that are full of eyes, and we also become bright and transparent.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE ROCK</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Christ</h2><p>In Exodus 17:6 the rock that was smitten and cleft to flow out the living water for God&rsquo;s chosen people was a physical rock. Yet in 1 Corinthians 10:4 the apostle Paul called it a spiritual rock because it typified Christ, who was smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life (John 19:34) to satisfy the thirst of His believers. Hence, Paul said that the rock was Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Smitten by the Authority of God&rsquo;s Law</h2><p>God told Moses to use his rod to &ldquo;strike the rock, and water will come out of it so that the people may drink&rdquo; (Exo. 17:6). In typology, Moses signifies the law, and the rod represents the power and authority of the law. The smiting of the rock by the rod signifies that Christ was smitten by the authority of God&rsquo;s law.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE LIVING WATER</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying the Spirit<br />as the Ultimate Consummation<br />of the Triune God</h2><p>The living water flowing out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6) typifies the Spirit, who flowed out of the crucified and resurrected Christ. Through incarnation Christ came to earth as the rock. At Calvary, the appointed place, He was crucified, smitten by God&rsquo;s law with its power and authority. His side was cleft, and living water flowed forth (John 19:34). This living water is the Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. Hence, in 1 Corinthians 10:4 Paul called it the &ldquo;spiritual drink.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Water of Life in Resurrection</h2><p>According to John 7:38-39, the rivers of living water are related to the resurrection of Christ. This shows us that Christ had to pass through incarnation, human living, and death and enter into resurrection; then the Spirit as the living water could be experienced and enjoyed by the believers. Through incarnation this living water flowed from the throne of God to Jesus, and after thirty-three and a half years it flowed through the cross and flowed into resurrection. Hence, today this living water is the water of life in resurrection. It is for those who believe to drink of, and it will gush up in them into eternal life (John 4:14).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>After they crossed the Red Sea and went out of Egypt, the children of Israel entered the wilderness and traveled in it to follow the journey of God. In their journeying in the wilderness, because of the desolate environment and its hardships, they had all kinds of needs for their living. The supplies they received consisted of six items, every item of which is a type of Christ as the supply that we need for us to take the journey of God after we have been saved. The tree that healed the bitter waters is a type of the cross of Christ. Christ suffered the thirst of death on the cross on our behalf and thus saved us from the thirst of death. When we are in a bitter situation, if we take the cross of Christ&rsquo;s suffering death, the sensation of the bitter situation will be made sweet. Moreover, the healing by the cross of Christ was made a statute and an ordinance for our healing. If we would diligently give heed to God&rsquo;s commandments, we would be spared from the diseases and plagues inflicted upon the worldly people. Twelve springs of water typify the resurrection life, which is the Spirit, flowing out from God into us for the mingling of divinity with humanity to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy and reach the full extent of God&rsquo;s administration. Seventy palm trees typify the flourishing life of Christ in resurrection for us to have the rejoicing in life&rsquo;s satisfaction and the victory for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s dispensing in time in absolute completeness and in full. Manna is a type of Christ, who was sent by God the Father to be our unique food. By eating Him, we allow Him to enter into us organically to become our inner constituents, and we are thereby built as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. The rock typifies Christ, who was smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life to satisfy the thirst of His believers. The living water is a type of the Spirit, who, as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, is the water of life in resurrection. It is for those who believe to drink of, and it will gush up in them into eternal life.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the significance of the tree that changed the bitter waters into sweet as a type of the cross of Christ.</li><li>Briefly state the spiritual significance seen in the type of the twelve springs of water.</li><li>Briefly state the spiritual significance seen in the type of the seventy palm trees.</li><li>Briefly state God&rsquo;s main intention in giving the manna and the spiritual significance portrayed by it.</li><li>Briefly explain how the rock is a type of Christ.</li><li>Briefly explain the spiritual significance seen in the type of the living water.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL THREE<br />THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">MOSES INTERCEDING<br />ON THE MOUNTAINTOP AND<br />JOSHUA FIGHTING<br />AT THE MOUNTAIN FOOT</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Amalek typifying the flesh of the believers.</li><li>Moses interceding on the mountaintop typifying Christ interceding in ascension.</li><li>Joshua fighting at the mountain foot typifying the indwelling Christ fighting against the flesh.</li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>On their way in the wilderness in their going to Jehovah, the children of Israel not only had all kinds of hardships related to the necessities of their living but also had enemies who hindered them from going on to reach God&rsquo;s goal. In Egypt it was Pharaoh the king of Egypt and his army who frustrated them from going out to follow God; in the wilderness, the first enemy who came to frustrate them was Amalek (Exo. 17:8).</p><h2 class="head1">I. AMALEK TYPIFYING THE FLESH OF THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>Amalek was a descendant of Esau (Gen. 36:12), Jacob&rsquo;s twin brother. Esau and Jacob were very close (Gen. 25:24-26). Hence, Amalek signifies that the believers&rsquo; flesh, their old man, is very close to the believers&rsquo; regenerated and spiritual new man. On the way of following God, that which most frequently causes disturbance to the believers is their flesh (Gal. 5:17). The apostle Peter refers to this matter: &ldquo;Beloved, I entreat you as strangers and sojourners to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:11). Hence, God swore that He would have war with Amalek (the flesh) from generation to generation (Exo. 17:16).</p><p>The name <em>Amalek</em> means &ldquo;warlike.&rdquo; The flesh enjoys fighting and never wants to keep the peace. Furthermore, the flesh is very destructive. The greatest destroyer of the Christian life is the flesh. The flesh often destroys our married life, family life, and church life. Moreover, the flesh is also very disturbing. Romans 7 shows us that Paul was so disturbed that he even cried out, &ldquo;Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo; (v. 24). Apparently this disturbance is caused by sin. Actually it is caused by the flesh. The flesh is warlike, destructive, and disturbing.</p><p>Amalek was the first enemy the children of Israel encountered on the way to the good land. This indicates that our flesh is the first among all our enemies in our following of the Lord in His way. It takes the lead over sin, the world, and Satan to fight against us. The flesh, sin, the world, and Satan are all related to one another and are interwoven. However, the most prominent among them in fighting against us is the flesh. When in our Christian experience the flesh is put to death, the world cannot hold us, sin cannot operate in us, and Satan is powerless to work upon us. The reason the world is prevailing, sin is strong, and Satan is active is that we are still in the flesh. Hence, the flesh is the leading enemy in frustrating us from entering into and possessing the all-inclusive Christ as the good land.</p><p>The destiny of Amalek is to have the remembrance of him blotted out from under heaven. In Exodus 17:14 God said to Moses, &ldquo;I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.&rdquo; Therefore, no matter how strong, stubborn, or prevailing the flesh may be, its remembrance will be blotted out. In Exodus, however, Amalek was not blotted out. In 1 Samuel 15 we see that the Amalekites were still in existence and were quite prevailing. Nevertheless, God has decided that the flesh must be blotted out. This will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom. Therefore, today is still the time for us to fight against the flesh.</p><p>God is so strongly against Amalek because Amalek was against the throne of God. Exodus 17:16 says, &ldquo;For there is a hand against the throne of Jah! Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.&rdquo; Since the flesh is a hand against the administration of God, it is in rebellion against the economy of God&rsquo;s administration. Whatever God does governmentally, the flesh opposes it. Therefore, God will fight against this opposer, this rebel, and blot out its remembrance.</p><h2 class="head1">II. MOSES INTERCEDING ON THE MOUNTAINTOP<br />TYPIFYING CHRIST INTERCEDING IN ASCENSION</h2><p>Exodus 17:8-9 says, &ldquo;Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim. And Moses said to Joshua, Choose men for us, and go out; fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.&rdquo; The Hebrew word for <em>men</em> in this verse denotes those who are weak. In the eyes of God, the children of Israel were weak men. The same is true of believers today. We all are weak and can easily be defeated by our flesh. God, however, chose those who are weak to fight against Amalek.</p><p>The victory or defeat in the battle hinged on Moses&rsquo; interceding on the mountaintop. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;And when Moses lifted his hand up, Israel prevailed; and when he let down, Amalek prevailed.&rdquo; Here Moses interceding on the mountaintop typifies Christ interceding in ascension. Believers fighting against the flesh in their spiritual journey today always need the intercession of Christ in ascension. When this interceding continues, we prevail; otherwise, we are defeated, for we are no match for the flesh. We must depend on the ascended Christ interceding for us.</p><p>Romans 8:33 and 34 say, &ldquo;Who shall bring a charge against God&rsquo;s chosen ones? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus...who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.&rdquo; Christ intercedes for us in His ascension at the right hand of God that we may be brought fully into God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. He knows how easy it is for us to fail, to fall, and to become fallen. His intercession will save us out of these conditions. His intercession is ever-unceasing and His power in caring for us is unlimited.</p><h2 class="head1">III. JOSHUA FIGHTING AT THE MOUNTAIN FOOT<br />TYPIFYING THE INDWELLING CHRIST<br />FIGHTING AGAINST THE FLESH</h2><p>In the battle against Amalek, Moses lifted up his hand on the mountaintop, and Joshua fought for the people at the mountain foot (Exo. 17:10, 13). Joshua fighting at the mountain foot typifies the indwelling Christ as the Spirit fighting against the flesh. On the one hand, Christ is interceding today in the heavens for the believers; on the other hand, Christ as the Spirit is in the believers fighting for them. This Christ who is in the believers fighting for them is the life-giving, indwelling Spirit in us (1 Cor. 15:45; Rom. 8:11, 13). He is the ascended Christ and the Spirit indwelling us as well. In heaven He intercedes for us as the High Priest who has ascended to the height and entered into the heavens (Heb. 4:14; 7:25-26); on earth He fights for us against our flesh as the Spirit of life who indwells us.</p><p>Romans 8:13 says, &ldquo;For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&rdquo; This shows us that we must put to death the practices of the body, but we must do it by the Spirit who indwells us. On the one hand, we must take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body, because the Spirit does not do it for us. On the other hand, we should not attempt to deal with the body of our flesh by relying on our own effort without the power of the Holy Spirit. The putting to death here is actually our coordinating with the Spirit who indwells us, just as Israel cooperated with Joshua. When we take the initiative to put to death the practices of our body, the Spirit comes in to apply the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death to those practices, thus killing them.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>When the children of Israel were on their way in the wilderness, the first enemy who came to hinder them from going on was Amalek. Amalek as a descendant of Esau, Jacob&rsquo;s twin brother, signifies the believers&rsquo; flesh. The name Amalek means &ldquo;warlike,&rdquo; signifying that the flesh enjoys fighting. The flesh often destroys the believers&rsquo; life and disturbs them so that they cannot go forward. The flesh, sin, the world, and Satan are all related to one another and interwoven. However, the most prominent among them in fighting against us is the flesh. Hence, the flesh is the leading enemy in frustrating us from entering into and possessing the all-inclusive Christ as the good land. God has decided that the flesh must be blotted out. This will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom. Today is still the time for us to fight against the flesh.</p><p>When the children of Israel were fighting against Amalek, their victory or defeat hinged on Moses&rsquo; interceding on the mountaintop. This signifies that believers fighting against the flesh in their spiritual journey today must depend on the intercessions of the ascended Christ for them to gain the victory. Christ&rsquo;s intercession for us in His ascension at the right hand of God is ever-unceasing, and His power in caring for us is unlimited.</p><p>In the battle against Amalek, Joshua fighting at the mountain foot typifies the indwelling Christ as the Spirit fighting against the flesh. In heaven He intercedes for the believers as the High Priest who has ascended to the height and entered into the heavens; on earth He fights for the believers against their flesh as the Spirit of life who indwells them. The believers should coordinate with the indwelling Spirit and take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body, and then the Spirit will come to apply the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death to those practices, thus killing them.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Who was the first enemy to hinder the children of Israel from going on in their journey through the wilderness?

On this mountain God first decreed the law, which was instituted according to what He is, as His testimony. Then He charged the children of Israel to make a tabernacle for Him according to the pattern He showed them on the mount (Exo. 25:40). Through this tabernacle they could sacrifice to God; that is, they could worship and serve God.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE LAW OF GOD</h2><p>Before God told the children of Israel to make a tabernacle and an altar for Him, He first declared to them His law (Exo. 20:1-21) as a preparation for them to make a tabernacle and an altar for Him. Without being exposed and enlightened by the law, man could not sense the need for the tabernacle and the altar.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being a Portrait of What God Is</h2><p>Apparently, the law of God given in Exodus 20 consists merely of some commandments that God wanted man to keep. Actually, it is a portrait, a description, of what God is. God is love and light; God is also holy and righteous. God enacted His law according to what He is. Because He is a God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, He enacted the law that is of love, light, holiness, and righteousness to correspond with His attributes. Therefore, the law enacted by God is God&rsquo;s portrait, description, and testimony.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Exposing the True Condition of Man<br />So That Man Would Be Afraid<br />to Draw Near to God</h2><p>The law of God has a negative function and that is to expose man&rsquo;s true condition so that man is afraid to draw near to God. Since the law of God is of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, it exposes the sinner&rsquo;s true condition, which is contrary to God&rsquo;s attributes, so that man is afraid to draw near to God. Thus, the sinner is aware of his sins and conscious of his need for Christ and His redemption, typified by the tabernacle and the altar.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>In Exodus 25 God said to Moses, &ldquo;And let them make a sanctuary for Me that I may dwell in their midst. According to all that I show you, the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its utensils, even so you shall make it&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). On Mount Sinai not only did God&rsquo;s people receive the law, which revealed what God is and exposed their true condition, but they also received the vision of God&rsquo;s dwelling place&mdash;the tabernacle. This tells us that the desire of God&rsquo;s heart is to have a dwelling place on earth with His redeemed. This is the goal of God in saving us.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Christ</h2><p>The tabernacle which God charged Moses to build is a type of the incarnated Christ. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; The incarnated Word, Christ, is the tabernacle which God pitched on earth among men.</p><h2 class="head3">1. As God&rsquo;s Concrete Expression in Humanity</h2><p>Through His incarnation Christ put on human nature to be God&rsquo;s concrete expression in humanity. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; From the time that Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a concrete way in Him as the tabernacle. Furthermore, 1 Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; <em>In the flesh</em> means in the likeness, in the fashion, of man (Rom. 8:3; Phil. 2:7-8). Christ appeared to people in the form of man (2 Cor. 5:16), yet He was God manifested in man&mdash;He was the embodiment of God in the flesh. He is a God-man, having two natures, the divine nature and the human nature, with the divine nature existing in the human nature and being expressed through the human nature.</p><h2 class="head3">2. As God&rsquo;s Dwelling Place in Humanity</h2><p>Through His incarnation Christ not only brought divinity into humanity but also became a tabernacle to God as God&rsquo;s habitation on earth among men. According to the Old Testament history, the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling on earth; Christ as the tabernacle is God&rsquo;s dwelling in humanity.</p><h2 class="head3">3. As the Means by Which Man Contacts God<br />and Thereby Receives and Enjoys God</h2><p>Christ, the incarnate God, as the embodiment of God became the dwelling of God in humanity as the means by which man could contact and thereby receive and enjoy God. God, who originally was above the heavens, hidden and untouchable (John 1:18a; 1 Tim. 6:16a), became flesh through Christ and was embodied in Him as the tabernacle. Through this tabernacle man can contact God and enter into God to receive Him and enjoy Him as grace and reality in fullness (John 1:14c).</p><h2 class="head3">4. It Being Made of Wood Overlaid with Gold</h2><p>The tabernacle was made of standing boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 26:15, 29). Acacia wood signifies Christ&rsquo;s humanity, strong in character and high in standard. Christ&rsquo;s humanity is the basic element for Him to be God&rsquo;s expression and dwelling place. Gold signifies Christ&rsquo;s divinity, divine, pure, and eternally unchanging. The acacia wood was overlaid with gold inside and outside, signifying that the divine nature was mingled with the human nature and that the divine nature penetrates the human nature and is expressed through it. Hence, with Christ as the tabernacle, which is a mingling of divinity and humanity, God obtains a concrete expression and dwelling place in humanity.</p><h2 class="head3">5. It Being Divided into Two Sections&mdash;<br />the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies</h2><p>The tabernacle was divided into two sections separated by a veil. The section outside the veil was called the Holy Place, and the section inside the veil was called the Holy of Holies (Exo. 26:33). Within the tabernacle there were a number of furnishings, signifying the different aspects of our experience of Christ after we have entered into God. In the Holy Place there were the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar near the Holy of Holies. The table of the bread of the Presence signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply, the lampstand signifies our experience of Christ as the shining light, and the incense altar signifies our experience of Christ as the sweet incense to God for our acceptance by God.</p><p>In the Holy of Holies there was the ark, which signifies Christ as the place where God met with people. Within the ark there were the golden pot containing the hidden manna, Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod, and the two tables of the covenant (Heb. 9:4). The hidden manna in the golden pot signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply in the deepest way; the budding rod signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry; the two tables of the covenant, which are the tables of the Ten Commandments, signify our experience of Christ as the enlightening inner law, which regulates us according to God&rsquo;s divine nature.</p><h2 class="head3">6. Its Covering</h2><p>According to Exodus 26:1-14, the covering of the tabernacle was of four layers. The first layer, the innermost layer, was made of ten curtains, which were of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen. This typifies Christ&rsquo;s fine and perfect humanity. With Christ there is no defect or bias. Christ in His human living, in both nature and appearance, lived as a heavenly man; He is also kingly both in position and behavior. Such a full and complete One shed His blood for redemption for sinners.</p><p>The second layer was made of eleven curtains of goats&rsquo; hair for a tent over the tabernacle. This signifies that Christ was made sin for us to bear all the sins of us sinners. This redeeming Christ was judged by God and thereby became our covering and protection. The third layer was made of rams&rsquo; skins dyed red as a covering for the tent. This signifies that Christ suffered death and shed His blood to become our covering. The fourth layer, the outermost layer, was a covering of porpoise skins as the top covering for the tent to stand against the wind, the rain, and the scorching of the sun. This signifies Christ as the One who is able to withstand any attack. As the rams&rsquo; skins, Christ covers us from God&rsquo;s judgment and enables us to stand before God. As the porpoise skins, He withstands for us all the attacks in our environment and enables us to stand strongly.</p><p>This shows us clearly that the four layers of the tabernacle&mdash;the curtains of fine linen, the curtains of goats&rsquo; hair, the covering of rams&rsquo; skins, and the top covering of porpoise skins&mdash;all are types of Christ, showing that He, the fine and perfect One, as our Substitute accomplished redemption for us and became our covering before God and our protection against any kind of attack.</p><h2 class="head3">7. Its Two Veils</h2><p>The tabernacle had two veils, one being the outer veil, the screen at the entrance of the tabernacle, and the other being the inner veil, the veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies (Exo. 26:31-37). Both of these veils are related to our entering into the tabernacle, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and they both typify Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">a. The Outer Screen</h2><p>The outer screen was an embroidery work of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, with five pillars of wood overlaid with gold and five sockets of bronze. This screen typifies Christ as the fine, pure, heavenly, royal, divine, and glorious One who suffered God&rsquo;s righteous judgment for our sins and became the entrance to God&rsquo;s Holy Place that we, the redeemed sinners, might enter into it to enjoy Christ&rsquo;s life supply and enlightening and to be accepted by God.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Inner Veil</h2><p>The inner veil was exactly the same as the screen in material and in workmanship. Unlike the screen, the inner veil was embroidered with cherubim and put on four pillars of wood overlaid with gold upon four sockets of silver. This veil typifies the flesh of Christ (Heb. 10:20b). When Christ&rsquo;s flesh was crucified, this veil was rent from the top to the bottom (Matt. 27:51), thus opening a new and living way (Heb. 10:20a) for us who were alienated from God, who is signified by the tree of life (Gen. 3:22-24), to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God.</p><p>As the screen, Christ died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) so that our sins may be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. Through this we may enter into the Holy Place and be brought back into God. As the veil, Christ died for us so that we may be terminated. This is the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. Through this we are brought to God in the Holy of Holies to live to God. Thus, we are fully reconciled to God and in harmony with God (2 Cor. 5:19-20).</p><h2 class="head3">8. Its Hangings</h2><p>Besides the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, the tabernacle has the court as its outermost sphere, which was one hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide. On the four sides there were hangings made of fine, white twined linen, pillars of bronze with their sockets, and the hooks of the pillars with their rods, of silver (Exo. 27:9-19). The hangings of the outer court signify Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness to be the expression and boundary of God&rsquo;s building. This expression was bright, clean, and without mixture. Furthermore, within this sphere everything was righteous toward God and men. The pillars and sockets of bronze signify the Christ who was judged by God and became the supporting ground, the separating ground, and the solid base of God&rsquo;s building. The hooks and rods of silver signify Christ&rsquo;s redemption, issuing out of God&rsquo;s righteous judgment, as our holding power and joining strength.</p><p>The materials of the hangings of the outer court consisted of bronze, silver, and linen. This shows us that Christ suffered God&rsquo;s judgment (bronze) on our behalf to accomplish redemption (silver), and now He has become God&rsquo;s righteousness (linen), which we bear upon us, as God&rsquo;s expression and testimony.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Typifying the Church</h2><p>According to the revelation of the entire Bible, the tabernacle portrayed in Exodus 25 through 40 typifies not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ, the church. Christ was incarnated and became the real tabernacle of God on the earth, destroyed by men through His crucifixion but built up again in His resurrection (John 2:19-22). Thus, He as the tabernacle has been enlarged to be the church (1 Tim. 3:15-16) and eventually will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal dwelling place of God and man (Rev. 21:3).</p><h2 class="head3">1. With the Believers as the Standing Boards</h2><p>Under the covering of the tabernacle there were the walls composed of standing boards. According to the record of Exodus 26:15-25, there was a total of forty-eight standing boards in the tabernacle. The number forty-eight is formed by six times eight. The number six refers to the created man, and the number eight refers to resurrection. Therefore, the forty-eight standing boards signify the created, fallen, and redeemed believers as the materials for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Having Both Divinity and Humanity in Christ</h2><p>The standing boards of the tabernacle were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 26:29a). When we were saved and regenerated, not only were we delivered from God&rsquo;s condemnation and judgment, but we also had a change in life and nature. Within us we have the divine nature, signified by gold, and the uplifted humanity of Jesus, signified by acacia wood. We have become a people in Christ who have both divinity and humanity. Christ&rsquo;s divine nature is joined with our human nature as one and is expressed through our human nature.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Being Built Together by Being Joined in Divinity</h2><p>&ldquo;You shall make bars of acacia wood...for the boards...and make their rings of gold as holders for the bars; and you shall overlay the bars with gold&rdquo; (Exo. 26:26-29). This indicates that Christ&rsquo;s divine nature (gold) unites the believers. By the uniting of His divinity we are built together.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Being Built Together as God&rsquo;s Habitation</h2><p>When the believers are united in the divine nature and are built together in Christ, they become God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; By this we see that God&rsquo;s dwelling place built up on earth is not only among us but also in our spirit to be indwelt by the Spirit of God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. It Being Also Called the Tent of Meeting</h2><p>After the tabernacle was built and erected, God came immediately to dwell in it. Exodus 40:34 says, &ldquo;Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.&rdquo; At that time God was not only the God in the heavens but also the God who dwelled among men. The tabernacle and the tent of meeting here refer to the same structure. With respect to man, it is the tent of meeting. But with respect to God, it is the tabernacle. As a type of Christ being God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth, the tabernacle is called the tabernacle. As a type of Christ being the gathering center of God&rsquo;s people, the tabernacle is called the tent of meeting (Lev. 1:1). Hence, on the one hand, the incarnated Christ is God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth, and on the other hand, He is the place where God&rsquo;s people meet with God and where they gather among themselves. In its ultimate consummation this tabernacle will be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the eternal dwelling place of God and His redeemed. Here, God will dwell with us forever and overshadow us with Christ as the tabernacle (Rev. 7:15).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The tabernacle typifies the incarnated Christ as God&rsquo;s concrete expression, God&rsquo;s dwelling place in humanity, and the means by which man contacts God and thereby receives and enjoys God. The tabernacle was made of wood overlaid with gold, signifying that the divine nature was mingled with the human nature for God to obtain a concrete expression and dwelling place in humanity. The tabernacle was divided into two sections: the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. The furnishings within the tabernacle signify the different aspects of the believers&rsquo; experience of Christ after they have entered into God. The four layers of coverings of the tabernacle&mdash;the curtains of fine linen, the curtains of goats&rsquo; hair, the covering of rams&rsquo; skins, and the top covering of porpoise skins&mdash;all are types of Christ, showing that He, the fine and perfect One, as our Substitute accomplished redemption for us and became our covering before God and our protection against any kind of attack. The two veils inside and outside the tabernacle are also types of Christ. As the outer screen, Christ died for our sins so that our sins may be forgiven by God and we may enter into the Holy Place and be brought back into God. As the inner veil, Christ died for us so that we may be terminated and brought to God in the Holy of Holies to be fully reconciled to God and in harmony with God.</p><p>The tabernacle typifies not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ, the church, constituted with the believers as the standing boards. The boards were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold and united together by the rings of gold and the bars of wood overlaid with gold. This signifies that the believers are a group of people with both divinity and humanity in Christ and who are united and built together in the divine nature of Christ into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</p><p>This tabernacle is also called the tent of meeting.

The furnishings inside and outside the tabernacle are types of the contents of the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE FURNITURE OUTSIDE THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>Outside the tabernacle there were two articles of accessory furnishings, one being the bronze laver and the other, the bronze altar.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Bronze Laver</h2><p>According to the arrangement of the furniture of the tabernacle, in location the laver was after the altar, but in function the laver was before the altar. Unless the priests first washed in the laver, they could not minister in the outer court nor in the tabernacle, and there would be no way for the operation of the tabernacle to be brought forth.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Typifying the Holy Spirit Given<br />Based on the Judgment at the Cross</h2><h2 class="head4">a. Bronze Signifying God&rsquo;s Judgment</h2><p>In typology bronze signifies God&rsquo;s judgment. The bronze laver typifies the Holy Spirit given based on the judgment at the cross. On the cross God judged our sin in the flesh of the Lord Jesus (Rom. 8:3). Based on this judgment, God gave us the Holy Spirit for our washing (Titus 3:5).</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Laver Being Made of Bronze Mirrors,<br />Signifying the Holy Spirit as the Judging Spirit<br /> Having the Reflecting Power</h2><p>The laver was made not merely of bronze but of the bronze mirrors of the women who served at the door of the tent of meeting (Exo. 38:8). Bronze mirrors were used to reflect man&rsquo;s true condition. Since the laver was made of bronze mirrors, it implies that the entire laver was a bronze mirror to reflect, expose, and cleanse people. This signifies that the Holy Spirit as the judging Spirit has the power to reflect and expose, making manifest the sins and defilements of people and then washing people (Titus 3:5).</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Priests in Their Ministry<br />First Having to Be Washed in the Laver,<br />Signifying the Believers in Their Service to God<br />First Having to Wash Away Their Uncleanness<br />in the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Before the priests entered the tabernacle or approached the altar to minister, they had to wash their hands and their feet in the laver so that they would not die (Exo. 30:19-20). This signifies that before we believers, as the New Testament priests, serve God by Christ and His cross, we must wash away the defilements that come from our contact with earthly people, things, and matters, in the Holy Spirit of God&rsquo;s judgment. If we remain in these defilements, we cannot serve God, we cannot pray, and we cannot function in the meetings. We need to be washed and renewed daily by the Holy Spirit in the divine element (Titus 3:5) that we may become a new creation with the divine nature to serve God in the divine life for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Bronze Altar</h2><p>According to the arrangement of the furniture, in position the bronze altar was before all the other furnishings. Furthermore, this altar, which was five cubits in length and width and three cubits in height, was the largest item of the tabernacle and could contain all the other furnishings and utensils. This indicates that the bronze altar is the beginning of all spiritual experiences and that it implies all other spiritual experiences.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Typifying the Cross of Christ</h2><p>The bronze altar typifies the cross of Christ. Hebrews 13:10 says, &ldquo;We have an altar from which they who are serving the tabernacle have no right to eat.&rdquo; This altar refers to the cross of Christ, on which He offered all that He was as a sacrifice to God (10:12).</p><h2 class="head4">a. Sinners Needing to Pass through the Altar<br />to Enter the Tabernacle</h2><p>According to the arrangement of all the furniture inside and outside the tabernacle, the ark and the bronze altar are at two ends. The two ends are related to two parties, God and man. God&rsquo;s end is at the ark, and man&rsquo;s end is at the bronze altar. A sinner who wants to go into the tabernacle to meet God must first pass through the altar, that is, the cross of Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Altar Redeeming Sinners<br />from Their Sins and Dealing with Their Sins</h2><p>Because of the fall, man became lost, fell into sin, and was under the righteous judgment of God. Hence, for man to come into the presence of God, he must rely on the cross of Christ, typified by the altar, to redeem him from his sins and to deal with his sins. Christ as the Lamb of God offered Himself as the sacrifice for sins (Heb. 10:12), and His blood has accomplished for us an eternal redemption from our sins (9:12, 14; 1 Pet. 1:18-19) that our sins may be forgiven by God. Furthermore, He was made sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21) in the likeness of the flesh and condemned sin through His death on the cross (Rom. 8:3) that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. Thus, through the cross of Christ we have access to God and are fully reconciled to the righteous God and live to Him.</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Altar Being Overlaid<br />with Bronze Plates Made of the Burnt Censers<br />Used by the Rebellious Ones</h2><p>In Numbers 16 we see that the bronze used to overlay the altar came from the censers of two hundred fifty rebellious ones who were judged by God with fire. After God judged them, He charged Moses to take the bronze censers and make them broad plates for a covering of the altar as a sign to the children of Israel (vv. 2-3, 17-18, 36-38). Hence, the bronze altar signifies the cross as the place where sinners are judged by God. Christ became a man to be our Substitute, and on the cross He took the position of a sinner (1 Pet. 3:18), bearing up the sins of the entire human race (2:24) and suffering God&rsquo;s judgment on behalf of us, the sinners, to save us from God&rsquo;s righteous judgment.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Altar Being in the Outer Court<br />of the Tabernacle, Signifying the Cross of Christ<br />Being Accomplished on the Earth</h2><p>The altar was located in the outer court of the tabernacle. According to the interpretation given in the New Testament, the outer court signifies the earth, and the entire tabernacle, including both the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, signifies the heavens. Therefore, the fact that the altar was located in the outer court signifies that the cross of Christ was accomplished on the earth and is very close and convenient to sinners. Christ came from the heavens to the earth and from God into the midst of men to be the Lamb of God who died on the cross for sinners and accomplished eternal redemption (John 1:29; Heb. 9:12). This cross, which is so close to sinners, is exceedingly convenient for sinners to apply the redemption of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE FURNITURE INSIDE THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>The furnishings outside the tabernacle are for assisting those who enter into the tabernacle to serve and draw near to God; the furnishings inside the tabernacle are the contents of the tabernacle, ministering to people the riches of Christ in different aspects.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Table of the Bread of the Presence</h2><p>The first item of the contents of the tabernacle was the table of the bread of the Presence (Exo. 40:4). Upon this table the presence-bread was to be displayed continually (Exo. 25:30). The bread was for the priests as their portion for eternity (Lev. 24:9). Therefore, the table of the bread of the Presence signifies the riches of Christ&rsquo;s life as the bread of life (John 6:48) for the supply of God&rsquo;s people that they may live and serve in God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p><p>The table of the bread of the Presence was made of acacia wood and was overlaid with gold (Exo. 25:23-24). Acacia wood signifies Christ&rsquo;s humanity as the basic element for Him to be our feast; being overlaid with gold signifies Christ&rsquo;s divinity as the expression of God. As we enjoy Christ&rsquo;s humanity as the supply with which to serve God, the outcome will be Christ&rsquo;s divinity as the expression of God. The more we enjoy Christ as the basic element of our feast, the more we express God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Golden Lampstand</h2><p>The second item of the contents of the tabernacle was the golden lampstand (Exo. 40:4), which signifies that Christ in His divinity is the light of life that shines over God&rsquo;s redeemed people. The lampstand was not made of acacia wood; it was entirely of pure gold. This indicates that it was not because of Christ&rsquo;s humanity that the light was shining but because of Christ&rsquo;s divinity. The Gospel of John, which unveils the divinity of Christ, tells us explicitly that Christ is the light of life. Chapter one opens with the words, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....In Him was life, and the life was the light of men&rdquo; (vv. 1, 4). In 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo; Moreover, 1 John 1:5 says, &ldquo;God is light.&rdquo; Light comes from divinity; the light of life is derived from Christ&rsquo;s divinity. This is the significance of the lampstand being of pure gold.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Golden Incense Altar</h2><p>The third item of the contents of the tabernacle was the golden incense altar (Exo. 40:5). The incense altar is a place to burn incense. Burning the incense signifies praying, and incense signifies Christ with all His merit. Therefore, incense signifies Christ as the means by which God&rsquo;s redeemed are accepted by God. Christ is the Intercessor to maintain the relationship between God and His people (Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25). According to the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle and the outer court, the ark is the focus. However, in actual practice the center is the golden incense altar. This indicates that the intercession of Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s administration. The book of Revelation is a book of God&rsquo;s administration. It reveals the throne of God and the administration of God throughout the universe. However, the executing center actually is not the throne; the executing center is the incense altar in chapter eight. There, in verses 3 through 5, we see that upon this altar the prayers of the saints are offered to God and that Christ as the incense is added to these prayers. When the prayers of the saints ascend to God with the incense of Christ and are accepted by God, God executes the judgments in His administration.</p><p>Therefore, we must enjoy Christ as our prayers and allow Him to pray in our praying that the prayers of the individual Christ may become the prayers of the corporate Christ. Thus, God will execute the move of His economy on the earth.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Ark</h2><p>All the above three items were in the Holy Place. The fourth item of the contents of the tabernacle was the ark in the Holy of Holies. The ark was the place where God met with people and spoke to people (Exo. 25:22). It signifies Christ in His redemption as the place where God meets with man and speaks to man. In the ark was the law of the Ten Commandments, which by its holy and righteous requirement exposed and condemned the sins of the people who came to contact God. However, by the lid of the ark, with the propitiating blood sprinkled on it on the Day of Propitiation (Lev. 16:15-17, 34), the entire situation on the sinner&rsquo;s side was fully covered. Therefore, upon this sin-covering lid God could meet with the people who broke His righteous law, and He could do this without, governmentally, any contradiction to His righteousness, even under the observing of the cherubim that bore His glory and overshadowed the lid of the ark. Thus, the problem between man and God was appeased, enabling God to meet with those who come forward to His presence. This is a prefigure of Christ as the Lamb of God who took away the sin that caused man to have a problem with God (John 1:29) by offering Himself once for all on the cross as the sacrifice for sins (Heb. 9:14; 10:12). Moreover, through His own blood He entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, thus accomplishing an eternal redemption for us and appeasing the problem between man and God. Thus, because of the blood of Christ we and God can meet together, have peace with one another, and communicate with and speak to one another in Christ.</p><p>Within the ark there were also the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron&rsquo;s rod that budded, and the two tablets of the covenant, all of which signify our deeper and more inward experiences of Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Golden Pot That Had the Manna</h2><p>After the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt, God gave them manna from heaven as their food. Furthermore, He commanded Moses to take a golden pot, put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Him to be kept throughout the generations (Exo. 16:33-34). This manna is called the hidden manna (Rev. 2:17), signifying our deepest experience of Christ as our life supply, which is deeper than that which is signified by the table of the bread of the Presence. This is a special portion reserved by the Lord for those who overcome the degradation of the worldly church, as their daily supply today and as their special enjoyment to be their reward in the coming kingdom.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Aaron&rsquo;s Rod That Budded</h2><p>After the judgment of God on Korah and his company for their rebellion in the wilderness, in order to vindicate the proper authority of leadership, God told the leaders of the twelve tribes to each take a rod and lay up their rods before the ark. On the next day, the rod of Aaron had sprouted, put forth buds, produced blossoms, and born ripe almonds (Num. 17:3-8, 10). The rod that budded signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry. This is deeper than the experience of Christ as the incense for our acceptance by God.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Two Tablets of the Covenant</h2><p>The two tablets of the covenant, which are the tablets of the Ten Commandments (Exo. 25:21), signify our experience of Christ as the enlightening inner law (Heb. 8:10), which regulates us according to God&rsquo;s divine nature. The law of commandments regulates us from without by and according to its dead letters; the law of life as the issue of Christ&rsquo;s being our life enlightens and regulates us from within. This is deeper than the experience of Christ as the shining lampstand in the Holy Place.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The furnishings inside and outside the tabernacle are types of the contents of the New Testament. Outside the tabernacle there were two articles of accessory furnishings, one being the bronze laver and the other, the bronze altar. The laver typifies the Holy Spirit given based on the judgment at the cross. Furthermore, since the laver was made of bronze mirrors, it signifies that the Holy Spirit as the judging Spirit has the power to reflect and expose, making manifest the sins and defilements of people and then washing the people. The bronze altar typifies the cross of Christ. A sinner who wants to go into the tabernacle must first pass through the altar, that is, the cross of Christ, for his redemption from sins and for the dealing with his sins. The altar was overlaid with bronze plates made of the burnt censers used by the rebellious ones, signifying that the cross, typified by the altar, is the place where sinners are judged by God. The altar was located in the outer court of the tabernacle, signifying that the cross of Christ was accomplished on the earth and is very close and convenient to sinners.</p><p>The furnishings within the tabernacle are the contents of the tabernacle, ministering to people the riches of Christ in different aspects. The first item was the table of the bread of the Presence, signifying the riches of Christ&rsquo;s life as the bread of life for the supply of God&rsquo;s people that they may live and serve in God&rsquo;s dwelling place. The second item was the golden lampstand, which signifies that Christ in His divinity is the light of life that shines over God&rsquo;s redeemed people. The third item was the golden incense altar, which signifies Christ as the means by which God&rsquo;s redeemed are accepted by God. The fourth item was the ark in the Holy of Holies, signifying Christ in His redemption as the place where God meets with man and speaks to man. Within the ark there were also the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron&rsquo;s rod that budded, and the two tablets of the covenant, all of which signify our deeper and more inward experiences of Christ.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What are the two items of the furnishings outside the tabernacle?

Furthermore, Christ in His flesh went through the process of death and resurrection to constitute the holy anointing oil and the holy incense with His divine and human elements, the element of His human living on earth, and the element of His death and resurrection that we might belong to God and be acceptable to God. The holy anointing oil typifies the compound Spirit, consummated by the Triune God passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, that is, the pneumatic Christ, who is God incarnated and who went through human living, died, and resurrected to anoint the persons and things that belong to God. The holy incense typifies Christ, who was incarnated, died, and resurrected, becoming the divine incense so that all the persons and things that have been anointed by the holy anointing oil and belong to God may be acceptable to God.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL</h2><p>Beginning with chapter twenty-five of Exodus, we have a description of the tabernacle and all its furnishings, the clothing and the food of the priests, and the incense altar, the propitiation silver, and the bronze laver. After this, we have the holy anointing oil. The compounded ointment was used to anoint the tabernacle with all its furnishings and the ministering priests, that all these things and persons could be sanctified. This ointment signifies God, who is triune, after a long process becoming the all-inclusive compound Spirit to reach His chosen and redeemed people to be one with them.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Its Ingredients and Composition</h2><p>According to the record in Exodus 30:22-25, the ingredients of the holy anointing oil are of two categories: the spices and the olive oil. The spices include four kinds: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. In typology, each of the ingredients has its significance.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Flowing Myrrh</h2><p>Myrrh comes from an aromatic tree, the juice of which may be used to reduce the suffering of death (cf. Mark 15:23). In the Bible myrrh is used mostly for burial (Gen. 50:26; John 19:39). Flowing myrrh, smelling sweet but tasting bitter, signifies the precious death of Christ. The crucified Christ tasted death on our behalf (Heb. 2:9) to take away the pain of death.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Fragrant Cinnamon</h2><p>Cinnamon has a distinctive flavor and can also be used to stimulate the heart. Fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death for our healing and encouragement.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Calamus</h2><p>Calamus is a kind of reed. It grows in a marsh but is able to shoot up into the air. Hence, calamus signifies the resurrection of Christ. Christ was put into a place of death, but in resurrection He rose up and stood up.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Cassia</h2><p>Cassia and cinnamon belong to the same family. Cinnamon is from the inner part of the bark, and cassia, from the outer part of the bark. In ancient times cassia was used as a repellent to drive away insects, snakes, and scorpions. Hence, cassia signifies the power and the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection for us to overcome the demons and all negative things.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Olive Oil</h2><p>In the Bible olive oil signifies the Spirit of God. One hin of olive oil is the basic element of the ointment, signifying that the unique God is the base of the compound Spirit. The four spices&mdash;flowing myrrh, fragrant cinnamon, calamus, and cassia&mdash;are compounded into the olive oil to be blended, mingled, and combined together to make the ointment. This indicates that the Spirit of God, signified by the olive oil, became the compound Spirit, signified by the holy anointing ointment, through the process of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Before Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection, the compound Spirit was not yet; it was after Christ&rsquo;s glorification at His resurrection that the compound Spirit was consummated (John 7:39).</p><p>In this compound ointment there are the numbers four and one. The four spices signify humanity in God&rsquo;s creation, and the one hin of olive oil signifies divinity in the Godhead. This indicates that in the compounded Spirit, signified by the holy ointment, there are the elements of divinity, humanity, Christ&rsquo;s death with its effectiveness, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with its power. All these elements are blended in the compound Spirit.</p><p>In addition, the measures of the four spices are rich in spiritual significance. Five hundred shekels of myrrh signify one unit of full responsibility. Two hundred fifty shekels of cinnamon and two hundred fifty shekels of calamus together form one unit, signifying that the Second of the Divine Trinity was split through death. Five hundred shekels of cassia also signify one unit of full responsibility. The first unit signifies the Father; the second unit, the Son, who was split on the cross; and the third unit, the Spirit. Hence, the three units of measure of the four spices signify the Triune God. Three units of four spices, each unit being of five hundred shekels, signify the Triune God in resurrection mingled with humanity to bear the full responsibility (signified by the number five).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Its Function</h2><p>The function of the holy anointing oil is to sanctify the things of God and the men of God, separating them from anything common and making them most holy for God&rsquo;s service, that they might be joined to the processed Triune God and become one with Him. Exodus 30:29-30 says: &ldquo;Thus you shall sanctify them that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy. And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons and sanctify them that they may serve Me as priests.&rdquo; Whoever or whatever was anointed was sanctified, set apart. The ointment became a mark separating them from anything common that they might be unto God and be joined to God.</p><p>First John 2:20-27 reveals that this ointment, which typifies the compound Spirit, has its function in the believers. This ointment is constantly anointing us. That is, the indwelling compound Spirit moves and operates in us continually to transmit the divine elements&mdash;Jesus, Christ, the Father, the Son, and the eternal life&mdash;into us that we may know the reality of the Divine Trinity and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). Thus, we are mingled with the Triune God as one and are sanctified for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation and the service of the priesthood.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE HOLY INCENSE</h2><p>In Exodus 30, after the record concerning the holy anointing oil, there is the description of the holy incense (vv. 34-38). The anointing oil reveals how God comes to us in Christ and with Christ, whereas the holy incense signifies how we go to God in Christ and with Christ. This is a divine two-way traffic: through the holy anointing oil Christ coming to us from God and with God for us to enjoy, and with the incense Christ going to God with us for God&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Its Ingredients and Composition</h2><p>Both the holy anointing oil and the holy incense are portraits of the Triune God. In the holy anointing oil and the holy incense we see divinity, humanity, the mingling of divinity with humanity, and Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</p><p>The holy anointing oil is composed of three spices&mdash;stacte, onycha, and galbanum&mdash;and pure frankincense. The first three form one group, while the last one is in a category by itself. Hence, here we have three plus one, which equals four. Three is the number of the Triune God, and four, the number of the creature, the human being. This means that the Triune God becomes a human being, bringing divinity into humanity.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Stacte</h2><p>The first of the fragrant spices is stacte. It is a resinous gum used as the purest myrrh, a myrrh that is edible. Hence, stacte signifies the sweet death of Christ. Christ died on the cross and poured forth His human life that He might bring the fallen sinners to God. Furthermore, stacte as a plant signifies Christ&rsquo;s generating life. Through His death He produced the sons of God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Onycha</h2><p>Onycha is the shell of a little animal, a shell that is good for medicine and is also used as a spice. This signifies that Christ with His redemptive life died for sinners. Through His death on the cross Christ released His redemptive life for sinners.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Galbanum</h2><p>Galbanum is also a resinous gum. Its odor is exceedingly strong, unpleasant, and offensive. It has three strange functions. First, it strengthens the fragrance of the other spices; second, it causes the fragrance of the incense to remain and endure; and third, it functions as a repellent to repel and expel noxious insects and poisonous reptiles and snakes. This indicates that the death of Christ not only strengthens and preserves the other elements but also has the power to expel the evil Satan and the demons.</p><p>All three spices that constituted the holy incense signify the death of Christ. Through His death Christ redeemed the fallen sinners, produced the sons of God, and expelled the old serpent, the devil.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Frankincense</h2><p>Frankincense is a white resinous gum signifying the sweet resurrection of Christ. Hence, following our experience of Christ&rsquo;s death, we also need the experience of His resurrection.</p><p>Exodus 30:34 says that &ldquo;there shall be an equal part of each.&rdquo; This means that there was to be an equal proportion of each of the four basic elements. This signifies that all the attributes of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection are even. Hence, we need an equal portion of the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</p><p>Besides these four elements, there is salt. Exodus 30:35 says: &ldquo;And you shall make of it incense, a perfume according to the perfumer&rsquo;s art, seasoned with salt, pure, and holy.&rdquo; Salt here signifies the cross of Christ, that is, His killing death. In salt there is corruption-killing power, and it also functions as a preservative (Lev. 2:13). This signifies that Christ&rsquo;s death has the killing power and the preserving power. With the holy ointment the tempering element is oil, but with the holy incense the tempering element is salt, which causes the incense to become pure. This means that God&rsquo;s coming to us is a matter of our being oiled, but our going to God is a matter of our being salted. This is because with God there is nothing unclean. He comes to us from a pure source. However, our source is full of uncleanness. Therefore, our going to God requires salt, that is, the cross of Christ, that we may become holy and pure.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Its Function</h2><p>Exodus 30:36 says: &ldquo;And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put some of it before the testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it shall be to you most holy.&rdquo; The grinding of the incense and putting it before the testimony in the tent of meeting signifies that Christ&rsquo;s sweet death and His fragrant resurrection are blended and offered to God as a base for the intercession of Christ and His members.</p><p>In both the Old Testament and the New Testament incense signifies our prayer (Psa. 141:2; Rev. 5:8). This kind of prayer, which is actually Christ, is our ascending to God through Christ and with Christ. This is a sweet-smelling fragrance to God. In the Old Testament, before the serving priests entered the tabernacle, they were required to come to the altar in the outer court to be cleansed and nourished. Then they were qualified to enter the tabernacle and come to the table of the bread of the Presence to receive a further supply of life. After this, they came to the lampstand to receive light. This light guided them to the ark, where they could contact God. God&rsquo;s presence then led them to the golden incense altar, the place of prayer. So also it is in our experience. We begin from the bronze altar, the cross of Christ, and eventually we come into God&rsquo;s presence. The outcome is prayer that is Christ ascending to God as incense for God&rsquo;s acceptance.</p><p>For the two-way traffic between the Triune God and us, we need the anointing of the holy ointment, and we also need the burning of the holy incense. God anoints us with the holy ointment, and we offer the holy incense to God. Thus, God sanctifies us with the holy ointment that we may enjoy the compound Spirit, and we satisfy God with our prayer, the holy incense, and carry out God&rsquo;s administration.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The holy anointing oil and the holy incense reveal a divine two-way traffic: through the holy anointing oil Christ coming to us from God and with God for us to enjoy, and with the incense Christ going to God with us for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. The holy ointment was made by the compounding together of flowing myrrh, fragrant cinnamon, calamus, cassia, and olive oil. Flowing myrrh signifies the precious death of Christ, fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death, calamus signifies the resurrection of Christ, cassia signifies the power and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and olive oil signifies the Spirit of God. Furthermore, in this compound ointment there are the numbers four and one, signifying humanity and divinity. This indicates that in the holy ointment, which typifies the compound Spirit, consummated by the Triune God passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, there are the elements of divinity, humanity, Christ&rsquo;s death and its effectiveness, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and its power. This compound Spirit anoints, moves, and operates in the believers to transmit His divine elements into them that they may be joined with the Triune God as one and sanctified for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation and the service of the priesthood.</p><p>The holy incense was made with three spices&mdash;stacte, onycha, and galbanum&mdash;and pure frankincense plus salt. The three spices signify that Christ&rsquo;s death not only redeemed the fallen sinners but also produced the sons of God and expelled the evil Satan and the demons. Frankincense signifies Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Salt signifies that the cross of Christ has the killing power and the preserving power that incense may become pure incense. This indicates that the holy incense signifies the incarnated Christ, who passed through death and was resurrected to become the divine incense. His sweet death and His fragrant resurrection are blended and offered to God as a base for the intercession of Christ and His members, so that all who are anointed by the compound Spirit and separated unto God may be accepted by God.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>How do the holy anointing oil and the holy incense portray a divine two-way traffic?</li><li>What are the elements that constitute the holy anointing oil?</li><li>Briefly state the spiritual significances of the four spices in the holy ointment.</li><li>Use the function of the holy ointment to explain the function of the compound Spirit in the believers.</li><li>Briefly state the spiritual significance seen in the elements, the composition, and the function of the holy incense.</li></ol></body></html>
