<h2 class="head1">WHO RULES THE UNIVERSE?</h2><p>I do not know if anyone can be so bold as to say that there is no God in the universe. But let us set this question aside for now. Consider the universe again. It is very big, but at the same time, it is very small. Objects that are even undetectable to the microscope have definite structures, laws, and order. This is true with whatever micro-object you consider. Men used to say that atoms were the smallest objects. Later they discovered that electrons were smaller. Recently, men have found that there are particles that are even smaller than electrons. Although these particles are small, they have definite principles, laws, and order governing them. If there is no God, who is organizing these things? How can it be a coincidence? There must be a God who rules and arranges everything. Otherwise, how can we have the wonderful order that we have today? The order of things can only speak of two possibilities. It can either be by chance, or it must be set into place by someone. It can only come by chance or arrangement. Either someone has arranged these things, or they have come about by accident. One of the two must be right.</p><h2 class="head1">BY CHANCE?</h2><p>Anything that happens by chance happens without a reason; anything that comes by arrangement speaks of someone behind the scene who is planning and executing. If no one in this universe is arranging everything, and if everything occurs by chance, then we are truly lost and bewildered. Some friends have said that the universe was formed when one object collided into another and a third object was produced. I cannot understand this logic. I have never seen one object in this world that is the result of two things randomly colliding into one another. My handkerchief did not come about by a few branches colliding with each other to produce cotton, and cotton colliding with cotton to produce threads, and threads colliding with each other to produce a handkerchief. I simply cannot understand this logic. There is nothing in this universe that has come about by chance collision.</p><p>Let me tell you a real story to illustrate this point about producing things by chance. A man was visiting a factory in America that manufactured meat grinders, and he talked with the factory manager. These meat grinders can be found everywhere in Shanghai among butchers and meat hawkers; they are small machines that shred the beef into small pieces. During the visit, the man discussed the origin of the universe with the manager. The manager said that there must be a wise and powerful God who had set everything in the universe in order. Another person who was there said, "There is no God in the universe, and everything came by chance." The manager did not argue with him; rather, he led him to where the meat grinders were being manufactured. He told the man, "My little machine is made up of only eight parts. Since you have said that the universe came about by chance, please try and put this machine together by chance. I will put the eight parts and a few screws into a box. Please shake the box and see if you can make a meat grinder out of it. I have a few hundred workers in this factory. The most capable ones can assemble two hundred machines a day. If I hired a simple girl from the countryside, who has never seen such a machine, she could do the job within a few days no matter how slow she was. But if you shook the box like I said, you would not get one machine in a month or even a year. This is impossible!" A little machine that is worth only $3.70 cannot be produced by chance. Could the vast universe have been produced by chance? Is it possible that all the objects in this world were produced by chance? A carpenter can make a chair like the one I am sitting on in half an hour. But if we waited for it to be produced by chance, I am afraid that we would not have a chair to sit on today. It is too incredible for the many things in this universe to come about by chance. There must be someone who has designed the universe, in order for it to be as orderly and logical as it is. Even the most foolish and uneducated person in this world can come to this conclusion. Unless a man is a fool, he has to believe that there is a God. If he does not believe this, there must be something wrong with his mind. At any rate, there is a God. It is illogical for man to believe that there is no God. Those who do not believe in God must have something wrong in their mind.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TESTIMONY OF THE CONSCIENCE</h2><p>The above examples are merely objective proofs of the existence of God. Let us consider the question of God's existence from another angle: the psychological makeup of man. There is a large organization in America called the National Geographic Society. It investigates cultures and geographies of different parts of the world. It has one conclusion concerning its members' many investigations&mdash;every race on earth, no matter how cultured or wild, advanced or backward, has one thing in common&mdash;a belief in God. Everywhere one goes, even among the uncivilized Miao natives, men believe in God. A man may be unintelligent and not able to think logically; he may not be able to give many reasons. But if he searches his heart, he knows that there is a God. Many people are only stubborn in their speaking; in their conscience they know that there is a God.</p><p>In 1925, there was a preacher who passed through a jungle in South America. Suddenly he heard a cry for help, and he ran towards the sound. When he approached a river, he saw a man on a canoe going downstream. The current of the river was strong, and not far from him was a waterfall. If no one came to his rescue, the man would die by falling over the waterfall. At that time, the man cried with all his strength: "O God, O God, save me, save me!" When the preacher saw this, he tried his best and saved the man.</p><p>The next day, the preacher passed through the same jungle again and saw a few hundred people gathered around someone who was speaking, and he drew near to hear what he was saying. The man talked about God, and he gave many reasons why there was no God. After the man finished, he challenged the audience: "I have given many reasons for the nonexistence of God. If anyone is not happy with these reasons, he can bring up his arguments now." The preacher went up to the platform and said, "I do not know how to argue, and I cannot give many reasons. But I can tell you a story. Yesterday as I was walking through the jungle, I heard someone crying, `O God, O God, save me, save me!' I ran towards the sound by the river and saw a man sitting in a canoe. The water was rapid, and the boat was moving close to a waterfall. His life was in danger, and I saved him and took him home. I would like to introduce this man to you now. The one who was crying to God for help yesterday is the gentleman here today who is giving you many reasons why there is no God. You can ask him yourself if I am right or not."</p><p>Indeed, many people have their conscience covered up. Before their conscience is awakened, they can give many reasons for saying that there is no God. But when they are at the end of themselves, when they are about to die, and when they think of their future, their conscience tells them that there is a God. They can brush the matter aside now. They can say that they are young and that such things do not matter. But the day will come when they will step into eternity, and their sleeping conscience will speak out. I have often said that the conscience can sleep, but it will never die. When the time comes, it will speak out. However, it may be too late to know God by then.</p><p>There were a father and son in England who were both strong and zealous atheists. One day the father was about to die, and he was tossing about in his bed. He seemed to be very restless. When the son saw this, he was afraid that the old man would be shaken in his conviction, and he encouraged him, saying, "Father, hold tight." His father turned to him in tears and asked, "Hold tight to what?" Since they did not have God, what was there for them to hold tight to? But we have to thank the Lord because there is something that we can hold onto. There is something which we can lean back on. We know whom we believe.</p><p>Friends, please listen to the inner voice. Our mind will often give us wrong ideas; it is affected by outside influences. But the inner voice is trustworthy; it represents our true self. Please listen to the inner urge.</p><p>I have searched into the matter and concluded that no one is born an atheist; everyone becomes one through the influence of environment. This is why our conscience is the most valuable guide, and we should follow its leading all the time.</p>
