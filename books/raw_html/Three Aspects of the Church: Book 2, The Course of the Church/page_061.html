	 <h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF GIVING ALL FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S USE</h2>
<p>The recovery of giving all for the Lord&rsquo;s use is still practiced among us (cf. Acts 2:44). In 1943 in northern China, the flow of the Holy Spirit was so strong that of eight hundred brothers and sisters, more than ninety percent placed their all into the Lord&rsquo;s hands&mdash;not merely in prayer or in word, but even more, they placed everything practically in the Lord&rsquo;s hands. I was present at that time, and there are other saints among us today who were in that flow. That was an unprecedented occurrence since the church came to China.</p>
<p>If it had not been for the war between China and Japan, more than three hundred brothers and sisters would have migrated to the northwest. The first migration to the northwest included more than seventy people; another thirty went to Korea and to the border of Manchuria. The brothers and sisters who went to the northwest in the spring of 1943 raised up meetings in more than forty places in less than one year.</p>
<p>The first group to migrate did not have much education and was somewhat weak. One brother&rsquo;s father-in-law was a doctor, and he was probably the most highly educated person among that migrating group; that family is still in the northwest today. However, when this group of saints consecrated themselves and all that they had and placed it in the Lord&rsquo;s hands, God did marvelous things through them. That recovery still influences us today. It is a pity that when it happened, we did not record all the details.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us and make us humble, because after we have recovered a spiritual item, it cannot be kept in oldness. We must live every day in newness, and we must renew our vision daily in order to be able to continue the former things. Otherwise, we will not experience anything new, and we will lose even the old things.</p>
<p>During the revival in northern China in 1943, Brother Sun Feng-lu said to me, &ldquo;I feel that the condition of the church today is just like the condition of the church on the day of Pentecost.&rdquo; He suggested that we should make a record of what was happening because so many things were God&rsquo;s wonderful working and demonstrated the work of the Holy Spirit. Regrettably, those things passed without being recorded. It would be difficult at this point for me to recall what happened and write something about it. It would require special grace from the Holy Spirit to remember everything that happened; we really had the Lord&rsquo;s presence. One brother, a doctor, was very proud and had a terrible temper; everyone was afraid of him. However, in that flow of revival, the Lord gained him strongly. Even today, thirteen years later, that brother is diligently following the Lord. That flow was very strong.</p>
<p>When a person is graced with being part of one of God&rsquo;s special moves on this earth, it is the greatest blessing of his life. God&rsquo;s move makes an impression that he will never forget, and it becomes an unending source of supply to him. Whoever can participate in such a flow is most blessed. I believe that whenever someone who was in such a flow thinks back on it, he will have fond memories of that time. The revival in northern China in 1943 was a very strong flow; many people were gained by God at that time. Many of the consecrations were not loose but were very strong. That flow of revival had a great influence on the churches in China after the war ended. It is a great blessing for a person to be able to participate in the flow of God&rsquo;s work, the flow of revival, at least once in his lifetime.</p>
