   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT A HISTORY OF THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Tim 3:16-17; John 6:63; 2 Cor 3:6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us trace together the history of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Old Testament is made up of thirty-nine books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first five, which are called the Pentateuch, were written by Moses, as we know.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Other books were gradually added.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then, after the return from the Babylonian captivity, further books, like Daniel, Nehemiah, Ezra, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi were written.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Though the date cannot be accurately fixed, from either the fourth or third century B.C. all thirty-nine books were generally recognized by the Jews as their sacred writings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes, however, the books were grouped together to make a total of twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the time of Christ the Old Testament was called the law John 12:34 and the Scripture 10:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The central focus of the Old Testament is the prophecy and the types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then Christ Himself came and lived on this earth thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His life was actually a speaking, expressing God Himself as the reality to mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His living was more than a model or pattern; it spoke forth God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a sense He was held in the flesh for those years, waiting to be processed from the flesh into another form.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After His death by crucifixion, He was processed into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As God, He had taken the step of incarnation to become flesh and was confined in this form until released by crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once He was ushered into resurrection, He took a further step and became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus Christ, as the life-giving Spirit, includes God and divinity; man and humanity; the mingling of these two in incarnation; a pattern of the uplifted human living that can satisfy God's eternal purpose; His precious, all-inclusive death; and His mysterious, all-transcending resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This One represents God, man, and all His accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Though He is so great, He is as available as the air you breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you take Him into you, you are receiving God, the proper humanity, the proper human living, the incarnation, the all-inclusive death, the wonderful resurrection, and the transcendent ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By breathing Him in, all His accomplishments become your reality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the New Testament which reveals this to us, though for all these centuries the vision has not been as clear as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How could we know these marvelous truths if the four Gospels had not been written and printed?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John present a composite picture of this wonderful One, each written from a different side or angle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without all four, our picture of Him would be incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament continues with the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this book we have the record of how Christ was preached, propagated, and reproduced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without the Acts, how could we know that this wonderful Person has been propagated into humanity and become the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without the Epistles from Romans to Jude, how could we know that the churches are His Body, His expression?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How could we know how the Christian life and the church life should be?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Revelation we have the completing of the revelation of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without this final book, we would not know that the churches today are the lampstands and tomorrow are the New Jerusalem, expressing Him in full.</S>
