OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(12)</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head3">52. The Word, the Lamb of God,<br />
the Baptizer, and the Heavenly Ladder</h2>
<p>John 1 presents Christ as the Word, the Lamb of God, the Baptizer, and the heavenly ladder.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Word</h2>
<p>The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, the Word is God defined, explained, and expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) In the Beginning</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo; (v. 1a). As the Word (vv. 1-5, 14-18) Christ was in the beginning. The phrase <em>in the beginning</em> in verse 1a means in eternity past.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) With God and Being God</h2>
<p>The remainder of verse 1 says, &ldquo;The Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; To say that the Word was with God means that the Word is not separate from God. It is not that the Word is the Word and that God is God, and that they are thus separate from each other. Rather, the Word and God are one. For this reason, the next clause in verse 1 says that the Word was God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in the beginning with God&rdquo; (v. 2). From eternity past the Word was with God. Contrary to what is supposed by some, it is not that Christ was not with God and was not God from eternity past, and that at a certain time Christ became God and was with God. Christ&rsquo;s deity is eternal and absolute. From eternity past to eternity future, He is with God and He is God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) In Him Being Life,<br />
and the Life Being the Light of Men</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In Him [the Word] was life, and the life was the light of men&rdquo; (v. 4). <em>Life</em> here refers to the life signified by the tree of life in Genesis 2. This is confirmed by the fact that in Revelation 22 John mentions the tree of life. Since life is in Him, He is life (John 11:25; 14:6), and He came that man might have life (10:10b).</p>
<p>Life is in the Word, the expression of God. Life can be found only in the expression of God. The Word, which is the expression and explanation of God, contains God as our life. When we receive the Word, we receive the life within it. Both the Word and the life are God Himself. The Word is the expression of God, and the life is the content of God. When we hear the Word, we realize that God is expressed and explained. When we receive the Word, we receive God&rsquo;s very content as life.</p>
<p>The life in the Word is &ldquo;the light of men.&rdquo; Whereas the light for the old creation was the physical light (Gen. 1:3-5, 14-18), the light for the new creation is the light of life, mentioned in John 1:4. Christ is the Word, the expression of God by which we may know God. When we receive Him as the expression of God, He becomes our life, and this life becomes the light that shines within us. When the Word is heard and the life is received, the life becomes the light shining within us to enlighten us. Many of us can testify that when we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, receiving Him into us, the divine life came into our being, and immediately we had the sense of something shining within. That shining was the shining of life.</p>
<p>Christ is the light of life (1:4b-13; 8:12; 9:5; 12:46) to bring the divine life to the world by shining forth God that man may be born of God to be His children, making man God in life and nature but not in His Godhead. When we receive His shining of the light of life, this shining imparts the divine life into us. That divine life becomes our authority to be God&rsquo;s children (1:12-13), God&rsquo;s kind, God&rsquo;s species, God&rsquo;s family.</p><h2 class="head5">(4) Becoming Flesh and Tabernacling among Men</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&rdquo; (v. 14a). For the Word as God to become flesh, that is, to be incarnated, is for God to have the human life and the human nature. To be incarnated is to be consolidated. As the Word before His incarnation, Christ was mysterious. However, when He was incarnated, He was consolidated and became real to us. Before His incarnation He was intangible, invisible, and untouchable. By becoming flesh He became solid, visible, and touchable.</p>
<p>The Word that became flesh &ldquo;tabernacled among us.&rdquo; The Word, by being incarnated, not only brought God into humanity but also became a tabernacle to God as God&rsquo;s habitation on earth among men.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(a) Full of Grace and Reality</h2>
<p>Verse 14b tells us that when the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, it was full of grace and reality. Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment; reality is God realized by us in the Son. Grace is the enjoyment, and reality is the realization.</p>
<p>Verse 17 says, &ldquo;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The law makes demands on man according to what God is; grace supplies man with what God is to meet what God demands. The law, at most, was only a testimony of what God is (Exo. 25:21), but reality is the realization of what God is. No man can partake of God through the law, but grace enables man to enjoy God. Reality is God realized by man, and grace is God enjoyed by man.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(b) Of His Fullness We All Receiving, and Grace upon Grace</h2>
<p>John 1:16 says, &ldquo;For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; This indicates that in Christ as the incarnated Word there is abundant fullness, for the fullness of God dwells in Him (Col. 2:9). Now we may receive the riches of grace and reality out of His divine fullness. Grace and reality have no limit. Instead, there is always fullness. Anything we enjoy other than God in Christ has a limit. But when we enjoy God in Christ as grace and reality, there is no limit, only fullness. This fullness is unlimited.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(5) As the Only Begotten Son of the Father,<br />
Having Declared Him</h2>
<p>&ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (John 1:18). The Greek word translated <em>declared</em> may also be rendered <em>explained.</em> Christ&rsquo;s being the Word is mainly to express God the Father by declaring, defining, and revealing Him. This verse tells us that the One who expresses the Father is the only begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father from eternity past and who is still in the bosom of the Father after incarnation. The only begotten Son was, is, and always will be in the bosom of the Father. The dear, only begotten Son of the Father is continually in the bosom of the Father to declare the Father. The more the Son speaks, the more the Father is declared, expressed.</p>
<p>The Father&rsquo;s only begotten Son has declared God by the Word, life, light, grace, and reality. The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized, apprehended. God is fully declared in the Son by these five things.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Lamb of God</h2>
<p>Christ is the Lamb of God, who took away the sin of the world for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s redemption. According to 1:29, John the Baptist declared concerning Christ, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; According to verse 36, John looked at Jesus walking and said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God!&rdquo; These verses indicate that Christ as the Lamb of God has taken away sin from the human race. The phrase <em>of the world</em> in verse 29 actually means from mankind. Through Satan sin entered into man, for Satan injected sin into the human race. But Christ as the Lamb of God came to take away sin from mankind. Christ died on the cross to deal with sin (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 9:26) and also with sins (1 Cor. 15:3; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:28).</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John the Lamb of God signifies the Word in the flesh as the fulfillment of all the Old Testament offerings to accomplish God&rsquo;s full redemption. This means that Christ is the totality of all the offerings. He is not only the sin offering but also the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the wave offering, the heave offering, the free-will offering, and the drink offering. With Christ as all the offerings we have God&rsquo;s full redemption, and we may experience and enjoy this redemption.</p>
<p>Through Christ as the Lamb of God fulfilling all the offerings, we may now enter into God and participate in the divine life and nature (John 3:14-15; 2 Pet. 1:4). Because of Christ as the Lamb of God, we are well able to enter into God. We may boldly come into God, knowing that He does not have the right to reject us, because we come through His Lamb. We have full redemption in Christ as the Lamb of God, and therefore we are enabled to enter into God to enjoy all that He is.</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Baptizer</h2>
<p>John 1:30-33 indicates that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Baptizer.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) In the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>In verse 33 John the Baptist said, &ldquo;He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In contrast to John the Baptist, who baptized in water, Christ is the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit. Water signifies death and burial for the termination of the repenting people; the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life and resurrection for the germination of the terminated people. The Holy Spirit, into whom Christ has baptized the believers, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9). Hence, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3), into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and even into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) With the Dove Abiding upon Him</h2>
<p>John 1:32 says, &ldquo;John testified, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.&rdquo; The dove signifies that Christ, the One who became the tabernacle and who is all the offerings, has become a life-giving Spirit to impart God into all those who accept the offerings in order to enter into God.</p>
<p>In John 1 Christ is presented as a little lamb with a little dove. The Lamb takes away sin from man, and the Dove brings God as life to man. The Lamb is for redemption, to redeem fallen man back to God, and the Dove is for life-giving, for anointing, to anoint man with what God is, to bring God into man and man into God, and for uniting the believers in God. Both the Lamb and the Dove are needed for us to participate in God.</p>
<p>John the Baptist testified that He saw the Spirit descending as a dove upon the Lamb of God and abiding upon the Lamb. A heavenly Dove was therefore upon the Lamb of God. In this way the two, the Lamb and the Dove, became one entity, which we may call the Dove-Lamb. This Dove-Lamb is the pneumatic Christ. The adjective <em>pneumatic</em>, meaning spiritual, is derived from the Greek word for spirit, <em>pneuma.</em> After His resurrection Christ became the pneumatic Christ. According to 1 Corinthians 15:45 He is the last Adam, who has become the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ. For our experience and enjoyment today, Christ is not merely the Lamb nor merely the Dove; He is the Dove-Lamb, the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) Putting Men into the Triune God</h2>
<p>As the Baptizer Christ puts men into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), bringing them into a spiritual and mystical union with the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) Germinating Them with the Divine Life</h2>
<p>As the Baptizer Christ also germinates with the divine life those who believe in Him, causing them to become children of God with the divine life and the divine nature (John 1:12-13).</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Heavenly Ladder</h2>
<p>In verses 51 and 42 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the heavenly ladder. He is the fulfillment of the ladder which Jacob saw in his dream when he was fleeing from his brother (Gen. 28:12). On that ladder the angels of God were ascending and descending.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Joining the Earth to Heaven</h2>
<p>In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus said to Nathanael, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; This reveals that Christ, as the Son of Man, with His humanity, is the ladder set up on the earth and leading to heaven, keeping heaven open to earth and joining earth to heaven. Heaven refers to God, and earth refers to man. As the ladder, Christ as the Son of Man joins God and man into one.</p>
<p>As the heavenly ladder Christ is the One who brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven. According to our concept, Christ has gone away from the earth. But according to God&rsquo;s concept, Christ has been set up on the earth, and no one can move Him. Our Christ, who is the ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven, is now not only in heaven but also on earth. Christ has been set up on earth, and He is reaching into heaven for the purpose of coming to us and joining us to Him.</p>
<p>In eternity past He was the Word, but in eternity future He will be the ladder. The ladder is not flat. It is set up on the earth to reach the heavens as a stairway. Every ladder is a stairway for going up and coming down. This traffic is the fellowship. The ladder indicates traffic, fellowship. The love of the Father, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14) are the reality of this ladder for going up and coming down. The Triune God is not flat. The Triune God is standing up to be a ladder. Without a ladder, there is no way to climb up higher. Christ as the ladder is the way in John 14:6. He is &ldquo;the ladder way.&rdquo; How can we as earthly men be one with the heavenly Father? Christ is the way as the ladder. He is the stairway for us to be one with God.</p>
<p>Christ as the heavenly ladder also needs a strong base to stand on. In Genesis 28:12 and 19 the heavenly ladder which Jacob saw took Bethel as its base. Bethel is God&rsquo;s house, God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Today in God&rsquo;s organic salvation, our regenerated spirit is God&rsquo;s dwelling place (Eph. 2:22), even the Holy of Holies of God (Heb. 4:16; 10:19), which Christ as our heavenly ladder takes as His base. Whenever we turn to our spirit, we sense Christ bringing God (heaven) to us and joining us to God (heaven). Thus, Christ as the heavenly ladder is the stairway to bring God to us and join us to God.</p>
<p>This Christ as the life-giving Spirit becomes the heavenly ladder that brings heaven to earth and joins the earth to heaven at Bethel&mdash;God&rsquo;s dwelling place in the spirit of the believers on earth. We are a part of God&rsquo;s house, Bethel, which brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven. We need to realize that as the duplication of Christ, we are the heavenly ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven (cf. S. S. 3:6). When we minister Christ to sinners, they will appreciate Christ and receive Christ. This is to bring heaven to the earth. Then when we help them to grow, we are joining them to heaven. Every day we should be persons bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven.</p>
<p>As the universal, heavenly ladder, Christ brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven, thereby making God and man one. On this ladder the angels of God ascend and descend as they do their service &ldquo;for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation&rdquo; (Heb. 1:14). Today we may experience and enjoy Christ as the ladder that joins us to heaven and brings heaven to us so that we may be a heavenly people living a heavenly life on earth and inheriting all the heavenly things.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) For Producing Stones for the House of God</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being the heavenly ladder is not only for joining the earth to heaven but also for producing stones for the house of God (John 1:42; Gen. 28:16-19). When Jacob awoke from his sleep in Genesis 28, he said, &ldquo;How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven&rdquo; (v. 17). Then he poured oil (a symbol of the Holy Spirit) upon the stone (a symbol of a transformed person) which he had used for a pillow, and he called the name of that place &ldquo;Bethel,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;house of God.&rdquo; In chapter one of John, we have the Spirit and the stone for the house of God. Verse 42 tells us that when Simon was brought to the Lord Jesus, He looked at him and said, &ldquo;You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).&rdquo; The name <em>Peter</em> means &ldquo;a stone,&rdquo; signifying a work of transformation that brings forth material for God&rsquo;s building. Thus, wherever Christ is as the heavenly ladder in His humanity, there is the gate of heaven, and there is the building of God&rsquo;s house with all the stones, that is, with all the transformed persons.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(13)</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in chapters two and three of John.</p>
<h2 class="head3">53. The Life-changer and the Temple</h2>
<p>In John 2 Christ is presented as the Life-changer and as the temple.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Life-changer</h2>
<p>In verses 1 through 11 we see that Christ is the Life-changer.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) As the One Who Is Life</h2>
<p>Christ, the Life-changer, is the One who Himself is life. This is clearly revealed by the word of the Lord Jesus in 11:25a: &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Changing the Fallen Man&rsquo;s Death<br />
into the Divine Life</h2>
<p>For Christ to be the Life-changer means that He changes the fallen man&rsquo;s death into the divine life. This is indicated by Paul&rsquo;s word in 2 Timothy 1:10b, where he tells us that our Savior Jesus Christ &ldquo;nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.&rdquo; Life here is the eternal life of God, which is given to all believers in Christ (1 Tim. 1:16) and which is the main element of the divine grace given to us (Rom. 5:17, 21). This life has conquered death (Acts 2:24) and will swallow up death (2 Cor. 5:4).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being the Life-changer is indicated in John 2:1-11 by the sign of His changing water into wine at the wedding feast in Cana of Galilee. In this portion of the Word, wine, the life-juice of the grape, signifies life. When the Lord Jesus learned that the wine had run out, He told the servants to take the six stone waterpots that were lying there and to fill them with water. The number six represents the created man, for it was on the sixth day that man was created (Gen. 1:27, 31). Thus, the six stone waterpots signify the natural man who was created on the sixth day. Furthermore, water here signifies death (cf. 1:2, 6; Exo. 14:21; Matt. 3:16). The fact that all six of the stone waterpots were full of water signifies that all humanity is naturally full of death. Just as the waterpots were filled to the brim with water, so we were filled with death. According to John 2:8-9 the Lord Jesus marvelously changed the death water into wine. This miracle shows that, as the Life-changer, the Lord Jesus can change our death into life.</p>
<p>Today we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Life-changer. The genuine Christian life is a life of having our water changed into wine, of having our death changed into life. The Christian life is not a character-changing life nor a behavior-improving life. The Christian life is altogether a matter of the Lord&rsquo;s changing our death into life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Temple</h2>
<p>John 2:19-22 reveals that Christ is the temple.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Destroyed by the Jews</h2>
<p>The body of Jesus, the temple, was destroyed and then raised up in resurrection. In verse 19a the Lord Jesus said to the Jews, &ldquo;Destroy this temple.&rdquo; As verse 21 makes clear, He was speaking of &ldquo;the temple of His body.&rdquo; When Christ became flesh, He took on a physical body. John 1:14 tells us that His physical body was a tabernacle. According to chapter two of John, His physical body was also the temple. Hence, when Jesus Christ was in the flesh, His body was the tabernacle and the temple of God, both of which are God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Realizing this, Satan did his best to destroy the Lord&rsquo;s physical body, and he did destroy it on the cross through the Jews.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Raised Up by Him in Resurrection</h2>
<p>After speaking about His body being destroyed, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;In three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (v. 19b). The words <em>in three days</em> signify in resurrection. After Satan destroyed the Lord&rsquo;s physical body on the cross, His body was put into a tomb and rested there. The Lord Jesus then went into death and came out in resurrection. When He arose, He Himself raised up His dead and buried body. After His resurrection, His body, the temple, was reared up on a much larger scale. The body that the enemy destroyed by crucifixion was merely the body of Jesus. What was raised up by the Lord Jesus in resurrection was not only His physical body but also everyone who is joined to Him by faith (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6). Since the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus has been enlarging His Body in resurrection life. What an immense Body Christ has today in His resurrection!</p>
<p>The Christian life consists of two matters: changing death into life and building up of the Body of Christ, the temple, in resurrection. We may summarize our Christian life by saying that the Christian life is the changing of death into life for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is the proper, genuine, and complete Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">54. The Bronze Serpent, the Light,<br />
the Bridegroom, and the Immeasurable Son of God</h2>
<p>Chapter three of John reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the bronze serpent, the light, the Bridegroom, and the immeasurable Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Bronze Serpent</h2>
<p>Verses 14 and 15 speak of Christ as the bronze serpent.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Having Destroyed the Old Serpent,<br />
the Devil, the Embodiment of Sin and Death</h2>
<p>In verse 14 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo; In Genesis 3 Satan, the serpent, injected his nature into man&rsquo;s flesh. When the children of Israel in the wilderness complained and were rebellious, speaking against God and against Moses, &ldquo;Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died&rdquo; (Num. 21:6). Then the people came to Moses, confessed that they had sinned, and asked him to pray that the Lord would take away the serpents. When Moses prayed for the people, God told him to lift up a bronze serpent on their behalf for God&rsquo;s judgment, that by looking upon that bronze serpent, all might live. That was a type. Here in John 3:14 the Lord Jesus applied that type to Himself, indicating that when He was in the flesh, He was in &ldquo;the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3), which likeness is equal to the form of the bronze serpent. The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent&rsquo;s poison. Christ was made in &ldquo;the likeness of the flesh of sin,&rdquo; but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). When He was lifted up in the flesh on the cross, by His death Satan, the old serpent, the devil, the embodiment of sin and death, was destroyed (John 12:31-33; Rev. 12:9a; Heb. 2:14).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) That the Believers May Have<br />
the Eternal Life of God</h2>
<p>As the bronze serpent, Christ destroyed the devil that the believers may have the eternal life of God. Concerning this, John 3:15 goes on to say, &ldquo;That every one who believes into Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; This is the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which not only is everlasting with respect to time but also is eternal and divine in nature.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) For Their Regeneration</h2>
<p>The eternal life received by the believers is for their regeneration (vv. 3, 5-8). Regeneration is accomplished in the human spirit by the Holy Spirit of God with God&rsquo;s life, the uncreated, eternal life. Thus, to be regenerated is to have the divine life, the eternal life (in addition to the human, natural life) as the new source and new element of a new person.</p>
<p>Through regeneration the believers have the eternal life of God in addition to their natural life, that they may live by this life while denying their natural life (vv. 15-16; Matt. 16:24). It does not matter whether a person is gentle or rough, or whether his natural disposition is quick or slow; his salvation does not depend on improvement or refinement. According to the truth in the Bible concerning the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers, it is altogether wrong for the believers to improve their behavior. To increase gentleness is wrong; to improve roughness is also wrong. This is because the natural life, whether gentle or rough, must be completely denied. The regeneration revealed in the Bible is not a religion, nor is it a set of moral teachings for improving oneself. Regeneration is to have God as life in addition to our original human life. Hence, we should not live by our original life, our first life; rather, we must deny our first life, the natural life, and live by our second life, the eternal life.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Light</h2>
<p>John 3:19 through 21 speaks of Christ as the light.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Having Come into the World</h2>
<p>Referring to Christ, verse 19a says that &ldquo;the light has come into the world.&rdquo; According to 1:9 this was &ldquo;the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.&rdquo; Christ came into the world as light so that men might be enlightened for salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Hated by the Doers of Evil</h2>
<p>In order to save us, Christ, the Son of God, came as light to enlighten every man. But, unfortunately, &ldquo;men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil. For every one who practices evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works be reproved&rdquo; (3:19b-20).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) Received by the Doers of the Truth</h2>
<p>Verse 21 goes on to say, &ldquo;But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they are wrought in God.&rdquo; According to the context, <em>truth</em> here denotes uprightness (as opposed to evil), which is the reality manifested in a man who lives in God according to what He is, and which corresponds with the divine light, which is God, as the source of the truth, manifested in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) To Be Their Life</h2>
<p>For those who receive Christ as light, the light becomes their life (vv. 16, 36). This life is the eternal life, the divine life, the uncreated life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Bridegroom</h2>
<p>The word of John the Baptist in verse 29 indicates that Christ is the Bridegroom: &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&rdquo; The bridegroom is a most pleasant person, who comes for the bride. The believers in Christ as a corporate bride are prepared for Christ as the Bridegroom. To us He should be the attraction, the pleasure, and the satisfaction. All the believers should experience and enjoy Him as the pleasant Bridegroom.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) To Have the Regenerated Ones as His Bride</h2>
<p>As the Bridegroom Christ has the regenerated ones as His bride. Whereas verse 29 speaks of the bride, verse 30 speaks of the increase. The increase in verse 30 is the bride in verse 29, and the bride is a living composition of all the regenerated people. This indicates that in John 3, a chapter on regeneration, regeneration not only brings the divine life into the believers but also makes them the corporate bride for Christ&rsquo;s increase. Regeneration, therefore, is for the increase of Christ; it is for the producing of the bride. Regeneration is for us to be a part of the bride of Christ.</p>
<p>The bride as the increase of Christ is related to the spiritual part of our being (v. 6b). Our regenerated human spirit is part of the increase of Christ, and this increase is Christ&rsquo;s multiplication and reproduction. Through regeneration we have become part of Christ&rsquo;s increase.</p>
<p>The bride of Christ is the increase of Christ. All of the reborn people are the increase of Christ, and this increase is the bride, which becomes the counterpart of Christ. The bride of Christ is the church, the composition of all the regenerated people. All those who are regenerated are composed together as the corporate bride to match Christ. Without regeneration, Christ cannot have His bride as His increase. Hence, Christ increases by regenerating the redeemed sinners, making them His bride, His wife.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve are a type of Christ with His increase. Adam was a bachelor, a single man, but one day the Lord opened His side, took out a rib, and built that rib into Eve as a wife to match Adam (Gen. 2:20b-24). Eve was Adam&rsquo;s increase, and through his wife Adam has billions of descendants, who are also his increase. Adam is still increasing today because the earth&rsquo;s population is continually increasing. All the upcoming new babes are parts of Adam&rsquo;s increase. Adam is a type of Christ (Rom. 5:14), and Eve is a type of the church as the bride of Christ (2 Cor. 11:2-3; Eph. 5:31-32). Not only the wife but also all the children are the increase of the husband. The increase of Christ today on this earth is immeasurable. Christ is still increasing.</p>
<p>In order for Christ to increase, we need to contact people individually to get them regenerated. Then gradually and steadily with the proper care, we as their parents should feed, nourish, and cherish them day by day through the small groups. For Christ to increase continually, each of us must be in a small group to produce new spiritual children.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) The Bridegroom Increasing<br />
but His Friend, John, Decreasing</h2>
<p>In John 3:30 John the Baptist said, &ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease.&rdquo; The increase and the decrease depend on who has the following. For Christ to increase and for John the Baptist to decrease means that John had to withdraw from the scene and from having a following; he had to allow Christ to be the only figure on the scene and to have all the following. All the following should go to Christ; none of it should go to John the Baptist or to anyone else. We all must decrease and let Christ increase. The entire following must go to Him.</p>
<p>We should all desire to see Christ increasing and ourselves decreasing. For this we need to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. The real significance of speaking the word of God is to spread God. When we speak the holy Word, the truth, the divine revelation, we spread God. Christ speaks God through us, His members, by defining God, explaining God, and eventually expressing God. To express God is to spread God. Christ is One who speaks the words of God and who gives the Spirit not by measure (v. 34). When someone receives His words, the Spirit follows to be the reality of what is spoken. Christ increases Himself by speaking God&rsquo;s word to spread God and by giving the Spirit of God to be the reality of what He has spoken in order to dispense the eternal life into people, making them Godkind, the children of God, the species of God, the family of God, to be Christ&rsquo;s increase. This is how Christ becomes the increasing Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Immeasurable Son of God</h2>
<p>Verses 31 through 36 present Christ as the immeasurable Son of God. These verses reveal an unlimited Christ. He is all-inclusive and immeasurable; He is higher than the heavens and broader than the universe. The Christ whom we may experience and enjoy is unlimited and immeasurable.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Coming from Above and Being above All</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is of the earth and speaks out of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all&rdquo; (v. 31). Christ is from above, from heaven; His source is heaven. Because His source is from above, He is above all things, all matters, and especially all people.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) The Father Loving Him<br />
and Having Given All into His Hand</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand&rdquo; (v. 35). The Son is the object of the Father&rsquo;s love. In love, the Father has made the Son to be above all and to be all in all. The Son&rsquo;s all-inclusiveness is a matter of the Father&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>The clause <em>the Father loves the Son</em> implies that apart from Christ, or besides Christ, nothing is pleasing to God. The Father loves only one person, and that person is Christ. God&rsquo;s love for the world (v. 16) is related to Christ. Apart from Christ, God does not love anyone or anything. Although God loves the world, if we did not have Christ, we would miss God&rsquo;s love. Only in Christ can we enjoy the love of God the Father. If we are outside of Christ, we have nothing to do with the Father&rsquo;s love. We can meet the love of the Father only in Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 35 says not only that the Father loves the Son but also that the Father has given all things into the Son&rsquo;s hand. The Father has given all things, including us, to Christ. The entire universe has been given to Christ, whom God the Father loves. He is the unique recipient of the Father&rsquo;s love and gifts. This implies that if we are not in Christ, we cannot receive any gifts from the Father. If we would enjoy God&rsquo;s love, we need to be in Christ. Likewise, if we would participate in what God gives, we also need to be in Christ, the unique object of the Father&rsquo;s love and the unique recipient of the Father&rsquo;s gifts.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) Being Sent by God and Speaking the Words of God<br />
to Impart the Riches of God to His Believers</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He whom God has sent speaks the words of God&rdquo; (v. 34a). The One who is from above, who is above all, who is loved by the Father, and to whom all things have been given by the Father has also been sent by God. Christ is God&rsquo;s Ambassador, God&rsquo;s Apostle; He was sent by God and from God.</p>
<p>As the One sent by God, Christ speaks the words of God to impart the riches of God into His believers. In verse 34 the Greek word translated <em>words</em> is <em>rhema,</em> which means the instant and present spoken word. Christ ministers the living word to nourish all His believers. Christ does not speak His own words or someone else&rsquo;s words&mdash;He speaks only the words of God. These words are spirit and life (6:63) as the essence of God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) Giving the Spirit of God Not by Measure</h2>
<p>John 3:34b says, &ldquo;He gives the Spirit not by measure.&rdquo; Christ the Son gives the Spirit without measure to God&rsquo;s people. The unique way for us to become the increase of the unlimited Christ is to receive the Spirit and be filled with the Spirit. The more we have of the Spirit, the more we will be Christ&rsquo;s increase. This increase begins with our regeneration, and it consummates with our being filled with the immeasurable Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(5) The One Believing into Him and Being Regenerated<br />
Receiving and Enjoying Him as the Eternal Life</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life&rdquo; (v. 36a). Everyone who believes in Christ the Son and is regenerated receives and enjoys Him as the eternal life (v. 15; 1 John 5:11-12).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(14)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">55. The Gift of God, the Messiah,<br />
and the Savior of the World</h2>
<p>According to John 4 we may experience and enjoy Christ as the gift of God, the Messiah, and the Savior of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Gift of God</h2>
<p>In verse 10 the Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, &ldquo;If you knew the gift of God...you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.&rdquo; In verse 14 He spoke to her again about the water that He gives. From these verses we see that Christ is the gift of God. Our thirst can be quenched only by the living person of Christ, the Son of God, who has been given to us by God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Given by God</h2>
<p>Christ has been given to us by God. John 3:16a says that God so loved the world, that is, sinful, fallen people, that He gave His only begotten Son, His expression, that they might obtain His eternal life to become His many sons and be His corporate expression for the fulfillment of His eternal New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s giving us His Son was not done in a simple way but in His Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Imparting the Living Water</h2>
<p>Christ, the gift of God, imparts the living water&mdash;the water of life (Rev. 21:6; 22:1). The water of life signifies God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(a) A Fountain of Water</h2>
<p>In John 4:14 the Lord Jesus said that the water that He gives us becomes in us a fountain of water gushing up into eternal life. This verse indicates that the Triune God flows in the Divine Trinity in three stages: the Father as the fountain, Christ the Son as the spring, and the Spirit as the river. We need to see that the Triune God is flowing through the Father, Christ the Son, and the Spirit into us. Whenever we drink of this water, it becomes a fountain in us. We all should say, &ldquo;The fountain is in me!&rdquo; This fountain emerges as a spring, and the spring flows out as a river for the New Jerusalem. As the spring of living water, Christ quenches our thirst, satisfies us, makes us happy, and becomes our pleasure.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(b) Gushing Up into Eternal Life</h2>
<p>According to John 4:14, the flowing Triune God is &ldquo;into eternal life.&rdquo; The Greek preposition translated as <em>into</em> is rich in meaning. <em>Into</em> here means issuing in, or to be, to become; thus, it speaks of destination. The eternal life is the destination of the flowing Triune God. A fountain is in us springing up as a river into a destination. This destination is the eternal life as the totality of the divine life. Just as our human life has its totality and a living person is the totality of the human life, so also the eternal life has its totality and the totality of the divine life is the New Jerusalem. The eternal life eventually will be the New Jerusalem. Thus, <em>into eternal life</em> means <em>into the New Jerusalem.</em></p>
<p>We must have something flowing into the divine New Jerusalem in order for us to arrive there. When God in Christ as the Spirit flows into us, He flows with us. He will flow us into the New Jerusalem to be the New Jerusalem. Thus, the New Jerusalem is the issue of God&rsquo;s flowing in three stages. All three stages are in us; we have the fountain, the spring, and the river within us at the same time. The Father is the fountain as the source, Christ the Son is the spring, and the Spirit is the flowing river, and this flowing issues in the eternal life, which is the New Jerusalem as the destination of the flowing Triune God.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Messiah</h2>
<p>In John 4 Christ is also presented as the Messiah. The Samaritan woman said to the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when He comes, He will declare all things to us&rdquo; (v. 25). Jesus responded by saying, &ldquo;I, who speak to you, am He&rdquo; (v. 26).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Coming to Bring the Divine Life to Men</h2>
<p>As the Messiah, Christ came to bring the divine life&mdash;the living water&mdash;to men (vv. 10, 14). In verse 29 the woman said to the people of the city, &ldquo;Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ?&rdquo; This indicates that she believed that Jesus was the Christ, the Messiah. By thus believing, she received the living water and was satisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) That Men May Worship God in Spirit</h2>
<p>The Messiah brought living water to men that they might worship God in spirit. In verse 20 the Samaritan woman spoke to the Lord Jesus concerning the place of worship: &ldquo;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship.&rdquo; To this the Lord Jesus replied, &ldquo;An hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). In verse 24 <em>God</em> is the complete Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;and <em>Spirit</em> refers to the nature of the complete Triune God, not merely to the Lord Spirit. To worship God, who is Spirit, we must worship with our spirit, which is of the same nature as He is. The Lord&rsquo;s word in verses 21 through 24 was given to instruct the Samaritan woman regarding her need to exercise her spirit to contact God the Spirit. To contact God the Spirit with the spirit is to drink of the living water, and to drink of the living water is to render real worship to God.</p>
<p>May the Lord impress us with what proper worship is. Proper worship is to continually drink the living water. God the Spirit is the living water, and our organ for drinking the living water is our human spirit. Whenever we exercise our spirit to contact God, the living Spirit, we drink of Him as the living water in His Son, Jesus Christ. This is the real and proper worship of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Savior of the World</h2>
<p>Verse 42 speaks of Christ as the Savior of the world. The Lord Jesus is the Savior of fallen mankind based upon His person and His redemptive work. He is the very God who became a man to be our Savior, and He has accomplished full redemption for us the sinners, through which He saves us from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from our fallen condition. What He is and what He has accomplished make Him competent to be the Savior able to save us to the uttermost. In particular, He is the Savior to save men from sin (vv. 16-18) through life as their salvation (v. 22). In salvation He is not only our Savior objectively; He is also our life subjectively.</p>
<h2 class="head3">56. The One Equal with God, the One Who Gives Life<br />
and Has the Authority of Judgment,<br />
and the One Testified by the Scriptures</h2>
<p>Chapter five of the Gospel of John reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the One equal with God, the One who gives life and has the authority of judgment, and the One testified by the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The One Equal with God</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Father Working</h2>
<p>In verses 1 through 9 the Lord Jesus enlivened an impotent man on the Sabbath. Because He worked to enliven an impotent man on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted Him and sought to kill Him. &ldquo;But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I also am working&rdquo; (v. 17). In their religious concept, they were resting in keeping the Sabbath, but they did not know that there was no rest for the Father and the Son as long as poor sinners were not saved. While the religious Jews were resting in keeping their Sabbath, the Father and the Son were still working that sinners might receive life and have rest. This not only offended the religious Jews but also caused them to consider that Jesus was blaspheming, because, according to their concept, He &ldquo;not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God&rdquo; (v. 18). In their consideration that was blasphemy to God, yet the One whom they accused of blasphemy had enlivened the impotent man. Christ&rsquo;s enlivening of that man testifies that He is equal with God the Father in giving life to people. Actually, the Son and the Father are one (10:30).</p><h2 class="head5">(2) The Son Working with the Father</h2>
<p>In 5:17 the Lord Jesus declared that the Father was working and that He also was working. In verse 19 He went on to say, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.&rdquo; Here we see that the Son was working with the Father. Although God&rsquo;s work in creation was finished (Gen. 2:1-3), the Father and the Son were still working for redemption and building. The religious Jews kept the Sabbath. However, they did not know that because of man&rsquo;s fall the rest of that Sabbath was broken. Neither did they know that the Father and the Son were still working for fallen man&rsquo;s redemption in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s original purpose, which is the building of God&rsquo;s eternal habitation. What God did was the old creation. What the Father and the Son are doing is the new creation through redemption for God&rsquo;s building. This work includes the Son&rsquo;s life-giving, which was manifested in the case of the impotent man. In this matter the Father and the Son are one. Whatever the Father wants to do in the matter of life-giving, the Son does it accordingly, working with the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The One Who Gives Life<br />
and Has the Authority of Judgment</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Giving Life to His Chosen Ones</h2>
<p>The Son gives life to God&rsquo;s chosen ones. In John 5:21 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills.&rdquo; According to this verse the Son gives life to the dead. In verse 24 we see that whoever hears the word of the Son and believes in Him who sent Him has eternal life and has passed out of death into life. In verse 25 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.&rdquo; The &ldquo;dead&rdquo; here are not those who are buried in their graves but the living dead ones; they are not those who are dead physically but those who, in accordance with Ephesians 2:1, 5 and Colossians 2:13, are dead in their spirit. In the eyes of the Lord, all the people living on earth are dead in their spirit. The words <em>an hour is coming, and it is now</em> refer to the very time the Lord Jesus spoke these words. Many at that time heard His living words and consequently were made alive in their spirit. <em>Will live,</em> therefore, means to be made alive in the spirit.</p>
<p>For nearly twenty centuries, from the time that the Lord Jesus spoke these words until the present, thousands and thousands of people have heard the living voice of the Son of God and have been enlivened with life. We also have heard the living word of the Lord and have been made alive. Like those in John 5:2 and 3, we were the impotent ones, for we were blind, lame, and withered. In short, we were dead. Then the Lord Jesus came to visit us, and we heard the living word of the gospel that enlivened us and made us alive. We have truly passed out of death and have entered into life. Since the source of death is the tree of knowledge and the source of life is the tree of life (Gen. 2:9, 17), for us to have passed out of death into life means that we have changed the source of our living.</p>
<p>For our spirit to be made alive actually signifies the resurrection in our spirit. This is also regeneration in our spirit. The regeneration in our spirit is a resurrection caused by the Lord Jesus with the divine life, which is Himself.</p>
<p>In John 5:26 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have life in Himself.&rdquo; This reveals that in the matter of life the Son is the same as the Father. Both the Father and the Son have life in themselves. Thus, the Son can and does enliven people with life as the Father desires. In life&rsquo;s enlivening the Son truly is one with the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Receiving the Authority of Judgment from the Father</h2>
<p>Concerning His receiving the authority of judgment from the Father, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son&rdquo; (v. 22). In verse 27 He continued, &ldquo;He gave Him authority to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man.&rdquo; As the Son of God the Lord can give life, and as the Son of Man He can execute judgment. Referring to Jesus, Acts 17:31 says that God will judge the world by that man whom He has designated. Romans 2:16 tells us that God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus, and 2 Timothy 4:1 says that Jesus Christ will judge the living and the dead. The Son will judge justly according to the Father&rsquo;s will (John 5:30). He is one with the Father in the matter of life&rsquo;s enlivening, and He is also one with Him in the matter of judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) To Be Honored</h2>
<p>The Son is to be honored even as the Father is honored. All judgment has been given to the Son in order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. &ldquo;He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him&rdquo; (v. 23b).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The One Testified by the Scriptures</h2>
<p>Christ is the One testified by the Scriptures (vv. 39-40, 46-47). We may come to Him to receive life by believing the Scriptures.</p>
<p>Verses 39 and 40 say, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.&rdquo; The Jewish religionists searched the Scriptures, but they were not willing to come to the Lord Jesus. Searching the Scriptures and coming to the Lord Jesus should be kept together. Since the Scriptures testify concerning the Lord Jesus, they should not be separated from Him.</p>
<p>We may contact the Scriptures and yet not contact the Lord. Only the Lord can give life. We should never separate the Scriptures from the Lord Himself. Whenever we search the Word, we must come to the Lord Himself. This means that we should make searching the Word and touching the Lord one thing. Whenever we study the Bible, we need to open our spirit to the Lord. While we are reading the words of the Scriptures with our eyes and understanding them with our mind, we must exercise our spirit to contact the Lord through the Scriptures. Then we will have not only the understanding of the letters in our mind but also the life in our spirit.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(15)</h1>
<p>John 6 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Passover Lamb and the bread of life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">57. The Passover Lamb and the Bread of Life</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Passover Lamb</h2>
<p>Christ is presented as the Passover Lamb in 6:4 and 51 through 56. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.&rdquo; This indicates that the Passover was the background for what is recorded in this chapter. In the Passover people slay the redeeming Lamb, sprinkle its blood, and eat its flesh. This typifies Christ as our Passover (1 Cor. 5:7). He is the redeeming Lamb of God (John 1:29, 36) slain for us that we may eat His flesh and drink His blood, taking Him in as our life supply that we may live by Him.</p>
<p>At the time of the Passover, people also eat unleavened bread. Here we have three basic elements of the Passover feast: first, the slaying of the lamb and the striking of its blood; second, the eating of the flesh of the lamb; third, the eating of unleavened bread. Therefore, we have the blood of the lamb, the flesh of the lamb, and unleavened bread. These three matters are found in the Lord&rsquo;s discourse in John 6.</p>
<p>In the Passover the main enjoyments are the Passover lamb with its blood for redeeming and its flesh for fighting and walking, and the unleavened bread, signifying a sinless living (Exo. 12:5-8). The flesh of the lamb is organic, and the blood is judicial. The blood redeems us judicially, and the flesh of the lamb is for God&rsquo;s elect to eat so that they can be organically nourished and strengthened to walk out of Egypt. Christ today is the Lamb with His blood for redemption and with Himself for strengthening and nourishing us so that we can walk on God&rsquo;s way out of Egypt. At the same time, we also eat Christ as the unleavened bread, signifying that we are living a sinless life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Shedding His Blood for Our Redemption<br />
That God May Pass over Us</h2>
<p>As the Passover Lamb, Christ shed His blood for our redemption that God may pass over us (Exo. 12:12-13). In John 6:53 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves.&rdquo; Here the Lord spoke of His blood, which is necessary for redemption (19:34; Heb. 9:22; Matt. 26:28; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; Rom. 3:25).</p>
<p>At the time of the Passover, the blood of the lamb was applied to the doorpost. Yet, in John 6:53 the Lord Jesus spoke about drinking His blood. To drink means to receive. Hence, to drink the blood is to receive it. The proper way to receive something into our stomach is by eating and drinking. The significance of eating and drinking is to receive something into our being. To eat the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and to drink His blood, therefore, is to receive the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and blood into our being. To eat is to take food into us to be assimilated into our body organically. To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. The principle is the same with drinking.</p>
<p>In verses 54 and 55 the Lord Jesus continued, saying, &ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.&rdquo; Here flesh and blood are mentioned separately. The separation of blood and flesh indicates death. Here the Lord Jesus clearly indicated His death, that is, His being slain. He gave His body and shed His blood for us that we may have eternal life. To eat His flesh is to receive by faith all that He did in giving His body for us. To drink His blood is to receive by faith all that He accomplished in shedding His blood for us. To eat His flesh and drink His blood is to receive Him, in His redemption, as life and the life supply by believing in what He did for us on the cross. By comparing verses 54 and 47 we see that to eat the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drink His blood is to believe in Him, because to believe into is to receive (1:12).</p>
<p>In John 6:56 the Lord Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him.&rdquo; The words <em>I in him</em> indicate that the Lord Jesus had to be resurrected so that He could abide in us as our life and life supply.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Imparting His Life into Us for Our Nourishment</h2>
<p>As the Passover Lamb Christ not only shed His blood for our redemption; He also imparts His life into us for our nourishment. Concerning this, in verse 51 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world.&rdquo; At this point the bread (mentioned earlier in the chapter) becomes the flesh. Bread is of the vegetable life and is only for feeding; flesh is of the animal life and is not only for feeding but also for redeeming. Before the fall of man, the Lord was the tree of life (Gen. 2:9), which is only for feeding man. After man fell into sin, the Lord became the Lamb (John 1:29), which is not only for feeding man but also for redeeming him (Exo. 12:4, 7-8).</p>
<p>In John 6:51b the Lord Jesus tells us that His flesh would be given &ldquo;for the life of the world.&rdquo; The Lord gave His body, that is, His flesh, dying for us that we might have life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Bread of Life</h2>
<p>Many verses in John 6 reveal that, for our experience and enjoyment, Christ is the bread of life (vv. 27, 32-35, 47-58, 63a, 68b). As the bread of life, He is the bread with eternal life. Spiritually speaking, everyone is hungry and in need of Christ as the bread of life.</p>
<p>This chapter clearly indicates that we need food. Our unique need according to this chapter is Christ as our food, Christ as the bread of life. We all are hungry and need food. Even though you may have been a Christian for many years, you still need Christ as your food every day. Christ is not only your life; He, as the bread of life, is also your life supply, your daily food.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Food Abiding to Eternal Life</h2>
<p>In verse 27 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for Him has the Father, even God, sealed.&rdquo; As elsewhere in the Gospel of John, eternal life is the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which is not only everlasting with respect to time but also is eternal and divine in nature.</p>
<p>The food which abides to eternal life is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. He came from the heavens not only to be our Savior&mdash;He came also to be our food. This means that He came to be the tree of life. What we need today is Christ as the eternal food, as the tree of life. We do not yet realize to the fullest extent how much we need Christ to be our daily food.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) The True Bread out of Heaven</h2>
<p>In verse 32 the Lord Jesus referred to Himself as the true bread: &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.&rdquo; As the true bread Christ is the bread of truth, or reality. Christ is true, real. He is the true food, and all other kinds of food are mere shadows of Him as the real food. The physical food we take in every day is a shadow of Christ. The reality of the food we eat daily is Jesus Christ. Christ is the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life. We all need Christ to be the bread of life, the true bread, to us. We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we need Christ as the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life. Therefore, through the Word we need to feed on Christ as the living bread.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) The Bread of God Giving Life to the World</h2>
<p>In verse 33 we see that Christ is the bread of God who, through incarnation, came down out of heaven and gives life to the world. As the bread of God He is God, He was sent by God, and He was with God. Although Christ is the very God, He became flesh in order to be the bread of life for us to eat.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) The Living Bread</h2>
<p>In verse 35 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life,&rdquo; and in verse 51 He said, &ldquo;I am the living bread.&rdquo; <em>Bread of life</em> refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; <em>living bread</em> refers to the condition of the bread, which is living.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(5) Everyone Who Believes in Him Receiving Eternal Life</h2>
<p>In verse 47 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes has eternal life.&rdquo; From this we see that everyone who believes in Him receives eternal life.</p>
<p>According to the word of the Lord Jesus in verse 29, the work of God is that we &ldquo;believe into Him whom He has sent.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s concept concerning God is that man should believe into Him, that is, receive Him as life and the life supply. This is the principle of the tree of life, which brings in life, as seen in Genesis 2. It is in contrast to the principle of the tree of knowledge, which brings in death.</p><h2 class="head6">(a) Through His Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>In John 6 there are six sections related to Christ as the bread of life (vv. 32-71). In the first section we have Christ&rsquo;s incarnation (vv. 32-51a); in the second, Christ&rsquo;s death (vv. 51b-55); in the third, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (vv. 56-59); in the fourth, Christ&rsquo;s ascension (vv. 60-62); in the fifth, Christ&rsquo;s becoming the life-giving Spirit (vv. 63-65); and in the sixth, Christ&rsquo;s being embodied and realized in the word of life (vv. 66-71).</p>
<p>We receive eternal life through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection (vv. 51b, 53-57). Verse 51b says, &ldquo;The bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world.&rdquo; As we have pointed out, this refers to the Lord&rsquo;s dying for us. He was slain, crucified, that we might have eternal life. In order to make Himself available to us to partake of as our food, the Lord Jesus had to die. The Lord Jesus was slain on the cross so that we could eat Him.</p>
<p>Resurrection is the next step by which the Lord Jesus made Himself available to us as the bread of life. Although He was slain, He is still living. He is the living One in resurrection. In verse 56 the Lord Jesus speaks of abiding in the one who eats His flesh and drinks His blood. Here Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is implied. This verse indicates that He had to be resurrected that He might abide in us as our life and life supply. The Lord Jesus could not have an abode in us before His resurrection. He could abide in us only after His resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(b) To Abide in Him</h2>
<p>Because Christ has been resurrected, not only does He abide in us, but we may abide in Him. He who eats His flesh and drinks His blood abides in Him (v. 56).</p>
<h2 class="head6">(c) To Live because of Him</h2>
<p>Having received Christ as eternal life by believing in Him, we now live because of Him. Regarding this, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (v. 57). To eat the Lord is to receive Him into us as food to be assimilated by us organically. Then we live by Him whom we receive. It is by this that Christ lives in us as the resurrected One (14:19-20).</p>
<p>In 6:53-57 the Lord Jesus, the Almighty God and the Creator of the universe, exhorts us to eat Him. Apart from the divine revelation in the Word, we would never have such a thought. If this word had not been spoken by the Lord Jesus, we surely would not have the boldness to say that we must eat the Lord. But both physically and spiritually we live by eating. Just as we need to eat three meals a day in order to live, so we need to eat the Lord so that we can live by the Lord.</p>
<p>The most important point in the entire chapter of John 6 is that Christ is our food, the bread of life. To eat Him is not a once-for-all matter. Rather, we daily need to contact the Lord and eat Him. Because He is the bread of life, He is edible. Now we must exercise our spirit to feed on Him, receiving Him, digesting Him, experiencing Him, enjoying Him, and applying Him moment by moment. We all need to concentrate on this one thing&mdash;eating Christ and then living by what we have eaten of Him. This is the divine way of life for our daily living.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(d) To Live Forever</h2>
<p>In verse 58 the Lord Jesus declared that the one who eats the bread which came down out of heaven shall live forever.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(6) By Him Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life&rdquo; (v. 63a). At this point the Spirit who gives life is brought in. After resurrection and through resurrection, the Lord Jesus, who had become flesh (1:14), became the Spirit who gives life, as is clearly mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45. It is as the life-giving Spirit that Christ can be life and the life supply to us. When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life into us. We receive the Lord Jesus, but we get the Spirit who gives life. It is as the Spirit that Christ is the redeeming and generating life to us. Today we do not need to contact the Lord physically. Since He is the Spirit, we can contact Him as the Spirit within us. Because He is the life-giving Spirit, we can feed upon Him and assimilate Him as our food.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(7) By Him Being Embodied in the Word</h2>
<p>Christ as the bread of life is embodied in the word of life. He is the Spirit embodied in the Word. In addition to the Spirit, who is wonderful, we need something solid, visible, tangible, and touchable&mdash;the word of life. Concerning this, the Lord Jesus says that the words which He has spoken to us are &ldquo;spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63b).</p>
<p>The Greek word for <em>words</em> in verse 63 and also in verse 68 is <em>rhema,</em> which denotes the instant and present spoken word. It differs from <em>logos</em> (translated <em>Word</em> in 1:1), which denotes the constant word. In 6:63 &ldquo;the words&rdquo; follow &ldquo;the Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit is living and real, yet He is very mysterious, intangible, and difficult for people to apprehend; the words, however, are substantial. First, the Lord Jesus indicated that for giving life He would become the Spirit. Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life. This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the Spirit of life. He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we get the Spirit, who is life.</p>
<p>At the end of John 6, in verse 68, Simon Peter said to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.&rdquo; This chapter closes with the word of life, which is the means for us to receive the Lord as the bread of life. If we receive the Word, we will have the Spirit; and if we have the Spirit within, we will have Christ as the inner supply of life. May we all realize that our need is Christ as our life supply and then daily contact Him as the life-giving Spirit embodied in the Word.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(16)</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in chapters seven and eight of the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head3">58. The Feast of Tabernacles and the Spirit</h2>
<p>In John 7 we have Christ as the Feast of Tabernacles and as the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Feast of Tabernacles</h2>
<p>Verse 2 says, &ldquo;Now the Jews&rsquo; Feast of Tabernacles was near.&rdquo; The Feast of the Passover is the first of the Jewish annual feasts, and the Feast of Tabernacles is the last (Lev. 23:5, 34). The Feast of the Passover, being the first feast of the year, implies the beginning of man&rsquo;s life (cf. Exo. 12:2-3, 6), which involves man&rsquo;s seeking for satisfaction and results in man&rsquo;s hunger. The Feast of Tabernacles, being the last feast of the year, implies the completion and success of man&rsquo;s life (cf. 23:16), which will end and will result in man&rsquo;s thirst. In the scene of the Feast of the Passover in John 6, the Lord Jesus presented Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man&rsquo;s hunger. In the scene of the Feast of Tabernacles in John 7, the Lord Jesus promised that He would flow forth the living water, which quenches man&rsquo;s thirst.</p>
<p>God ordained the Feast of Tabernacles so that the children of Israel would remember how their fathers, while wandering in the wilderness, had lived in tents (Lev. 23:39-43), expecting to enter into the rest of the good land. Hence, this feast is a reminder that today people are still in the wilderness and need to enter into the rest of the New Jerusalem, which is the eternal tabernacle (Rev. 21:2-3). Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob also lived in tents and looked forward to this eternal tabernacle (Heb. 11:9-10), in which there will be a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to quench man&rsquo;s thirst (Rev. 22:1, 17). At the end of such a feast, which had such a background, Christ cried out the promise of the rivers of living water, which will satisfy man&rsquo;s expectation for eternity (John 7:37-39).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Reaping of the Harvest<br />
of the Good Land Given by God</h2>
<p>After the full harvest of their crops, the Jewish people observed the Feast of Tabernacles to worship God and enjoy what they had reaped (Deut. 16:13-15). The Feast of Tabernacles, therefore, was held at the time of the reaping of the harvest of the good land given by God. For us today, the reality of this good land is the Spirit (Gal. 3:14; Phil. 1:19). The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ. Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the land promised to Abraham. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God&rsquo;s bountiful supply for us to enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) For God&rsquo;s People to Enjoy and Be Satisfied before God</h2>
<p>The Feast of Tabernacles was a feast for God&rsquo;s people to enjoy and be satisfied before God (Lev. 23:40b; Rom. 14:17b). As the last feast of all the feasts ordained by God for His people (Lev. 23:34, 39-43), the Feast of Tabernacles is for their enjoyment of the rich produce of the good land at its harvest time for their satisfaction. Christ as the reality of the Feast of Tabernacles is such a feast for our experience and enjoyment today.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Spirit</h2>
<p>John 7:37-39 speaks of the Spirit.</p>
 <h2 class="head5">(1) Jesus Becoming the Spirit through His Glorification</h2>
<p>Jesus became the Spirit through His glorification. Regarding this, verse 39b says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s word indicates an expectation&mdash;expectation that although the Spirit was &ldquo;not yet,&rdquo; the time was coming when the Spirit would be there. The Spirit of God was there from the beginning (Gen. 1:1-2), but at the time the Lord Jesus cried out at the feast, the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified. Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected (Luke 24:26). After Jesus&rsquo; resurrection the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ, who was breathed into the disciples by Christ in the evening of the day on which He was resurrected (John 20:22). The Spirit is now the &ldquo;another Comforter,&rdquo; the Spirit of reality promised by Christ before His death (14:16-17). When the Spirit was the Spirit of God, He had only the divine element. After He became the Spirit of Jesus Christ through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Spirit had both the divine element and the human element, with all the essence and reality of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ. Hence, through resurrection the Spirit who was &ldquo;not yet&rdquo; became the Spirit who now is; such a Spirit is now the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ as the living water for us to receive.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Receiving Christ as the Spirit</h2>
<p>Everyone who thirsts and comes to Christ and believes in (drinks) Him receives Him as the Spirit for his satisfaction, and out of his inner being shall flow rivers of living water. John 7:37 says, &ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.&rdquo; The last day here signifies that all the enjoyment of any success in human life will end. There is a &ldquo;last day&rdquo; to every kind of material thing of the physical life. If anyone thirsts and comes to the Lord Jesus and drinks, believing into Him, &ldquo;out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (v. 38). The Lord Jesus does not speak of just one flow but of rivers. The unique river of living water is the Spirit. Out of this unique river, many rivers will flow out. These &ldquo;rivers of living water&rdquo; are the many flows of the different aspects of life (cf. Rom. 15:30; 1 Thes. 1:6; 2 Thes. 2:13; Gal. 5:22-23) of the one unique &ldquo;river of water of life&rdquo; (Rev. 22:1), which is God&rsquo;s &ldquo;Spirit of life&rdquo; (Rom. 8:2). One river is the river of peace, and other rivers are joy, comfort, righteousness, life, holiness, love, patience, and humility. We do not know how many rivers there are. These rivers of living water flow out from the depths of our being. This is the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">59. The Light of the World,<br />
the I Am, and the Freeing Son</h2>
<p>In John 8 Christ is presented as the light of the world, the I Am, and the freeing Son.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Light of the World</h2>
<p>In verse 12 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo; The light of life (1:4) shines within us by the inner sense of life to deliver us from sin. When we received the Lord Jesus, He came into us as our life. This indwelling life now shines within us as light. This is the light of life. Spontaneously this shining of the indwelling light sets us free from sin. Then we do not walk in darkness but have the light of life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The I Am</h2>
<p>In chapter eight Christ is further unveiled as the I Am (vv. 24, 28, 58, 51-52).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Jehovah, the Eternal and Everlasting One</h2>
<p>As the I Am, Christ is Jehovah, the eternal and everlasting One, who was, is, and will be the Triune God (Exo. 3:14-15; Rev. 1:4). &ldquo;I Am&rdquo; is the meaning of the name Jehovah, and Jehovah is the name of God (Gen. 2:7), the One who is and who was and who is coming, the self-existing and ever-existing One. This name is used in speaking of God in His relationship with man. Hence, it indicates that the Lord Jesus is the ever-existing God who has a relationship with man.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus as the great I Am is the everlasting One who exists from eternity to eternity. He is without beginning or end of time. As the I Am, He is the self-existing One who exists from eternity to eternity. He is not only Jesus, a man from Nazareth; He is the great I Am. For Him to be the I Am in our experience and enjoyment of Him today means that He is whatever we need. To have Him as the I Am is like having a blank check on which we may fill in the amount that we need. The Lord Jesus, the great I Am, is everything we need.</p><h2 class="head6">(a) Existing before Abraham</h2>
<p>As the I Am, the Lord Jesus existed before Abraham. In John 8:58 He said, &ldquo;Before Abraham came into being, I am.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus as the great I Am is the eternal, ever-existing God. Hence, He was before Abraham and is greater than Abraham (v. 53).</p>
<h2 class="head6">(b) Having Died for Our Sins on the Cross</h2>
<p>As the I Am, the Lord Jesus died for our sins on the cross (vv. 24, 28). In verse 28 He said, &ldquo;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am.&rdquo; The phrase <em>lift up</em> refers to the Lord&rsquo;s being lifted up on the cross (cf. 3:14; 12:31-34) to die for our sins. In John 8:24 He said, &ldquo;Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.&rdquo; Any man who does not believe that the Lord Jesus is the very God, the I Am, will die in his sins.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Everyone Who Believes in Him<br />
Not Seeing Death Forever</h2>
<p>According to the word in verses 51 and 52, everyone who believes in Him as the I Am will not see (taste) death forever. Here we see that the Lord Jesus is able to save us from the result of sin, which is death. Once sin has been dealt with, spontaneously the result of sin will be removed.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Freeing Son</h2>
<p>In John 8 Christ is also unveiled as the freeing Son (vv. 34, 36).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Everyone Who Commits Sin Being a Slave of Sin</h2>
<p>In verse 34 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.&rdquo; A slave is always under a certain kind of bondage. Satan, the devil, has brought all humankind under the bondage of sin by injecting himself into man as the sinful nature that compels man to sin. It is impossible for anyone to free himself from such a slavery.</p>
<p>This slavery is not an outward matter; it is inward and is even in our nature. Satan&rsquo;s subtlety was not only to cause us to do something wrong but to inject himself into us as the sinful nature. Sin, therefore, is not merely objective, not merely an outward wrongdoing. Sin is in the subjective nature of our being; it is in our nature and even has become our very self. As a result, anything that is outside of our nature cannot help us in dealing with the sin that is in our nature. For this, we need another life, a stronger, richer, higher life, to come into us and be our life to encounter the satanic nature within us and thereby to set us free from the slavery of sin. This life is actually Christ Himself as the great I Am. He is such a life because He is the divine life. The divine life is higher than the human life and also higher than the satanic life. When this divine life comes into us, it defeats the satanic life and nature.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) The Son Freeing Us from the Slavery of Sin<br />
That We May Enjoy His Freedom</h2>
<p>The Son frees us from the slavery of sin that we may enjoy His freedom. In verse 36 the Lord Jesus declared, &ldquo;If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.&rdquo; The Son sets us free by shining within us as the light of life (v. 12). The light of life is not an outward light but an inward light. The very life which is Christ Himself has been given to us, and this life shines and becomes light within us (1:4; 10:10). This light sets us free. For this reason we must have the instant and constant fellowship with Him, not only every minute but even every second. Every second we need to be one with Him, fellowshipping with Him. Then He works as life within us. When life works, it shines, and when it shines, it sets us free. The bondage of our sin is not a chain on our shoulders; it is something in our constitution, in our being, in our fallen nature. Nothing outward can set us free from such bondage except the inward life which is Christ Himself working and shining in us. Day by day we may experience and enjoy Christ as the indwelling life shining within us as the light of life that gradually and spontaneously frees us from the slavery of sin.</p>
 <p>The Son frees us from sin not only by shining as the light of life but also by being the reality of what God is. &ldquo;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free&rdquo; (8:32). Truth here is not the so-called truth of doctrine but the reality of the divine things, which is Christ Himself. This verse says that the truth, the reality, will set us free, whereas verse 36 says that the Son sets us free. This proves that the Son, the Lord Himself, is the truth. Since the Lord is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9), He is the reality of what God is. Hence, reality is the divine element, the very element of God, realized by us. When Christ as the great I Am comes into us as life, He shines within us as light, bringing the divine element as reality into us. This reality, which is the divine element imparted into us and realized by us, sets us free from the bondage of sin by the divine life as the light of man. In this way the Son frees us from the slavery of sin that we may enjoy His freedom.</p>
<p>If we would experience Christ as the freeing Son, we need to realize that today Christ is in us as the life-giving Spirit and that this Spirit is the universal reality. The life-giving Spirit is the reality of the all-inclusive Christ, the One who is the great I Am, the Son of God, and the Son of Man. This Spirit is the reality of the One who died on the cross, resurrected from the dead, and who is now in ascension. This One is in us as the life-giving Spirit. He is living, capable, and powerful, and He sets us free from sin.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in chapters nine and ten of the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head3">60. The Light and the Healer of the Blind</h2>
<p>Chapter nine presents Christ as the light and the Healer of the blind.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Light</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the light of the world to give sight to the blind (vv. 1, 4-5). Blindness, like sin in chapter eight, is a matter of death. A dead person surely is blind. &ldquo;The god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers.&rdquo; Hence, they need &ldquo;the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ&rdquo; to shine upon them (2 Cor. 4:4) &ldquo;to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God&rdquo; (Acts 26:18).</p>
<p>The man whose eyes were opened by the Lord Jesus in John 9 was born blind. This signifies that blindness is in the nature of a person when he is born. We sinners were blind by nature because we were born that way. Therefore, a person needs not only to confess that he is sinful but also admit that he is blind.</p>
<p>To the blind man in John 9 the Lord Jesus, as the light of the world, imparted sight in the way of life (10:10b, 28). When the Lord Jesus saw this blind man, He said, &ldquo;While I am in the world, I am the light of the world&rdquo; (9:5). The Lord Jesus is the light of life (8:12). Blindness comes from the shortage of the light of life. Every dead person is also a blind person. Everyone who is spiritually dead is also spiritually blind. The blindness in John 9, therefore, indicates the lack of life. If we have the divine life, we will have sight, for the light of life opens our eyes. For this reason, the Lord Jesus first pointed out that the blind man needed the light of life.</p>
<p>In John 9 we see that there is a connection between light and blindness. Blindness not only indicates death but also denotes darkness. According to the Gospel of John, blindness issues in darkness. If you were blind, you would be in darkness, unable to see anything. According to 1 John darkness also causes blindness: &ldquo;He who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes&rdquo; (2:11). On the one hand, blindness causes darkness; on the other hand, darkness causes blindness. According to the Gospel of John, blindness comes first and then darkness. In John 9 blindness equals darkness. Hence, the blind man in this chapter needs Christ as the light of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Healer of the Blind</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the light of the world (v. 5) to give sight to the blind; He is also the Healer of the blind (vv. 6-7).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Words out of His Mouth<br />
Mingling with Humanity to Bring Sight to the Blind</h2>
<p>How can the light come into us, who were born blind? According to verse 6, in order for the light to come into us, we need the anointing. The words out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth (signified by His spittle), being the anointing Spirit (6:63), mingle with humanity (signified by the clay) to bring sight to the blind. If we would understand this, we need to know the significance of the clay, the spittle, and the anointing itself.</p>
<p>In John 9:6, after the Lord Jesus spoke of Himself as being the light of the world, He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the blind man&rsquo;s eyes with the clay. Clay here, as in Romans 9:21, signifies humanity. Clay signifies the natural man, the man created by God. As those created by God, we all are clay. Spittle here, as something that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord (Matt. 4:4), signifies the Lord&rsquo;s words, which are Spirit and life (John 6:63). The Lord&rsquo;s making clay of the spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the Lord&rsquo;s living word, which is the Spirit. The word <em>anointed</em> in John 9:6 proves this, because the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit is the anointing Spirit (Luke 4:18; 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 1 John 2:27). Here the Lord Jesus anointed the blind eyes with the clay made of His spittle, that they might have sight. This signifies that by the anointing of the mingling of the Lord&rsquo;s word (which is His Spirit) with our humanity, our eyes, which were blinded by Satan, can have sight.</p>
 <p>We need to be deeply impressed with the significance of the mingling of the clay with the spittle. Our humanity (clay) is mingled with the element of the Lord in His word (spittle). This indicates that the Lord mingles His element with us by and with His word. This means that the clay has received something that has proceeded out the Lord&rsquo;s mouth and has been mingled with it. This mingling of divinity with humanity is the most prevailing ointment, and no other ointment can surpass it. According to John 6 the anointing of the Spirit follows the mingling of the Lord in His word with the clay. From experience we know that immediately after we receive the Lord through His word, we have the anointing of the Spirit. As a result our blindness is healed, and we receive our sight.</p>
<p>Now we can see how the light of the world, Jesus Christ, can come into a person who was born blind. The light of the world comes into a blind man through the mingling of the life-giving Spirit with his being. In order to come into us, Christ became the life-giving Spirit. Now as the Spirit He is able to come into us and mingle with us and anoint us. This is the significance of the clay, the spittle, and the anointing in this chapter.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Through Our Obedience</h2>
<p>John 9 also reveals that we receive light for our sight through our obedience, which washes away our old humanity. In verse 7a the Lord Jesus said to the blind man whose eyes had been anointed with the clay, &ldquo;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is interpreted, Sent).&rdquo; Here to wash is to cleanse away the clay. This signifies the washing away of our old humanity, as experienced in baptism (Rom. 6:3-4, 6).</p>
<p>John 9:7b continues, &ldquo;He went therefore and washed and came away seeing.&rdquo; His going and washing indicates that he obeyed the life-giving word of the Lord. So he received his sight. If he had not gone to wash off the clay after having been anointed with it, the clay would have blinded him even more. Our obedience to the Lord&rsquo;s anointing cleanses us and brings us sight.</p>
<p>The word <em>Siloam</em> means &ldquo;sent.&rdquo; Once we have been anointed by the Spirit, we will be in the position of being sent. The anointing puts us on the ground of being sent. Therefore, we must obey. The Lord Jesus Himself always stood on the ground of being sent by the Father and was always obedient. Now the Lord puts us in the same position as His sent ones. After we receive Him in His word and have His anointing, He puts us in the position of being sent, and we must now be obedient to His sending. In particular, we must obey His sending us to the pool of Siloam for the washing away of our old man. Even though we have believed in the Lord Jesus and have entered into an organic union with Him, we may still have the clay of the old man on our eyes. Therefore, we need to obey the Lord, go to the pool of Siloam, and wash away our old man. This is the way to receive the divine light.</p>
<h2 class="head3">61. The Shepherd, the Door,<br />
and the Pasture of the Sheep,<br />
and the Son and the Father Being One</h2>
<p>In John 10 Christ is unveiled as the Shepherd of the sheep, the door of the sheep, and the pasture of the sheep. This chapter also reveals the matter of the Son and the Father being one.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Shepherd of the Sheep</h2>
<p>In verses 10 and 11 we see that Christ is the Shepherd of the sheep.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Good Shepherd</h2>
<p>In verse 11a the Lord Jesus said of Himself, &ldquo;I am the good Shepherd.&rdquo; He calls His sheep by name and leads them out of the fold (v. 3). Then He goes before the sheep, and they follow Him (v. 4). As the Shepherd Christ takes the sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and into Himself as the pasture.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Laying Down His Soul-life for the Sheep</h2>
<p>In verse 11b the Lord Jesus continued saying, &ldquo;The good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;life&rdquo; here is <em>psuche</em> and refers to the soul-life. The good Shepherd, Christ, laid down His soul-life for the sheep that they might have the <em>zoe</em> life, the eternal and divine life. In verse 10b the Lord said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&rdquo; Here the Greek word for <em>life</em> is <em>zoe,</em> the word used in the New Testament for the eternal, divine life. As a man the Lord has the <em>psuche</em> life, the human life, and as God He has the <em>zoe</em> life, the divine life. He laid down His soul, His <em>psuche</em> life, His human life, to accomplish redemption for His sheep (vv. 15, 17-18) that they may share His <em>zoe</em> life, His divine life, the eternal life (v. 28), by which they can be formed into one flock under Himself as the one Shepherd. As the good Shepherd He feeds His sheep with the divine life in this way and for this purpose.</p>
<p>The real Shepherd is the living Christ. As our Shepherd the Lord not only gives life to us; He is life to us. The living of Christ within us is actually His living shepherding. Hence, the Lord Jesus shepherds us by being life to us and by living in us.</p>
<p>Today Christ shepherds us inwardly in the way of life, not in the way of outward activity. Inwardly we have Christ as our Shepherd, as a Shepherd of life and in life. Because Christ shepherds us by being life to us from within, the more we live by Him as our life, the more we experience and enjoy His shepherding. On the one hand, Christ lives in us. On the other hand, we live in Him, by Him, with Him, and through Him. When we live in the Lord in such a way, we are under His shepherding. As we are under Christ&rsquo;s shepherding, there will be a life-consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life. The life within us, which is actually Christ Himself, will indicate that the Lord intends to lead us in a certain way. This life-consciousness with its leading and instruction is an indication that we are under Christ&rsquo;s shepherding.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Door of the Sheep</h2>
<p>Verses 1-4 and 9 show us that Christ is the door of the sheep.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) For the Old Testament Saints<br />
to Go into the Law as the Custody</h2>
<p>Christ was the door of the sheep for the Old Testament saints to go into the law as the custody (v. 9a). The fold in John 10 signifies the law and also Judaism, the religion of the law. Before Christ came, God put His chosen people under the custody of the law. God did this through Christ as the door by which God&rsquo;s elect entered into the custody of the law. The law was the fold where God&rsquo;s people as the sheep were kept and protected temporarily until the pasture, the permanent place for the sheep, was ready.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) For the Saints under the Law<br />
to Go out of the Custody</h2>
<p>Christ is the door not only for God&rsquo;s elect to enter into the custody of the law, as did Moses, David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah in the Old Testament time, before Christ came, but also for God&rsquo;s chosen people, such as Peter, John, James, and Paul, to come out of the fold of the law now that Christ has come. Thus, the Lord Jesus indicated in verse 9 that He is the door not only through which God&rsquo;s elect may go in but also through which God&rsquo;s chosen people may go out.</p>
<p>God no longer intends to keep His chosen people in the fold of the law. He wants them to come out of the law into Christ. Now, during the New Testament age, God intends to bring His people out of the law through Christ as the door. Christ has come, and the pasture is ready. There is no need for the sheep to be confined any longer in the custody of the Judaic law. They must be released from the fold of the law to enjoy the riches of the pasture. Christ is the door through which His believers may come out of any kind of fold and come into Him as the pasture.</p>
<p>As the door of the sheep to leave the fold, Christ is our freedom from legality. In Christ we have the freedom to go in and to go out. This means that we do not have any legality. The freedom we enjoy is Christ Himself. Because Christ is our freedom, our door, we are not bound by any legality. This, of course, does not mean that we are free to indulge the flesh (Gal. 5:13). In Christ we are not in bondage to legality. Because Christ is our door, we have true freedom.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Pasture of the Sheep</h2>
<p>Today we may experience and enjoy Christ not only as the Shepherd and the door but also as the pasture. For Christ to be the Shepherd of the sheep, He has to be the door for the release of many sheep of God&rsquo;s flock in Judaism. Now after setting them free from the Judaistic fold as the door of the sheep, Christ feeds them with Himself as the rich pasture of the sheep. John 10:9 says, &ldquo;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.&rdquo; The pasture here signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep. When the pasture is not available, the sheep must be kept in the fold temporarily. When the pasture is ready, there is no further need for the sheep to remain in the fold. The sheep should come out of the fold and remain in the pasture permanently. To be kept in the fold is transitional and temporary. To be in the pasture enjoying its riches is final and permanent. Before Christ came, the law was a ward, and being under the law was transitional. Now that Christ has come, all God&rsquo;s chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture (Gal. 3:23-25; 4:3-5). This should be final and permanent.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that He came that we may have life and have it abundantly. This means that, because Christ is the pasture of the sheep, He came to impart Himself as life into the sheep. As long as the sheep stay in the pasture, they will have the supply of life abundantly. By feeding on the pasture, the sheep experience and enjoy the pasture as their abundant life supply.</p>
<p>In order to be the pasture of life to the sheep, Christ had to die for them. Hence, He laid down His life for His sheep, dying for the sheep in order to minister Himself as life to them and thereby be the pasture to them. Today our pasture is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit. In our daily life we should have the definite realization that we are in the pasture experiencing and enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life.</p><h2 class="head5">(1) For the Old Testament Saints</h2>
<p>Christ is the pasture of the sheep for the Old Testament saints, who go out of the custody of the law, to feed on.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) For the New Testament Saints</h2>
<p>Christ is the pasture for the New Testament saints, who become one flock with the Old Testament saints under one Shepherd, to feed on. In John 10:16 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.&rdquo; The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ (Eph. 2:14-16; 3:6), brought forth by the Lord&rsquo;s eternal, divine life, which He imparted into His members through His death and resurrection. The fold is Judaism, which is of letter and regulation, and the flock is the church, which is of life and spirit.</p>
<p>As the One who is the Shepherd, the door, and the pasture, the Lord Jesus forms His sheep into one flock, the one universal church, the one Body of Christ, consisting of all the believers in Christ. The Lord supplies the sheep with Himself as life so that there may be one flock and one Shepherd, one Body and one Head. This one flock is different in nature from a fold. A fold is a religious organization; the one flock is the church. Christ has brought us out of the fold into the flock, where we are in Him as the pasture experiencing and enjoying Him as our life and life supply.</p>
<p>For us to be fed with Christ as the rich pasture of life is for us to be flocked together with God&rsquo;s other sheep to be His organic Body to arrive at the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;the New Jerusalem. When we feast on Christ as the pasture, we like to be flocked together with others. The more we enjoy Christ, the more we like to fellowship with others. If we feed upon Christ as our pasture in the morning, enjoying Him as the feast, we will eagerly go to the meeting in the evening.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Son and the Father Being One</h2>
<p>In John 10:30 the Lord Jesus declared, &ldquo;I and the Father are one.&rdquo; Here the Lord asserted His deity, that is, that He is God (v. 33; 5:18; 1:1; 20:28; 1 John 5:20; Phil. 2:6).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Father and the Son Being One<br />
in Shepherding, Freeing, and Feeding God&rsquo;s Chosen People</h2>
<p>According to the context the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 10:30 signifies that the Father and the Son are one in shepherding, freeing, and feeding God&rsquo;s chosen people.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) The Believers, as God&rsquo;s Flock,<br />
Enjoying the Care of Both the Son and the Father</h2>
<p>The believers, as God&rsquo;s flock, enjoy the care of both the Son and the Father. In verses 28 and 29 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; These verses speak respectively of the Son&rsquo;s hand and of the Father&rsquo;s hand. The Father&rsquo;s hand, by which He chooses in His love according to His purpose (17:23; 6:38-39), and the Son&rsquo;s hand, by which He saves by His grace for the fulfillment of the Father&rsquo;s purpose (1:14; 6:37), both of which have the keeping power, are for the believers&rsquo; protection. Eternal life, which is for the believers&rsquo; living, will never fail. Hence, the believers are eternally secure and will never perish.</p>
<p>Grace and love are not two separate matters but two aspects of one thing. Love is in the Father. When this love reaches us in the Son, it becomes grace. When through grace we return to the Father, we enjoy His love.</p>
<p>Both the Son&rsquo;s hand of grace and the Father&rsquo;s hand of love are of the divine life. In the Father the divine life is the source, and in the Son this life is the course. In the Father the divine life is love, and in the Son the divine life is grace. Because we enjoy both the Son and the Father, we enjoy both grace and love. The result is that we are preserved, and nothing can snatch us out of these two hands&mdash;the Son&rsquo;s hand of grace and the Father&rsquo;s hand of love.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(18)</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in chapters eleven and twelve of the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head3">62. The Light of the World<br />
and the Resurrection and the Life</h2>
<p>Chapter eleven presents Christ as the light of the world and the resurrection and the life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Light of the World</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the light of the world for us to walk in that we might not stumble (vv. 9-10). When the Lord wanted to go into Judea (v. 7), He encountered the frustration caused by man&rsquo;s opinion, which is a sign of walking in darkness. Whereas in other chapters of this Gospel the frustration came from those in the Jewish religion, in this chapter the frustration came from human opinion expressed first by the disciples (vv. 8, 11-16). The disciples said to the Lord that the Jews were seeking to stone Him and therefore He should not go into Judea. The Lord&rsquo;s word to His disciples in verses 9 and 10 indicates that their opinion was a sign that they were walking in darkness. &ldquo;Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of the world. But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&rdquo; This indicates that all opinionated persons are in darkness. Opinions are a sign of darkness because to utter an opinion is to speak nonsense. The reason a person speaks nonsense is that he is in the darkness. But the Lord Jesus is fully in the light, and He Himself is the light. Furthermore, whenever Christ is present, there is day. In other words, as long as Christ is present, we are not in darkness; if Christ as the light of the world is present, it is daytime.</p>
<p>Whenever we express an opinion that is contrary to the Lord&rsquo;s will, that opinion signifies that we are not walking in the day but in the darkness. If we are following the Lord, we should say &ldquo;amen&rdquo; to whatever He says and not express any opinion. As long as we express an opinion of any kind, that opinion will be a sign that we are in darkness and that we do not know what we are saying. Only the Lord knows what to say. When He says, &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; that is something in the day, in the light. The Lord&rsquo;s guidance is always light. If we follow our opinion, we shall be in darkness. But if we follow His guidance, we shall be in the day and we shall walk in the light. This is the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the light of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Resurrection and the Life</h2>
<p>In verses 25 and 26 we see that Christ is the resurrection and the life. In verse 25a the Lord Jesus said of Himself, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo; Christ as the resurrection has been tested by death and has conquered death, and Christ as the life remains unchangeable and lasts forever. This is indicated by Paul&rsquo;s word in 2 Timothy 1:10b that says, &ldquo;Our Savior Christ Jesus...nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.&rdquo; Christ nullified death, making it of none effect, through His devil-destroying death (Heb. 2:14) and death-swallowing resurrection (1 Cor. 15:52-54). <em>Life</em> in 2 Timothy 1:10 is the eternal life of God, which is given to all believers in Christ and which is the main element of the divine grace given to us (Rom. 5:17, 21).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is not only life but also resurrection. By itself, life can only have existence, but resurrection can withstand any kind of attack, even the attack of death. Death cannot hold Him because He can conquer death (Acts 2:24). Death cannot retain Him, because He is not only life&mdash;He is also resurrection. Life is the power to exist, but resurrection is the power to conquer everything that is against life. As the resurrection, Christ can defeat every attack against life. Christ as the resurrection is mainly to overcome death and all the things belonging to death such as blindness, dumbness, deafness, and all kinds of sickness.</p>
 <p>According to the Scriptures, death is a great power. When death comes upon a man, he cannot escape it. Only the Lord Himself as the resurrection can defeat death. Since He is the resurrection, He can break the power of death. Even Hades is unable to confine our Lord to the tomb (Rev. 1:18). Because Christ is not only life but also resurrection, He can deliver all of the dead persons from death.</p>
<p>After speaking of Himself as the resurrection and the life, Jesus said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and every one who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever&rdquo; (John 11:25-26). This indicates that we may enjoy Christ as the resurrection and the life by believing into Him, that is, by receiving Him into us so that we may have an organic union with Him.</p>
<p>We must learn to apply Christ as the resurrection life day by day. We must not only live by the Lord as life, but we must also conquer by the Lord as resurrection. Many times our circumstances affect us like death. But all matters which contain the touch of death are a test because these matters prove whether or not the Lord is the resurrection. Nothing can confine us, for we have the Lord as our resurrection life. Regardless of the pressure or trouble we are bearing, we can stand it because we have resurrection life. According to 11:25, the Lord did not say that we will not die, but that we will prove to the whole universe that the Lord into whom we believe is the resurrection! Satan will try his best to put us permanently into death. One day, though we all may die, we will all be resurrected. Throughout the whole universe this will be the greatest victory, the victory that will testify that the Lord is the resurrection. However, even in our daily life we may have the foretaste of the ultimate victory of that resurrection. This is why the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection&rdquo; (Phil. 3:10).</p>
<p>Today with His believers everything that the Lord accomplishes is the exercise of Himself as the resurrection. Regenerating, sanctifying, renewing, transforming, conforming, and even glorifying are the exercise of Christ as the resurrection who is life eternal. Every aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation involves resurrection. After resurrecting us through regeneration, the Lord is now continuing this process of resurrection by sanctifying and transforming us. Eventually, Christ will glorify us. That glorification will be the consummation of resurrection. God&rsquo;s salvation, therefore, is a process of resurrection. May we experience and enjoy this Christ as the resurrection and the life day by day so that we will be no longer a natural man but a resurrected person.</p><h2 class="head3">63. The Grain of Wheat and the Light</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Grain of Wheat</h2>
<p>John 12:23-24 reveals that Christ is a grain of wheat for His divine multiplication. In verse 24, Jesus likened Himself to a grain of wheat: &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; As such a grain of wheat, Christ is the divine seed to produce many grains (the people who receive Him) to become His many members who constitute His organic Body which consummates in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Falling into the Ground and Dying</h2>
<p>In this chapter, according to the worldly view, Jesus was in His golden time. A great crowd of Jews esteemed Him highly and welcomed Him warmly (vv. 12-19), and even the Greeks were seeking after Him (vv. 20-22). However, the Lord neither accepted this kind of exaltation, nor took this opportunity to get a name for Himself; nor did He seize the golden opportunity as the means to have His increase. Rather, knowing that the way for a grain of wheat to multiply is not by being welcomed and honored, but by falling into the ground and dying, the Lord preferred to fall as a grain of wheat into the ground and die that He might produce many grains for the church.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was the unique grain that contained His divine life with the divine glory, and His humanity through His incarnation became a shell to conceal the glory of His divinity. Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death released the divine life and glory that were within the shell of His humanity. Just as a grain of wheat releases its life by falling into the ground, so Christ released the divine life within Him through death. Through His death on the cross, the shell of His flesh was broken, and the divine life contained and concealed within it was released. If Christ had not fallen into the earth to die, He would have remained one grain. But He fell into the earth and died, and He brought forth many grains as His multiplication.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Growing out of Death to Produce Many Grains</h2>
<p>Christ, who as a grain of wheat fell into the ground and died, grew out of death to produce many grains, which are the believers. The Lord Jesus fell into the ground and died that His divine element, His divine life, might be released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3), just as a grain of wheat has its life element released by falling into the ground and growing up out of the ground to bear much fruit, that is, to bring forth many grains.</p>
<p>After unveiling Himself as a grain of wheat falling into the ground to produce the many grains, in John 12:32 Christ goes on to reveal Himself as one being lifted up from the earth to draw all men to Himself. &ldquo;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all man to Myself.&rdquo; In one respect, the Lord&rsquo;s death was His falling into the ground, as revealed in verse 24; in another respect, it was His being lifted up on the tree (1 Pet. 2:24). His falling into the ground was to produce the many grains; His being lifted up was to draw all men to Himself. The many grains produced by His falling into the ground are the believers, the &ldquo;all men&rdquo; drawn by His being lifted up on the tree. On the one hand, we the believers are grains produced by the death and resurrection of Christ. On the other hand, we are those who have been drawn to the Lord. We are the grains, and we are the drawn ones. All those who are drawn to Him eventually become the many grains, the fruits produced by His death and resurrection. This indicates that the church life has been multiplied! In fact, this multiplication is still taking place today, for many are still being drawn to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) For His Multiplication&mdash;Glorification</h2>
<p>Christ is the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died, that grew out of death to produce many grains for His multiplication, His glorification. According to John 12:23-24, the Lord&rsquo;s glorification is a matter of His multiplication. Verse 23 indicates clearly that the Lord was concerned for His glorification, and verse 24 explains what this glorification is. In verse 23 He said to the disciples, &ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.&rdquo; In verse 24 He went on to say, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; This indicates that glorification is a matter of dying and rising so that many grains may be brought forth. This means that the Lord&rsquo;s glorification was His multiplication, and His multiplication was His glorification. Since a field of ripe wheat has a certain kind of glory and all the ripe ears of wheat are the glory of the grains of wheat that have been sown into the ground, the multiplication of a grain of wheat is its glorification. Likewise, as a grain of wheat, the Lord Jesus died on the cross to bring forth the multiplication of Himself, and He is glorified in the producing of many grains, which are for the building up of His Body. As a grain of wheat, a container of the divine life, Christ was sown into the earth through death in order that He might be multiplied and thereby glorified.</p><h2 class="head5">(4) The Believers&rsquo; Enjoying Him as the Life Essence<br />
through His Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>The believers may enjoy Christ as the life essence through His death and resurrection; that is, they may enjoy Him as the life essence released through His death and dispensed through His resurrection. The Lord, as a grain of wheat falling into the ground, lost His soul-life through death that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains. As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death (v. 25) that we may enjoy the eternal life in resurrection. To lose our soul-life is to follow Him that we may serve Him and walk with Him on this way, the way of losing the soul-life and living in His resurrection. This is indicated by the Lord&rsquo;s word to the disciples in verse 26a, &ldquo;If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant will be.&rdquo; Thus, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, grant me the grace to be willing to die. Lord, I want to follow You. You said that wherever You are, there will Your servants be. Lord, since You are in death, we must be in death also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One difference between Christ as the one grain and us as the many is that He was willing to fall into the ground, but we are not. Instead of falling into the ground to die, we like to be uplifted. However, if we are lifted up, there will be no multiplication. The only way for a grain to multiply is to fall into the ground and die. Otherwise, it will remain alone, perhaps in a high place. All genuine Christians are grains, but not many are willing to fall into the ground and die. There might be a huge crowd, but there might be very little life because few are willing to experience the death of Christ. Since nearly everyone is unwilling to die and prefers to receive glory, no life is imparted into others. It is easy to have a crowd but difficult to impart life into others. To do this, we need to die. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not need a crowd; we need the death that releases life. We need to experience this aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s death not only releases the divine life but also multiplies it. The shortage of life among the believers is due to the fact that we have not died enough to minister life to one another. Life comes out of death. The divine life is within us, but how much this life is multiplied depends upon how much death we undergo. The more death we experience, the more life will be released from us. Only death can bring about the multiplication of the divine life; power cannot do it. Today&rsquo;s Christians devote their attention to power instead of to life. But only the death of Christ can multiply life. He is the unique grain of wheat, and we are the many grains of wheat. In our function we should be the same as Christ for His multiplication. Hence, we need to enjoy Christ as the grain of wheat by experiencing His life-releasing death for the multiplication of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Light</h2>
<p>In verses 35, 36, and 46, we see that Christ is the light. In verses 35 and 36, the Lord Jesus said to the crowd, &ldquo;The light is still among you a little while. Walk while you have the light so that darkness may not overcome you; and he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe into the light, so that you may become sons of light.&rdquo; In verse 46, the Lord then said of Himself, &ldquo;I have come as a light into the world, that every one who believes into Me would not remain in darkness.&rdquo; This indicates that the Lord Jesus came to this world as the shining light that man might not remain in darkness. Christ is the manifestation of God as light, and if people receive Him as light, they will have God. If a man believes into Him, he will not remain in darkness. However, if a man refuses to receive Him as light, he simply rejects God and will be overcome by darkness. Christ comes as light. If a man receives Him, he will have God and will become one of the sons of light, the children of God. Here the Lord was making a declaration to the religious crowd that He is the manifestation of God coming to them as light. If they receive Him, they will become sons of light, and if they do not receive Him, they will be overcome by darkness. Christ is the light into whom we believe, that we may become sons of light who do not remain in darkness and are not overcome by darkness.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(19)</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head3">64. The One Who Washes the Disciples&rsquo; Feet<br />
and the Glorified Son of Man</h2>
<p>In John 13 we have Christ as the One who washes the disciples&rsquo; feet and as the glorified Son of Man.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The One Who Washes His Disciples&rsquo; Feet</h2>
<p>In verses 3 through 10, we see that Christ is the One who washes His disciples&rsquo; feet.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Having Come Forth from God and Going to God, and into Whose Hands God the Father Has Given All</h2>
<p> Verse 3 indicates the reason why the Lord washed the disciples&rsquo; feet: He knew &ldquo;that the Father had given all into His hands and that He had come forth from God and was going to God.&rdquo; At that time He realized three matters: that the Father had given all into His hands, that He had come forth from God, and that He was going to God. Because of these three things He washed the feet of His disciples. The &ldquo;all&rdquo; that the Father had given Him was mainly the disciples, His coming forth from God had brought God into His disciples, and in His going to God He was to leave these disciples. The Father had given the disciples, and the Lord had brought God into them, but now He was going to leave them. By His coming forth from God and His bringing God into them, a relationship between the disciples and God came into existence. Now He was going to leave them. After He would leave them, how could this relationship between the disciples and God be maintained? It was to be maintained by foot-washing. Foot-washing is to wash from the feet all the dirt that frustrates the fellowship of the relationship between God and man. In doing this, the Lord showed His disciples the way for them to maintain their relationship with God in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Washing the Feet of the Disciples<br />
from the Dirtiness of the Earthly Touch</h2>
<p>In verses 4 and 5, we are told that Christ laid aside His garments, girded Himself with a towel, poured water into the basin, and &ldquo;began to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded&rdquo; (v. 5). This indicates that Christ washed the feet of the disciples from the dirtiness of the earthly touch. We need to realize that in our spirit we, the regenerated ones, are in God and in the heavenlies, but in our body we are still living in the flesh and walking on the earth. In our spirit the Lord has brought God into us and us into God, in our spirit we are one with God, and in our spirit we are in the heavenlies because we are in God. But in our body we are still on the earth. On the one hand, we are the new creation, we are in God, and we are in the heavenlies. On the other hand, we are still in the old creation, still on this earth.</p>
<p>Although we have the divine life and have become the church, we are still living in this fallen flesh on the earth. Through the earthly touch we are often dirty. This is inevitable, for we cannot avoid the earthly touch. Our feet are the members of our body that touch the earth. Day by day we are touching the earth with our feet, and by contacting the earth with our feet, our feet certainly become dirty. Consequently, foot-washing is a necessity for us.</p>
<p>Dirtiness is different from sinfulness. To be sinful is one thing and to be dirty is another. We may be absolutely sinless and yet be very dirty. Perhaps nothing is wrong, but we are dirty simply because of the earthly touch. We need to realize that we are still in the body and are still walking on this earth. As a result, much of the time we are not clean. Therefore, we need foot-washing.</p><h2 class="head5">(3) With the Spirit, the Word, and the Life,</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus washed the disciples&rsquo; feet with water (v. 5). Water here signifies the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5), the Word (Eph. 5:26; John 15:3), and the life (19:34). The Lord washes us spiritually by the working of the Holy Spirit, by the enlightening of the Word, and by the operating of the inner law of life. In the Scriptures each of these three items is symbolized by water.</p>
<p>For things that are sinful we need the cleansing of the blood, but for things that are dirty and not sinful we need the spiritual washing. We need a washing by the Holy Spirit, the living Word, and the inner life. In our experience, the Lord Jesus Himself and saints who have much life can afford us such a washing. For us to experience this washing, we need to spend time in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. If we remain in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, the Lord will come to us and wash us, not with the blood, but with the Spirit, the living Word, and the inner life. It is difficult to say just when He completes this washing. Sometimes it takes only a few minutes to wash the dirt away; at other times it may take half a day. Whenever we are in need of such a washing, we just need to spend time in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, opening ourselves up to Him and allowing the inner life to flow within us. Spontaneously, something living will flow, water, and wash us, and we will become clean again. Our spirit will be uplifted, and our whole being will be so pleasant in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This is the washing with the living water in the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p> Today the Lord always exercises the washing by the Holy Spirit dwelling within us, by the Word of God in the Scriptures enlightening us, and by the inner life operating within us. The Lord may wash us many times a day. We need to allow the Spirit, the living Word, and the inner life to wash away all the dirt that we have accumulated while living in the flesh and walking on this dusty earth.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) To Maintain Them in the Fellowship with Him<br />
and with One Another</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus washed the disciples&rsquo; feet to maintain them in the fellowship with Him and with one another (13:8, 10). Thus, He said to Peter, &ldquo;Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me&rdquo; (v. 8). In ancient times the Jews wore sandals, and since their roads were dusty, their feet easily became dirty. When they came to a feast, if they sat at the table and stretched out their feet, the dirt and the smell would certainly frustrate the fellowship. The Lord washed His disciples&rsquo; feet to show them that He loved them to the uttermost (v. 1), and He charged them to do the same to one another in love (vv. 14, 34). Today the world is dirty, and we, the saints, are easily contaminated. For us to maintain pleasant fellowship with the Lord and with one another, we need spiritual foot-washing&mdash;with the washing Holy Spirit, the washing word, and the washing life&mdash;carried out both by the Lord in His love and by one another in love. This is absolutely necessary in order for us to live in the fellowship of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Glorified Son of Man</h2>
<p>In John 13 Christ is also revealed as the glorified Son of Man going through death to terminate the old creation (12:23-24; Gal. 6:14) and entering into resurrection for His multiplication to be the new creation (Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 5:17). In John 13:31 and 32, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Now has the Son of Man been glorified, and God has been glorified in Him. If God has been glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and He will glorify Him immediately.&rdquo; For Christ to be glorified was to have His divine element released from within His humanity through death and resurrection. His death not only broke the shell of His humanity and released His divine life; it also terminated the old creation (12:23-24). Paul thus declared in Galatians 6:14, &ldquo;But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.&rdquo; This verse indicates that through the crucified Christ, the world&mdash;the old man of the old creation&mdash;has been crucified to us and we to the world, that is, that the Lord Jesus went through death to terminate the old creation. In the next verse, Paul said, &ldquo;For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters&rdquo; (v. 15). These two verses reveal that by the cross of Christ we are separated from the world and are thus qualified to live in the new creation. According to the context of the book of Galatians, the new creation is composed of sons of God; it is a corporate, divine sonship (3:26; 4:5, 7), brought forth through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, the Spirit&rsquo;s regeneration, and God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into us. In keeping with the book of Galatians, the Gospel of John unveils that as the glorified Son of Man, Christ not only passed through death to terminate the old creation but also entered into resurrection for His multiplication to be the new creation composed of the many sons of God (12:23-24; 13:31-32; 20:17).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(20)</h1>
<p>In the next four messages we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head3">65. The Embodiment of the Triune God</h2>
<p>Chapters fourteen through seventeen reveal Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Father&rsquo;s House</h2>
<p>Chapter fourteen unveils that Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the Father&rsquo;s house. The Father&rsquo;s house signifies the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people; this is the mutual abode where God dwells in man and man dwells in God (vv. 2, 20, 23).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Enlarged with His Believers to Be God&rsquo;s Fullness</h2>
<p>The Father&rsquo;s house is Christ enlarged with His believers to be God&rsquo;s fullness (the Body of Christ as God&rsquo;s full expression) through His going&mdash;His death, and in His coming&mdash;His resurrection (Eph. 3:19b). In John 14:2 and 3 the Lord Jesus told His disciples, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; According to 2:16, <em>My Father&rsquo;s house</em> in 14:2 refers to the temple, the body of Christ, as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. At first the Father&rsquo;s house as God&rsquo;s dwelling place was only the individual body of Christ (2:16, 21). But through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, the body of Christ has increased to be His corporate Body, which is the church, including all His believers, who have been regenerated through His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection the church is the Body of Christ, which is the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 2:5; Heb. 3:6), God&rsquo;s habitation (Eph. 2:21-22), God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <em>many abodes</em> in John 14:2 are the many members of the Body of Christ (v. 23; Rom. 12:5), which is God&rsquo;s temple (1 Cor. 3:16-17). The Father&rsquo;s house is the resurrected temple&mdash;Christ raised up with His members, His believers (John 2:19-21). According to Ephesians 2:6 and 1 Peter 1:3, we, the members of Christ, have been raised up with Him. As members of the Body of Christ raised up with Him, all the believers in Christ are the abodes, the rooms, in the Father&rsquo;s house. Hence, the Father&rsquo;s house is Christ enlarged with His believers to be God&rsquo;s fullness, the Body of Christ as the full expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(a) Through His Going&mdash;His Death</h2>
<p>It was through His death and in His resurrection that Christ was enlarged with His believers to be the Father&rsquo;s house&mdash;a mutual abode where God abides in man and man abides in God. Speaking of His death, the Lord said in John 14:2, &ldquo;I go to prepare a place for you.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s going was to pave the way for man to be in God, that is, to bring man into God for the building of His dwelling place. For man to allow God to dwell in him, man must firstly get into Him. If man does not get into God, God will not get into man. Once man dwells in God, then God will dwell in man. But between man and God there were many obstacles, such as sin, sins, death, the world, the flesh, the self, the old man, and Satan. For the Lord to bring man into God, He had to solve all these problems. Therefore, He had to go to the cross to accomplish redemption that He might open the way and make a standing for man, that man might enter into God. This standing in God, being enlarged, becomes the standing in the Body of Christ. Anyone who does not have a standing, a place, in God does not have a place in the Body of Christ, which is God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Hence, His death&mdash;His going in order to accomplish His redemption&mdash;was to prepare a place in His Body (the Father&rsquo;s house) for the disciples.</p><h2 class="head6">(b) In His Coming&mdash;His Resurrection</h2>
<p>Christ as the Father&rsquo;s house&mdash;the mutual abode of God and man&mdash;was enlarged with His believers to be God&rsquo;s full expression not only through His going&mdash;His death, but also in His coming&mdash;His resurrection. Speaking of His resurrection, the Lord said in verse 3, &ldquo;I am coming again.&rdquo; This word refers to Christ in His resurrection coming to His disciples. This thought corresponds to the Lord&rsquo;s words to the disciples in verse 18: &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; This coming was fulfilled on the day of His resurrection (20:19-22). After His resurrection the Lord came back to His disciples to be with them forever, thus not leaving them as orphans. Furthermore, in John 14:3, the Lord told the disciples, &ldquo;I am coming again and will receive you to Myself.&rdquo; In receiving the disciples to Himself, the Lord put them into Himself. This is indicated by verse 20 where the Lord spoke to the disciples regarding the day of resurrection: &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and <em>you in Me,</em> and I in you.&rdquo; In verse 3 the Lord also said that He would receive us to Himself that &ldquo;where I am you also may be.&rdquo; The Lord is in the Father (vv. 10-11). He wanted His disciples also to be in the Father, as revealed in 17:21. Through His death and resurrection He brought His disciples into Himself. Since He is in the Father, they are in the Father by being in Him. Hence, where He is, the disciples are also. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection was a further step of coming into us to enlarge the Father&rsquo;s house, a mutual abode of God and man.</p>
<p>It was through death and in resurrection that Christ built the Father&rsquo;s house. The Gospel of John reveals that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, working Himself into us, by way of Christ the Son&rsquo;s death and resurrection. The Lord Jesus indicated this in chapter two when He said to the Jewish leaders, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (v. 19). The phrase, <em>in three days</em> means &ldquo;in resurrection.&rdquo; Thus, here the Lord is saying that He would build up the temple, the Father&rsquo;s house, in resurrection. Apart from the death and resurrection of Christ, there is neither a way for us to enter into God nor a place for us in God. The Lord Jesus died for His believers and was raised up with them. Now based on His death and resurrection, He is working on them to build them up into one Body, and this Body is the church, the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15).</p>
<p>Christ as the Father&rsquo;s house is a mutual abode, an abode for both God and us. However, if we would not be built up through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection so that God can dwell in us, we shall be short of the experience of God as our dwelling place. We need to be built up through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection so that God can dwell in us. When we are built up in this way, we become an abode to God. When God dwells in us, He becomes our dwelling place. This is our abode. Furthermore, this means that we and God, God and we, are mingled together to become one abode, a mutual abode. God abides in us, and we abide in God&mdash;a mutual abiding. Christ as the Father&rsquo;s house is thus a sign signifying the mingling of God with His people. Therefore, we should be built up through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection so that we and God can be mingled together to become a mutual abode, the Father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) The Way to Enter into the Father&rsquo;s House</h2>
<p>John 14:4-6 reveals that Christ is the way for man to enter into the Father&rsquo;s house, that is, for man to get into the Father. In verse 4 the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, &ldquo;And where I am going you know the way.&rdquo; In verse 5 Thomas said to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, we do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?&rdquo; We should note that these two verses speak of the words <em>where</em> and <em>way.</em> According to verse 6, Jesus said to Thomas, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&rdquo; This verse reveals that Christ the Son is the way and that the Father is the &ldquo;where&rdquo; (destination). Therefore, both the way and the where are living persons; Christ the Son, the living person, is the way, and the Father, the living person, is the destination. Through Christ the Son we get into the Father. To take the Lord Jesus as the way means that when we walk in Jesus as the way, we arrive at the destination, which is the Father. Hence, we take Jesus as the way, and we reach the Father as the place.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(a) The Way for Man to Get into God</h2>
<p>Christ is the way for man to get into God. Since the way is a living person, the place to which the Lord brings us must also be a living person, God the Father Himself. The Lord Himself is the living way to bring man into God the Father, the living place. Although the disciples thought that both the place and the way were places, not persons, the Lord said to them, &ldquo;I am the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, Christ as the way signifies the incarnated God with all that He is and all that He has done. The Father is holy, dwelling in unapproachable light, and we are sinful. We are also involved with sin, the world, Satan, and other negative things, all of which are obstacles that make access to the Father impossible. Yet through His death on the cross, the Lord Jesus dealt with sin, the world, Satan, and other negative things, thus clearing away all the obstacles between us and God. By taking away sin, judging the world, destroying Satan, terminating the old creation, and dealing with all other negative things, Christ has cleared the path, and now He Himself becomes our way into the Father. We simply need to enter into Jesus, and He will transport us to the Father. He is the way for us to enter into the Father. The only way to go to the Father and contact Him is through the Lord Jesus. Christ, and Christ alone, is the way into the Father.</p>
<p>If we want to contact God, we simply need to say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; By calling on the name of the Lord, we are immediately taken to the Father and brought into Him to enjoy Him. We also know that God is in us, that we are in Him, and that we are one with God. This is a fact, and this is our experience. As Christians we can testify that we have God, that we enjoy God, and God enjoys us. We can enjoy God so much through the Lord Jesus as the way. The Lord has taken away sin, He has judged the world, He has destroyed Satan, and He has terminated the old creation. Now everything is clear, and there are no longer any obstacles between us and God. When we call on the Lord, we are immediately in the presence of God. We experience the fact that God is in us and that we are one with God. Then God becomes our enjoyment.</p>
<p>The way by which we enter into the Father is the crucified Jesus and resurrected Christ with His redemption (vv. 2b-3; Heb. 10:19). According to Hebrews 10:20, the Lord Jesus as our way into the Father is a new and living way: &ldquo;Which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; Ephesians 2:18 says, &ldquo;Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&rdquo; This verse indicates that through Christ as the way we have access in the Spirit unto the Father. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we have the sense that we are in the presence of God and that God is within us. Today the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit. Actually, Christ as this life-giving Spirit is the access for us to touch God and enter into Him.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son, is the way to the Father. Simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are brought by Him and in Him into the Father. When we get into Christ as the way, we arrive at the Father as our destination, because the Son is one with the Father. Therefore, to be in the Son is also to be in the Father. Once we are in Christ Jesus, there is no longer any distance between us and God. Because we are in Christ, we are immediately brought into the Father. We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can testify that this is not a mere doctrine&mdash;it is a spiritual fact. From experience we can testify that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately in the Triune God in an experiential way. The Lord Jesus is the way for us to enter into the Father.</p><h2 class="head6">(b) The Reality to Make the Way Real for Us</h2>
<p>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus also said that He is the reality. The way needs the reality; the way without the reality means vanity. Unless the Lord is our reality, He can never be our way. Apart from the Triune God, the entire universe is vanity, having no content, no reality. The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is the reality. The reality is all that God is, which becomes the person of Christ. Christ is the reality of the divine things. This reality came through Him and becomes the realization of God to us. If we were to call on a name other than that of the Lord Jesus, we would not have a way into God, because all other names are void of reality. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately on the way into God because the Lord is the embodiment of the Triune God, who is the unique reality in the universe. Therefore, when we call on the name of Jesus, we receive something real into us.</p>
 <p>The reality we receive by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus is the being and the doing of the Triune God. First, this reality is the incarnated God (1:1, 14). This reality is also the Son (8:32, 36) and the Spirit (14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:7). Hence, the reality is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Furthermore, this reality includes what the Triune God has done. The reality is whatever the Triune God has accomplished. This is the gospel (Eph. 1:13). The reality, therefore, is the very being of the Triune God and what He has done.</p>
<p>In the universe only what God is and what God does is real. This means that the reality in the universe is God&rsquo;s being and God&rsquo;s doing. God&rsquo;s being is in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and His doing is redemption. In the gospel He is everything and has done everything necessary for us to contact Him. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive this universal reality.</p>
<p>The reality is actually the way, and the way is the destination. When we get on the way, we reach the destination. This means that when we receive Jesus, we have the Father. When we receive Christ the Son as the way, we have the Father as the destination. Because Christ the Son is the embodiment of the Father, when we call on the name of the Lord, we have both the Son and the Father. This is the reality becoming the way. This is Christ the Son with what He has done becoming our way into the Father. When we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, we get on this way and we have the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(c) The Life to Bring Us the Reality</h2>
<p>In John 14:6, the Lord Jesus went on to say that He is the life. The reality needs life. If it is a dead reality, it is still vanity. It must be a living reality. The Lord Jesus is life to us. Christ as this life brings us the reality, and the reality becomes the way for us to enter into the Father. Firstly Christ is our life. Then this life brings us all the reality of the Godhead. Eventually, this reality of the Godhead is the way for us to get into the Father. When the Lord is life to us, then we have the reality. When the Lord is our reality, then we have the way for us to get into the Father. If the Lord is going to be our way, He must be our reality, and if He is going to be our reality, He must be our life. By having Him as life, we have Him as our reality, and by having Him as our reality, we have Him as our way into the Father. The Lord Himself is the way, this way is the reality, and the reality is in the life.</p>
<p>Reality is the divine life, and the divine life, which is eternal life, is the Triune God. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Triune God comes into us to be our life. Therefore, the life in 14:6 signifies the Triune God within us (Eph. 4:18; Col. 3:4a; Rom. 8:2a, 6b). When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we experience the Triune God within us as life. In other words, when we call on the Lord Jesus, we sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in us. We have something living, moving, and acting within us. This is the Triune God within us as the divine life. This life brings us the reality, and the reality is the way for us to enter into God. When we are on the way&mdash;Christ the Son, we are also at the destination&mdash;God the Father.</p>
<p>In John 14:6, the Lord Jesus clearly said, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&rdquo; Because Christ is the way, the reality, and the life, when we have Him, we have the life, the reality, and the way. Life is the divine element of the person of Christ. If we have Christ, we possess the divine element, which is His divine constitution of all the attributes of what God is. In regeneration we have received this life, and in the growth of the divine life through sanctification, renewing, and transformation, we participate in the reality of Christ, which is the way for us to enter into the Father&rsquo;s house as the Body of Christ, which is the Father&rsquo;s house that consummates the New Jerusalem.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head5">(3) The Expression of the Father Realized as the Spirit</h2>
<p>In John 14:7-26, Christ who is the Father&rsquo;s house is also revealed as the expression of the Father realized as the Spirit. This chapter unfolds that the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is dispensing Himself into His believers in Jesus Christ. In the dispensing of Himself into us, God is triune. He is one, yet He is three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Christ the Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father (vv. 7-11), and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son (vv. 17-20). In the Son the Father is expressed and seen (the Son is even called the Father&mdash;Isa. 9:6), and as the Spirit the Son is revealed and realized (2 Cor. 3:17). The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers. God the Father is hidden, God the Son is manifested among men, and God the Spirit enters into man to be his life, his life supply, and his everything. Hence, this Triune God&mdash;the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit&mdash;dispenses Himself into us to be our portion that we may enjoy Him as our everything in His Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(a) Coinhering with the Father</h2>
<p>John 14:7-11 unveils that as the expression of the Father, Christ the Son coinheres with the Father. In studying the deep truths concerning the Trinity, we may use three particular words: the verb <em>coinhere,</em> the noun <em>coinherence,</em> and the adjective <em>coinherent.</em> The Son not only coexists with the Father but also coinheres with the Father. What is the difference between coexisting and coinhering? To coexist is to exist together at the same time. To coinhere is to exist in one another, to dwell in one another. To say that the Father and the Son coexist means that They exist together, but to say that the Father and the Son coinhere means that They dwell in one another.</p>
<p>We have a word concerning this coinherence in John 14:10a: &ldquo;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?&rdquo; Here we have the mutual indwelling of the Father and the Son. In verse 11 the Lord goes on to say, &ldquo;Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me.&rdquo; The Lord says that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son. What a mystery this is! The Father dwells in the Son, and the Son dwells in the Father. When the Son was living on this earth, His living was a mutual abiding. He was abiding in the Father, and the Father was abiding in Him.</p>
<p>The New Testament says not only that Christ the Son and the Father are with each other, but also reveals that the Son and the Father coinhere. For the Son to be coinherent with the Father means that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son. John 17:21 is another verse that reveals this coinherence: &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.&rdquo; The Son and the Father coexist in the way of coinherence. This means that while they coexist, the Father exists in the Son and the Son exists in the Father.</p>
<p>It is easy to see the matter of coexistence, but it is much more difficult to realize the matter of coinherence. The coexistence of the Son and the Father means that They exist together. The coinherence of the Son and the Father means that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son. Because of this coinherence of the Father and the Son, we may say that the Father and the Son are two-one.</p>
<p>As One who coinheres with the Father, Christ the Son also works with the Father. In John 14:10, the Lord says, &ldquo;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.&rdquo; Here we see that the Son speaks and the Father works. The Son&rsquo;s speaking is the Father&rsquo;s working. Everything that the Son does is in coordination with the Father who abides and works in Him for the accomplishment of His economy. Since the Father is in the Son, when the Son speaks, the Father, who abides in the Son, does His work. The Father does His work in the Son&rsquo;s speaking because They are in one another.</p>
 <p>Since Christ the Son coinheres with the Father, to see the Son is to see the Father. The Son did not express Himself; He expressed only the Father (vv. 7-9). Christ was the Son, yet He expressed the Father. Because the Son expresses not Himself but the Father, the Son&rsquo;s expression is the Father&rsquo;s expression. Therefore, when we see the Son, we see the Father. This is proved by the exchange between the Lord Jesus and Philip in John 14. In verse 7 the Lord Jesus pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known His Father also. Then He said, &ldquo;Henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.&rdquo; However, Philip replied, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us&rdquo; (v. 8). To this the Lord Jesus answered, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?&rdquo; (v. 9). In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, for the Son is the expression of the Father. If we have seen the Son, we have seen the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son to be expressed through Him.</p>
<p>The Son&rsquo;s coinhering with the Father is not for doctrine. Rather, this coinherence is for our experience of God&rsquo;s dispensing. Christ the Son coinheres with the Father so that He with the Father may be dispensed into our being.</p><h2 class="head6">(b) Realized as the Spirit</h2>
<p>John 14:16-20 reveals that Christ as the expression of the Father is realized as the Spirit. The Father is embodied and expressed in the Son among the believers, and Christ the Son is realized as the Spirit entering into and abiding in the believers. In order to abide in us, the Lord had to be transfigured, transformed, from the flesh into the Spirit. He came in the flesh to be among us, but He had to be transfigured into the Spirit before He could come into us. How was the Lord transfigured? He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit by His death and resurrection.</p>
<p>Christ realized as the Spirit is another Comforter. In verse 16 the Lord said, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&rdquo; This verse shows that the Spirit is &ldquo;another Comforter.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;Comforter,&rdquo; <em>paracletos</em> (anglicized &ldquo;paraclete&rdquo;), means &ldquo;advocate,&rdquo; &ldquo;one alongside who takes care of our case, our affairs, and all of our needs.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;Comforter&rdquo; is the same as that for &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; in 1 John 2:1. Today we have the Lord Jesus both in the heavens as well as the Spirit within us as our Paraclete taking care of our case. The Holy Spirit, the reality of Jesus and the realization of the Lord, is such a One who is alongside us, ministering to us and taking care of all of our needs.</p>
<p>Christ realized as this Spirit, this Comforter, is the Spirit of reality. In John 14:17, the Lord said, &ldquo;Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; He is the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, are realized in the Spirit. The Spirit is the realization of what God the Father and God the Son are. God the Father is light, and God the Son is life. The reality of this life and light is just the Spirit. If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have the light of God the Father. If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have God the Son as our life. The reality of all the divine attributes of both God the Father and God the Son is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Verses 16 and 17 of John 14 also reveal that Christ is realized as the Spirit to be with us and in us. Not only does He abide with the believers (v. 16) but also in them (v. 17). As we have seen, when the Lord was in the flesh, He was only able to be among the disciples, to be with them. But after becoming the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of reality in His resurrection, He is able now to abide not only with us but also in us. It is by being the Spirit that Christ enters into us and abides in us.</p>
<p>Christ is realized as the Spirit to live with us in resurrection that we may live. This is indicated by the Lord&rsquo;s words to the disciples in verse 19: &ldquo;Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; This refers to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. When the Lord was resurrected, we were resurrected with Him. First Peter 1:3 tells us that Christ regenerated us in His resurrection. In His resurrection we were made alive together with Him. Thus, because He lives in resurrection, we also live, for we were regenerated in His resurrection. By His coming as the Spirit, He enters into us and causes us to live just as He lives. The life He lives is the resurrection life. After His resurrection, He comes to enter into us as the Spirit. So He lives and we live by Him also (Gal. 2:20). He lives by the resurrection life, and we live by Him, sharing Him as the resurrection life.</p>
<p>Christ is realized as the Spirit so that we may realize that He is in the Father, we are in Him, and He is in us. The Lord said in John 14:20, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; The day mentioned in this verse is the day of resurrection. On the day of resurrection the disciples were to know that the Lord was in the Father, that the disciples were in Him, and that He was in them. This is coinherence. As Christ is in the Father, so the disciples are also. Now where He is, there the disciples are also. He died to prepare the way that we might get into God and that God might get into us. Then by being in us and by bringing us into the Father, the Lord can build us together in the Triune God to be His eternal abode.</p><h2 class="head6">(c) Coming to Us with the Father<br />
and Making an Abode with Us</h2>
<p>As the expression of the Father realized as the Spirit, Christ comes to us with the Father and makes an abode with us (vv. 21-23). In verse 23, the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; According to this verse, the Triune God in Christ comes to the believer to make a mutual abode with him. The abode mentioned in verse 23 is one of the many abodes found in verse 2. It will be a mutual abode, in which the Triune God abides in the believers and the believers abide in Him. We should not forget that each of us is one of so many abodes in the Father&rsquo;s house. The Father and the Son take the lover of Jesus as Their abode. The Father and the Son come to the believer to make an abode with him that he and They may have an abiding place. The believer will be Their abode and They shall be his abode. This verse is the basis of 15:4-5: &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; Most Christians do not realize that the basis of 15:4-5 is 14:23, where we have the mutual abode made by the appearing of the Father and the Son as the Spirit to the believer who loves Him. In other words, this abode is prepared by the visitation of the Triune God. When the Triune God grants us a visit, His visitation makes us His abode and it makes Him our abode. Eventually, we and He, He and we, become a mutual abode. We will abide in Him, and He will abide in us. In such a situation there is no place for sin, the world, Satan, the old man, or the flesh. All such things have been chased away.</p>
<p>We have had this experience in the past. Deep within us there was a sweet appreciation toward the Lord Jesus, and we told Him that we loved Him. Then the Lord told us that since we loved Him, His commandment was that we should not do this and that. We said amen to the Lord, perhaps even with tears in our eyes. Immediately we had the sense of His manifestation within us. We were so much in His presence. At that time we had the sense that He was filling us up with Himself and that we were being drawn into Him. We were abiding in Him, and He was abiding in us. We were His abode, and He was our abode. We all have had this kind of experience, either in a deep way or in a shallow way, either for a long time or just for a few minutes. We need to have this experience all day long.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus stirs up our love, and in response we may say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You.&rdquo; The Father responds to our love for the Son, and then the Father and the Son come to us to make an abode in our spirit. Actually, the Father and the Son come to take us over, to possess us. In this way the Father and the Son settle within us to make an abode with us, that is, to build the Father&rsquo;s house. This is a great matter. The abode signifies that we human beings may and can become an abode of God. God in Christ desires, longs, to enter into us, possess us, and make us His dwelling place.</p>
 <p>From our experience we know that the Father and the Son pay us a constant visitation. In our daily life the Father and the Son often come to visit us. We may be at home, at school, or at work, but wherever we may be, the Father and the Son come to visit us to do a building work in us, making an abode which will be a mutual dwelling place for the Triune God and for us.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(d) Coming to Us as the Holy Spirit<br />
Sent by the Father in the Son&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>  Christ comes to us as the Holy Spirit sent by the Father in the Son&rsquo;s name. In verse 26 the Lord said, &ldquo;But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you.&rdquo; Here we see that the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, was to be sent by the Father in the Son&rsquo;s name. Therefore, the Holy Spirit comes not only from the Father but also by the Son. Thus, the Holy Spirit comes not only from the Father but also from the Son, and He is the reality not only of the Father but also of the Son. Hence, when we call on the name of the Son, we get the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3).</p>
<p>  The Holy Spirit is not only sent by the Father but &ldquo;from with&rdquo; the Father (John 15:26). In Greek, the preposition translated <em>from</em> is <em>para.</em> This word means &ldquo;by the side of&rdquo; and often has the meaning of &ldquo;from with.&rdquo; This is seen elsewhere in the Gospel of John, for example, in 6:46: &ldquo;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God.&rdquo; The word <em>from</em> in this verse is <em>para</em> in Greek. The sense here is &ldquo;from with.&rdquo; The Lord is not only from God but also with God. While He is from God, He is still with God (8:16, 29; 16:27). Likewise, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, is sent &ldquo;from with&rdquo; the Father. This means that the Spirit not only comes from the Father but also with the Father. When the Father sends the Spirit, He comes with the Spirit. The Comforter comes from the Father and with the Father. The Father is the source. When the Spirit comes from the source, it does not mean that He leaves the source but that He comes with the source.</p>
<p>  The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, is sent by the Father in the Son&rsquo;s name. Thus, the Holy Spirit comes in the Son&rsquo;s name to be the reality of His name. The name is the Son Himself, and the Spirit is the person, the being, of the Son. When we call on the name of the Son, we get the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). The Son came in the Father&rsquo;s name (5:43) because the Son and the Father are one (10:30). Now the Spirit will come in the Son&rsquo;s name because the Spirit and the Son also are one (2 Cor. 3:17). Because the Spirit and the Son are one, the Spirit can be sent by the Father as the Son. This interpretation strongly indicates that the Spirit is the Son. The Father&rsquo;s sending the Spirit in the Son&rsquo;s name means that the Father sent the Spirit as the Son. This is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;reaching us eventually as the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit comes in the name of the Son. When we call on the name of Jesus, the Spirit comes. The name of the Son is Jesus, and His person is the Spirit. God the Father sends the Spirit, and the Spirit comes in the name of the Son. Eventually, it is the Triune God who comes. When the Spirit comes to us, the Father also comes. The Son is also here because the Spirit comes with the Father in the name of the Son. The Father sends the Spirit from with Himself, and the Spirit comes in the name of the Son. The Spirit comes as the Son. He is the Son coming, and this Son coming is from with the Father. Therefore, when one comes, all three are present. By calling on the name of the Lord, we may enjoy and experience Christ as the expression of God realized by the Spirit so that Christ the Son would come to us with the Father and make an abode with us.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>

<h2 class="head4">b. The True Vine</h2>
<p>In John 15 we see that Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the true vine. In John 15:1 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.&rdquo; Christ the Son as the true vine with the believers as its branches is the organism of the Triune God in God&rsquo;s economy, the divine dispensing, to grow with His riches and express the divine life. As the organism of the Triune God, this vine is corporate and universal.</p>
<p>John 15 reveals not only Christ the Son as the vine but also the Father as the husbandman, the Body of Christ as the branches of the vine, and God the Spirit as the Spirit of reality. As the vine, Christ the Son is the center. The whole universe is pictured as a vineyard, and centered in this vineyard is the vine, who is the Son. God the Son is the center. Everything is centralized in Him. He, as the vine, is the center of the vineyard. God the Father is the source and founder, and Christ the Son is the center. Everything that God the Father is and has is for the center, is embodied in the center, and is expressed through the center. God the Father is expressed, manifested, and glorified through the vine. Therefore, God the Father is the source and God the Son is the center.</p>
<p>In the last two verses of this chapter the Spirit is revealed. Here God the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality. This means that the Spirit is the reality. Whatever God the Father is in the Son and whatever He has centralized in Christ the Son will be realized by the Spirit. All that God the Father is in the Son is a reality in God the Spirit. Everything centralized in the Son is revealed, testified, witnessed, and realized by the Spirit of reality. Therefore, God the Father is the source, the founder; Christ the Son is the center, the embodiment, and the manifestation; and God the Spirit is the realization, the reality. This is exceedingly profound and deep.</p>
<p>Moreover, in this revelation there is not only the Triune God but also the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is the church. In this revelation the church is likened to the branches of a vine. The branches of a vine are simply the body of the vine. If the branches are taken away from the vine, the vine will have no body. Without the branches, the vine has nothing remaining except the root and the stem. Hence, the branches are the body of the vine.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) With His Believers as the Branches</h2>
<p>As the many branches of the vine, the believers of Christ are members of the Christ of God to form the organism of the Triune God in the divine dispensing. In John 15:5 the Lord Jesus declared, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches.&rdquo; Such a statement implies that Christ and His believers are one tree. Christ and the believers, the vine with the branches, form the organism of the Triune God in the divine dispensing. The vine in John 15, therefore, is a universal vine comprising Christ and His believers as the branches. In this vine, this organism, the Triune God lives, expresses Himself, and dispenses Himself to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Christ, the infinite God, is the vine, and we are His branches. We are actually branches of the infinite God, organically one with Him. This means that we have been organically joined to the Triune God. Now we are part of God, even as the members of our bodies are parts of us. If we are in the light, we shall see that we are members of Christ, that we are part of Him.</p>
<p>We have become branches of the vine, members of the Christ of God, by the branching out of the vine. By our natural life we are not branches of the vine. On the contrary, by our fallen nature we are branches of Adam and even branches of the devil. Just as a branch is the branching out of a tree, so when we were born, we were just the branching out of Adam. As branches of Adam, we were also branches of Satan. The wonderful thing is that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, He branched out into us. This branching out has made us branches of this wonderful Christ. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s branching out has made us branches of Christ as the vine. Now as branches we are filled with Christ as life, for to be a branch in the vine means that Christ has become our life. We should not say that we do not feel that we are filled with Christ. When the Lord says, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches,&rdquo; we have to say a strong amen. Just keep saying, &ldquo;Hallelujah, I am a branch!&rdquo; We as branches of the vine will be filled with Christ.</p>
<p>No plant other than the vine can illustrate adequately the living relationship between the believers and Christ. A vine differs from a tree in that it has virtually no trunk. If you cut off the branches of a vine, there is practically nothing left, only the root. It is very significant, therefore, that the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the vine, you are the branches.&rdquo; The vine is everything to the branches. Whatever is in the vine is also in the branches. This indicates that as the vine Christ is a great enjoyment for us, the branches. From the vine and through the vine, we receive everything we need to live as branches.</p>
<p>As believers, we are branches of the vine and are good for nothing except to express the vine. All that the vine is and has is expressed through the branches. Individually, the branches are the regenerated ones. Corporately, they are the church, the Body of Christ. The branches, the believers in Christ the Son, are for the expression of the Son with the Father through fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>As branches of the vine, we need to abide in the vine, the Christ of God. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo; (vv. 4-5). Only when the branches abide in the vine can the vine be everything to them. This is the reason the Lord said concerning Himself as the vine and us as the branches, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; Our life and enjoyment are to abide in the vine. Our destiny as branches is to remain in the vine.</p>
<p>Apart from the vine, we, the branches, can do nothing. A branch of a vine cannot live by itself, for it will wither and die apart from the vine. The relationship between the branches and the vine portrays the relationship between us and the Lord Jesus. We are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing apart from Him. What we are, what we have, and what we do must be in the Lord and by the Lord in us. Therefore, it is crucial for us to abide in the Lord and for the Lord to abide in us. We should not do anything in ourselves; we should do everything by abiding in the vine. Christ as the vine is an all-inclusive portion for our daily enjoyment. Because we are branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us. Then in our experience Christ will be everything to us for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Abiding in the Christ of God is a crucial matter. Fruit-bearing depends on abiding. Our abiding depends on a clear vision that we are branches in the vine. If we are to abide in the vine, we must see the fact that we are branches in the vine. If we see that we are already in Christ, we shall be able to abide in Him. Therefore, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, show me clearly that I am a branch in the vine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once we see the fact that we are branches in the vine, we need to maintain the fellowship between us and Christ as the vine. Any insulation will separate us from the rich supply of the vine. A little disobedience, a sin, or even a sinful thought can be the insulation that separates us from the riches of the vine. First, we must see that we are branches. Then we need to maintain the fellowship between us and the Lord. Nothing should be between Him and us. From experience we know that even a small thing can separate us from the rich supply of the vine. Hence, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, let there be nothing between You and me separating me from Your rich supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As long as we abide in Christ, He will abide in us. His abiding in us depends on our abiding in Him. Our abiding is the condition of His abiding, but His abiding in us is not a condition of our abiding in Him. With us, however, because we are so fluctuating, there is the need of a condition. If we do not abide in Christ, there is no way for Him to abide in us. Although He does not change, we have many changes. We may abide in Him today and stay away from Him tomorrow. Therefore, His abiding in us depends on our abiding in Him. Our abiding in Him is the condition of His abiding in us. Thus, the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; If we do not abide in Him, we fail to meet the condition of His abiding in us. His abiding depends on our abiding. This mutual abiding will bring forth fruit.</p>
 <p>How good, how miraculous, how wonderful, and how excellent it is that we all are a part of this organism! Christ is this organism, and we are included in this organism. He is the tree, and we are the branches. As far as we, the branches, are concerned, Christ, the tree, lives to be our support, our supply, and our everything. Christ as the tree also does everything through His believers as the branches. Just as the tree needs the branches and cannot do anything apart from the branches, so today Christ as the very embodiment of the Triune God can do nothing without us. In the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;that is, growing a vine tree&mdash;without us Christ is unable to act, work, or to have any kind of activity. Without Him we can do nothing, and without us He can do nothing. We surely need Him for the purpose of our enjoying the wonderful, excellent, and marvelous divine life, and He surely needs us for the purpose of fruit-bearing, the multiplication and the enlargement of this divine tree.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) The Organism of the Triune God</h2>
<p>Christ as the true vine, with His believers as the branches, is the organism of the Triune God. As the branches of the true vine, we are the multiplication of Christ, the duplication of Christ, the spreading of Christ, and the enlargement of Christ. This multiplication, duplication, spreading, and enlargement&mdash;the true vine with its branches&mdash;is the organism of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Christ as the true vine is an organism full of life, like the tree of life (Gen. 2:9). The true vine is not an organization without life, like the tower of Babel (Gen. 11:4, 9). The tree of life is an organism, and the tower of Babel is an organization. In contrast to an organization that has no life or organs, the vine tree is an organism that has life with many organs, organic systems, and organic elements growing in it.</p>

<p>Just as our human body, as an organism, functions to contain us, express us, and take action for us, Christ as the organism of the Triune God functions to contain the Triune God and express the Triune God. Furthermore, this organism is the means by which and through which the Triune God can act and move. In particular, Christ as the vine tree is the organism of the Triune God with the divine life for the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Christ as the true vine dispenses the very Triune God into all the fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(a) The Father as the Husbandman&mdash;the Cultivator of the Soil</h2>
<p>In John 15 God the Father is revealed as the husbandman who is related to a husbandry, a plantation. This is indicated by the Lord&rsquo;s words in verse 1: &ldquo;My Father is the husbandman.&rdquo; A husbandman is the source, the originator, the founder, and the planter of a husbandry. As such, he engages in an enterprise. The universe is the enterprise of the Father. The Father has a divine plan, an eternal purpose, and He wants to fulfill the intention behind His purpose. This is what is meant by the Father&rsquo;s being the husbandman. He is the husbandman of the vineyard who plans to carry out a certain purpose. He is the source, the founder, and the first one to accomplish certain things according to His mind and purpose.</p>
<p>It is the Father&rsquo;s pleasure that all that He is and has become the riches of Christ as the vine. All that the Father is, all that the Father has, all the riches of the Father&rsquo;s divine life, and all the fullness of the Godhead are in the vine, which is the embodiment of them all. The Father as the husbandman is the source, the author, the planner, the planter, the life, the substance, the soil, the water, the air, the sunshine, and everything to the vine. Therefore, Christ the Son as the vine is the center of God&rsquo;s economy and the embodiment of all the riches of the Father. The Father, by cultivating the Son, works Himself with all of His riches into this vine, and eventually the vine expresses the Father through its branches in a corporate way. This is the Father&rsquo;s economy in the universe.</p>
 <p>In the Old Testament the children of Israel were a vine in the sight of God (Psa. 80:8; cf. Isa. 5:2; Jer. 2:21; Ezek. 19:10; 15:2). But Israel failed God as the vine because they did not give Him the opportunity to express Himself through them. Although God tried to express Himself through them, they failed Him. Eventually, the Lord Jesus came as the true vine that can fully express God. This true vine is the embodiment of God and the full manifestation of God. What God is and what God has are embodied in this true vine and are fully expressed through this true vine.</p>
<p>In the universe the Father is a husbandman, a farmer. Farming is God&rsquo;s economy! Just as a farmer&rsquo;s economy is farming, growing things, so God&rsquo;s economy is growing a vine tree, a vine with many branches. Christ is this vine; Christ is God&rsquo;s economy. This vine, including the branches, is God&rsquo;s economy. This means that His economy includes us, for we are branches of this vine. The Father is the husbandman, the farmer who cultivates the soil so that the vine may spread.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(b) The Branches Being for the Bearing of Fruit<br />
to Express the Riches of the Father&rsquo;s Life in the Divine Dispensing</h2>
<p>In John 15:2-8 we see that the branches in the vine are for the bearing of fruit to express the riches of the Father&rsquo;s life in the divine dispensing. The believers in Christ are His many branches grafted into Him, the true vine in the universe, to bear much fruit for His enlargement in His spreading, that they might express the Triune God as His organism. The vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father. With the vine we have the glorification of the Father through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing. In fruit-bearing the Father&rsquo;s life is expressed; hence, in fruit-bearing He is glorified. This is the reason the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit&rdquo; (v. 8).</p>
<p>In John 15:8 the word <em>glorify</em> means to have the intent, content, the inner life, and the inner riches released from within and expressed. The vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father, to have the intent, the content, the inner life, and the inner riches released and expressed from within. As an organism to glorify the Father, the vine and the branches express the riches of the divine life. When the vine tree bears clusters of grapes, the riches of the divine life are expressed. This expression is the glorification of the Father because the Father is the divine life.</p>
<p>The Father is the source and the substance of the vine tree. Apart from the fruit, the essence, substance, and life of the vine tree are concealed, hidden, and confined. However, the riches of the inner life of the vine are expressed in the clusters of fruit. To express the inner life in this way is to release the divine substance from within the vine. When the life of the vine is expressed through the branches in its propagation and multiplication, the Father is glorified, because what the Father is in the riches of His life is expressed in the propagation and multiplication of the vine. This is the glorification of the Father.</p>
<p>Our fruit-bearing is the glorification, the expression, of the Triune God from within. Today the Triune God is within us as our life and nature, and the expression of the life and nature of the Triune God from within us is glory. Therefore, when the divine life with its nature is expressed through us in fruit-bearing, the Father is glorified. Day by day we need to live a life that bears fruit, and in this way we glorify the Father. The more we express the divine life in fruit-bearing, the more the Father is glorified.</p>
<p>Fruit-bearing is also the overflow of the riches of the inner life. Bearing fruit is a matter of the overflow of our inner life. We need continuously to enjoy Christ as everything to us. Then we shall have an abundance of inner life. Out of this abundance of inner life there will be a flow that will reach others, penetrating into their lives. This flow will bear much fruit. This kind of fruit-bearing is the manifestation of the inner life. The inner life of the vine is the riches of all that the Father is and has. This is to be manifested by the fruit-bearing of the vine. Hence, the vine&rsquo;s fruit-bearing is to express the Father in the Son.</p><h2 class="head6">(c) Through the Spirit of Reality<br />
Whom the Son Sent from and with the Father<br />
and Who Came to Us from and with the Father</h2>
<p>According to John 15:26, the Spirit of reality whom the Son sent from and with the Father testifies concerning the Son as the vine; hence, the Spirit testifies to the branches and through the branches to the world. In 15:26-27 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me; and you testify also, because from the beginning you have been with Me.&rdquo; This indicates that the Holy Spirit is the reality of all things, and we are to be witnesses of the Spirit of reality.</p>
<p>In these verses the Lord said that He would send to the disciples the Spirit of reality. But in 14:26 the Lord said that the Father would send the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, in the Son&rsquo;s name. The Lord has two different ways of speaking about the same thing. First, in 14:26, He says that the Father will send the Spirit; now in 15:26, He says that the Lord Himself will send the Spirit. Then who sent the Spirit&mdash;the Father or the Son? We must say that the Spirit was sent by both the Father and the Son. The Father and the Son are one. The Father&rsquo;s sending is the Son&rsquo;s sending, and the Son&rsquo;s sending is the Father&rsquo;s sending. The two are one. Regardless of who it is who sends the Spirit, the Spirit is always sent with the Father and in the name of the Son. Once again we see the Triune God. When the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father in the Son&rsquo;s name. So all three of the Godhead are here.</p>
<p>In verse 26 the Lord said that He would send the Comforter from the Father. The Greek preposition translated <em>from</em> in this verse is <em>para.</em> The sense of this preposition in Greek here is &ldquo;from with.&rdquo; The Spirit of reality is sent by the Son, not only from the Father but also with the Father. The Comforter comes from the Father and with the Father. The Father is the source. When the Spirit comes from the source, He does not leave the source but comes with the source. This Spirit, sent by the Son coming with the Father, will testify concerning the Son. Therefore, His testimony concerning the Son is a matter of the Triune God.</p>
<p>This Spirit of reality testifies concerning the Son as the vine, testifying in front of the persecuting religion (vv. 18-25). Furthermore, the Spirit testifies to the branches and through the branches to the world. Religion may persecute, but the Spirit of reality testifies that the Son is the vine. Through the believers as the branches this testimony will go forth throughout the whole world.</p>
<p>The Father is the source of the vine, the Son is the vine, and the Spirit is the life-juice of the vine. This great vine is the organism of the Triune God. All that the Father is, is in this organism, embodied in the vine, which is the second of the Trinity. Within the vine is the circulating life flow of the Spirit. It is the Spirit who carries the riches of the Father to sustain the vine and its branches. This vine into which we have been grafted is the organism of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Christ the Son is the vine, and we are the branches to bear fruit for the glorification of the Father, that is, the expression, spreading, and multiplication of the Father as its source and husbandman. All that God the Father is and has is centralized and embodied in Christ the Son, and all of this is realized in the Spirit of reality. Now all of this has been wrought into us and will be expressed and testified through us. John 15 has four very important items: God the Father as the source and founder, God the Son as the center and manifestation, God the Spirit as the reality and realization, and the branches as the Body, the corporate expression. The branches are vital, for they express what God is in Christ as the Spirit. Without the branches there can be no full expression. The full expression depends upon the branches, the Body, for what God is in Christ the Son and as the Spirit will be expressed by the branches, the Body. All that God the Father is and has is in Christ the Son, all that the Son is and has is realized as the Spirit, and all that the Spirit has is in the Body, in the church, in us. In other words, God the Father as the source is embodied in God the Son as the center who is now realized as God the Spirit as the reality. All that the Spirit has is expressed in us, that is, in the branches, the church. The Triune God in Christ is expressed, manifested, and glorified in the church.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head4">c. The Newborn Child</h2>
<p>In John 16 Christ is presented to us as the newborn child.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Born in His Resurrection to Be the Firstborn Son of God</h2>
<p>In His resurrection Christ was born to be the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33). In John 16:20-21, the Lord Jesus says to the disciples, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the little child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.&rdquo; This woman is the whole group of the disciples, the child is Christ, and the birth is resurrection (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5; Rom. 1:4). According to Acts 13:33, the Lord Jesus was born, begotten, in resurrection to be the Son of God with respect to His humanity. The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, therefore, was a birth. This means that when Christ was resurrected, He was born.</p>
<p>Although Christ was already the only begotten Son of God, it was still necessary for Him to be born in resurrection as the firstborn Son of God. In eternity Christ was the only begotten Son of God, in incarnation He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, and in resurrection He had another birth to be the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29b). When Christ was born of Mary, He was born as a man, and His humanity had nothing to do with His being the only begotten Son of God. In other words, the human part of Jesus was not the Son of God. Therefore, it was necessary for this human part of Him to be born into the divine sonship through resurrection. Hence, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was a new birth for Him. In this birth the disciples were the travailing woman. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection this &ldquo;woman&rdquo; had a newborn child&mdash;the resurrected Christ as the firstborn Son of God&mdash;and she rejoiced (John 20:20). In this sense Christ was a child born in resurrection. After His resurrection He was the &ldquo;child&rdquo; with the divine life and the human nature with both divinity glorified and humanity &ldquo;sonized.&rdquo; The disciples as the mother must have been very happy at the birth of this wonderful child.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) With His Believers to Be His Many Brothers</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being the firstborn Son of God implies that He has many brothers and that He is the Firstborn among these brothers (Rom. 8:29). The birth that took place through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection involved the birth not only of an individual but of a group, a group that includes the firstborn Son and the many sons of God. This indicates that through one birth, one delivery, many sons were brought forth. This resurrection was the birth of the corporate child&mdash;the corporate new man. Thus, 1 Peter 1:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo; God regenerated us through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. We, as human beings, were all divinely sonized through His resurrection to be many sons of God to participate in His divine sonship. We are the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection. In resurrection, God begot a Son, Jesus Christ, and in resurrection God regenerated many sons. This shows us that the resurrection of Christ was a great delivery. In that same delivery the Firstborn was Christ, and this firstborn Brother had many &ldquo;twins&rdquo; to follow Him. In the unique resurrection Christ was born and we were regenerated; hence, we were His &ldquo;twins&rdquo; in the same delivery. This was a universal delivery of a corporate child, which included the Son of God as the Head and His many brothers as the Body. The firstborn Son of God is the Head, and His many brothers, sons of God, are the members of Christ. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was the one universally big delivery of Himself as the firstborn Son and the believers as His many brothers, His millions of &ldquo;twins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The birth of a new corporate child comprising Christ and His believers was the birth of the new man (Eph. 2:15). The Christ who returned in His resurrection was the newborn child to be the new man (Col. 3:10-11). The old man was created by God in Genesis 1 and 2, but the new man was born through the death and resurrection of Christ referred to in John 16. We were born into the old man, but we were regenerated into the new man. We should remember that before we were born into the old man, we had been already regenerated into the new man, since we had been regenerated before we were born according to 1 Peter 1:3. We do not need to try, struggle, or endeavor to be a new man. We are already a new man. We were a new man two thousand years ago. We should not look at ourselves. When we look at ourselves, we will see the old man and be disappointed. Rather, all of us should declare, &ldquo;I am a part of the new man through the wonderful death and resurrection of the Son of God.&rdquo; Through His resurrection He as the only begotten Son of God became the firstborn Son of God, and through His resurrection His many brothers were brought forth. Also, through His resurrection a new child was born, comprised of Christ and all His believers.</p><h2 class="head6">(a) By the Conviction of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>In resurrection Christ was born as a newborn child to be the firstborn Son of God with His believers to be His many brothers. How does this accomplished fact apply to our experience? According to John 16, it is by the work of the Spirit that we become the many brothers of Christ, the members of Christ. John 16 unveils the two categories of the work of the Spirit: the conviction of the Holy Spirit and the transmission of the Holy Spirit. The first category of the Spirit&rsquo;s work is to convict the world in the preaching of the gospel and to transfer people out of Adam into Christ (vv. 8-11); the second category of the Spirit&rsquo;s work is to edify the believers and build them up by revealing to them the Son with the fullness of the Father (vv. 12-15).</p>
<p>John 16:8-11 reveals that the Spirit works to convict the world&mdash;mankind&mdash;concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment. In verse 8 the Lord says of the Spirit, &ldquo;When He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment.&rdquo; Here to convict means to convince, to condemn, to cause people to rebuke themselves. The Spirit always convicts the world concerning the three matters of sin, righteousness, and judgment. Sin entered through Adam (Rom. 5:12), righteousness is the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin (John 8:44). We were born of sin in Adam. The only way to be freed from sin is to believe in Christ, the Son of God. If we believe in Him, He will be righteousness to us, and we shall be justified in Him (Rom. 3:24; 4:25). If we do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe in Christ the Son of God, we shall remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity (Matt. 25:41).</p>
<p>In John 16:8-11 the convicting work of the Spirit is related to three persons: Adam, Christ, and Satan. We all became fallen in Adam, but we may believe in Christ and be justified. Because Christ was accepted by God in His death, God raised Him up from the dead, and now He becomes righteousness to all who believe in Him. Satan, the source of death, has been judged and destroyed through Christ&rsquo;s death (Heb. 2:14). The three main items are related to these three persons: sin is related to Adam, righteousness is related to Christ, and judgment is related to Satan. We were born of Adam, but we have believed in Christ and have received Him as our righteousness. However, all those who do not believe in Christ will suffer the judgment of Satan. Because they remain followers of Satan, they will have the same destiny as Satan.</p>
<p>In verse 9 the Lord says that the Spirit would convict the world &ldquo;concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me.&rdquo; Here we see that for a person to perish the unique sin is to not believe in the Son (3:16). The sin here is the unwillingness to be transferred from Adam into Christ. If people wish to remain in Adam, it means that they want to remain in the old realm and not move into the new realm, which is Christ. There is no need for us to commit sin in order to perish. If we simply do not believe in the Lord Jesus, we are already qualified to perish. We may be a gentleman, but as long as we do not believe in the Lord Jesus, we are destined to perish. The unique way to escape from our sinful situation is to believe in the Lord; the unique sin that qualifies us to perish is to not believe in Him. Therefore, the key today is whether we believe or not. If we believe, we shall be transferred out of Adam into Christ. But if we do not believe, we shall perish.</p>
<p>In verse 10 the Lord said that the Spirit would convict the world &ldquo;concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father.&rdquo; This means that the Father has been fully satisfied with the Lord&rsquo;s redemptive death on the cross and has accepted Him in His resurrection. The proof that the Father is satisfied with Christ&rsquo;s redemption is that the Father resurrected Him from the dead and exalted Him to His right hand. The resurrection and ascension of Christ are the evidences proving that His redemption has satisfied God and has met all the demands and requirements of God. Therefore, He was released from death to be exalted to the heavens at the right hand of God. Now God&rsquo;s righteousness is manifested in justifying those who believe in Christ (Rom. 3:26). If sinners will believe in Christ, God will justify them, for Christ Himself will become their righteousness.</p>
<p>We are justified in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, as proved by Romans 4:25 and 10:9. Romans 4:25 says, &ldquo;Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification,&rdquo; and 10:9 says, &ldquo;That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&rdquo; According to the Scriptures, we must believe that God has raised Him from the dead, for we may believe that the Lord has died and yet not believe that He was raised from the dead. If we believe that the Lord has been raised from the dead, this surely implies our faith in His death. Everybody believes that the Lord died, but revelation is needed to believe that the Lord has been resurrected. In Him, the resurrected One, we are accepted before God. Furthermore, as the resurrected One, He is also in us to live for us the life which can be justified by God and which is always acceptable to God. Therefore, Romans 4:25 says that He was raised because of our justification. Justification includes the fact that God has resurrected Christ, accepted Him, and that He has been satisfied with His redemptive death.</p>
<p>In John 16:11 the Lord said that the Spirit would convict the world &ldquo;concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.&rdquo; We have seen that judgment is related to the devil. Satan, the devil, is the author of sin, the origin of death, the father of all sinners, and the ruler of the world. As such, judgment has been prepared for him. We must recognize that judgment is not for man but for Satan. It is not God&rsquo;s intention to judge man, because His judgment is for Satan. The lake of fire has been prepared as God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan; it was never intended for man. In Matthew 25:41 the Lord said that the King will say to some people, &ldquo;Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.&rdquo; The eternal fire has been prepared for Satan and his angels&mdash;the devil and his followers&mdash;not for human beings. But if we refuse to come out of Adam into Christ, we will share the judgment that is for Satan, because we prefer to remain as his followers.</p>
<p>Satan, the ruler of the world, has been judged in the flesh of Christ on the cross (John 12:31-33; 3:14). On the cross the Lord as the Son of Man was lifted up in the form of a serpent (3:14), that is, &ldquo;in the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3). Satan, the ruler of this world, as &ldquo;the ancient serpent&rdquo; (Rev. 12:9; 20:2) has injected himself into man&rsquo;s flesh. Through His death on the cross &ldquo;in the likeness of the flesh of sin,&rdquo; the Lord has destroyed Satan who is in the flesh (Heb. 2:14). By judging Satan in this way (John 16:11), the world which hung upon Satan was also judged. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s being lifted up judged the world and cast out its ruler, Satan.</p>
<p>When the Spirit comes, He convicts unbelievers&mdash;fallen sinners&mdash;of sin, righteousness, and judgment. Sinners, who are born in Adam, must believe in the resurrected Christ so that they may have Him as their righteousness. If they do not believe, they will be judged by God as Satan is. When the gospel is preached in a proper way, those who hear should have the desire not to remain in Adam but to be transferred into Christ. These people will then be regenerated and saved. To them the convicting Spirit will become the regenerating Spirit (3:6), the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), and the Spirit of reality, dwelling within them (John 14:17).</p>
<p>The Spirit came to us to convict us of sin, righteousness, and judgment. We repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, and escaped the judgment that is upon Satan. We have been transferred out of Adam into Christ. We have also become children of God and members of Christ. Now we can be filled and saturated with the Triune God who is dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us.</p><h2 class="head6"> (b) Through the Transmission of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>It is also through the transmission of the Holy Spirit that we become the many brothers, the members of Christ as the newborn child. As we have seen, the first category of the Spirit&rsquo;s work is to convict people, that is, to convince sinners to repent, believe, and be regenerated. But the work of the Spirit involves much more than this. The second category of the Spirit&rsquo;s work is the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s dwelling in the regenerated believers to reveal Christ, to glorify Christ, and to make Christ real in the believers (16:12-15). This is the building work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In John 16:13-15 the Lord says, &ldquo;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; According to the context, &ldquo;the reality&rdquo; in John 16:13 refers to what the Father has, what the Son has, and what the Spirit receives of the Son and of the Father. What the Father has is a reality, what the Son has is a reality, and what the Spirit receives is also a reality. What the Father has becomes the Son&rsquo;s, what the Son has is received by the Spirit, and what the Spirit receives is disclosed to us. The Father, the Son, the Spirit, and we, the believers, are all involved in this process.</p>
<p>The Father, who is the source, the origin, has many riches. All that the Father has becomes the Son&rsquo;s. The Son has the unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8). Whatever the Father has is the Son&rsquo;s, and what the Son has is received by the Spirit. Since what the Spirit receives is disclosed or transmitted to us, we become the destination. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the Divine Trinity to us. All the riches of the Triune God reach us in the Spirit. Therefore, we are the destination of the Triune God. All that the Triune God is and has has been disclosed, conveyed, transmitted, to us. Because we are organically united to the Spirit, that is, organically united to the processed Triune God, whatever He is and has now is our portion as our inheritance.</p>
<p>John 16:13-15 unveils to us the transmission of the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;into the believers. The Father as the source, the origin, has an abundance of riches. All that the Father has becomes the Son&rsquo;s. The Son not only has what the Father has; He also has all the riches in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. All that He has is in addition to what the Father has. All these riches contained in the Son are received by the Spirit, and the Spirit discloses them to us. This disclosing is a transmission of all the riches of what the processed Triune God is and has into our being. Now whatever the processed Triune God is and has is to be our element, our essence, our being. This makes the processed Triune God the very essence of our being. Thus, we all become God-men, the many brothers of Christ.</p>
<p>We must apply the transmission of the Holy Spirit to our experience. Do we have all that the Father has, all that the Son has, and all that the Spirit has received? Has the Spirit disclosed all that the Father has and all that the Son has to us in our experience? Actually, we have received everything that the Triune God is and has, but we have been too veiled to see and experience what we have received. We must know this fact in the Word and know it in our experience. We should realize that all that the Father has is the Son&rsquo;s, that all that the Son has was received by the Spirit, and that the Spirit discloses to us what He receives. The Spirit, the Son, and the Father are all ours to possess! Thus, the Triune God is within us for our daily and hourly enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) For God&rsquo;s Full Glorification</h2>
<p>Christ as the firstborn Son of God and His believers as the many sons of God were born in resurrection to be a newborn child for God&rsquo;s full glorification. The many brothers of Christ produced by the conviction and transmission of the Holy Spirit are for God&rsquo;s full glorification (Rom. 8:30b, 17b; Heb. 2:10; 1 Thes. 2:12). In particular, the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s transmission to the believers of all that the Father and the Son have is the glorifying of the Son with the Father (John 16:13-15). The work of the Spirit is not only to convict the sinners that they might believe in Christ and be transferred out of Adam into Christ; it is also to reveal Christ with the fullness of the Father to all of these transferred believers that they might be built up with all the fullness of the Godhead in order to express the Triune God and to glorify the Son with the Father.</p>
<p>  In keeping with John 16, Romans 8 reveals that the purpose of God&rsquo;s foreknowledge, predestination, and calling is to prepare and produce many brothers for His firstborn Son that they, together with God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, may be the many sons of God with the divine life and nature for the expression of God (vv. 28-29). In 8:30, Paul declares, &ldquo;Those whom He predestined, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified.&rdquo; Glorification is the step in God&rsquo;s complete salvation in which God will completely saturate our body of sin, which is of death and is mortal (7:24; 8:11; 6:6), with the glory of His life and nature according to the principle of His regenerating our spirit through the Spirit. In this way He will transfigure our body, conforming it to the resurrected, glorious body of His Son (Phil. 3:21). This is the ultimate step in God&rsquo;s complete salvation, wherein God obtains a full expression, which will ultimately be manifested in the coming age.</p>
<p>  Corresponding to John 16 and Romans 8, Hebrews 2:10 shows that the many believers as the many brothers of Christ are for God&rsquo;s full glorification: &ldquo;For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through suffering.&rdquo; The many sons here are the many brothers in Romans 8:29. The last step of God&rsquo;s great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory. Romans 8 tells us that God&rsquo;s work of grace upon us began with His foreknowing, passed through His predestination, calling, and justification, and will end with His glorification. The glorification of the sons of God will be accomplished by the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (Phil. 3:21), at which time we will be manifested with Him in glory (Col. 3:4). This is our hope (1:27). This glorification of the sons of God, as the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation, will last through the millennial kingdom and will be manifested in full for eternity in the New Jerusalem&mdash;the ultimate consummation of the new man (Rev. 21:2, 5, 11, 23).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY-EIGHT</h1>

IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(24)</h1>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Father&rsquo;s Glorification</h2>
<p>In the foregoing messages, we saw three aspects of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God: the Father&rsquo;s house (John 14), the true vine (John 15), and the newborn child (John 16). Christ is the house for God to have a mutual abiding place for His rest, satisfaction, and manifestation. Christ as the vine tree is God&rsquo;s enlargement for His multiplication, spreading, and glorification. Also, Christ is the new man to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy. In John 17 we come to the fourth aspect of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God&mdash;the Father&rsquo;s glorification.</p>
<p>The main point of the Lord&rsquo;s message in John 14 through 16 is that the Son may be glorified so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. The Father is glorified in the Son through the organism of the vine tree. As we have seen, the organism of the vine tree is for the propagating and spreading of life, that is, for the multiplication and reproduction of life, and also for the expression of the Triune God. When the Triune God is propagated, multiplied, and expressed through this organism, the Son is glorified, and in the Son&rsquo;s glorification the Father is glorified also. Thus, the Lord prayed in John 17 that He, the Son, would be glorified so that the Father also might be glorified.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s prayer was fulfilled in three stages. First, it was fulfilled in His resurrection, in that His divine element, His divine life, was released from within His humanity into His many believers (12:23-24), and His whole being, including His humanity, was brought into glory (Luke 24:26), and in that the Father&rsquo;s divine element was expressed in His resurrection and glorification. In His resurrection God answered and fulfilled His prayer (Acts 3:13-15). Second, it has been fulfilled in the church, in that as His resurrection life has been expressed through His many members, He has been glorified in them, and the Father has been glorified in Him through the church (Eph. 3:21; 1 Tim. 3:15-16). Third, it will ultimately be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem, in that He will be fully expressed in glory, and God will be glorified in Him through the holy city for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23-24).</p>
<h2 class="head5"> (1) To Be Glorified by the Father<br />
that the Father May Be Glorified in Christ</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, His ultimate intention, is to manifest, express, Himself. Glorification simply means manifestation. To be glorified is to be manifested and expressed. Just as the electricity hidden in a lamp is glorified when the electricity is manifested in a lamp that is turned on, so God is glorified when He is manifested.</p>
<p>In John 12:28 the Lord prayed, &ldquo;Father glorify Your name.&rdquo; To glorify the name of the Father is to cause the Father&rsquo;s divine element to be released and expressed. The Father&rsquo;s element, the divine life, which is eternal life, was in the incarnated Son. It was necessary for the shell of the Son&rsquo;s humanity to be broken through death so that the Father&rsquo;s element might be released and expressed in resurrection. This is the glorification of God the Father in the Son. The Father is glorified in the Son&rsquo;s glorification because in this glorification the Father is expressed.</p>
<p>In 13:31-32 the Lord also said, &ldquo;Now has the Son of Man been glorified, and God has been glorified in Him. If God has been glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and He will glorify Him immediately.&rdquo; The Father is glorified in the Son. This means that when the Son is glorified, the Father is glorified as well. For the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to have His divine element released, expressed, and multiplied through death and resurrection. In this way God the Father is glorified in the Son&rsquo;s glorification.</p>
<p>After speaking the words recorded in John 13:31 and 32, the Lord Jesus went on to give the lengthy message recorded in John 14 through 16. Actually, this message began in 13:31, which speaks of the glorification of the Son. Both the Lord&rsquo;s message in chapters fourteen through sixteen and His prayer in chapter seventeen are on the subject of glorification. In His message He spoke concerning glorification, and in His prayer He prayed concerning glorification.</p>
<p>In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&rdquo; Here we see glorification as the subject of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in chapter seventeen. The Father is to glorify the Son so that the Son may glorify the Father. This is a mutual glorification between the Son and the Father. If the Father will glorify the Son, then the Son will glorify the Father. Hence, the Son was to be glorified by the Father that the Father may be glorified in Him. Furthermore, for the Lord to be glorified is for Him to be multiplied. This means that the divine life within Him, the Father&rsquo;s life, would be multiplied and thereby be glorified.</p>
<p>Christ was God incarnate, and His flesh was a tabernacle in which God could dwell on earth (1:14). His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God&rsquo;s shekinah glory had been concealed within the tabernacle. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory (Matt. 17:1-4). But then it was concealed again in His flesh. Before the prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord indicated that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him. The Lord Jesus knew that He would pass through death so that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken to release His divine element, His divine life. He would also resurrect that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed. Then His entire being, both His divinity and His humanity, would be glorified. In this way the Father would be glorified in Him.</p>
<p>In John 17:5 the Lord Jesus went on to say in His prayer, &ldquo;And now, glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.&rdquo; This verse reveals that the Son is to be glorified along with the Father. This means that the Son is exactly the same as the Father in glorification. The Son is glorified along with the Father and with the same glory that the Father has. He had the divine glory along with the Father before the world was, in eternity past; hence, He should be glorified now with that glory along with the Father. The Lord participates in the divine glory, not separately by Himself, but along with the Father, for He and the Father are one (10:30).</p>
<p>Before His incarnation Christ as the only begotten Son of God was with the Father in glory and enjoyed this glory with the Father. But when He with this glory put on flesh through incarnation, this glory was concealed in His flesh. His humanity was a shell that covered and confined the divine life and nature, along with the divine glory, that were within Him. The divine glory, the expression of the divine life and nature, was therefore confined and concealed within the Lord&rsquo;s humanity. Outwardly, He appeared to be a Jew, even a despised Nazarene. That was the appearance of the shell of Christ&rsquo;s humanity. But within this shell the divine life, nature, and glory were concealed. Through His death and by His work in His resurrection, Christ released the divine life from within Him to produce many grains for His glorification.</p><h2 class="head6">(a) Glorified in Resurrection</h2>
<p>Christ was glorified by the Father with the divine glory in His resurrection. John 7:39b says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; Many readers of the Bible might find this verse easier to understand if <em>resurrected</em> were used instead of <em>glorified,</em> for then the verse would say, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been resurrected.&rdquo; But the verse does not say &ldquo;had not yet been resurrected&rdquo;; it says &ldquo;had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; However, <em>glorified</em> actually stands for <em>resurrected,</em> for the Lord was glorified when He was resurrected. In Luke 24:26 the Lord said of Himself, &ldquo;Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?&rdquo; This refers to His resurrection (v. 46), which brought Him into glory (1 Cor. 15:43a; Acts 3:13a, 15a). For Christ to enter into His glory, into His glorification, was for Him to enter into His resurrection. This means that He was glorified in His resurrection. His resurrection was His glorification.</p>
 <p>According to the New Testament thought, resurrection is a release in life, and this release in life is a matter of glorification. Just before He was about to be crucified, the Lord Jesus prayed not that the Father would resurrect Him but that the Father would glorify Him. The Father answered this prayer for glorification by resurrecting the Lord Jesus (Acts 3:13; Matt. 22:31-32). <em>Glorification</em> is therefore a synonym of <em>resurrection.</em> However, glorification is not for resurrection; rather, resurrection is for glorification. Resurrection is the cause, and glorification is the effect, the result.</p>
<h2 class="head6"> (b) The Father&rsquo;s Glorification in the Body of Christ&mdash;<br />
the Aggregate of His Believers</h2>
<p>We have seen how Christ the Son was glorified in His resurrection. Now by what way will the Son be glorified today so that the Father might be glorified in and through the Son? It is by the church. When the church has been regenerated, sanctified, crucified, and united with Christ in glory, then the Son of God will be expressed and manifested. The Son of God will be glorified in the oneness of the church, and the Father at that time will also be glorified in and through the Son. Therefore, the prayer, &ldquo;Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You,&rdquo; includes and depends upon the matter of the church being regenerated, sanctified, crucified, and united in oneness with the Son of God. God is glorified in Christ and in the church in the church age (Eph. 3:21). If we are not a part of the church, we will miss this glorification.</p>
<p>John was very strong to unveil the glorification of the incarnated Jesus, that is, the glorification of Christ by God with His glory. Christ was not self-glorified by His own exaltation, but He was glorified by God. In His being glorified, He as a grain of wheat passed through death unto resurrection, and that is glorification. His glorification was to produce us as many grains. He is the one grain; we are the many grains. We as the many grains are the totality, the aggregate, of Christ as the unique grain sown into the earth. When Christ was resurrected, He was glorified to produce us as His many grains to form and constitute His Body.</p>
<p>Glory is the expression of the divine life and the divine nature. If we live by the divine life and nature, we shall express the divine glory. The more the saints live by the divine life and the divine nature, the more glorious the church life is, and the more divine glory there will be in the church. When we live by the divine life with the divine nature, we express the Lord Jesus. This is the Lord&rsquo;s glorification in us, and in this glorification the Father is glorified.</p>
<p>We can boldly testify of the fact that we all have the Lord Jesus within us. But we probably do not have the boldness to say that the Lord is expressed from within us. This may be because we are so strong in ourselves that the Lord Jesus often does not have a way to be expressed through us. Our self, comparable to marble, is hard and completely opaque, thus completely covering the Lord Jesus. This is the reason we need the Lord&rsquo;s breaking. Although we may be like marble, the Lord has a way to break us. By the cross He breaks our marble self.</p>
<p>We should have the faith to believe that more and more the Lord will be expressed in us. If we give Him the way to grow in us and to come forth from within us, we shall express Him more and more. Then the churches will be filled with the divine glorification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the believers as the branches bear much fruit, the Father is glorified, for in fruit-bearing the Father&rsquo;s life, the divine life, is expressed. In John 15:8 we see that glorification is in fruit-bearing: &ldquo;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.&rdquo; According to 12:24 the one grain fell into the ground and died, rose up, and brought forth many grains. This is multiplication, and this multiplication is glorification. Hence, the many grains of wheat in 12:24 are the many branches of the vine in chapter fifteen. The branches of the vine bear fruit, and this fruit-bearing is the Father&rsquo;s glorification. The more fruit we bear, the more God is glorified in our Christian work.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Through the Organic Union of Christ&rsquo;s Believers<br />
with the Father in Christ in Oneness</h2>
<p>The Father is glorified through the organic union of Christ&rsquo;s believers with the Father in the Son in oneness (17:23). In John 15 the fact of our being in Christ and Christ being in us is clearly revealed (vv. 4-5). But in John 17 the Lord prayed for our realization of this fact (vv. 20-21). He prayed so that we would realize that we are in Him just as He is in the Father, and He is in us just as the Father is in Him. With the Divine Trinity there is such a wonderful coinhering oneness. This coinhering oneness has been duplicated by Christ with His believers. Today Christ is in His believers, causing His believers to be in Him. This is like the Father being in the Son, causing the Son to be in the Father. The prayer of Christ in John 17 is a revelation of such a coinhering oneness.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s prayer was for the glorification of the Son that the Father might be glorified as the Son glorified the Father in His earthly living and ministry (vv. 1b, 4-5). This traffic of glorification, where the Son prayed asking the Father to glorify the Son that the Son may glorify the Father, is based on the believers&rsquo; oneness (vv. 2-3, 6-23a). If we are not one, the Son cannot be glorified, and the Father cannot be glorified by the Son. When we are one, Christ is glorified. When Christ is glorified, God the Father is glorified in Christ the Son&rsquo;s glorification.</p>
<p>The oneness of the believers is by the Father&rsquo;s eternal life conveyed in the Father&rsquo;s name and in the Father&rsquo;s word (vv. 2-3, 6-12). Our oneness is also by the Father&rsquo;s sanctifying word as the truth&mdash;the divine reality&mdash;through the coinhering of the Triune God and the believers (vv. 13-21). The sanctifying God is in us, and we are in the sanctifying God; therefore, we are spontaneously sanctified.</p>
<p>The oneness of the believers is also by the glory given to the believers by Christ the Son through the coinhering of the Triune God incorporated with the believers. In John 17:22-23 the Son prayed to the Father: &ldquo;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.&rdquo; The believers can be one as the three of the Trinity are one. The Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the disciples all coinhere. This is the glory. In this coinhering, Christ is glorified, and the Father is glorified.</p>
<p>The oneness revealed in chapter seventeen is for the Father&rsquo;s glorification in the Son. This oneness is actually the divine glorification. The Son is glorified in the church, and the Father is glorified in the Son. In chapters fourteen through seventeen we see five main things: the Father&rsquo;s house, the vine, the new man, the divine glorification, and the oneness. Actually, all of these five things are one. This is the unique subject of the Lord&rsquo;s message in chapters fourteen through sixteen, and it is the main point of His prayer in chapter seventeen. The oneness is the glorification, the glorification is the new man, the new man is the vine, and the vine is the Father&rsquo;s house. The glorification for which the Lord prayed is actually the divine mingling with humanity, and this mingling is the marvelous oneness revealed in chapter seventeen. This oneness is safeguarded in the name of the Father, in the Triune God, and in the glorious expression of the Triune God. This is the central point of the revelation of the New Testament.</p>
<p>In John 17 the Lord prayed that the Father would glorify the Son so that the Son might glorify Him. To glorify the Son is actually to build the Father&rsquo;s house. Hence, glorification is the building. Furthermore, the building is the cultivation of the vine. The vine tree comes into being through the birth of the new man. When the new man was born, the vine with all its branches came into being. Now the vine is growing and spreading, and this spreading is the divine glorification. Therefore, the glorification of the Son is for the glorification of the Father, and the glorification is the building of the Father&rsquo;s house, the spreading of the vine, and the growth is the new man.</p>
<p>In the divine glorification the Triune God is glorified in humanity, and humanity is glorified in divinity. One day the Lord Jesus will come in a physical manifestation of glory, and we shall be brought into that glory. Then there will be glorification upon glorification and glorification within glorification. Eventually, there will be the ultimate consummation&mdash;the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:10-11). The New Jerusalem will be the completion of the new man, the consummation of the vine, and the full building of the Father&rsquo;s house. May we all see that the Father&rsquo;s house, the vine, the new man, and the glorification are all one thing&mdash;Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God for our experience and enjoyment.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(25)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">66. The Redeeming and Life-imparting One</h2>
<p>In this message we will cover further aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Gospel of John. In John 19:34 we see that Christ is the redeeming and life-imparting One. The experience and enjoyment of Christ as the redeeming and life-imparting One is based upon the two aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s death: the redemptive aspect signified by the blood and the life-imparting aspect signified by the water in John 19:34. This verse says, &ldquo;One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.&rdquo; Two substances came out of the Lord&rsquo;s pierced side: blood and water. Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins (1:29; Heb. 9:22) for the purchasing of the church (Acts 20:28). Water is for imparting life, to deal with death (John 12:24; 3:14-15) for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-30). The Lord&rsquo;s death, on the negative side, takes away our sins and, on the positive side, imparts life into us.</p>
<p>We sinners became fallen and as a result were against God&rsquo;s righteousness and estranged from God&rsquo;s life (Gen. 3:24; Eph. 4:18). As sinners, we need to be redeemed judicially from God&rsquo;s condemnation according to the righteous requirement of His law (Gal. 3:13) and to be saved organically by His life from the death brought in by sin (2 Tim. 1:10; Rom. 5:10, 12, 17, 21). Christ, as the Redeemer and Savior of fallen man, redeems and saves us through His death and resurrection. In His crucifixion, after He was pierced by a soldier, blood and water, two elements which are critical to human life, came out of Him (John 19:34). Blood is to wash away our sins for redemption, and water is to dispense the divine life into us for life impartation. All the negative things have been dealt with, and God has been dispensed into us as the eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Redeeming One</h2>
<p>Christ is the redeeming One who shed His blood for redemption as the Lamb of God (1:29, 36). Speaking of the Lord Jesus, John declared, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&rdquo; (v. 29). The blood which flowed out of the Lord&rsquo;s side was for redemption (Heb. 9:22; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; Rom. 3:25); this was typified by the blood of the passover lamb (Exo. 12:7, 22; Rev. 12:11). As Zechariah 13:1 indicates, this redeeming blood formed a fountain for the washing of sins. The blood which flowed out was also the price of the purchase of the church (Acts 20:28).</p>
<p>The blood of Christ is for God&rsquo;s judicial redemption in His redeeming the believers (Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18-19), forgiving the believers&rsquo; sins (Heb. 9:22), and washing away their sins (1:3). The blood of Christ is also for God to justify the believers (Rom. 3:24; 5:9) and sanctify them positionally (Heb. 13:12; 10:29). This blood speaks something better for the New Testament believers before God (12:24). By the blood of Christ, the Lamb, we can overcome Satan, the accuser of the believers (Rev. 12:11). Thus, it is the precious blood of Christ (1 Pet. 1:19).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Life-imparting One</h2>
<p>Christ is the life-imparting One who as the life-giving Spirit released His divine life signified by the water (1 Cor. 15:45b). As previously mentioned, that blood and water came out of the Lord&rsquo;s pierced side indicates that His death has two aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect. The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect, which is even more wonderful than the redemptive aspect. God&rsquo;s purpose is that redemption be followed by the imparting of life, for God&rsquo;s intention is to dispense Himself into us as life. Therefore, redemption prepares the way for the release of the divine life so that this life may be dispensed into us for the producing of the church.</p>
<p>The death of Christ that imparts life released the Lord&rsquo;s divine life from within Him for the producing of the church, which is composed of all His believers, into whom His divine life has been imparted. This life-imparting death of the Lord&rsquo;s is typified by Adam&rsquo;s sleep, out from which Eve was produced (Gen. 2:21-23), and is signified by the death of the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground for the bringing forth of many grains (John 12:24) to make the one bread&mdash;the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). Hence, it is the life-releasing, life-propagating, life-multiplying death, the generating and reproducing death.</p>
<p>Through His death on the cross Christ&rsquo;s divine life was released. Hence, His death was a life-releasing death. Because His divine life has not only been released out of Him but also imparted into us, His death was a life-imparting death. On His side it was a life-releasing death; on our side it is a life-imparting death. Moreover, it is a life-propagating death, for by it life is spread in many directions. Furthermore, it is a life-multiplying death, causing the multiplication of life. It is also a life-producing death, for the one grain has been reproduced in the many grains.</p>
<p>Water, signifying the divine life, is for God&rsquo;s organic salvation. The Lord promises to give the sinners the water of life (John 4:10, 14; Rev. 21:6). Also, the Lord calls the sinners to come and drink His water of life (22:17; John 7:37-38). We were regenerated by God with His divine life (1 Pet. 1:3). This divine life saves us (Rom. 5:10b). It dispositionally sanctifies (6:19, 22), renews (12:2b; Titus 3:5), transforms (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18), conforms (Rom. 8:29), and glorifies us (8:30). We reign in it (5:17). We become kings by this divine life. We also grow with it for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:15-16). We all have to grow into the Head, Christ. Then out from Him we have something of the divine life to minister to the Body for its building up. This consummates the New Jerusalem, which is wholly supplied with the river of water of life and with the tree of life (Rev. 21:2; 22:1-2). The river of water of life signifies the Spirit of life, and the tree of life signifies Christ as the embodiment of the divine life. Both are for the supply of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s pierced side was prefigured by Adam&rsquo;s opened side, out from which Eve was produced (Gen. 2:21-23). The blood was typified by the blood of the passover lamb (Exo. 12:7, 22; Rev. 12:11), and the water was typified by the water that flowed out of the smitten rock (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). The blood is for redemption, forming a &ldquo;fountain&rdquo; in which we may be cleansed (Zech. 13:1), and the water is for regeneration, forming &ldquo;the fountain of life&rdquo; from which we may drink at any time (Psa. 36:9; Rev. 21:6). Outwardly we have been washed, and inwardly we have been filled with this divine life.</p>
<p>In short, the blood is for redemption, and the water is for imparting life. We need the blood to wash away our sins, and we need the water as the flow of the divine life to germinate us, to bring the divine life into our being, that we may have the life power to overcome so many things. His blood saves us from the guilt of sin, and His life saves us from the power of sin. As the redeeming One, Christ washes away our filthiness; as the life-imparting One, He keeps away our death.</p><h2 class="head3">67. The Resurrected One</h2>
<p>In John 20 Christ is revealed as the resurrected One who brought His believers into God the Father and breathed the Holy Spirit into His believers.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Bringing His Believers into God the Father</h2>
<p>Christ, as the resurrected One, brings His believers into God the Father, making His Father their Father and His God their God, and making them His brothers. In 20:17, after resurrection early in the morning, the Lord Jesus told Mary, &ldquo;Go to My brothers.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word to Mary indicated that in resurrection His disciples had become the same as He insofar as they also were sons of God. Previously, the most intimate term the Lord used in reference to His disciples was <em>friends</em> (15:14-15). But after His resurrection He began to call them brothers, for through His resurrection His disciples were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3) with the divine life, which had been released by His life-imparting death, as indicated in 12:24. It was through His resurrection that the Lord imparted Himself as the Spirit into His disciples. By receiving His life they were reborn, regenerated, and became His brothers, having the same life as the Lord. He was the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died and grew up to bring forth many grains for the producing of the one bread, which is His Body (1 Cor. 10:17). He was the Father&rsquo;s only Son, the Father&rsquo;s individual expression. Through His death and resurrection the Father&rsquo;s only Begotten became the Firstborn among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). His many brothers are the many sons of God and are the church (Heb. 2:10-12), a corporate expression of God the Father in the Son. This is God&rsquo;s ultimate intention. The many brothers are the propagation of the Father&rsquo;s life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life. Hence, in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is fulfilled.</p>
<p>In John 20:17 the Lord Jesus also said to Mary, &ldquo;I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.&rdquo; Through His life-imparting death and resurrection, the Lord made His disciples one with Him. Therefore, His Father is the Father of His disciples, and His God is the God of His disciples. In His resurrection they have the Father&rsquo;s life and God&rsquo;s divine nature, just as He has. In making them His brothers, He has imparted the Father&rsquo;s life and God&rsquo;s divine nature into them. By making His Father and His God theirs, He has brought them into His position&mdash;the position of the Son&mdash;before the Father and God. Thus, in life and nature inwardly and in position outwardly they are the same as the Lord, with whom they have been united.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Breathing the Holy Spirit into His Believers</h2>
<p>Christ as the resurrected One also breathed the Holy Spirit into His believers, as the pneumatic Christ&mdash;the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Through this process He entered into His believers to be with them forever (John 14:16-20). John 20:22 says, &ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit here is actually the resurrected Christ Himself because the Spirit is His breath. The Holy Spirit is thus the breath of the Son. The Greek word for <em>Spirit</em> in this verse is <em>pneuma,</em> a word that is used for breath, spirit, and wind. Therefore, this verse can be translated, &ldquo;Receive the holy breath.&rdquo; On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath.</p>
<p>The Christ who breathed Himself into the disciples is the life-giving Spirit, and the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is breath. Some theologians use the term &ldquo;the pneumatic Christ&rdquo; to refer to the Christ who is the Spirit, the breath. After the Lord Jesus accomplished all of His processes, He became the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ. Such a One, the pneumatic Christ as the Spirit, came to His disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them. From that time onward, He was truly one with His disciples, for He became the intrinsic being of His disciples essentially. In John 20:22 the resurrected Christ, the pneumatic Christ, Christ as the Spirit, entered into His believers to be the divine essence of their spiritual life and being.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John reveals that Christ is the Word, the eternal God (1:1) who passed through a long process eventually to become the breath, the <em>pneuma,</em> that He might enter into the believers. For the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, He took two steps. First, He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh (v. 14), to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for man (v. 29), to declare God to man (v. 18), and to manifest the Father to His believers (14:9-11). Second, He took the step of death and resurrection to be transfigured into the Spirit that He might impart Himself into His believers as their life and their everything for the building up of His Body, the church, the habitation of God, to express the Triune God for eternity. The Gospel of John clearly reveals that Christ became flesh to be the Lamb of God and that in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Thus, in the evening of the day of His resurrection He came and breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit in John 20:22 is the Spirit expected in 7:39 and promised in 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; and 16:7-8, 13. This indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter (14:16). Then in chapter twenty He brought to His disciples this other Comforter, the Spirit of reality. Now the Spirit of reality has come to the disciples to be within them; now the disciples know that the Lord Jesus is in the Father and that the Father is in the Lord; now they are in the Lord and the Lord is in them. They realize that they are now one with the Triune God. Therefore, all that the Lord Jesus spoke to them in chapters fourteen through sixteen is fulfilled at this very moment. This fulfillment is that the Lord Jesus went through death and resurrection and came to the disciples as the Spirit, coming as another Comforter to be their reality that they might be one with the Triune God.</p>
 <p>As the falling into the ground to die and the growing out of the ground transforms a grain of wheat into another new and lively form, so the death and resurrection of Christ transfigured Him from the flesh into the Spirit. As the last Adam in the flesh He became the life-giving Spirit through the process of death and resurrection. As He is the embodiment of the Father, so the Spirit is the realization, the reality, of Him. It is as the Spirit that He was breathed into the disciples. It is as the Spirit that He was received into His believers and flowed out of them as rivers of living water (7:38-39). It is as the Spirit that through His death and resurrection He came back to the disciples, entered into them as their Comforter, and began to abide in them (14:16-17). It is as the Spirit that He can live in the disciples and they can live by Him and with Him (v. 19). It is also as the Spirit that He can abide in the disciples and they can abide in Him (v. 20; 15:4-5). It is as the Spirit that He can come with the Father to the one who loves Him and make an abode with him (14:23). It is as the Spirit that He came to meet with His brothers as the church to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to them and to praise Him in their midst (Heb. 2:11-12). And it is as the Spirit that He can send His disciples with His commission, with Himself as life and everything to them, in the same way that the Father sent Him (John 20:21).</p><h2 class="head3">68. The Chief Shepherd</h2>
<p>In John 21:15-22 Christ is unveiled as the Chief Shepherd. In resurrection Christ worked and walked with the believers as the Chief Shepherd to build up the church by shepherding His flock (1 Pet. 5:4). As the great Shepherd in resurrection (Heb. 13:20), the Lord charged His disciples to feed and shepherd His lambs and sheep at the cost of their life and to glorify God by following His pattern of laying down His soul-life for the sheep (John 21:19b-22; 10:11, 15b).</p>
<p>As the Head, Christ is the Chief Shepherd (1 Pet.5:4), and in resurrection He is the great Shepherd of the sheep (Heb. 13:20). Actually, we are not the ones shepherding. When we shepherd, it should be Christ shepherding through us. If we shepherd people apart from Christ, this is not in resurrection but in the old creation. When Christ shepherds through us, our labor is in resurrection. Only Christ is resurrection. Whatever is divine is resurrection. We have to learn to shepherd people not by ourselves in the old creation but by Christ as the shepherding Chief in resurrection.</p>
<p>According to John 21:15-17, after restoring Peter&rsquo;s love toward Him, the Lord Jesus charged him, saying, &ldquo;Feed My lambs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shepherd My sheep,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Feed My sheep.&rdquo; Here, to feed the lambs is to nourish them with the riches of the inner life. To feed others, we need to enjoy the riches of the Lord&rsquo;s divine life. This requires that we love Him. To believe in the Lord is to receive Him; to love the Lord is to enjoy Him. The Lord came as life and the life supply to us. We need to have faith in Him and love toward Him. This Gospel presents these as the two requirements for us to participate in the Lord.</p>
<p>Lamb-feeding is by the nourishing with the riches of the inner life, and sheep-shepherding is for the building up of the church. Shepherding is for the &ldquo;flock&rdquo; (10:14, 16), which is the church (Acts 20:28); therefore, it is related to God&rsquo;s building (Matt. 16:18). Later, in his first Epistle, Peter indicated this by saying that growth, by feeding on the guileless milk of the Word, is for the building of God&rsquo;s house (1 Pet. 2:2-5). He also indicated that shepherding is for God&rsquo;s building by charging the elders to shepherd the flock of God (5:1-4). The growth by nourishing is for the building. The Lord is still working with His disciples in this way. Today by lamb-feeding and sheep-shepherding, the Lord is working with us for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>By considering three chapters&mdash;John 10, and 1 Peter 2 and 5&mdash;we shall see that feeding the lambs and shepherding the sheep are for the building up of the church. According to John 10, the Lord laid down His soul-life that His sheep might have His divine life and be brought together as one flock. To bring all His sheep together as one is truly the building. In 1 Peter 2, Peter says that we, as newborn babes, must be fed with the guileless milk of the Word that we might grow up to be built up together as a spiritual house. Finally, in 1 Peter 5, Peter, as one of the elders, charges the elders to care for the sheep by feeding and shepherding them. Feeding the sheep is different from shepherding them. In John 21:15 the Lord said, &ldquo;Feed My lambs&rdquo;; in 21:16 He said, &ldquo;Shepherd My sheep&rdquo;; and in 21:17 He said, &ldquo;Feed My sheep.&rdquo; To shepherd means to take care of the sheep, and to feed means to supply food to the sheep. While we are serving the Lord today, we must not only care for His sheep but also feed them with spiritual food. It is not sufficient simply to care for and to look after the brothers and sisters; we must also feed them. In verse 15 the Lord said, &ldquo;Feed My lambs,&rdquo; and in verse 17 He said, &ldquo;Feed My sheep.&rdquo; By this we see that both the young believers and the more matured believers need the feeding. If the Lord has committed to us the burden of His flock, we must be sure to do two things&mdash;to feed them and to care for them.</p>
<p>After restoring Peter&rsquo;s love for Him and charging him with lamb-feeding and sheep-shepherding, the Lord, by predicting Peter&rsquo;s martyrdom, instructed the disciples to follow Him to death. In verse 18 the Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.&rdquo; In saying this to Peter, the Lord was &ldquo;signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God&rdquo; (v. 19a). After predicting Peter&rsquo;s martyrdom, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; (v. 19b). We all must follow the Lord as the good Shepherd who laid down His life for the sheep (10:11, 15b). Our following Him even unto death is to glorify God (21:19). This shows us that after we have been regenerated and commissioned by the Lord, we must love the Lord at any cost and follow Him to the end at any sacrifice. By following the Lord&rsquo;s pattern of laying down His life for the sheep, we shall accomplish the Lord&rsquo;s purpose to feed His lambs and to feed and shepherd His sheep.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED NINETY</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(26)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">II. IN ACTS</h2>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Acts.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Experiencing and Enjoying Him as:</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The One in Resurrection</h2>
<p>Christ today is in resurrection. One day, as the One who existed in eternity, Christ became a man by incarnation. Eventually, He was crucified and buried. Through death He entered into another realm, the realm of resurrection. In His preexistence, Christ was God and was with God in eternity; by incarnation, He became a man in the flesh; then, through crucifixion and burial, He entered into resurrection. On the day of His resurrection angels told the women that Christ could not be found in the tomb, for He had risen from the dead (Luke 24:1-6). This indicates that Christ is in resurrection.</p>
<p>Christ is now our Savior in resurrection, and the Spirit is Christ in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b). After Christ was resurrected, He became a person wholly in resurrection. Today some Christians know Christ in His incarnation and crucifixion. But like Paul we should aspire not only to know Christ in His death but even the more to know Him in His resurrection (Phil. 3:10). We need to know Him in the power, sphere, and element of His resurrection.</p>
<p>In Acts 1:3 we see Christ as the One in resurrection appearing to the disciples and speaking to them the things concerning the kingdom of God: &ldquo;To whom also He presented Himself alive after His suffering by many irrefutable proofs, appearing to them through a period of forty days and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Appearing to the Disciples</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s presenting Himself alive was for the purpose of training the disciples to practice and enjoy His invisible presence. In the Gospel of John there is no word or hint indicating that the Lord left the disciples after breathing Himself into them. Actually He stayed with them, although they were unconscious of His presence. The Lord&rsquo;s further appearing to them was His manifestation. Before His death the Lord&rsquo;s presence was visible in the flesh. After His resurrection His presence was invisible in the Spirit. His manifestations, or appearings, after His resurrection were to train the disciples to realize, enjoy, and practice His invisible presence, which is more available, prevailing, precious, rich, and real than His visible presence. The Lord&rsquo;s invisible presence is just the Spirit in His resurrection, whom He breathed into the disciples and who would be with them all the time.</p>
<p>After the Lord breathed Himself into the disciples, He never left them essentially. However, economically He would appear and then disappear. The Lord appeared and disappeared economically in order to train the disciples. Regarding this we should not speak of His going and coming but of His appearing and disappearing. The disciples had become accustomed to the visible presence of Christ. For three and a half years He had been with them visibly in the flesh. Suddenly His visible presence was taken away. Then the Lord came back to the disciples to breathe Himself into them. From that time onward the Lord&rsquo;s presence with the disciples became invisible. It was no longer a physical presence but a spiritual presence. From the time that He breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples on the day of His resurrection, the resurrected Christ dwelt in them. His appearing spoken of in Acts 1:3 does not mean that He had ever left the disciples. Rather, it means that He made His presence visible to them, training them to realize and continually enjoy His invisible presence.</p>
<p>Although the Lord&rsquo;s spiritual presence is invisible, it is more real and vital than His visible presence. The Lord&rsquo;s visible presence involved the elements of space and time. But with His invisible presence there is neither the element of space nor the element of time. His invisible presence is everywhere. Wherever we are, the Lord&rsquo;s invisible presence is with us. Actually, His invisible presence is not merely with us&mdash;it is within us. When the Lord was with the disciples in the flesh, His presence with them was outward and visible. But after He breathed Himself into them as the life-giving Spirit, His presence became inward and invisible.</p>
 <p>Through such an invisible presence, this invisible Christ became His disciples&rsquo; element and essence. He was one with His disciples intrinsically and essentially, but the disciples were not used to such an invisible presence. They were used to visible things. Because of their weakness, He appeared to them and disappeared in order to train them to realize His invisible presence. He wanted them to know that even though they did not see Him or feel His presence, He was still with them all the time (Matt. 28:20). His presence was always there inside their being; it even became their intrinsic essence and their thought. In Galatians 2:20 the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; This is the invisible presence of the pneumatic Christ.</p>
<p>In these forty days, the Lord trained the disciples to know their new being, to know that His essence had become their essence. He trained them to know that He had become them, that He had entered into them, and that He had brought them into Him. He also trained them to realize that He was in the Father, that they were in Him, and that He was in them (John 14:20). Ultimately, this kind of training was to help the disciples realize that they were mingled with the Triune God, that they were no longer merely human but divinely human, even &ldquo;Jesusly&rdquo; human. They were no longer separate from the Triune God, but they could now live a life in which they were one with the processed Triune God. They were no longer merely men, but God-men, divine men, with the Triune God as their intrinsic essence to become their divine being. The Lord was training them to live and behave in this life and to be persons in this life, the divine persons on this earth. The Lord created the entire universe in six days, but He spent forty days to train the disciples. The training of the disciples was a much bigger task than the creation of the universe.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples for a period of forty days. In the Bible forty days are a period of trial and testing (Deut. 9:9, 18; 1 Kings 19:8). When the Lord Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil, He fasted forty days and forty nights (Matt. 4:1-2). Also, the children of Israel were tested, educated, by God in the wilderness for forty years. Forty, therefore, is the number of testing, proving, trying, and educating. In Acts 1 the Lord appeared and disappeared during a period of forty days in order to test and train His disciples.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Speaking to Them<br />
the Things concerning the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>During these forty days, Christ as the One in resurrection also spoke to the disciples the things concerning the kingdom of God. Although we are not told in Acts what the Lord spoke concerning the kingdom, we may infer what He said by considering other portions of the Word. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus taught the disciples much concerning the kingdom. It is not likely that during the forty days after His resurrection, He gave the disciples something new concerning the kingdom. Rather, He may have repeated what He taught them in the Gospels. When the Lord spoke regarding the kingdom in the Gospels, the disciples were not able to understand what He was teaching them. They did not have the spiritual insight to understand the kingdom of God, because the Lord was not yet in them. But in John 20 they received the wonderful person of the resurrected Christ into them as the life-giving Spirit. As a result, in Acts 1 they were very different, for Christ, the life-giving Spirit, was now within them as their life and person. Because they had the life-giving Spirit within them, they were able to understand the Lord&rsquo;s speaking concerning the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God is not a material kingdom visible to human sight; it is a kingdom of the divine life. The kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life into His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life. The kingdom of God is the ruling, the reigning, of God with all its blessing and enjoyment. It is the goal of the gospel of God and of Jesus Christ. To enter into this kingdom, people need to repent of their sins and believe in the gospel (Mark 1:15) so that their sins may be forgiven and that they may be regenerated by God to have the divine life, which matches the divine nature of this kingdom (John 3:3, 5).</p>
 <p>The kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself (Luke 17:21) as the seed of life sown into His believers, God&rsquo;s chosen people (Mark 4:3, 26), and developing into a realm in which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life. Regeneration is its entrance (John 3:5), and the growth of the divine life within the believers is its development (2 Pet. 1:3-11). The kingdom of God is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live (Rom. 14:17), and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward (Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5) to the overcoming saints in the millennium. Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God and the eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God&rsquo;s eternal life for all God&rsquo;s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<p>In Acts 1:3 the Lord Jesus as the One in resurrection must have helped the disciples to have such a proper realization concerning the kingdom of God. The disciples must have begun to see that the kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life to His believers, that it is the propagation of Christ as life to His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life. The disciples certainly must have understood that they were now part of the propagation, the spreading, of Christ, and thereby were part of the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The One in Ascension</h2>
<p>After the resurrected Lord finished the forty-day training, He had the peace to leave the disciples. Thus, He brought them all to the Mount of Olives where He was carried up into heaven (vv. 11-12). His ascension brought Him into a new stage&mdash;the stage of a resurrected man living in the heavens to execute the things God determined on this earth. This resurrected One is now sitting in the heavens to execute God&rsquo;s administration (2:36; Heb. 12:2).</p>
<p>After the resurrected Christ breathed the life-giving Spirit into the disciples as life, life supply, and everything related to their inner man, they all became God-men, men who had been mingled with God. They were filled with the divine life essentially, but they were not yet qualified to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. Therefore, the resurrected Christ had to ascend to the heavens to be exalted by God and to be given the kingship, the lordship, and the headship over all things. He also obtained the throne, the glory, and all the authority in the universe. While the one hundred twenty were praying on the earth for ten days, God was making the exalted Christ to be the King, the Lord, and the Head of all things. God was giving the authority, the throne, and glory to His exalted One&mdash;Christ as the One in ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Pouring Out the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>As the One in ascension, Christ poured out the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:33) upon all flesh (2:17a) to baptize all His believers into one Body (1:5; 1 Cor. 12:13). In Acts 2:33 Peter declared, &ldquo;Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear.&rdquo; The exalted Christ&rsquo;s receiving of the promise of the Holy Spirit was actually the receiving of the Holy Spirit Himself. Christ was conceived of the Spirit essentially for His being in humanity, and He was anointed with the Spirit economically for His ministry among men. After His resurrection and ascension, He still needed to receive the Spirit economically again so that He might pour out this Spirit upon His Body to carry out on earth His heavenly ministry for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The same Spirit who was breathed into the believers essentially as life in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was poured out upon them economically by Christ in His ascension. In and after His ascension Christ received the all-inclusive Spirit from the Father economically and poured Him out upon the believers for their ministry and work.</p>
 <p>Christ poured out the Holy Spirit upon all flesh, that is, all fallen human beings, without distinction of sex, age, or status, in order to baptize all His believers into one Body (2:17a; 1:5). It was through the Spirit that Christ as the Head of the Body baptized all His believers into His Body (Matt. 3:11; Acts 1:5; 11:15-16; 1 Cor. 12:13). The New Testament reveals that Christ is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit (Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16; John 1:33). Concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit, the Lord Jesus said in Acts 1:5, &ldquo;John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&rdquo; This was accomplished in two steps, in two instances. First, on the day of Pentecost, Christ, the Head of the Body, having received the Spirit economically once again in ascension, baptized the Jewish believers into the Spirit. That was the first step, the first instance, of Christ baptizing the Body into the Spirit. Then in the house of Cornelius, Christ, the Head, baptized all the Gentile believers into the Spirit (10:44-47; 11:15-17). That was the second step, the second instance. By these two steps, these two instances, Christ the Head of the Body, baptized His entire Body into the Spirit once for all.</p>
<p>Because Christ has baptized all His believers into His Body by means of the Spirit, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12:13, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body.&rdquo; The Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism, and in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ. Therefore, we should all, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, be this one Body. Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. In this one Spirit we were all baptized by Christ into this one living Body to express Christ.</p>
<p>In this way the baptism in the Holy Spirit was accomplished once for all. Now what we need is not to be baptized in the Holy Spirit again, but simply to experience the baptism already accomplished in the Holy Spirit. Even as we need not be crucified again because of the finished work of Christ on the cross, so also we need not be baptized in the Holy Spirit again. Christ the Head has already baptized the whole Body in the Holy Spirit. We need only experience what the Head has already done to the Body.</p>
<p>If we would experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit, we must first realize that the Lord has ascended, establishing His lordship and His headship (Acts 2:36). Because Christ was established as the Lord and Head, He poured down the Holy Spirit upon His Body (v. 33). Second, we must have a right relationship with the Body. Thus, we may tell the Lord as the Head that we know His Body, that we are regenerated members of His Body and are rightly related to it, and that on this standing we claim the baptism in the Holy Spirit already accomplished upon His Body. Then we will indeed experience the wonderful baptism in the Holy Spirit. If we do not understand the ascension of Christ or do not have a right standing with the Body, no matter how much we pray and tarry, it will be difficult to have the experience. Therefore, if we would experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we must realize that Christ today is ascended and is the Lord and Head of all to the church, and we must stand in a right position in respect to the Body.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Made Lord and Christ</h2>
<p>As the One in ascension, He was made Lord&mdash;the Lord of all to possess all (10:36)&mdash;and Christ&mdash;God&rsquo;s Anointed to carry out God&rsquo;s commission (Heb. 1:9). In fact, the pouring out of the Holy Spirit is a proof that God has exalted the Lord Jesus and has made Him both Lord and Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Lord, as the Lord of All to Possess All</h2>
<p>Acts 2:36 says, &ldquo;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.&rdquo; As God, the Lord was the Lord all the time (Luke 1:43; John 11:21; 20:28). But as man, He was made the Lord in His ascension after He brought His humanity into God in His resurrection. God has always been the Lord, but now a man is on the throne as the Lord. After Jesus was crucified and buried, God resurrected Him and set Him at His right hand, making this Jesus, a Nazarene, the Lord of all the universe. For God to be the Lord, there is no need of any kind of inauguration. But for a small man from a lowly town in a despised country to be made the Lord requires a real inauguration. Now this man from Nazareth was inaugurated to be the Lord of all. By the ascension Peter realized that the very man Jesus, whom he had been following for three and a half years, was inaugurated to be Lord of all. Now the Lord of the universe, the Lord of heaven and of earth, is a real man whose name is Jesus. This is why we declare, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; and why we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Christ in His ascension was inaugurated as Lord of all, not only of all men, but also of all things (Acts 10:36). As the Lord, Christ now possesses the whole universe, God&rsquo;s chosen people, and all positive things, matters, and persons. Christ is the Lord not only of God&rsquo;s chosen people, but also of the angels and of all those who will be in the millennium and in the new heaven and the new earth. Therefore, He is the Lord of the heavens, the earth, and everything and everyone He has redeemed. In ascension He is the Lord of all to possess all.</p>
<p>The lordship of Christ is one of the most important aspects of what He has obtained in His ascension. Since the lordship of Christ was fully established in His ascension, we&mdash;the members of His Body identified with Christ the Head&mdash;only need to realize this heavenly fact (Eph. 1:20-23). Once we realize that Christ has obtained the lordship, we, the church as His Body, have to apply it. We may exercise His lordship through our prayer for believers and sinners who are in a poor condition (Matt. 16:18-19; 28:18-19). In our prayer for them, we should take the ground of His ascension, proclaim His lordship, and tell Him that His lordship must be exercised over them. In this kind of bold and extraordinary prayer, we claim what the Lord has obtained in His ascension&mdash;His lordship. Instead of begging the Lord to do something for us, we need to learn to pray by claiming what the Lord has obtained in His ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Christ, as God&rsquo;s Anointed to Carry out God&rsquo;s Commission</h2>
<p>Christ in His ascension has not only been made the Lord of all but also the Christ of God to work out the spreading of the gospel and the building up of the church that God&rsquo;s chosen people may be saved and perfected for the constitution of the New Jerusalem to be God&rsquo;s eternal habitation and manifestation according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy for God&rsquo;s eternal satisfaction. As God&rsquo;s sent and anointed One, He was Christ in eternity and from the time that He was born (Dan. 9:26; John 1:41; Luke 2:11; Matt. 1:16). He was called Christ from His birth, was anointed at His baptism (3:13-17), and was called the Christ by Peter: &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (16:16). This was for Him to accomplish the first part of God&rsquo;s economy for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s redemption and the release of the divine life by His earthly ministry. But in His ascension He was officially inaugurated into the position of God&rsquo;s Christ, God&rsquo;s appointed One, to carry out the second part of God&rsquo;s economy for the producing and the building up of the church by His heavenly ministry.</p>
<p>Although He was anointed in His divinity in eternity and was anointed at His baptism, He was not officially inaugurated as the Christ until His ascension. When Jesus ascended on high, God made the appointment official. Christ has been not only chosen, appointed, and anointed by God, but also inaugurated by God into His office. In this way God declared to the whole universe that this is the very One whom He appointed to accomplish His eternal plan, which is to build up His temple, the New Jerusalem. Therefore, as the One in ascension, Christ was made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) that He might possess all and that He might carry out God&rsquo;s commission through His heavenly ministry to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan (10:36; Heb. 1:9).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED NINETY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(27)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Author of Life</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Author of life. As such, He is the origin or Originator of life, the holy and righteous One; He was killed by the Jewish leaders, raised from the dead by God, and witnessed by the disciples.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Origin or Originator of Life</h2>
<p>In Acts 3:14-15 Peter says to the Jewish people, &ldquo;But you denied the holy and righteous One and asked that a man who was a murderer be granted to you; and the Author of life you killed, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;Author&rdquo; is <em>archegos,</em> meaning &ldquo;author,&rdquo; &ldquo;origin,&rdquo; &ldquo;originator,&rdquo; &ldquo;chief leader,&rdquo; &ldquo;captain.&rdquo; In 3:15 it denotes Christ as the origin or Originator of life, hence the Author of life, in contrast to the murderer. According to this verse Peter indicates that Christ is the source, the origin, and the Initiator of life; He is the Author, the Chief Leader, in life. Here we see the imparting of life into others, which is to propagate Christ. For such a propagation, we need the Lord as the Author of life, as the source of life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Holy and Righteous One</h2>
<p>Christ as the Author of life is also the holy and righteous One. According to 3:14 the Lord is the holy One. In this verse <em>holy</em> indicates that Jesus, the Nazarene, the One despised by the Jewish leaders, was absolutely for God and separated unto Him. Furthermore, He was absolutely one with God. According to the denotation of the word <em>holy</em> in the Bible, it signifies one who is absolutely unto God, who is absolutely for God, and who is absolutely one with God. In all of human history only the Lord Jesus is such a One. Throughout His entire life the Lord Jesus was absolutely separated unto God, for God, and one with God. There was never an instant when He was not absolutely for God and one with Him. Therefore, He is called the holy One. He alone deserves the title &ldquo;the holy One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 3:14 Peter called the Lord Jesus not only the holy One but also the righteous One. To be righteous is to be right with God and also with everyone and with everything. Only the Lord Jesus can be called the righteous One, because only He is right with God and with everyone and everything. In ourselves we are not right with God, with others, or even with things. We, therefore, cannot be the righteous One.</p>
<p>As the righteous One, the Lord Jesus is the right One. He was never wrong with God or with anyone or anything. Consider the time when He cleansed the temple: &ldquo;He found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there. And having made a whip out of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, as well as the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables. And to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away from here; do not make My Father&rsquo;s house a house of merchandise&rdquo; (John 2:14-16). The Lord Jesus certainly was right in doing this. If He had not done it, He would have been behaving like a politician. The Lord saw the sinful situation, and He was indignant. As the righteous One, the Lord cleansed the temple in a righteous way. He was never wrong, for He was always the righteous One. As the righteous One, He is right with God, with man, and with everything in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Killed by the Jewish Leaders,<br />
Raised from the Dead by God, and<br />
Witnessed by the Disciples</h2>
<p>Peter wanted the people to realize that the One the Jewish leaders killed is the Author of life. Although He was killed, God raised Him from the dead. Regarding the Lord as a man, the New Testament says that God raised Him from the dead (Rom. 8:11). But considering Him as God, it tells us that He Himself rose from the dead (14:9). Furthermore, the apostles, the disciples, were witnesses of the resurrected Christ, bearing witness of His resurrection, which is the crucial focus in the carrying out of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><h2 class="head3">4. God&rsquo;s Servant</h2>
<p>As God&rsquo;s Servant, Christ was raised up by God to bring the blessing covenanted to Abraham, first to the Jews, the chosen people of God, that they may turn away from their wickedness.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Raised Up by God<br />
to Bring the Blessing Covenanted to Abraham</h2>
<p>In Acts 3:25-26 Peter says, &ldquo;You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God covenanted with your fathers, saying to Abraham, &lsquo;And in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.&rsquo; To you first, God, having raised up His Servant, has sent Him to bless you in turning each of you away from your wicked deeds.&rdquo; Here the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; of Abraham in whom all the nations of the earth will be blessed refers to Christ (Gal. 3:16). Christ is the One in whom all the families of the earth, all races, colors, and nationalities, will be blessed. Furthermore, God sent back the ascended Christ first to the Jews by pouring out His Spirit on the Day of Pentecost. Hence, the very Spirit whom God poured out is the very Christ whom God raised and exalted to the heavens. When the apostles preached and ministered this Christ, the Spirit was ministered to people.</p>
<p>At the time Peter was speaking the word recorded in Acts 3:26, Christ, God&rsquo;s Servant, had ascended to the heavens and was still there. Nevertheless, Peter told the people that God had sent Christ to bless them. What does this mean? Actually, God has received Christ into the heavens. But here Peter says that God has sent this ascended One to the people. In what way did God send the ascended Christ to the Jews? God sent Him by pouring out the Spirit. This implies that the outpoured Spirit is actually the ascended Christ Himself. When the outpoured Spirit came to the people, that was Christ, the ascended One, sent by God to them. From this we see that the poured-out Spirit is identical to the ascended Christ. In God&rsquo;s economy, for the experience of His people, the ascended Christ and the poured-out Spirit are one. In God&rsquo;s economy Christ and the Spirit are one for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. First to the Jews, the Chosen People of God,<br />
That They May Turn Away from Their Wickedness</h2>
<p>In these verses, Peter indicates that God has sent His Servant first to the Jews to bless them by pouring out His Spirit to them. Now they need to receive this One. He is not far from them. Although He is in the heavens, economically He is among them as the poured-out Spirit to bless them. If they call on the name of the Lord Jesus, they will receive His person&mdash;the Holy Spirit. Then they will have God&rsquo;s blessing. This is the way for us to receive the blessing God intends to give us by sending the ascended Christ back to us as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Cornerstone</h2>
<p>In Acts 4:10-12 we see that as the cornerstone Christ was despised and crucified by the Jewish leaders, the builders, but raised from the dead by God, becoming the cornerstone of God&rsquo;s building with God&rsquo;s salvation being uniquely in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Despised and Crucified by the Jewish Leaders<br />
and Raised from the Dead by God</h2>
<p>Peter testifies to the Jewish leaders in Acts 4:10-12: &ldquo;Let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified and whom God has raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you in good health. This is the stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner. And there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;Nazarene&rdquo; indicates the One despised by the Jewish leaders (John 1:45-46; Acts 22:8; 24:5). In 4:11 the Greek word translated &ldquo;considered as nothing&rdquo; also means &ldquo;rejected&rdquo; (Matt. 21:42). In Acts 4:10, <em>you</em> is emphatic. Here Peter emphasizes the fact that the Jewish leaders crucified the Lord Jesus, but God raised Him from the dead.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Becoming the Cornerstone of God&rsquo;s Building<br />
with God&rsquo;s Salvation Being Uniquely in Him</h2>
<p>The stone despised, rejected, by the builders has become the cornerstone. Literally, the Greek words rendered &ldquo;cornerstone&rdquo; mean the &ldquo;head of the corner.&rdquo; Verse 11 is a quotation from Psalm 118:22. The Lord Jesus also quoted this verse in Matthew 21:42, where He was indicating that He is the stone for God&rsquo;s building (Isa. 28:16; Zech. 3:9; 1 Pet. 2:4) and that the &ldquo;builders&rdquo; were the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God&rsquo;s building. His word unveiled the Jewish leaders&rsquo; rejection of Him and God&rsquo;s honoring of Him for the building of His habitation among His people on earth. By this word Peter learned to know the Lord as the precious stone held in honor by God, as he expounded concerning Him in his first Epistle (vv. 4-7). Peter&rsquo;s quoting this word indicates that he preached Christ not only as the Savior for the salvation of sinners but also as the stone for God&rsquo;s building. The fact that Christ our Savior is a stone reveals that God&rsquo;s salvation is for God&rsquo;s building. It is such a Christ who is the unique salvation to sinners, and it is in His unique name under heaven, a name despised and rejected by the Jewish leaders but honored and exalted by God (Phil. 2:9-10), that sinners must be saved (Acts 4:12) not only from sin (Matt. 1:21) but also to participate in God&rsquo;s building (1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>In Christ God came in incarnation to be a stone for the building up of His universal habitation, but the Jewish leaders, who should have been the builders, despised this stone, Jesus Christ. However, God made Him the cornerstone. The more the Jewish leaders rejected Him, the more God used Him. At first, He was a common stone. Then the Jewish leaders rejected Him by killing Him. But God honored Him by raising Him up from among the dead and making Him a particular stone, the cornerstone, the prominent stone that joins the walls of a building. As the cornerstone of God&rsquo;s habitation, Christ joins the wall of the Jewish believers and the wall of the Gentile believers.</p>
<p>Christ is not only the holy One, the righteous One, the Author of life, and the Servant; He is also a stone for God&rsquo;s building. According to Acts 4:12, this stone is the unique One in whom we can be saved. Hence, He is the Stone-Savior. As the Stone-Savior, He is solid, strong, and reliable. We can rely on Him and stand on Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">6. The Leader and Savior</h2>
<p>In Acts 5:30-32 Christ is revealed as the Leader and Savior: &ldquo;The God of our fathers has raised Jesus, whom you slew by hanging Him on a tree. This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.&rdquo; Christ was slain by the Jews on a tree and exalted by God to His right hand to be the Leader, as the Ruler of the kings, to rule over the world, and to be the Savior to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel (Rev. 1:5; 19:16). Christ, exalted by God to be the Leader and Savior, was also witnessed by the disciples and the Holy Spirit, who was one with the disciples.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Slain by the Jews on a Tree and Exalted by God<br />
to His Right Hand to Be the Leader and Savior</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Leader, as the Ruler of the Kings,<br />
to Rule over the World</h2>
<p>Acts 5:30 tells us that Christ was slain by the Jews on a tree. Acts 5:31 goes on to say that God has exalted the crucified Jesus &ldquo;to His right hand as Leader and Savior.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; is <em>archegos,</em> meaning &ldquo;author,&rdquo; &ldquo;origin,&rdquo; &ldquo;originator,&rdquo; &ldquo;chief leader,&rdquo; &ldquo;captain.&rdquo; This word is used only four times in the New Testament and always in reference to Christ (3:15; Heb. 2:10; 12:2). It has been translated a number of different ways in various versions because there is no precise English equivalent to the Greek. The thought is that this One is the origin and Originator, the Author, the Leader, and the Inaugurator. He is above all, and He is spontaneously the Ruler with authority. God has exalted Jesus, the One rejected and killed by the Jewish leaders, as the highest Leader. His being the Leader is a matter related to His authority. He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God&rsquo;s chosen people to receive His salvation (Acts 17:26-27; John 17:2).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus as the highest Ruler is above kings and presidents. In a very real sense, Christ as the Ruler of the kings dethrones all the kings. Only He is the Ruler. According to Revelation 1:5, He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth. He is the King of kings and Lord of lords (19:16). Christ is both the Ruler and the King. As the Ruler of all the enthroned ones, He rules the entire earth. Today the entire world is under the Lord&rsquo;s ruling. He is sovereign over everyone and everything.</p>
<p>As the Leader, the Ruler, He is ruling the earth for the purpose of our salvation. He is ruling so that we may be saved. We believe that God chose us, and then at the right time the Lord Jesus, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, exercised His authority to produce a certain environment so that we had no choice except to believe in Him. In a sense, we have been &ldquo;caught&rdquo; by the Lord in His sovereignty. We have been caught by Christ and in Christ; furthermore, we have been caught in the church. He is the Ruler of the kings, arranging the environment so that we were constrained to believe in Him. Without such an environment, we would not have believed in Him. Actually, believing in the Lord does not depend on us&mdash;it depends altogether on Him. He has been exalted to be the Leader over all the kings to arrange the environment so that His chosen people will believe in Him.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) The Savior to Give Repentance<br />
and Forgiveness of Sins to Israel</h2>
<p>The One God has exalted to His right hand is not only the Leader but also the Savior. <em>Leader</em> is related to His authority, and <em>Savior</em> to His salvation. Jesus&rsquo; incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man&rsquo;s Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader so that He might be the Savior.</p>
 <p>According to Peter&rsquo;s word in Acts 5:31, the Lord is the Savior &ldquo;to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God&rsquo;s chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior. His sovereign ruling causes and leads God&rsquo;s chosen people to repent, and His salvation based upon His redemption affords them forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>Repentance is for forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4). On God&rsquo;s side, forgiveness of sins is based upon His redemption (Eph. 1:7). On man&rsquo;s side, forgiveness of sins is through repentance. Repentance and forgiveness are major gifts, and only the Lord Jesus as the Leader and Savior is qualified to give them. We need to realize that in this universe He is the only One qualified to give repentance and forgiveness of sins. It is the Lord who has caught us and compelled us to repent. Otherwise, we would not have repented. Repentance is not of us; it is a gift given by the exalted Leader and Savior. Following repentance, we received the gift of forgiveness. We should praise the Lord that He is qualified to give repentance and forgiveness to God&rsquo;s chosen people.</p>
<p>When Christ was on earth, He saved Peter, John, and many others. However, although the title &ldquo;Savior&rdquo; is applied to Christ in His earthly ministry (John 4:42), He was not officially the Savior until His ascension. We were saved officially by the Christ on the throne, by the One in glory. When we were saved, we were seated with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6). Christ has saved us from the throne and to the throne. This is the ascended Christ as our Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Witnessed by the Disciples and the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Christ exalted by God to be the Leader and Savior was witnessed by the disciples and the Holy Spirit. In Acts 5:32 Peter goes on to say, &ldquo;We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;things&rdquo; here is <em>rhema,</em> referring to instant words. Both the apostles and the Holy Spirit were witnesses of these things. This indicates that the Holy Spirit was one with the apostles. In this verse Peter says that God gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him. Obedience is the way and the condition to receive and enjoy the Spirit of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. The Son of Man</h2>
<p>Acts 7:55 speaks of Stephen seeing Jesus standing at the right hand of God: &ldquo;But being full of the Holy Spirit, he looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.&rdquo; This verse unveils that Christ is the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God to be the comfort, encouragement, and strength to the one martyred for Him.</p>
<p>Stephen saw the ascended Christ as the Son of Man. This means that the Christ who is in the heavens still has His humanity; He still possesses a human nature. Some do not believe that Christ today is still the Son of Man. They claim that Christ became a man by incarnation but that in His resurrection He put off His humanity. They think that Christ today is merely the Son of God, that He is no longer the Son of Man. However, it is erroneous to teach that Christ in ascension is no longer the Son of Man. In ascension Christ is still both the Son of God with divinity and the Son of Man with humanity.</p>
<p>According to Acts 7:55, Stephen saw the glory of God. This was a great vindication and encouragement to the persecuted one. Verse 55 says that Stephen also saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God. The Lord in ascension is usually referred to as sitting at the right hand of God (Matt. 26:64; Heb. 1:3, 13). But Stephen saw Him standing there. Sitting is for resting, whereas standing is for working. Because a member of His Body was suffering on earth, the Son of Man was seen standing at the right hand of God. This indicates that the Lord was greatly concerned for His persecuted one.</p>
<p>Stephen did not care for the environment. Rather, being full of the Spirit, he looked intently into heaven. In Acts 7:2 Stephen said that the God of glory appeared to Abraham. Now we are told that Stephen saw the glory of God and Jesus as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God. In the entire New Testament this occurred only once. Furthermore, in 7:56 Stephen said, &ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.&rdquo; The earth rejected Stephen and was closed to him, but the heavens opened up to him, indicating that the heavens were with him and for him.</p><h2 class="head3">8. The Lord of All</h2>
<p>In Acts 10:36 Peter speaks of Christ as the One who is &ldquo;Lord of all.&rdquo; <em>All</em> refers here to all men, all peoples (1 Tim. 2:4). Christ in His ascension is the Lord not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles. He is the Lord of all the different races and peoples on earth. With Him there is no respect of persons. As the Lord of all, Christ is the Lord of the Jews and the Gentiles for all of them to be saved.</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. The Judge</h2>
<p>Acts 10:39-43 indicates that Christ was done away with on a tree by the Jews, raised on the third day by God, and designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead; whoever believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Done Away With on a Tree by the Jews<br />
and Raised on the Third Day by God</h2>
<p>In verses 39 through 41 Peter speaks to Cornelius concerning Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection: &ldquo;We are witnesses of all the things which He did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom also they did away with by hanging Him on a tree. This One, God raised on the third day; and He has made Him manifest, not to all the people, but to witnesses appointed beforehand by God, to us, ones who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.&rdquo; In verse 40 Peter says that God raised this One, but in verse 41 he says that the Lord rose from the dead. Regarding the Lord as a man, the New Testament tells us that God raised Him from the dead (Rom. 8:11). However, considering Him as God, the New Testament tells us that He Himself rose from the dead (14:9).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Designated by God to Be<br />
the Judge of the Living and the Dead</h2>
<p>In Acts 10:42 Peter says, &ldquo;He has charged us to proclaim to the people and solemnly testify that this is the One who was designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ has been designated the Judge of all mankind. He will judge both the living and the dead. The resurrected Christ at His second coming will be the Judge of the living before the millennium on His throne of glory (Matt. 25:31-46; 2 Tim. 4:1). He will also be the Judge of the dead after the millennium on the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). Therefore, the Lord will exercise God&rsquo;s judgment over all men, over the living and the dead.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Whoever Believes into Him<br />
Receiving Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<p>In Acts 10:43 Peter continues, &ldquo;To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; This proves that even though Cornelius feared God and worked righteousness and his prayers and alms had been accepted by God, he still needed God&rsquo;s forgiveness of his sins through believing into Christ the Redeemer. Although he was devout, he was yet still sinful and could not say that he had not sinned. Thus, he needed redemption and forgiveness. Christ, who is the Judge of the living and the dead, can also be experienced and enjoyed as the Redeemer into whom we may believe to receive forgiveness of sins.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(29)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">10. The Firstborn of God</h2>
<p>In Acts 13:32-39 we see Christ as the Firstborn of God, who was promised to the fathers and was begotten by God in resurrection to be His Firstborn. As the Firstborn of God, He is the holy and faithful things of David. Through such a One, forgiveness of sins is announced, and whoever believes in Him is justified from all things.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Promised to the Fathers<br />
and Begotten by God in Resurrection<br />
to Be His Firstborn</h2>
<p>In Acts 13:32-33 Paul says, &ldquo;We announce to you the gospel of the promise made to the fathers, that God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, &lsquo;You are My Son; this day have I begotten You.&rsquo;&rdquo; Here we see that Christ as the Firstborn of God was promised to the fathers, and God fulfilled this promise to their children in raising up Jesus. Resurrection was a birth to the man Jesus. He was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity (John 1:18; 3:16). After incarnation, through resurrection, He was begotten by God in His humanity to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</p>
<p>Paul was able to see the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection in the word in Psalm 2: &ldquo;You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You&rdquo; (v. 7). Paul applied the word <em>today</em> to the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. This means that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His birth as the firstborn Son of God. Jesus, the Son of Man, was born to be the Son of God through being raised up from the dead. Therefore, God&rsquo;s raising up of Jesus from the dead was His begetting of Him to be His firstborn Son. We need to realize that the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection was His birth.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus had two births. First, He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man. Then thirty-three and a half years later He was crucified, buried, and raised from the dead. Through resurrection He had a second birth, for as a man He was born in His resurrection to be the Son of God. Therefore, in His first birth He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, and in His second birth He was born in resurrection to be the Son of God.</p>
<p>In His second birth the Lord Jesus was born to be the firstborn Son of God. According to the New Testament, He is the Son of God in two aspects. First, He was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son; second, He is now God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. The words <em>only begotten</em> indicate that God has only one Son. John 1:18 and 3:16 speak of the only begotten Son of God. Eternally speaking, Christ is the only begotten Son of God. This is His eternal status. But through resurrection He, as a man, was born to be the firstborn Son of God. The word <em>firstborn</em> indicates that God now has many sons (Heb. 2:10). Romans 8:29 and Hebrews 1:6 both speak of Christ as the Firstborn. We who believe in Christ are the many sons of God and the many brothers of the Lord, the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<p>As the only begotten Son of God, the Lord is the embodiment of the divine life. The Gospel of John emphasizes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that as the Son of God He is the embodiment of the divine life (1:4). Through resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God as the life-dispenser for the propagation of life. First, He was the only begotten Son as the embodiment of life; now He is the firstborn Son for the propagation of life. Through His becoming the firstborn Son of God in resurrection, the divine life has been dispensed into all of His believers to bring forth the propagation of the life which is embodied in Him.</p>
<p>Here in Acts 13 Paul was not preaching Christ as the only begotten Son of God, as the Gospel of John does. Rather, here Paul was preaching Christ as the firstborn Son of God for propagation. For this reason, he preached the resurrection of the Lord Jesus as His second birth. Through His second birth, His birth in resurrection, Christ became the firstborn Son of God for the propagation of the divine life.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Holy and the Faithful Things of David</h2>
<p>In 13:34 Paul speaks a further word regarding the resurrection of Christ: &ldquo;As to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, &lsquo;I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things.&rsquo;&rdquo; Verses 33 and 34 are concerned with the resurrected Christ. Verse 33 indicates that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His second birth to bring Him forth as the firstborn Son of God. God promised to give Him to His people, and this resurrected One is the holy and faithful things of David. The phrase <em>the holy things of David, the faithful things</em> indicates that Christ was of David, for it was out of David&rsquo;s seed that God raised up such a One. To God, the resurrected Christ is the firstborn Son, but to us, He is the Savior. Moreover, He is a great gift given by God to His chosen people, and this gift is entitled &ldquo;the holy things...the faithful things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Greek word for <em>the holy things...the faithful things</em> here is in the plural. The same Greek word is used for &ldquo;Holy One&rdquo; in the next verse, but in the singular. However, it is not the regular word for <em>holy;</em> it is a Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word <em>chesed,</em> which is translated &ldquo;mercies&rdquo; in Isaiah 55:3, 2 Chronicles 6:42, and Psalm 89:1, both in the Septuagint and in the King James Version. In Psalm 89 the word <em>mercies</em> in plural in verse 1 (KJV) is the same word as for <em>Holy One</em> in singular in verse 19. This Holy One is Christ, the Son of David, in whom God&rsquo;s mercies are centered and conveyed. Hence, <em>the holy things of David, the faithful things</em> refers to the resurrected Christ. This is fully proved by the context, especially by &ldquo;Your Holy One&rdquo; in the next verse, and by the verse following Isaiah 55:3.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s thought in Acts 13:33 and 34 is very deep. The resurrected Christ, who is God&rsquo;s firstborn Son brought forth through His second birth, His resurrection, is the holy and faithful things. In verse 34 the word <em>faithful</em> means &ldquo;trustworthy.&rdquo; The resurrected Christ is the holy and faithful things God gives to us. Here Paul indicates that the resurrected Christ is not only our Savior bringing us God&rsquo;s salvation and that He is not only the firstborn Son of God. This resurrected One is also the holy and faithful things as a gift given to us by God.</p>
<p>It is easy for us to understand that Christ is our Savior. It is more difficult to understand that Christ is the firstborn Son of God. But it is very difficult to understand that the resurrected Christ is the holy and faithful things given to us by God. The holy and faithful things cover a wide span, a span much wider than that covered by the titles &ldquo;Savior&rdquo; and &ldquo;firstborn Son.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;the holy things...the faithful things&rdquo; is actually a divine title, a title of Christ. In these verses Christ is called the holy and faithful things. The Savior God raised up out of the seed of David has become the holy and faithful things.</p>
<p>These holy and faithful things are all the aspects of what Christ is. According to the New Testament, Christ is life, light, grace, righteousness, holiness, sanctification, and justification. He is also the bread of life and the living water. Furthermore, the holy and faithful things include all the aspects of Christ unveiled in 1 Corinthians: power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, glory, the depths of God, the unique foundation of God&rsquo;s building, the Passover, the unleavened bread, the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, the spiritual rock, the Head, the Body, the firstfruits, the second man, and the last Adam. We see many more aspects of Christ in the Gospel of John, such as the Shepherd and the pasture. Oh, how much Christ is to us as the holy and faithful things! As the resurrected One, He is the firstborn Son, the Savior, and all the holy and faithful things.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the holy and faithful things are regarded as mercies. Isaiah 55:3 speaks of &ldquo;the sure mercies shown to David.&rdquo; Second Chronicles 6:42 mentions &ldquo;the mercies of David,&rdquo; the Lord&rsquo;s servant, and Psalm 89:1 says, &ldquo;I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.&rdquo; Mercy implies both love and grace, but it reaches further than love. Where love and grace cannot reach, mercy can reach. All the holy and faithful things are Christ Himself as mercies to us. Life is a mercy, and light is also a mercy. Likewise, righteousness, holiness, justification, and sanctification are mercies. In chapter ten of the Gospel of John we have the door, the pasture, and the Shepherd, all of which are mercies. If we took time to count all the aspects of these mercies, we would have a long list of mercies. A husband&rsquo;s love for his wife and the wife&rsquo;s submission to her husband are Christ as mercies to us. If a husband, in Christ, loves his wife, this surely is a mercy. His love for her is Christ Himself as a mercy to him. In a similar way, if a sister, in Christ, submits to her husband, that also is a mercy. Her submission is Christ Himself as a mercy to her.</p>
<p>Our speaking the word of God year after year inexhaustibly is certainly Christ as a mercy to us. This is not a matter of our ability or gift. It is altogether a matter of mercy. Not only is it a mercy for us to speak the word of God, but even the dear Savior is our speaking. Our speaking is Christ, and to us this speaking Christ is a mercy. Though our speaking may not be eloquent, our speaking may be full of Christ. This is wholly due to Christ being a mercy to us in speaking the word of God.</p>
<p>We all need to see that the resurrected Christ is all the holy and faithful things as mercies given to us by God as an all-inclusive gift. This was the Christ preached by Paul in Acts 13. Paul, in his gospel message, not only preached Christ from the Old Testament, but also preached the resurrected Christ as the holy and faithful things. Actually, what Paul proclaimed here in his preaching of the gospel requires all the Epistles written by him for its definition. Therefore, if we want to see more concerning Christ as the holy and faithful things, we need to study the fourteen Epistles of Paul. In his preaching Paul set up an excellent pattern for us to follow in our gospel preaching today. Like Paul, we need to preach Christ in a rich and uplifted way.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Through Him Forgiveness of Sins Being Announced<br />
and in Him Whoever Believes<br />
Being Justified from All Things</h2>
<p>In Acts 13:38 and 39 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you; and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.&rdquo; To be forgiven of sins (v. 38) is on the negative side and is for our release from condemnation. To be justified (v. 39) is on the positive side and is for our reconciliation to God and acceptance by Him.</p>
<p>In both verse 38 and verse 39 Paul speaks of &ldquo;this One.&rdquo; Who is this One? This is the One who has been resurrected to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, our Savior, and the many holy and faithful things. Therefore, through the One who is the holy and faithful things as God&rsquo;s mercies to us, we are forgiven and justified. Through the One who is the firstborn Son, the Savior, and the holy and faithful things, forgiveness of sins has been announced to us. And through this One we are justified from all the things from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses.</p>
<p>The One by whom we are forgiven and justified is not only our Savior; He Himself is our forgiveness and justification. Both forgiveness and justification are mercies from God to us, and these mercies are aspects of the resurrected Christ. Today Christ in His resurrection is our forgiveness and our justification. Never consider forgiveness and justification as something apart from Christ. Both forgiveness and justification are aspects of Christ Himself as mercies from God to us, and these mercies are holy and faithful things. To be sure, forgiveness and justification are gifts of God, and they certainly are holy and faithful things. If we have this understanding, we shall see that forgiveness and justification are not common. Rather, they are holy. Furthermore, they are faithful, sure, trustworthy. This is Paul&rsquo;s preaching of Christ as the Firstborn of God in Acts 13, through which many were saved.</p>
 <h2 class="head3">11. The Spirit of Jesus</h2>
<p>Acts 16:6-7 indicates that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Spirit of Jesus, the Holy Spirit, who guided the apostles in their ministry. Speaking of Paul and his co-workers, these verses say, &ldquo;They passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. And when they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.&rdquo; The move of the apostle Paul and his co-workers for the spread of the gospel was not according to their decision and preference or according to any schedule made by human council, but by the Spirit of Jesus.</p>
<p>Just as the Spirit of Christ is the reality of Christ, so the Spirit of Jesus is the reality of Jesus. If we do not have the Spirit of Jesus, Jesus will not be real to us. But today Jesus is real to us because we have the Spirit of Jesus as the reality, the realization, of Jesus. Jesus was a man who continually suffered intense persecution while He was on earth. Therefore, the Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of a man with abundant strength for suffering. He is the Spirit of a man as well as the Spirit of suffering strength.</p>
<p>As an evangelist, Paul went out to preach, and he also suffered. In that suffering he needed the Spirit of Jesus because in the Spirit of Jesus there is the suffering element and the suffering strength to withstand persecution. In our preaching today we also need the Spirit of Jesus to face the opposition and persecution. The Spirit of Jesus is not only the Spirit of God with divinity in Him that we may live the divine life but also the Spirit of the man Jesus with humanity in Him that we may live the proper human life and endure its sufferings.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Being the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>We need to pay careful attention to two divine titles in verses 6 and 7&mdash;&ldquo;the Holy Spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Spirit of Jesus.&rdquo; The interchangeable use of these two titles reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit. &ldquo;The Holy Spirit&rdquo; is a general title of the Spirit of God in the New Testament. &ldquo;The Spirit of Jesus&rdquo; is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death as well. Such an all-inclusive Spirit was needed for the apostle&rsquo;s preaching ministry, a ministry of suffering carried out among human beings and for human beings in the human life.</p>
<p>In Acts 16 Luke first speaks of the Holy Spirit and then of the Spirit of Jesus&mdash;two titles for the Spirit of God not found in the Old Testament. The title &ldquo;the Holy Spirit&rdquo; was used for the first time at the conception of the Lord Jesus. It was when the time came to prepare the way for Christ&rsquo;s coming and to prepare a human body for Him to initiate the New Testament dispensation that the term &ldquo;the Holy Spirit&rdquo; came into use (Luke 1:15, 35; Matt. 1:18, 20). In order to understand the first usage of the title &ldquo;the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; we need to see that this title is involved with the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation. Hence, according to the principle of first mention, the Holy Spirit is related to Christ&rsquo;s incarnation and birth. This title indicates God&rsquo;s coming into man to be one with man in incarnation. In the New Testament, the title &ldquo;the Holy Spirit&rdquo; indicates that God is now mingling Himself with man.</p>
<p>In Acts 16:7 Luke turns from the Holy Spirit to the Spirit of Jesus. As a man, Jesus first lived a human life and then was crucified and resurrected, and He ascended to the heavens and was made Lord and Christ. Thus, the Spirit of Jesus implies the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Guiding the Apostles in Their Ministry</h2>
<p>In Acts 16 we see that the move of the apostles in their evangelistic work was, strictly speaking, not by the Spirit of God. Rather, it was by the Holy Spirit, who was involved with the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation and birth, and by the Spirit of Jesus, who was involved with the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. These two divine titles indicate strongly that Paul&rsquo;s move in his evangelical work was not something in the way of the old dispensation. If it had been a move in the old dispensational way, then the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah should have been mentioned. But in Acts 16 there is no mention of the Spirit of God or of the Spirit of Jehovah. Instead, we are told that Paul and his co-workers were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia and were not allowed by the Spirit of Jesus to go into Bithynia. The fact that Luke speaks of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus indicates that the evangelical work of the apostles was a new move in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
 <p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is carried out through the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. The Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus include these matters. This means that the Spirit, who is now called the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus, is the totality and ultimate consummation of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. When we have this Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus, we have Christ in His incarnation, in His humanity and human living, and in His death, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<p>Elsewhere we have pointed out that after His resurrection and in His resurrection Christ became the pneumatic Christ. The pneumatic Christ is identical to the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). The Holy Spirit, who is also the Spirit of Jesus, is the totality of this pneumatic Christ. The pneumatic Christ is constituted of certain elements: incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. In the entire universe He is the only One who possesses these six qualifications. Only He is qualified with incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. Hence, the Spirit of Jesus is the realization of this qualified Jesus. The Spirit of Jesus is the totality of such an all-inclusive One. In Acts 16 Paul and his co-workers were moving under the direction of such a Spirit, the Spirit who is the totality of the all-inclusive Christ.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Jesus is the totality and realization of Christ as the uniquely qualified One, the One qualified through incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of the One with humanity, who lived a human life on earth for thirty-three and a half years, who died an all-inclusive death, who resurrected from the dead to propagate the divine life by imparting it into all His believers, and who ascended to the heavens to be made Lord and Christ. The Spirit who did not allow the apostles to go into Bithynia was the Spirit of this Jesus. This Spirit is the totality and the full realization of the all-inclusive Jesus. These verses prove that the apostles were moving under the direction and guidance of such an all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>The kind of work we do for the Lord depends on the kind of Spirit by whom we are guided, directed, instructed, and constituted. Paul was not constituted of the Spirit of God or of the Spirit of Jehovah but of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus. As a vessel containing the Triune God, Paul was fully constituted of the Holy Spirit, who was involved with the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation and birth, and of the Spirit of Jesus, who was involved with the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, life-imparting resurrection, and ascension. Paul was a person constituted of this all-inclusive Spirit. Thus, when he came out to preach, he could truly preach Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that the kind of work we do for the Lord depends on the Spirit by whom we are guided and of whom we are constituted. Actually, this Spirit should become our constitution. Then our work will be the expression of this Spirit, and we will do a work for Jesus as the incarnated One with humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. If we are constituted of the Spirit of Jesus, we will do the work of ministering Jesus as the all-inclusive One and convey Him as such a One to others.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(30)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">12. The Lord Jesus</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Object of the Believer&rsquo;s Faith</h2>
<p>Acts 16:31 says, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; Here Christ is revealed as the Lord Jesus. As such, He is the object of the believer&rsquo;s faith for the salvation of the believer and his household. To believe in the gospel is mainly to believe in Jesus Christ. Furthermore, to believe is to believe on, to take the ground and stand on, the Lord Jesus to be saved. We believe not only into Christ but also on Christ. This is to take the ground and the standing on the person of Christ and all that He has accomplished, both of which constitute the belief, the faith, of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We believe on Christ as the ground and standing so that we may be saved.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. For the Salvation of the Believer and His Household</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the word <em>household</em> in verse 31 indicates that the family of the believer is a complete unit for God&rsquo;s salvation, like the family of Noah (Gen. 7:1), the families partaking of the Passover (Exo. 12:3-4), the family of the harlot Rahab (Josh. 2:18-19), the family of Zaccheus (Luke 19:9), the family of Cornelius (Acts 11:14), the family of Lydia (16:15), the family of the jailer in verse 31, and the family of Crispus in 18:8. Hence, Christ as the Lord Jesus is the object of the believer&rsquo;s faith for the salvation not only of the believer but also of his household.</p>
<h2 class="head3">13. A Man to Judge the World</h2>
<p>Christ is a man to judge the world, designated by God in righteousness, and proved by God&rsquo;s raising Him from the dead.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Designated by God in Righteousness</h2>
<p>In 17:30 and 31 Paul says, &ldquo;Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now charges all men everywhere to repent, because He has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from the dead.&rdquo; The day set by God for the judgment of the world will be the day when Christ will judge the living men from the throne of His glory before the millennium (Matt. 25:31-36). This probably does not include the day when He will judge dead men at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). According to Acts 10:42 Christ has been designated by God &ldquo;to be the Judge of the living and the dead.&rdquo; He will be the Judge of the dead after the millennium at the great white throne. Second Timothy 4:1 and 1 Peter 4:5 also say that Christ will judge both the living and the dead. The day in Acts 17:31 refers particularly to the day Christ will judge the living, because on this day He will judge &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; which should refer only to living men. This day of Christ&rsquo;s judgment on earth will be brought in by His coming back. He was designated by God to execute this judgment, and God&rsquo;s raising Him from the dead is strong proof of this. In their preaching to the Gentiles, both Peter in 10:42 and Paul here and in 24:25 stressed the coming judgment of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Proved by God&rsquo;s Raising Him from the Dead</h2>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;proof&rdquo; in 17:31 may also be translated &ldquo;faith,&rdquo; &ldquo;assurance,&rdquo; &ldquo;guarantee.&rdquo; The resurrection of Christ is proof and assurance of His coming back to judge all the inhabitants of the earth. This is guaranteed that we may have faith in it and that it may lead us to repent (v. 30).</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word regarding Christ as the man designated by God and regarding His resurrection indicates that Paul was fully constituted of this One and of His resurrection. Paul was led, guided, and directed absolutely by the Spirit of Jesus. Because he was constituted of the Spirit of Jesus, his goal, no matter what the subject in speaking, was to preach Christ and His resurrection.</p><h2 class="head3">14. God</h2>
<p>In Acts 20:28 we see Christ as God: &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood.&rdquo; This verse reveals that Christ as our God is the Purchaser of the church, having obtained the church with His own blood. God secured, purchased, and redeemed the church with His own blood. God&rsquo;s own blood is the blood of Jesus Christ (1 John 1:7). This also implies that the Lord Jesus is God.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s purchasing the church with His blood indicates the precious love of God for the church and the preciousness, the exceeding worth, of the church in the eyes of God. Here the apostle does not touch the divine life and nature of the church as in Ephesians 5:23-32, but the value of the church as a treasure to God, a treasure which He acquired with His own precious blood. Paul expected that the elders as overseers would also treasure the church as God did.</p>
<p>Both the Holy Spirit and God&rsquo;s own blood are divine provisions for the church He treasures. The Holy Spirit denotes God&rsquo;s person, and His own blood, God&rsquo;s work. God&rsquo;s redemptive work acquired the church; now God&rsquo;s person, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), cares for the church through the overseers. The church is under the care of the Holy Spirit, and the church has been bought by God with His own blood. Hence, the church is a treasure in the sight of God. The church is dear to God, so we have to regard and respect the church.</p>
<p>In Acts 20:28 Paul says that the church of God has been obtained &ldquo;through His own blood.&rdquo; To understand the unusual phrase <em>His own blood</em> in verse 28, we need to see that the God who died for us to obtain the church is not the God before incarnation. Prior to incarnation, God certainly did not have blood, and He could not have died for us. It was after the incarnation, in which God was mingled with humanity, that He died for us. Through incarnation, our God, the Creator, the eternal One, Jehovah, became mingled with man. As a result, He was no longer only God&mdash;He became a God-man. As the God-man, He surely had blood and was able to die for us.</p>
<p>When the God-man died on the cross, He died not only as man but also as God. The One who died on the cross was the One who had been conceived of God and born with God. Because He was a God-man, the very element of God was in Him. The divine element was mingled with His humanity.</p>
<p>In the conception of the Lord Jesus, the God-man, the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18-20; Luke 1:35) was generated in Mary&rsquo;s womb. Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with both the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature and produced the God-man, One who is both the complete God and a perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively, without a third nature being produced. This is the most wonderful and excellent person of Jesus.</p>
<p>The conception and birth of the Lord Jesus was God&rsquo;s incarnation (John 1:14), constituted of the divine essence added to the human essence, hence, producing the God-man of two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity. Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16) and might be the Savior (Luke 2:11) who died and shed His blood for us.</p>
<p>The blood that has redeemed fallen human beings is the blood of Jesus, the Son of God (1 John 1:7). As human beings, we need genuine human blood for our redemption. Because He was a man, the Lord Jesus could fulfill this requirement. As a man, He shed human blood to redeem fallen human beings. The Lord is also the Son of God, even God Himself. Therefore, with His blood there is the element of eternity, and this element ensures the eternal efficacy of His blood. Therefore, as a man He has genuine human blood, and as God He has the element that gives to His blood eternal efficacy. In Acts 20:28 Paul had the boldness to speak of this blood as being God&rsquo;s own blood.</p>
<p>Therefore, Christ died on the cross as the God-man, and the blood He shed there for our redemption was the blood not only of the man Jesus but also the blood of the God-man. Therefore, this blood, through which God obtained the church, is God&rsquo;s own blood. This implies that Jesus Christ is God as the Purchaser of the church who obtained the church with His own blood.</p>
<h2 class="head3">15. The Content of the Gospel</h2>
<p>Acts 26:18-23 unveils Christ as the content of the gospel. Christ suffered death and resurrected from the dead to announce light both to the Jews and to the Gentiles, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance.</p><h2 class="head4">a. The One Who Suffered Death<br />
and Resurrection from the Dead to Announce Light<br />
Both to the Jews and to the Gentiles</h2>
<p>In his defense before Agrippa, Paul says that he did not testify anything apart from the things which both the prophets and Moses said were about to take place, &ldquo;that the Christ would suffer and that He, being the first to rise from the dead, would announce light both to the people and to the Gentiles&rdquo; (v. 23). Literally, the Greek words rendered &ldquo;would suffer&rdquo; mean &ldquo;was to be subject to suffering.&rdquo; Furthermore, the Greek words translated, &ldquo;He, being the first to rise from the dead, would announce&rdquo; may be rendered, &ldquo;by the resurrection of the dead He should be the first to announce&rdquo; or &ldquo;He being the first to rise from the dead should announce.&rdquo; In 26:23 Paul says that Christ announced light both to the people and to the Gentiles. The word <em>light</em> here indicates the enlightenment of God, who is light (1 John 1:5), shining in Christ, who is the light of the world (John 8:12; 9:5), through the preaching of the gospel of the glory of Christ (2 Cor. 4:4, 6). Here Paul speaks of light instead of life because both the religious people and the Roman politicians were in darkness. Because they were in a dark &ldquo;cell,&rdquo; Paul says that Christ, as the first to rise from the dead, announced light both to the people and to the Gentiles.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. To Open Their Eyes</h2>
<p>Acts 26:18 presents the full, complete, perfect, whole gospel, of which Christ is the content: &ldquo;To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.&rdquo; Here the opening of people&rsquo;s eyes is the carrying out of the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s jubilee, the acceptable year of the Lord, proclaimed by the Lord Jesus in Luke 4:18-21 according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The acceptable year of the Lord in Luke 4:19 is the New Testament age typified by the year of jubilee (Lev. 25:8-17), which is the time when God accepts the returned captives of sin (Isa. 49:8; 2 Cor. 6:2) and when the oppressed under the bondage of sin may enjoy the release of God&rsquo;s salvation. The first item of the spiritual and divine blessings of the New Testament jubilee, which are the blessings of the gospel of God, is to open the eyes of those who are fallen and turn them from darkness to light so that they may see the divine things in the spiritual realm. To see these things requires spiritual sight and divine light.</p>
<p>Many of us have had the experience of listening to certain messages that brought us into darkness and of listening to other messages that brought us into light. We may listen to a sermon given by a particular minister, pastor, or preacher. The more we listen to that sermon, the more we are brought into darkness, and everything becomes opaque. However, we may listen to another message, and the more we listen, the more the divine light shines in us. Day dawns, our eyes are opened, and we begin to see spiritual things. This is the kind of message that opens people&rsquo;s eyes. If a ministry is living, it must open people&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>In order to open people&rsquo;s eyes, we ourselves must have the vision and see the heavenly things. We must see the things concerning Christ, not by being taught but by having Christ appear to us. After we have seen the vision, we need to contact people, telling them that Jesus has appeared to us and that we have seen Him. Saul had his eyes opened; thus, he knew how to open the inner eyes of others. Whether or not our word, our ministry, could open other people&rsquo;s eyes depends upon how much we have seen and how much we have experienced. Hence, we should pray to the Lord that we do not want to be opaque, that we want our eyes to be opened as they have never been opened before, and that we want to have eyes like the four living creatures in the book of Revelation who have eyes everywhere, without and within (4:6, 8).</p>
 <h2 class="head4">c. To Turn Them from Darkness to Light and<br />
from the Authority of Satan to God</h2>
<p>Acts 26:18 speaks not only of the opening of the eyes but also of the turn from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God. To turn from darkness to light is to have a transfer from darkness to light, and to turn from the authority of Satan to God is to be transferred out of the authority of Satan to God. What a great transfer this is!</p>
<p>Darkness is a sign of sin and death; light is a sign of righteousness and life (John 1:4; 8:12). The authority of Satan is Satan&rsquo;s kingdom (Matt. 12:26), which belongs to darkness. Satan is the ruler of this world (John 12:31) and the ruler of the authority of the air (Eph. 2:2). He has his authority and his angels (Matt. 25:41), who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world (Eph. 6:12). Hence, Satan has his kingdom, the authority of darkness (Col. 1:13).</p>
<p>According to Acts 26:18, we are transferred from the authority of Satan to God. Actually, to be transferred to God is to be transferred to the authority of God, which is God&rsquo;s kingdom belonging to light. Formerly we were in darkness and under the authority of Satan. But we have been transferred out of darkness and the authority of Satan into light and God.</p>
<p>Darkness is actually the authority of Satan. Whenever we are in darkness, we are under the satanic authority. Light is God Himself (1 John 1:5). Therefore, when we are in the light, we are in God. Just as Satan and darkness are one, so God and light are one. The greatest transfer we can have is the transfer from darkness to light.</p><h2 class="head4">d. That They May Receive Forgiveness of Sins<br />
and an Inheritance</h2>
<p>In Acts 26:18 we see that when our eyes are opened and we have a turn, a transfer, from darkness and satanic authority to light and God, we may receive forgiveness of sins. Forgiveness of sins is the base of all the blessings of the New Testament jubilee. The genuine forgiveness of sins comes through the opening of the eyes and the transfer from Satan to God. Therefore, we need to have our eyes opened and to have a transfer from the authority of Satan to God in order to receive the complete and perfect forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>As the result of having our eyes opened and of being transferred from the authority of Satan to God, we not only have the forgiveness of sins on the negative side, but also we receive an inheritance on the positive side. This divine inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all that He has done, and all that He will do for His redeemed people. This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 2:9), who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance (1:12). The Holy Spirit, who has been given to the saints, is the foretaste, the seal, the pledge, and the guarantee of this divine inheritance (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 1:13-14), which we are sharing and enjoying today in God&rsquo;s New Testament jubilee as a foretaste and will share and enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity (1 Pet. 1:4). In the type of the jubilee in Leviticus 25:8-13, the main blessings were the liberty proclaimed and the returning of every man unto his own inheritance. In the fulfillment of the jubilee here, liberation from the authority of darkness and receiving the divine inheritance are also the primary blessings.</p>
<p>This inheritance in Acts 26:18 is Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. This Christ is the portion of the saints. In Colossians 1:12 Paul says that the Father has qualified us &ldquo;for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light.&rdquo; This portion is the &ldquo;lot,&rdquo; the inheritance, of the saints. The inheritance is a lot, and this lot is a portion. The saints are the persons who have been sanctified by God; hence, the portion of the saints in Colossians 1:12 is the portion of those who have been sanctified by faith in the Lord in Acts 26:18.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the twelve tribes of Israel each received an allotment, a portion, of the good land for an inheritance. The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ given to us as our inheritance. Therefore, Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, is our inheritance. This inheritance is the processed Triune God fully embodied in the all-inclusive person of Christ, who through resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Sanctified by Faith in Christ</h2>
<p>According to Acts 26:18, the divine inheritance is among those who have been sanctified by faith in Christ. This sanctification is not only positional but also dispositional (Rom. 6:19, 22). Sanctification (being made holy) is not only a matter of position, that is, not only a matter of being separated from a common, worldly position to a position for God, as illustrated in Matthew 23:17 and 19, where the gold is sanctified by the temple and the gift is sanctified by the altar through a change of position, and in 1 Timothy 4:3-5, where food is sanctified by the saints&rsquo; prayer. Sanctification is also a matter of disposition, that is, a matter of being transformed from the natural disposition to a spiritual one, as mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:18 and Romans 12:2. This involves a long process, beginning from regeneration (1 Pet. 1:2-3; Titus 3:5), passing through the whole Christian life (1 Thes. 4:3; Heb. 12:14; Eph. 5:26), and being completed at the time of rapture, at the maturity of life (1 Thes. 5:23).</p>
<p>To be sanctified positionally is only to have a change in position and usage; to be sanctified dispositionally is to be transformed in nature by and with the holy nature of God. Sanctification is a saturation with God as our possession for our enjoyment today. It will consummate in our maturity in the divine life so that we may resemble God and be qualified to fully possess and enjoy Him as our inheritance in the coming age and for eternity.</p>
<p>We need to pray desperately to the Lord that we want to experience Him as the content of the full, complete, perfect, and thorough gospel that He revealed to Paul as mentioned in Acts 26:18. When we pray this way, the Lord Jesus will appear to us, and His appearing will give us a vision. If we experience the whole gospel, we shall not merely be a preacher&mdash;we shall be a witness. Therefore, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, open my eyes and turn me thoroughly from all darkness to light. Turn me from the dominion of Satan unto God, and grant me a thorough forgiveness of all my sinfulness. O Lord, sanctify me that I may enjoy You as my portion among the saints.&rdquo;</p></body></html>
