   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ Laying Down</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His Soulish Life that the Sheep May Have</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 10 the Lord said, I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly, and in verse 11 He said, I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In these two verses two different Greek words are used for life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 10 the Greek word is zoe, which is the word used in the New Testament for the eternal divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 11 the Greek word is psuche, the same word for soul, which means the soulish life, that is, the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These two verses indicate that the Lord Jesus has two kinds of lives.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a man the Lord has the psuche life, the human life, and as God He has the zoe life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He laid down His soul, His psuche life, His human life, to accomplish redemption for His sheep 10:15, 17-18 that they might share His zoe life, His divine life 10:10 , the eternal life 10:28 , by which they may be formed into one flock under Himself as the one shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the good shepherd, He feeds His sheep with the divine life in this way and for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s divine life could never be slain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What was slain in His crucifixion was His human life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to be our Savior, He, as a man, laid down His human life to accomplish redemption for us that we might receive His zoe life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He laid down His human life in order that we, after being redeemed, might receive His zoe life, the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To Be Formed into One Flock by Life</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>under One Shepherd</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The shepherd, the divine life, and the human life are all for the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 16 the Lord said, And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who are the sheep that are not of this Jewish fold?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And what is this one flock?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ Eph 2:14-16; 4:6 , brought forth by life, which the Lord imparted into His members through His death John 10:10-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before, the fold was Judaism; now, the flock is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sheepfold was, and still is, Judaism, but the flock is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The flock is the church which includes two peoples the believing Jews and Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord brings both together into one flock and under one shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now, the one flock and the one shepherd are the one Body and the one Head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why are the shepherd, the divine life, and the human life all for the flock?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the people in the flock are fallen persons in need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a man, the shepherd had the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He sacrificed His human life in order to accomplish redemption for His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way His flock was redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then His flock received His divine life, and by this divine life the sheep live together as the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, the flock is formed into one unit, into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not accomplished by the human life, but by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the human life we are condemned and divided; in the divine life we are accepted and united.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the divine life we are all one entity, meaning that we are one flock under one shepherd in one life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we live by our human life and not by the divine life, we will only cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, we would become strangers and stray away from the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever you live by your human life, you are no longer a sheep but a stranger.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A sheep is a regenerated person with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all must live by the divine life and thus become genuine, real, and pure sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we shall all be in the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as we live by our human life, we will resemble a wild animal, perhaps a devouring lion or a wild horse.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not live by the divine life, there can be no flock.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The flock is produced, kept, maintained, and formed by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How good it is for brethren to dwell together in unity Psa 133:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, dwelling in unity simply means to dwell in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord that in the divine life we are truly one and love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not possible in our human, psuche life, but only in the divine, zoe life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We receive this zoe life through the redemption accomplished by our shepherd who laid down His psuche life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He sacrificed His psuche life to accomplish redemption for us all that we might receive Him as our zoe life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we are in the zoe life under one shepherd to be one flock.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not an organization; it is a flocking together in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The flock is not a matter of religion, but of life.</S>
