   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE ONENESS IN THE FOUR GREAT ACTS OF GOD Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; 2:8-9, 16-17, 22; 12:1-2; Matt 16:16-19; Eph 1:22-23; 3:9-11, 21; 4:4-6, 11-12; 5:25-27; Col 3:10-11; Rev 21:2-3; 22:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whenever we speak about the ground of the church, we find ourselves engaged in spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Satan, the enemy of God, hates this matter of the church ground, which has been concealed from the Lord's people for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ground of the church is directly related to the importance of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Certain portions of the Word such as Matthew, Ephesians, and Revelation reveal the importance of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us first consider the importance of the church as shown in these books.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we shall go on to consider the inward and outward aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This will prepare us to appreciate the oneness manifested in the four great acts of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>PLANNED IN ETERNITY PAST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Ephesians, a book on the church, we see that the church was planned by God in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the desire of His heart, God planned before time began to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the church is according to God's eternal purpose, according to the eternal plan of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although the church came into existence in time, it was planned by God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not many Christians today have a serious regard for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They tend to take the church for granted and concentrate on matters such as salvation, holiness, victory, and spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Christians do speak of the church, it is often in the way of debating or criticizing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Very few believers pay attention to the church in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many seeking Christians consider it a waste of time to devote their attention to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, in the book of Ephesians we see that the church is related to God's will and to the desire of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since the church is such a great matter in the eyes of God, we dare not take it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE BODY, THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians also reveals that the church is the Body, "the fullness of the One Who fills all in all" 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is the Body, the fullness, of the all-inclusive, infinite, unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How great the church is!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not a mere association or religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is the very Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as we need a physical body through which to express ourselves, so the infinite and unlimited Christ needs a Body as His fullness in order that He may be expressed in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Certainly this is far more important than personal salvation or spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we see that the church is the Body, the fullness, of the all-inclusive Christ, we shall never again regard it as an insignificant matter.</S>
