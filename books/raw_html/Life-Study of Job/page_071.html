<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S CORPORATE MOVE<br>REVEALED IN ACTS THROUGH REVELATION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Two Mysteries<br>Being the Contents of the Divine Economy</H2><P>This stage of God's corporate move is revealed in Acts through Revelation. This is the deepest and the most profound, heavenly, divine, spiritual, and organic section of the Bible. This section concerns God's eternal economy regarding Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church, the Body, as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4, 6). Christ is the mystery of God, and the Body of Christ is the mystery of Christ. These two mysteries are the contents of the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Processed Triune God<br>as the Consummated Spirit Being in Our Spirit</H2><P>In this section of the Word we have a full revelation concerning the Christian life. The substance, essence, element, and expression of this part of the Word are simply the processed, consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive, compound, indwelling Spirit who indwells us in our spirit to be our life, our nature, our essence, and our everything, that we may be the same as the Triune God in life and nature to be His fullness as His full expression in a corporate way.</P><P>The processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit is in our spirit. Therefore, as Christians we should remain in our spirit. We should not go to visit our flesh, and we should not befriend our soul. Our spirit is our precious place. To worldly people it is a prison, but to us it is a palace. Here in our spirit we can enjoy the processed Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Spiritual Breathing</H2><P>We need to learn to exercise our spirit. Exercising our spirit is like breathing. Even when we are resting we are still breathing. We may say that breathing signifies our exercising of our spirit. Just as we breathe without ceasing, we need to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). Every time we pray we need to pray in our spirit (Eph. 6:18). This is spiritual breathing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Deified That We May Become<br>the Corporate Expression of the Triune God</H2><P>In our spiritual breathing by the exercise of our spirit, we enjoy, receive, and absorb the divine substance with the divine essence, the divine element, and the divine expression. This will cause us to be deified, that is, to be constituted with the processed Triune God to be made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. In this sense we may speak of the deification of the believers, a process that will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</P><P>Do you know what the New Jerusalem is? The New Jerusalem is a composition of God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified people who have been deified. On God's side, the Triune God has been incarnated to be a man; on our side, we are being deified, constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God so that we may be made God in life and in nature to be His corporate expression for eternity. This is the highest truth, and this is the highest gospel.</P>
