   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"But of Him you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is absolutely something that God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet we did not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order for us to know, there was the need for the church to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church announces to men this earth-shaking fact, that God has put men into Christ; when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, God judged Him, and men were also judged in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, judgment is over as far as men are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The gospel tells us that God has done something in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It tells us that God has included us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He dealt with Christ, He also dealt with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have been dealt with in Him already.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has solved the problem of sin as well as the problem of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank the Lord that we died in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why Romans 6:11 says, "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are dead in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What do we do after we hear such a fact?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are persons with a will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we believe in this fact, we should have some kind of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we want to be baptized after we believe in the Lord and are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the meaning of baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being baptized is being in Christ Jesus and being in His death Rom 6:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, God has put us into Christ, but we have to do something to show others that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our baptism demonstrates to others the way we get into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are baptized into the water, do we remain in the water?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No, we come out of it quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our coming out of the water signifies that we have been resurrected with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whoever comes out of the water testifies that he has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, our baptism is a reenactment of the work that God accomplished for us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a performance to show others what God did for us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a spiritual performance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Christ was on the cross, God put us in Christ and terminated the old man in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God had to terminate Adam; that account had to be settled and closed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We were men in Adam, and we could only be delivered from Adam through death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we are joined to the death of Christ, we are terminated and delivered from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the first aspect of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second aspect of God's work is to put Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "Who became wisdom to us from God."</S>
