   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S OPERATION AND OUR COOPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the one hand, we work out our own salvation; on the other hand, God operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 13 Paul exclaims, For it is God who operates in you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God operates in us, and we cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that we work out our salvation according to God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the very time a sister is murmuring or a brother is reasoning, God operates to enable them to work out their salvation from murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we turn to the Lord and say, O Lord Jesus, I love You, we are saved from murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek word rendered operates can also be translated energizes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is energizing us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because it is not easy for us to experience God s salvation in many situations, He energizes us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, a brother may be very strong in his reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If this brother is to work out his own salvation from reasonings, he needs God to energize him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In creating the heavens and the earth God simply had to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But to rescue us from murmurings and reasonings, it is necessary for Him to energize us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that it is more difficult for Him to save us from murmurings and reasonings than it was for Him to create the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God wanted to create something, He simply spoke, and that thing came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, if He tells us not to murmur or reason, we may not pay attention.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, there is a wrestling inwardly between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Have you not wrestled with God many times?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This wrestling is a proof that it is difficult for God to rescue us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to rescue us without damaging us, He energizes within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Christian life is a wrestling life, a life of wrestling with the God who operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The very God who operates in us is the supplying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again and again we have pointed out that in 1:19 Paul says that his circumstances will turn out to his salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If God does not operate in us, it will not be possible for us to experience the supply from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God operates in us in order to bring to us the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not mere doctrine; it is a fact of spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CHRIST MAGNIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the bountiful supply of the Spirit, Christ is magnified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What Paul speaks of in 1:20 is the magnification of Christ, but in 2:16 he speaks of holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Holding forth the word of life is equal to magnifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ Himself is the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We hold forth the word of life, and this word is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE SPIRIT, GOD, CHRIST, AND THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am very fond of these two portions of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, we see from chapter one that it is possible for our environment to turn out to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, we see from chapter two that we need to work out our salvation by cooperating with God s energizing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, according to our fallen disposition, our tendency is to go contrary to God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need God to operate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then if we cooperate with Him, we shall work out our instant salvation and hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be impressed with the fact that the Spirit in 1:19 equals God in 2:13, and that Christ in 1:20 and 21 equals the word of life in 2:16.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, the Spirit, God, Christ, and the word of life are one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have seen that in order to magnify Christ and to live Christ, we need the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we must go on to see that this bountiful supply is stored in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the Bible, the Spirit and the Word are one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus says, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that the Word is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ephesians 6:17-18 indicates that the Spirit is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every word of the Bible is the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have pointed out that this breath is the pneuma, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, because both the Word and the Spirit are the breath of God, they are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Spirit is the breath of God, and the Word also is God s breath.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, God s breath is His pneuma, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, the Word of God is the Spirit; on the other hand, the Spirit of God is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From our experience we know that we can contact the Spirit and experience the moving of the Spirit within us by saying, O Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This inner moving of the Spirit often issues in a word from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, suppose a brother is unhappy with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But he turns to the Lord and says, Lord Jesus, I love You, and the Spirit moves within him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then this moving of the Spirit becomes a word to him: Do not think of your wife in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First the brother contacts the Spirit; then the Spirit becomes the word uttered within him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, this word becomes a light shining from within the brother, causing him to hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At other times in our experience we first receive the Word, and then the Word becomes the Spirit moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whether we first experience the Spirit and then the Word, or first the Word and then the Spirit, the Spirit and the Word are one.</S>
