<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. By Receiving the Spirit from Christ<br>Not by Measure</H2><P>We also receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ by receiving the Spirit from Him not by measure (John 3:34b). If the Spirit whom we receive from Christ were measurable or limited, He would not be adequate for us to enjoy. The Spirit whom we receive of Christ is without measure and is unlimited. Not only the Spirit is without measure, but the receiving of this Spirit also is without measure. Hence, the enjoyment of Christ is unlimited.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. By Drinking the Living Water Which Christ Gives<br>and Which Becomes in Us a Spring of Water<br>Gushing Up into Eternal Life, through<br>Worshipping God as the Spirit in Our Spirit</H2><P>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ is by drinking the living water which He gives and which becomes in us a spring of water gushing up into eternal life, through worshipping God as the Spirit in our spirit (John 4:10, 14, 24). As we drink the living water, it becomes a spring of water within us, gushing up into eternal life. To drink the living water is to drink eternal life. According to the clear revelation of the New Testament, eternal life is God embodied in Christ and dispensed into us by the Spirit (11:25; 14:6; 16:13-15). Thus, eternal life is the Triune God Himself. We are drinking the Triune God, and our drinking is counted by God as our worship of Him.</P><P>According to John 4, to drink Christ as the living water is the genuine worship to God (vv. 10, 14, 24). The real worship of God is not to give something to Him or to kneel down before Him; the real worship of God is our enjoyment of Him by drinking Him. The more we enjoy Him, the more we worship Him. The angels may sing to God, but they do not have the capacity to receive Him. God's real desire is to have some who will drink Him. Man was made with a capacity to receive God and to drink Him as the living water. This is the real worship of God.</P><P>In the night in which He was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread, and having given thanks, He broke it and said, "This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me." Similarly, He took the cup also and said, "This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me" (1 Cor. 11:23-25). Our eating and drinking of Christ are our remembrance of Him, and our remembrance of the Lord is our worship to Him as the processed Triune God. Eating and drinking Christ is the way to worship Him, and it is also the way to receive, experience, and enjoy Him.</P>
