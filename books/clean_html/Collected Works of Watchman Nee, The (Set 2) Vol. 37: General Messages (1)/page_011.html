<h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>Romans 8:5-6 says, "For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit. For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace." What is the mind of the flesh? One characteristic of the mind of the flesh is to believe in ourselves, to think that we know everything, and to be confident of everything. The mind of the spirit also has its characteristic, which is to have no trust in ourselves, to be hesitant and fearful in saying or doing anything. The mind of the flesh is always busy and quick; it always considers itself to be very clever. Yet it does not have any rest, and the result is death. The mind of the spirit is not under the control of natural wisdom; it is under the control of God's command. It does not have any confidence in the flesh and does not act according to the idea of the mind. The result is life and peace. Hence, our "head" must be saved before we can be free from the control of the fleshly mind and before we can have the mind of the spirit. Only then will we have life and peace.</p><h2 class="head1">SIX</h2><p>Paul said, "Not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you" (1 Cor. 1:12). Please pay attention to the last phrase "and more abundantly toward you." The Corinthians were very wise. But Paul said that he did not conduct himself in the world in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God and more abundantly toward them. Thank the Lord that the more wise and judicious we are, the more we do not need to use our wisdom. We trust in the grace of God. This is all the more true when it comes to the things of God and the affairs of the church; we do not need fleshly wisdom or fleshly cleverness.</p><p>We have to learn to never bring our secular mind into the consideration of spiritual affairs. I do not know if your secular mind is useful in other things or not, but I do know one thing, a secular mind is definitely not useful in spiritual things. Your secular ways, tactics, strategies, and cleverness may be useful in other things, but they are absolutely useless in spiritual things. In the house of God, it is not a matter of man's ways or cleverness but a matter of God's will. Only one thing counts here; it is not what man says or thinks but what God has said. We need to ask the Lord, "God, what is the pattern that You want to show me?" Other than the pattern that He shows us, we cannot have another pattern. We have to learn to obey God's will and give up trusting in our own wisdom. While we are obeying God's will, we should look to Him to carry us through all the difficulties that we face in doing His will. From now on, we should look to God so that we can conduct ourselves in the world not in fleshly wisdom but in His grace and so we can obey His will.</p>
