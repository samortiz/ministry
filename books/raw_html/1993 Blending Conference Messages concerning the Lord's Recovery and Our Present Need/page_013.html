<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Eternal Life</H2><P>We need to see what life is and what life does. The divine life, the eternal life, can be considered as the first and the basic attribute of God. This life is the eternal life. This is not just everlasting life added to your life to make it last forever. Eternal denotes not only duration of time, which is everlasting, without end, but also quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect. The quality of this life is complete. It is perfect in everything. This life is also the uncreated life. God presented this uncreated life to man when He created him. Many lives were created by God, but He Himself is the uncreated life. He is life eternal, without beginning and without ending.</P><P>This life is also the divine life, the very life of God. Ephesians 4:18 is the unique verse that speaks of the life of God. It speaks of being estranged, alienated, from the life of God. We do not ever want to be alienated from the life of God. We like to be those who are daily participating in, enjoying, and living the very life of God. This life is in us, and it is a divine life, so it is making us divine.</P><P>This life is incorruptible. The Lord Himself as the King of the ages is incorruptible (1 Tim. 1:17). Nothing can damage Him. This life is also indestructible. God's enemy made every effort to destroy this life, but this life could never be destroyed.</P><P>This life is a person, the very Triune God&#151;the Father in the Son as the Spirit. The Father is life, because the Bible says the Father has life in Himself (John 5:26). The Son is life, because He said, "I am..the life" (John 14:6). The Spirit is life, because according to Romans 8:2 He is the Spirit of life. The term the Spirit of life means that the Spirit is life.</P><P>Now that we have seen what this life is, we need to see what this life does. The very Triune God is to be life to His redeemed children with which they are regenerated, renewed, transformed, conformed to His glorious image, and glorified with Himself as the glory. The first real experience of life is His regenerating us (John 1:12-13; 3:5-6). When He put this life within us, that was our initial experience of the life of God. This life also renews us (Titus 3:5). Life is always new (Rom. 6:4b); it never grows old. This life is also transforming us (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2). It is not improving us in an outward way but is metabolically transforming us from within by operating in us all the time. Eventually, this life will conform us to His glorious image (Rom. 8:29; Phil. 3:21). Finally, we will be glorified with Himself as the glory (Rom. 8:30c; Heb. 2:10a). All of this is accomplished by this marvelous life. The truth concerning the eternal life is a great and crucial point of the major items in the Lord's recovery.</P>
