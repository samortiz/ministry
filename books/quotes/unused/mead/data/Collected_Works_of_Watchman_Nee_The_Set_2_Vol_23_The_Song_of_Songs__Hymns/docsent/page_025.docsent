   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Silent Answer 4:9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 9 says, "Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the first time the King calls her his spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By this time, her mind is completely one with the King.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why the King considers her to be a person to whom he can commit himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At this point she is able to participate in everything that the King does.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At this point her love reaches a degree that is above the ordinary and becomes pure to the point that a marriage relationship is sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The most important thing to remember is that she has passed through countless dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By this time everything that is manifested in her is of the new creation, and she can satisfy the King's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The main reason that she can be the King's spouse is that the King loves her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The King can love her unreservedly because the Holy Spirit has worked on her to the extent that she has become altogether lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the first time the King calls her "my sister."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because she now possesses the same nature as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One Heb 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abraham's wife was his sister, and Isaac married a sister of his own household.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The difference between Jacob and Esau is that one married a Gentile, while the other married a sister of his mother's household.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, Christ's love is lavished on those who have the same life as He, and who come from the same Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Thou hast ravished my heart."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This can be translated as "Thou hast given me courage" see ASV, margin .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The King is saying, "You have encouraged me to love you; you have encouraged me to draw near to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have encouraged me to be satisfied with you and to lead you on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have encouraged me because you have answered my demands and because you have said what your eyes have said.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When your eyes look at me, they say that you are willing to come with me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In an atmosphere of love, the eyes say much more than the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Did not the Lord speak to Peter with His eyes Luke 22:61 ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Outsiders cannot understand the language of the eyes, but love can comprehend the intentions of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only have the maiden's eyes revealed her desire for Him, but the chain on her neck has shown Him her answer as well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The chain on the neck is a symbol of submission to God's instruction Prov 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She has encouraged Him by her submission to the teaching of the Holy Spirit and by the moral edification which the Holy Spirit has wrought in her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She has caused Him to love her and to know that He can lead her on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. Inward Relationship 4:10-15</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 10 says, "How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It seems that prior to this, he never praised her love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Love is an expressed sentiment, and it is different from the two breasts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God attracts men with His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He placed His Son on earth and invited men to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through Christ God manifested His love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When men are attracted to Christ, they respond to God's invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When men express their love to Christ, they are answering God's invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Love is man's answer to God's love manifested through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man's love toward Christ is his response to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Love is expressed more and more perfectly as believers consecrate themselves time after time and as they are dealt with again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord sees that the believers no longer set their mind on earthly things, but on the heavenly things in their experience, He will say, "How fair is thy love...how much better is thy love than wine!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the maiden praised the King's love in 1:2, she only said that his love was better than wine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the King's praise of the maiden, he says that her love is much better than wine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From this we see that the believers' appreciation of the Lord's love cannot match the Lord's appreciation of the believers' love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although we treasure the Lord's love, we cannot comprehend how precious His love is toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the Lord loves us so deeply, He can appreciate our love and His heart can be satisfied with our love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We know the story of David and Jonathan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"They kissed one another, and wept one with another" 1 Sam 20:41 , until David won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our Lord is the One who has the preeminence over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even in loving us, He takes the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"The smell of thine ointments is better than all spices!"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The maiden has the King's ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The King is anointed with the Holy Spirit, and the maiden is also anointed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The ointment on Aaron's head flows to the skirts of his garments.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the emphasis here is not just on the ointment, but on the fragrance of the ointment, which implies the effect of the anointing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The word "smell" can be translated "fragrance."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>See Darby's New Translation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Fragrance is something that eyes cannot see and ears cannot hear.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But it is something that one can smell.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The most difficult thing in the world to explain is fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Language cannot explain fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Is it not true that others are touched not by something that can be seen or heard, but by a special, spiritual flavor which emanates from the believers who are with them?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You cannot give a name to this flavor; this is their fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is the result of a life of submission to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This fragrance far exceeds all human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes we can identify virtues in an unbeliever which excel that of a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can identify many natural virtues that some believers possess, but none of these can be compared to the fragrance that comes forth from a life that is molded by the Holy Spirit.</S>
