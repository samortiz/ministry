   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We should not allow anything or anyone, including ourselves, to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He Himself must be everything in us and to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ has a big key to open the treasury of all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When He opens the treasury, no one will shut.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He shuts the treasury, no one will open.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the One who can open up to us all the riches of God embodied in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He can also shut the door to these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes we experience the door of the divine treasures being open to us to flood into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But at other times we may do something to offend the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we have the sensation that the door is shut and that the riches coming to us are stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His opening and His shutting are all for one thing the enjoyment of His riches as the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe the direct application of Isaiah 22:22 is this Christ has the key to control the door of God's treasury, in which are the riches of God in Christ for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have experienced both His opening of these riches to us and His shutting up of these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When He shuts up these riches, we have the feeling of being dried up or inwardly deprived.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our experience indicates that Christ is the One who has the key to all of His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ONE WHOM GOD DRIVES</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AS A PEG NAIL INTO A SURE PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE HEAVENS INTO WHICH CHRIST WAS EXALTED</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the One whom God drives as a peg, or nail, into a sure place Isa 22:23a .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In typology, the sure place typifies the third heaven cf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2 Cor 12:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ was raised up from the dead, and He was exalted to the third heaven where God is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, to be exalted to the third heaven is to be exalted to God the Father because the Father is in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Luke 15:18 the Lord Jesus relates the story of the prodigal son saying, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Against heaven equals before you God the Father .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sinning against heaven is sinning before God because God the Father is in heaven Matt 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Heaven, referring to the heavens, is the sure place where God the Father is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without the book of Isaiah, we would not know that when God exalted Christ, God drove Him as a peg into the place where He is, the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ today is in the heavens as a peg driven into God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the peg upon which all of us hang.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes when I was in a plane flying to another locality, the devil injected a thought into me that the plane in which I was flying would drop.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My response to this thought was, "I am not actually in this plane; I am in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, I am not hanging on the plane; I am hanging on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is the peg on which I hang.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sisters may think that they are hanging on their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They need to realize that their husbands are not good, trustworthy "hangers."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The best hanger is Christ who has been driven into God in the heavenlies.</S>
