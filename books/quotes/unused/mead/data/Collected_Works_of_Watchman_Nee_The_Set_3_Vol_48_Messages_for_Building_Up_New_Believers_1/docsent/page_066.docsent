   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Pray</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the early morning we should fellowship, praise, and gather the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must also pray to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalms 63:1 KJV and 78:34 KJV both say that we should seek the Lord early.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The prayer spoken of in the previous paragraph is a kind of blending prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the prayer we are talking about here is more specific.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After one fellowships, praises, and eats manna, he has strength and can present everything in prayer before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Prayer surely requires much strength.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One must first draw near to God early in the morning and be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then he can set aside about half an hour or a quarter of an hour to pray for a few urgent things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He can pray for himself, for the church, or for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, he can pray also in the afternoon or at night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if he takes advantage of the fresh power he has gained, the power acquired in the early morning through fellowshipping with God and eating manna, he will receive greater support.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every believer should do these four things conscientiously before the Lord early in the morning: fellowship with Him, praise Him, read the Bible, and pray to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether or not a person has done these four things in the morning is manifested in his walk during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>George M ller confessed that the degree to which he was fed by the Lord in the morning determined his spiritual condition throughout the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His spiritual condition for the day depended on his feeding before the Lord in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Christians find themselves weak during the day because their mornings are ill spent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, there are those who are so far ahead in their spiritual journey that they can experience the total separation of the spirit from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their outward man is broken, and they are not that easily shaken by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this is another matter altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>New believers should learn to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once they become loose in this, they become loose in everything, and everything will go wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a great difference between being nourished and not being nourished in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A very famous musician once said, "If I skip practicing for one day, I will notice it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I skip practicing for two days, my friends will notice it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I skip practicing for three days, my audience will notice it."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If this is true for practicing music, it is even more true for the spiritual lesson of rising up early.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we fail to have a good morning watch before God, we will know it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who are experienced in the Lord also will know it when they come into contact with us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They will know that we have not touched the spiritual source.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From the very first day, new believers should strictly discipline themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every morning they should rise up early to exercise this way before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE PRACTICE OF EARLY RISING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Finally, we should speak a little about actual ways to implement this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can we rise up early?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to pay attention to a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All early risers must have the habit of going to bed early.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No one can stay up late and rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is like burning a candle at both ends.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not set too high a standard for rising.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people want to rise up at three or four o'clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they find out that they cannot make it, they quit after a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is better to take a moderate course.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Five or six o'clock is a suitable time to get up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Get up when the sun is about to rise or has just risen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Always get up around sunrise.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If one tries to get up too early, his practice may not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>An unreasonably high standard will only result in a condemned conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some people have set too high a standard for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They get into problems with their family or their work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When they take hospitality at the homes of others, they get into problems with their hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not a profitable thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our standard should be reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We do not advocate extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not set too high a standard for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Before the Lord you should consider carefully the proper time for you to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You should take into consideration your physical limitations as well as the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Set your standard accordingly and keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may face a little difficulty at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is always easy the first and second day.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the third day is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You will find it easy for the first few days.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But after a few days, you will love the bed so much that you will not want to get up at all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is especially true in winter.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It takes a long time for us to build up a new habit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Perhaps you are used to getting up late, and your mind has been used to getting up late.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if you rise up early a few times, your mind will gradually adjust to getting up early.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After you do this for a few days, you will not want to go back to sleep even if your mind is telling you to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the beginning you will need to force yourself a little in order to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Before a habit is built up, you need to ask God for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Continue to ask until this habit is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Try to do this again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Give up your bed daily to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the end you will rise up early spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You must build up this habit before God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You must not miss the grace of fellowship early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A healthy person does not need more than eight hours of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do not think that you are an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do not worry that early rising will affect your health.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It may be your anxiety which is affecting your health.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Many people love themselves too much and worry themselves to sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You may need ten or twelve hours of sleep if the doctor says that you are ill.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But six to eight hours of sleep are sufficient for a normal person.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, do not go to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Maintain at least six to eight hours of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We do not expect those who are sick to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you are sick, it is all right for you to lie on your bed in the morning and read your Bible there.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, those who are not advised by doctors to stay in bed and who are not really sick should rise up early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We hope those who are mature and weighty in the Lord will uphold this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The church should push the sluggard ones to go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They should be shaken up a little.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We should usher the new believers into this great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You should take every chance to ask the new ones, "What time do you get up every day?"</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After a few days, you have to ask them again, "What time did you get up this morning?"</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This kind of reminding should go on for at least a year into a person's initial Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>After a year, you may still need to ask, "Brother, what time do you rise up now?"</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Ask the new believers whenever you see them.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>You need to go to them and render them some help in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>However, if we have not learned the lesson well before the Lord, it will be hard for us to do this to others.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is why we must first learn this lesson well ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Early rising should be a believer's first habit among all habits.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Giving thanks before meals is a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Meeting together on the Lord's Day is also a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Rising up early is even more an essential habit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>A new believer needs to build up this habit.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is unfortunate that some have been Christians for years and yet have never enjoyed the blessing of early rising.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>They have never enjoyed the grace of early rising.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If we want to experience this grace, we have to learn this lesson well.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If more brothers and sisters will come together to learn this lesson, and if everyone will rise up early in the morning, the church will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When one brother receives more light, the whole church will receive more shining.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When everyone receives a little more light each day, the church as a whole will become richer.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The church is poor today because too few people are receiving their supply from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If everyone receives something from the Head, however little it may seem to be, the culmination of all the little portions will make the whole very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We do not wish to see only a minority of people working in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We hope to see all the members rising up before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We hope to see the whole church rising up to receive God's riches and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>What one member receives from the Head becomes the profit of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If every brother and sister takes this way, there will be many containers before God, and we will be richer and richer as the days go by.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We hope that you will not consider early rising as a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we all learn to rise up early, and if we all maintain this habit, we will have a bright spiritual future ahead of us.</S>
