It is similar in content to the article "The Numbering of Spiritual Days" published in Issue No. 47 of Notes on Scriptural Messages and reprinted in The Collected Works, Volume 19. However, there are variations in the arrangement of the material in these two articles. Since we do not have the assurance that this message is based on the same spoken message, we have included it in this volume.)</p><p>In the Psalms, Moses prayed to God, "Teach us then to number our days/That we may gain a heart of wisdom." If our days are numbered according to the calendar, then a day is a day and a year is a year; this is easy to understand. But if we take God's view, then some years and days will be numbered, while others will not be numbered. Our days on earth are limited. How should we please God within such a limited number of years and days? How can each day and each year of our life be counted? This is the subject of our study.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>There are two genealogies in Genesis 4 and 5. Chapter four is the genealogy of Cain, while chapter five is the genealogy of Seth. The way that the two genealogies are recorded is different. Cain's genealogy is very simple; it does not record the age of Cain and his descendants. Seth's genealogy is much more detailed; it tells us how old each person was when he begot offspring and how many years he lived. It records the ages of generation after generation. Based on the fact that one genealogy is simple and the other is detailed, we can trace God's principle in numbering our days. Cain's genealogy was simple because he offended God and was far away from God. He did not have any fellowship with God. Seth's genealogy was detailed because Seth replaced Abel and was acceptable to God; he fellowshipped with God. Hence, our spiritual days are reckoned according to our condition before the Lord. When we were far from God and dead in sin, our days were not reckoned in the sight of the Lord. But when we repented, turned to God, and began to fellowship with Him, our spiritual days began.</p><p>When the Israelites left Egypt, God commanded them, saying, "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you" (Exo. 12:2). The first month is the beginning of the year; it is the starting point of reckoning. In this month the Israelites killed the Passover lamb, left Egypt, and freed themselves from the bondage of Pharaoh. Hence, God charged them to call this month the first month. From this month forward, the Israelites had a new beginning before the Lord.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, how much spiritual history do you have? Some of you are quite old; you may be fifty or sixty years old. But spiritually, you are still only one year or even one month old. Your spiritual age began the day you were regenerated and saved. The day you received the Lord's salvation was the day your spiritual history began. Before that day, no spiritual years were counted before the Lord. However, even after you believed in the Lord, one year does not necessarily mean one year. You may have been a Christian for five years, but in the eyes of God, you may not be five years old as a Christian. In other words, even after you become a Christian, some days and years are not counted in God's sight. We can see from the Bible that some years were skipped over because God considered them to be wasted, and they could not be counted. He also records some years in the Bible to serve as our warning. We will consider the following passages and draw some lessons from them.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 38: General Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
