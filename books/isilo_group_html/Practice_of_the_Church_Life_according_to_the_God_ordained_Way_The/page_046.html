As God, He was free, without any limitation. But He intentionally entered into humanity to conceal Himself in a human shell. He remained in the womb for nine months. After being born, He lived as a man for thirty years, apparently doing nothing that was noteworthy. After the three and a half years of His ministry, He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive, complicated death. He entered into death, and He remained there. Then He came out of death and entered into resurrection. In His resurrection, as a man in the flesh, the last Adam, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). How many troubles He experienced in the "tunnel" of His process!</P><P>Not only so, God's angels are millions, perhaps even billions, in number. Furthermore, all the angels are mighty. Why would God not use the angels to visit all the corners of the backward countries to proclaim the gospel to them? The angels do not need transportation. They do not need cars or trains, and they do not need to learn a language. How easy it would be if God would use the angels to preach the gospel. But God would not take the easy way. For the preaching of the gospel, God put all the angels aside. He prefers to use dumb human beings, who are slow to act and stupid in learning.</P><P>We need to remember that whenever we come together, we are playing like a team. Whether the number of saints gathered is one thousand or only ten, every attendant is a member of the team. None of us should hide himself so that he becomes a spectator. Whenever we come to a meeting, we must act, behave, and move in the meeting as a transformed person. Some of the saints are very clever by birth. Such clever ones like to hide themselves in the meetings. Others are stupid by birth. Eventually, it is the stupid ones who act, who shout, in the meetings. Actually, the stupid ones should learn to restrict their activity. They need to realize that they were born stupid under God's sovereignty. God did this for a purpose.</P><P>I have been handling the English language for more than seventy years, but still my speaking in English is poor. I do not know why God came to me and charged me with a commission to speak His Word. Often I have prayed, "Lord, You know that my speaking in English is poor." Eventually, I realized that this was of the Lord. If I were eloquent in speaking English, my ministry would be different. The "color" and weight of my ministry would be changed. God purposely chose a stupid speaker.</P><P>Giving a message does not depend on our eloquence. To be eloquent is one thing; to be able to present the truth to people is another thing. You may be very eloquent, smart, and excellent in speaking, yet after your speaking you may not have released the truth. On the other hand, a person may be very stupid, but in giving a message he may do a good work in presenting the truth. After hearing one of my messages, a young man stood up and said, "Yes, Brother Lee is not eloquent, but after his speaking, we always have a clear view concerning a certain truth." Although we may be stupid ones who were born stupid, God will use us. But we need to learn. Realizing that we are stupid, we should not act so much and so easily. Rather, we should desire and endeavor to learn.</P><P>Those who were born smart, on the other hand, must learn to put their cleverness to death. The compound Spirit applies the Lord's death to us. All the clever ones need the compound Spirit to apply the Lord's death to their cleverness. Some of the clever ones hide themselves in the meetings. They would not do or say anything until they are certain that they would be a "star." That is wrong. God uses the clever ones, and He also uses the stupid ones. But we all need to be terminated; we all need to be crucified, to be crossed out. Both the clever ones and the stupid ones need to be dealt with. If the clever ones allow their cleverness to be crossed out, they will no longer perform in the meetings like actors; they will simply live, act, work, move, and do things in a normal way.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
