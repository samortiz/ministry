"Gave them authority." This refers to the powers of the age to come. The Lord wants the disciples to preach the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens, so He does the things of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Verses 2-4:There were twelve apostles divided into six pairs: Simon and Andrew, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, James and Thaddaeus, and Simon and Judas. The arrangement in Luke 6 is a little different because the emphasis there is on the selecting; Luke 9 is on the sending.</P><P>Peter means "a rock." Most likely Bartholomew was Nathanael. "Matthew the tax collector." Only in this Gospel is Matthew specifically designated "the tax collector." Matthew recorded this in remembrance of his salvation. It seems that he was writing this with tears. "Betrayed Him" may be rendered "delivered Him up." Some say "Iscariot" is Issachar. Issachar means "one who is exchanged for a price" (Gen. 30:18). Therefore, Judas Iscariot can be rendered "Judas the trader." Judas was good at doing business; he treated his Teacher as goods. Iscariot means "a man of Kerioth." Kerioth was the name of a place in Judah. Among the twelve apostles, only Judas was from Judea; all the rest were Galileans.</P><P>Verses 5-6:Their going out this time was to work entirely among the children of Israel. Although the Israelites rejected the Lord, He still sent forth His disciples to preach the gospel of the kingdom to them. Here "Israel" includes all the twelve tribes. Why does it say "the lost sheep of the house of Israel"? Because in God's eyes, in a sense, Israel is lost.</P><P>Verses 7-8:"Heal the sick...cast out demons." These are powers of the age to come. "Freely give." This means that the spiritual power of the gospel is not sold for money.</P><P>Verses 9-10:Here the word "sandals" is plural. The word for "worker" is the same as that in 9:37-38, but it is singular here.</P><P>Verse 11:"And into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and there remain until you depart." "Who in it is worthy" means "who in it is suitable."</P><P>Verse 14:"And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet." To "shake off the dust from your feet" is to show that you have nothing to do with any place that rejects Christ.</P><P>Verse 15:"Truly I say to you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city." This shows us that God's punishment is in varying degrees. Rejecting Christ will result in a more severe punishment than committing many serious sins.</P><P>The Lord told the disciples to go out without money or bag or sandals or a staff. This principle applies to going to the house of Israel, not to the Gentiles. The principle of preaching to the Gentiles is "taking nothing from the Gentiles" (3 John 7). Either receive the provision from the believers, or provide for your own needs. This way of going out without money or staff to the house of Israel also has a time limit (Luke 22:35-38).</P><P>Here, according to the text, we also realize that this is not the principle in preaching the gospel to the Gentiles: (1) Verse 5 clearly says, "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles." (2) "Find out who in it is worthy" (v. 11). To preach the gospel to the Gentiles is to preach to those who are unworthy. (3) "If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it" (v. 13). Since the Gentiles were not yet reconciled to God, how could there be a house for which they could plead peace?</P><P>Here are several principles that can be applied today to the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles: (1) freely receiving and freely giving, (2) trusting in the Lord to supply our needs, and (3) taking nothing from those who do not receive salvation.</P><P>Verse 16:"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be therefore prudent as serpents and guileless as doves." Here, the Lord mentioned not only the serpents but also the doves. The Lord did not say that we should be like serpents; rather, He said that we should be prudent as serpents. This means that we should not provoke others in a senseless way that causes us to suffer loss. To be guileless is to be harmless. The meaning here is that in the midst of the evil ones we need to be prudent, lest we be hurt senselessly; however, neither should we try to make gains for ourselves by hurting others.</P><P>Verses 17-20:The apostles would suffer persecution.</P><P>Verse 21: "And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death." For the sake of the gospel we must break the closest relationships we have on this earth. Because of the Lord's greatness men will rise up against us.</P><P>Verse 22:"And you will be hated by all because of My name. But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved." There are many people who are hated by others, but how many are hated because of the Lord's name? If there is no tribulation, there is no joy. There is nothing on earth that gives people joy more than tribulations (Rom. 5:3). If one does not have a heart to obey the Lord, he cannot suffer for the Lord. "He who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved." This is very different from Acts 16:31. The latter is spoken to sinners, the former, to workers. Here, to be saved may mean to be saved from the wicked ones, or it may mean to be saved in the kingdom age, that is, to receive a reward in the millennium. Here, most probably it refers to receiving the reward.</P><P>The three aspects of salvation are: (1) in the present age, (2) in the kingdom age, and (3) in the new heaven and new earth.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
