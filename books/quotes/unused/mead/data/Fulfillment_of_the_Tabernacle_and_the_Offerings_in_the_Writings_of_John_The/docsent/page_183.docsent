   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 15 Scripture Reading: John 17:1-10, 22-24; 7:39; 12:23, 28; 13:31-32; 14:13; 15:8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the mysterious sign of the divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to know the significance of this sign, we need to understand what glory is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the natural human concept, glory is related to having a high position with honor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, a man wins an election for the office of President, and now he has the glory of occupying this high, honorable position.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we should set aside this natural concept of glory when we read about glory in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE EXPRESSION OF THE DIVINE LIFE WITH ITS NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the Scriptures, glory is the expression of the divine life with its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us once again use a carnation seed as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A carnation seed does not have any glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After such a seed is sown into the soil, it will grow into a plant, and eventually this plant will blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The blossoming of a carnation flower is the expression of the glory concealed in the life and nature of a carnation seed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A carnation seed has its particular life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When this life and nature are released through the blossoming of the flower, we see the glory of a carnation plant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The carnation blossom is the glory, and this glory is the expression of the life and nature of a carnation plant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the blossom is the glory, the blossoming is the glorification of the carnation plant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, when a carnation blossoms, it is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we have both the glory and the glorification of the carnation plant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE LORD'S PRAYER CONCERNING HIS GLORIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to John 17:1, the Lord Jesus prayed, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we see glorification as the subject of the Lord's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was God incarnate, and His flesh was a tabernacle for God's dwelling on earth John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God's shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory Matt 17:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But it was concealed again in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before the prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord had indicated that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him John 12:23; 13:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord knew that He would pass through death that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken so that His divine element, His divine life, might be released.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He would also resurrect so that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then His entire being, both divinity and humanity, would be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way the Father would be glorified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 17:5 the Lord Jesus went on to say, "And now, glorify Me with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before His incarnation, the Lord as the only begotten Son of God was with the Father in glory and enjoyed this glory with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when He put on flesh through incarnation, this glory was concealed in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His humanity was a shell that covered and confined the divine life and nature, along with the divine glory, that were within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The divine glory, the expression of the divine life and the divine nature, was therefore confined and concealed within the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Outwardly, He appeared to be a Jew, even a despised Galilean and a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was the appearance of the shell of the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But within this shell the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine glory were confined and concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the Lord lived, walked, and worked among the people, His disciples saw in Him something that had never been seen by men before.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yes, the Lord who lived among them was a man, but He lived in such a way that He expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He expressed God's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What the disciples saw in the Lord Jesus was the expression of the divine life and nature that were within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In his Gospel the Apostle John regards this expression as glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to John 17:6 the Lord said to the Father, "I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were Yours, and You gave them to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Son came and worked in the Father's name 5:43; 10:25 to manifest the Father to those whom the Father had given Him and to make the Father's name known to them 17:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, for the Lord to make known to them the Father's name was for Him to express the Father in His divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord lived among the disciples in such a way that He expressed the Father, and this expression was a matter of glorification.</S>
