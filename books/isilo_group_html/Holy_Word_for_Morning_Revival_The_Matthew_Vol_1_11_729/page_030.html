Whatever they do in secret for the Father&#8217;s kingdom is seen in secret by the Father, and He will repay them. Their heavenly Father&#8217;s seeing in secret must be an incentive to doing their righteous deeds in secret. So in vv. 6 and 18.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>[In Matthew 6:1-18] the Lord uses three illustrations-the giving of alms, praying, and fasting-to reveal how we are filled with the self and the flesh. Man&#8217;s flesh, seeking to glorify itself, always wants to do good deeds before men in order to gain men&#8217;s praise. But the kingdom people, who live in an emptied and humbled spirit and walk in a pure and single heart under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom...must do all things in the spirit to please their heavenly Father.</p><p>To the kingdom people God is not only their God but also their Father....Hence, the new law of the kingdom...is given to them...that they should keep it not by their fallen human life but by the Father&#8217;s eternal, divine life, not to gain man&#8217;s glory but to receive the Father&#8217;s reward.</p><p>Regarding each of the three illustrations, the Lord uses the word &#8220;secret&#8221; (vv. 4, 6, 18). We must do our righteous deeds in secret, for our Father is in secret....The effect of doing our righteous deeds in secret is that the self and the flesh are killed.</p><p>Although the Lord speaks about the matter of reward (vv. 1, 5), the important thing here is not the reward, but the growth in life....We all need some secret growth in life, some secret experiences of Christ...because such experiences kill our self and our flesh.</p><p>No matter what kind of righteous deeds we do-giving material things to the saints, praying, fasting, doing something to please God-we must try our best to do them in secret.
