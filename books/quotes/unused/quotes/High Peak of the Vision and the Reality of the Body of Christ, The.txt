O Lord, we come, on the one hand, to worship You and thank You, and on the other hand, to confess to You our shortcomings and failures
O Lord, whenever we come into Your presence, as You taught us in Your prayer, we cannot forget that Your enemy is still here
O Lord, even more, we ask You to cover us with Your prevailing, precious blood and resist for us his attacks and disturbances
Tonight we will fellowship concerning the high peak of the vision that the Lord has shown us in these more than seventy years
Concerning the church, the Lord showed us, on the negative side, that Christianity and Catholicism are altogether degraded and deformed
On the positive side, the Lord also led Brother Nee to see the local church, that is, the practical aspect of the church
Their view is off the mark because they do not see that the seven golden lampstands are indistinguishable in nature, shape, and function
If we put the seven lampstands in front of us, unless we give each a number, it is impossible to tell which is which
Although they are the overcomers in the local churches, in chapter twelve we see that they are one man-child, not seven man-children
In chapter fourteen we see that they are one group of 144,000 overcomers, not two groups, and much less seven groups
Peter was the apostle who set up the Jewish churches, and Paul was the apostle who set up the Gentile churches
At the end of Revelation the churches set up by the twelve apostles are one building, the holy city New Jerusalem, the Body of Christ
As to the matter of Christ as our life, apparently people received what Brother Nee spoke, but in reality not many entered in
We must live with Christ day by day, receive Him as our life, take Him as our person in our daily life, and have a co-living with Him
All of you are very sincere, and you have paid not a small price to travel from the other end of the world to be here
The local churches everywhere just acted according to their own desire, even to the extent that Brother Nee was forced to stop his ministry
In that period of six years, among us we had many who were capable of preaching, yet they did not see any vision or revelation
We have published a book recording solely the messages given by Brother Nee during the resumption of his ministry
In that book some of the messages were his and some of the messages were mine, and eventually it is difficult to distinguish between them
More than forty co-workers around us also desired to participate in the fellowship, but he refused all of them
Only two brothers, Brother Weigh and I, and two sisters, Peace Wang and Rachel Lee, were given permission to be with him
All the forty-odd co-workers waited in Foochow, and they asked me, saying, 'Brother Lee, no matter what, please put in a word for us
After some consideration Brother Nee said, 'If you want to practice it, every one of you must hand over himself
You must hand over everything hand over yourself hand over your family hand over your riches hand over your church hand over everything
Afterward, at the conclusion of the meeting, Brother Nee said, 'We all will remain here to seek the Lord's leading
There was a person who was his prison mate and much younger than he and who was led to salvation in the prison through Brother Nee
Not too long before his death Brother Nee had told this brother After you go out you should try to find a brother by the name of Witness Lee
Today if you go to my bedroom, you will notice that there is no other picture in my bedroom except the picture of Brother Nee
Early in the fourth century Athanasius, who was present at the Nicene Council, said that 'He was made man that we might be made God'
God set man before the tree of life, meaning that He wanted man, who had God's image, to receive God as his life
Today in the Lord's recovery, it is not that we will not preach the gospel anymore; but preaching the gospel is for begetting
We are building the local churches for the building up of the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem
O Lord, Your church has been on the earth for more than nineteen hundred years, yet her condition is still as it is today
O Lord, we pray that You will deliver us from this religious age that we may truly enter into the state which You are after in Your economy
That no other department in the world has more books than Christianity is proof that many people have seen something from the Bible
At any rate, from 1922 to 1952, when he was put into prison, Brother Nee carried out his ministry for exactly thirty years
Gather some brothers who are engaging in business and ask them to make a small investment and do a little advertising
He supplied the work every year for eleven years, from 1950 to 1961; every year there was a sum of money as a supply
Even if the brothers and sisters would not give anything, the co-workers still would have food on their tables
From 1961 the churches began to share according to their ability in order to reduce the burden on the side of my work
He made arrangements, saying, 'Now the three political regions-the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan-all differ from one another
He further charged me, saying, 'Brother Weigh also needs your help in bearing the responsibility for the articles'
In the initial period, the Taiwan Gospel Book Room published books mainly in coordination with the Book Room in Hong Kong
Thank the Lord, as soon as we began the work in Taipei, an overseas Chinese brother contributed ten thousand U
When to us the Father gave Thee,/Thou in person wast the same,/All the fulness of the Father/In the Spirit to proclaim'
Stanza three says that the Lord was the only grain, and then stanza four says we are His reproduction, His Body and His bride
Since then, after another period of time, the Lord's table meeting among us turned from the old hymns to the new hymns
Two months ago the church here was getting into the life-study of Hebrews as The Holy Word for Morning Revival
God becoming man and man becoming God' is the economy of God; it is beyond the comprehension of angels and men
They do not see that there is a line concerning the economy of God recorded in the Scriptures showing us how God became man to make man God
The Bible shows us how man can become God to have a God-man living and thus become an organism of God, which is the Body of Christ
Christianity has Christmas, Christianity has the manger, and Christianity has the angels announcing the good news
He did it by depending on His divine life within and by rejecting His human life without and thus living the life of a God-man
When He went to the cross, He brought with Him the man whom He had become; that is, He put on this man and thus crucified this man
When He became a man, He did not become a God-created man or a holy man; rather, He became a God-created yet fallen man
He was resurrected through the power of His divine life with the humanity that He had put on, the part created by God
Through His incarnation God brought divinity into humanity, and through His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity
Andrew Murray said the same thing, except that the wording he used is different from ours and not as thorough as ours
In this resurrection He brought the humanity which He had put on into divinity and thus became God's firstborn Son
When He became the firstborn Son, He not only had divinity as His life, but He also had the uplifted humanity added to His divinity
To use our ordinary language, we may say that we and the Lord as God's firstborn Son were born in the same delivery
Not only so, He as the last Adam, who in His resurrection brought humanity into divinity, became the life-giving Spirit
When you brew a cup of tea, first you need to have some water, then you put the tea in, and finally you add some lemon and maybe some sugar
Now, as God's only begotten Son He has become God's firstborn Son, and the many sons of God were born together with Him
When we believe in the Lord, the One whom we receive is such a One, not a shallow Christ as people commonly preach
It is this One who went through all these processes to accomplish the step for Him to become man that He might make man God
It is through regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification that we may become God
When we reach this point, 1 John 3:2 says that when 'He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is'
The God-man life that we live today is the model life that Jesus Christ lived on earth by going through death and resurrection
In the Epistles the Christian life, the life of a God-man, that we live is a life after death and resurrection
We have also done numerous things without You, for all of which we need Your forgiveness and the cleansing of Your precious blood
O Lord, because Your enemy is always on our heels, we can only declare that we overcome him by the blood of the Lamb
We need to see, however, that what people generally know about these four points is altogether superficial and is according to the letter
Preachers preach mainly that Christ died for us to make propitiation for our sins, that He loves us and even gave Himself up for us
He was originally a mystic, and it was he who improved the teachings of mysticism and made them simple and easy to understand
Concerning the resurrection of Christ, his speaking was also excellent, yet it was rather mysterious and not easily comprehended
That book stresses that Christ was the grain of wheat that died in order to release the life within it and thus produce many grains
It put an end to man so that everything related to man-the old creation, sin, Satan, and the world-was also ended with the ending of man
The latter half of the death of Christ is positive, which was to release Himself , His divinity, and His divine life
One time in the Gospels the Lord Jesus said that He was constrained and He longed to die in order to be released
Christ died, and through His death the shell of His flesh, which He put upon Himself when He became man, was broken
In His life on earth of thirty-three and a half years, a great part of His living was the manifestation of His inner divine attributes
When the Lord Jesus lived on this earth, He lived a human life, yet what He lived out was not something human but something divine
When He was on the earth, the people around Him, even His followers, such as Peter, James, and John, often asked, 'Who is this One'?
There is room in my heart for Thee;/Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,/There is room in my heart for Thee'
The Lord Jesus was just such a man so that no one would ever think that there was something as a treasure in Him or that God was in Him
One time He and His disciples passed through a village, but the people of the entire village did not receive them
James and John said to the Lord, 'Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them'?
On another occasion, little children were brought to Jesus so that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them
After the Lord went through His death and resurrection, one of His disciples said to Him, 'My Lord and my God'!
When the Bible readers, including the Jewish rabbis, come to 2 Samuel 7:12, they do not try to probe deeply into it
Hebrews 2:10 says that one day this firstborn Son, as our Captain, will bring us, the many sons, His many brothers, into glory
It was the last Adam, the incarnated Jesus, who became the life-giving Spirit; hence, the life-giving Spirit is the very Jesus Christ
By inference we say that the life-giving Spirit is the all-inclusive Christ, the processed and consummated Triune God
From eternity He was the Triune God with all three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but without having gone through the processes
In eternity the Triune God had no human element, no experiences of human living, no element of death, and no element of resurrection
He is the God-man having humanity and the human living, and He passed through death and entered into resurrection
Early in the fourth century Athanasius, who was present at the Nicene Council, said that 'He was made man that we might be made God'
Once we believe in the Lord, we receive God's life, and 2 Peter 1:4 says clearly that we can 'become partakers of the divine nature'
John 3:2 tells us, 'We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is'
God became man through the process of being incarnated, living a human life, being crucified, and entering into resurrection
The sanctification we experience after our regeneration is not positional sanctification but dispositional sanctification
When the Spirit separated us from sinners, that was the positional sanctification that took place before we were saved
When the Spirit comes into us to change our disposition, that is the dispositional sanctification that takes place after our regeneration
From the first step of regeneration to the final step of conformation, everything is carried out by the Spirit
Eventually, this Spirit will bring us into glory so that God will be completely expressed from within us through our corrupted body
Nee made a statement saying that the Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection without the Holy Spirit there is no resurrection
The work of the Triune God in us is to produce the Body of Christ, the reality of which is the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ
When we have the pneumatic Christ, the consummated Triune God, the resurrection, we are practically the Body of Christ
Although the local churches are independent of each other in business affairs, they all are one in the matter of the treasure
The reality of the Body of Christ is the consummated Triune God within us, who is the pneumatic Christ, the resurrection
Simply, the reality of the Body of Christ is the living of a God-man life by a group of God-redeemed people together with the God-man Christ
Before the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, in the universe there was God in heaven and man on the earth
Rather, according to man's natural law, He was conceived in His mother's womb for nine months, and then He was born to be a man
After His death and resurrection He produced many brothers who, with Him as the oldest Brother, become the one great man in the universe
In general, Christians would spontaneously reply that the Father sent Him to be our Savior and to accomplish redemption for us
As such a One He became a life-giving Spirit and brought forth Himself and the many sons of God in resurrection
After regenerating us, the life-giving Spirit dwells in us and is mingled with our spirit to live a God-man life with us
He is the very One who is God yet man and who died and was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ
In His ascension He is the Mediator of the new covenant , the surety of the new covenant , the High Priest , and the heavenly Minister
Now in the heavens He is doing one thing, that is, to work on all His redeemed and regenerated people to make them God
The purpose of transformation is to make man God until man is conformed to the image of God and is exactly like God
It is true that He lived on earth as a man, but He did not live by His human life; rather, He lived by God as His life
During His thirty-three and a half years on earth, every day He lived a life by God, a life in which He rejected and denied Himself
As far as Christ is concerned, before He went to the cross to die and be resurrected, every day He lived a life of death and resurrection
Although what is lived out is a human life, the virtues that are manifested are something transformed from the divine attributes
When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, He was genuinely a man, but instead of living by the life of man He lived by God as His life
In His life and in His living He lived the divine attributes as His human virtues manifested before the eyes of men
They had this realization not only because they saw the miracles He did, such as His calming the winds and the sea and raising the dead
Since we were born of God the Father in Christ, and since our Father God is God, how can we, the children begotten of Him, not be God?
Christians know that Christ intercedes in heaven for us and sympathizes with us in our problems by rendering help to us in the environment
A hin of olive oil was compounded with four kinds of spices-myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia-making a total of five ingredients
The tabernacle, the serving priests of God, and everything related to the worship of God were anointed with this anointing ointment
Stanza two says If Id have Christ formed within meI must breathe my final breathLive within the Crosss shadowPut my soullife eer to death
If we know the power of resurrection, we will surely be delighted to be in the mold of the cross and to be conformed to it
Philippians 3:10 says that it is through the resurrection power of Christ that we are conformed to the death of Christ
We are conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection which is not a thing or a matter but a person the lifegiving Spirit
The life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God
We are dying every moment of every day, and we are living every moment of every day by the indwelling life-giving Spirit
It is true that Galatians 2:20 does say that we are crucified with Christ, yet we did not stop there but were resurrected with Christ
In his translation Darby has a note on this word saying that the word here is not simply 'by' or 'through' or 'on account of'
Whereas formerly this God-man consisted of one Son, now he has been enlarged to be the firstborn Son and many sons
We have the local churches, and we know how to set up churches, how to appoint elders, and how to assign deacons
We also know how to have good meetings by not having one man speaking but having everyone practicing to prophesy as prophets
The way to live out the reality of the Body of Christ is to go through death and resurrection by the living together of God with man
In principle, those who speak these things speak in themselves; they do not speak in the Spirit or according to the Spirit
If you see this light, you do not have to say anything, and yet you will spontaneously keep the oneness of the Body
When you are in the Spirit, you keep this oneness; when you are not in the Spirit, even if you say you are not divided, you are divided
All those who were ambitious and therefore dissenting rebellious and divisive whether in mainland China or in Taiwanwhere are they today
Beginning with Brother Nee, everyone who has been faithful and sincere to stay in the Lord's recovery has been blessed
Now concerning being cautious, we must never allow our self, our natural being, our old 'I,' and our disposition to be resurrected
Built with the saints in the Triune God,/His universal house we'll be,/And His organic Body we/For His expression corp'rately'
When you run you must stay within two lines once you step on the white line you are outofbounds and even if you regret it there is no remedy
Do not compare yourself with others so that you are discouraged because you sense that you are not doing as well as others
