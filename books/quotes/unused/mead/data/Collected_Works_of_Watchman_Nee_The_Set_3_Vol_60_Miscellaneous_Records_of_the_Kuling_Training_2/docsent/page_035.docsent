   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Hindrance of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On God's side there is no problem being man's Father; the problem is on the sinner's side.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is eager to dispense His grace to the world, but He is held back by man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sin hinders God from dispensing His grace to man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaiah 59:1-2 says, "Behold, Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save; / Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>/ But your iniquities have become a separation / Between you and your God, / And your sins have hidden His face / From you so that He does not hear."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 9:31 says, "We know that God does not hear sinners."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should read these verses to a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the third step.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not preach a gospel which tries to bring men to God without the need of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am afraid that there is no such gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must help a sinner to make a turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is willing to dispense His gift to man, and He will always dispense His gift to man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man's sinfulness, however, prevents God from answering his prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This brings us one step further, from a sense of need to a sense of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In preaching the gospel, we should let the sinner see God's gift.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After this we should let him see what kind of God He is, and then let him see his own sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as we can get a person to come to God, the question of His existence will not pose a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Bringing a person to God is easier than trying to prove His existence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After we have done this, we should awaken him to a sense of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After he becomes conscious of his own sin, we have reached the fourth step.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Cross of the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fourth step is to show the sinner the cross of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the cross can solve the problem of man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can ask a sinner to read Hebrews 9:27-28, 1 Peter 2:24, and 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We only need to read these few passages with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not have to speak too much about the doctrine of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All we need is to let a sinner know that the Lord Jesus has borne our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This simple preaching is all that is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As preachers of the gospel, we must not interrupt our own message.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should never try to be omniscient or try to explain everything clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We only have to speak a little; we should not lead the listeners into detours.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, we should use simple words and use our own testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Concerning the Lord's crucifixion for us, we can consider a few types in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first is the Lord Jesus as the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's judgment fell on Him, and we who are in Him are spared from judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The second is the Lord Jesus as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was slain for our sins and transgressions, and His blood was shed for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The third is the Lord Jesus as the brass serpent being hung on the pole for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As soon as sinners look up to Him, they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord's crucifixion is also like the offering of the sacrifices in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is the Lamb of God, sacrificing Himself for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In preaching the gospel, we only need to let sinners know the simple fact of the Lord's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as they believe, they will be saved by the redemption of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>KEYS TO PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The above four steps constitute a direct way to preach to the awakened sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through these four steps, we can easily bring them to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are basic truths; they are also simple truths.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We want to bring men to salvation with the least amount of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We want them to know these four things because the thoughts of sinners are totally in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Their mind is not open to God, their emotion does not desire God, and there is no room in their judgment for God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to use the above four steps to lead them to a proper desire and decision.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is what we called "clinchers" in the earlier chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The goal of our preaching is to create a desire for God within sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mr. Wilkes said that we have to pray for the sinners, believe for them, and even receive for them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is true.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He meant that we have to feel the sins of the sinners; we have to feel as if their sins are our sins, and that together we have offended the Lord and rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should join ourselves to their confession and even to their believing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When they believe, we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As they repent, we repent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The two are joined as one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we deny the world, we are denying the world with and for them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we accept the Lord, we are accepting Him with and for them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should join them in prayer, in believing, and in receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way, sinners will be brought to the Lord easily.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A gospel preacher must be burning in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A cold person cannot save others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For this reason, we must first be kindled ourselves with fire before we can kindle others with the same fire.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only one who identifies himself with those who are about to be saved and feels the same as they do can bring about their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Next, we have to preach a gospel that speaks of things that are here with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not preach a gospel that merely speaks of things that happened two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's gospel is like the manna; it must be fresh and living every day.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Third, we have to grind ourselves into fine powder before we can touch others' feelings in a tender way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have to echo the sinners' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to bear the sinners on our shoulder and carry them to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our words have to be clinchers, but even more our very person has to be a clincher.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A gospel preacher has to possess a certain rare power, a power that will electrify others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He has to be an "electric conductor," and he has to join himself to sinners and pass on this "electricity" to them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have to be receivers and conductors, those who can pass electricity on to others at will.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have to waste our lives before we can do the work of soul saving.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Paul was one who gave up everything for the gospel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He was willing to spend and be spent for others' souls 2 Cor 12:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He was not only good at preaching; he was able to waste himself on behalf of others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Paul is a good example to us.</S>
