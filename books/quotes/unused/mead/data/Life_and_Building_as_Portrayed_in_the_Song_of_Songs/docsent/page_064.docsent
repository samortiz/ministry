   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE DESTINATION OF BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2; 1 Cor 1:10; 3:6; Eph 4:2-3, 15-16; Phil 2:2-3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The final need of the seeking one is the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may be like a company of horses, or so improved that we are like a dove or even a palanquin, but we still need to go on to be the city!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building up of the city should be our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our Christian life must continually improve until it reaches the building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christians today have many different goals.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in the Word we see clearly that the destination of our Christian life is simply the building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no need to wait until eternity to reach this destination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Word tells us that we should reach it in this age, while we are still living in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we would read all the Epistles again with the viewpoint of the building, we would see that they all are for this destination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They all point toward the goal of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE ORDER OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Consider the arrangement of the books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are arranged very much in order, just like our body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our head is on top, and our feet are on the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, the book of Revelation is at the end of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is indeed significant that the four Gospels are at the beginning, followed by the Acts and the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The book of Romans does not follow the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was clearly the work of the Holy Spirit that all the books were arranged in such a good sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Gospels are at the beginning, followed by the Acts, the Epistles, and then Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ as such a wonderful Person is first of all presented in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These Gospels are simply a record and revelation of such a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is not only God, but also man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is not only life, but also the way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is not only the Savior, but also the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the Triune God; He is the Father, the Son, as well as the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is our God, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Lord, our life-giving Spirit, our way, our life, our everything!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a One is our humility, our patience, and our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is revealed in a full record of four books.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the revelation of this wonderful Person, the book of Acts shows the spreading of such a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was spread to the north, the south, the east, and the west.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was brought to every direction and imparted into so many human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Following the Acts, the Epistles tell us how this wonderful Person can come into us so that we can be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1 Corinthians tells us how He is everything to us, and how we must become precious stones to be built up together as God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1 Corinthians also shows us many distracting elements which cause Christians to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why Paul told them, "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion" 1 Cor 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to be attuned to the same mind and the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul also says in Romans 15:6 that the whole Body needs to have one mind and one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All these passages indicate the oneness in building up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE SUBSTANTIAL BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, we see that all the books of the New Testament are arranged in a marvelous sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But this is not simply for the sake of appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I had been reading and studying the Bible for many years, yet I did not see anything about the building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only in recent years have I begun to see such a central, solid, and substantial thing as the building in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we can see that all the Epistles were written for this one purpose and destination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all must reach this destination.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How wonderful that we have received Christ and are enjoying Him as grace!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we must reach the destination, which is the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not something for the next age; it is for this age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And it is not something in the air, but solidly on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By my experience, I can tell you that this is really substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is so real, and it is so reachable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the New Testament Epistles simply bring us to this one destination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all are familiar with the book of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the beginning, it speaks of the lampstands which are built up in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The lampstand signifies the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Ephesus there was one lampstand, and in Smyrna there was also one lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In each one of the seven cities in Asia mentioned in the first chapter of Revelation, there was a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The lampstands are not for the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord wants us all to be built up together as a lampstand in the locality where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then, the book of Revelation ends by speaking of a city which has been built up with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, it is right to say that the Song of Songs is an extract of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Song of Songs also has a city at the end, and this city is the bride of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The city at the end of Revelation is the Bride of the Lamb Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And like the Song of Songs, this city really looks like the dawn, the moon, and the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is even no night there 21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The New Testament shows that all other things are passing away.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only one thing is increasing, and that is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The more we grow in life, the more so many other things will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Perhaps today we still hold on to doctrinal toys, but if we grow in life, so many toys will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When a man becomes as old as I am, he has no more interest in toys.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>By growing in life, the toys of doctrines and gifts simply pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Eventually, there is only one thing left the building up.</S>
