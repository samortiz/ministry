<P>If we know that someone has done something improper, we should not touch it. We must have a strong burden to touch the person, but not his sin or failure. To know others' failures is a strong temptation and a strong spoiling of our contact with them. If we do not know someone's sins and failures, they may be helped by us when we touch them. However, once we know of someone's failures, this knowledge changes our contact with that person. It is difficult to know the defeated background of a brother without being changed in our attitude toward him. We must contact such a brother as if we knew nothing about him and in a way full of life and full of Christ. By one hour of this kind of contact, he will receive something which will enlighten him. Then he may go home to repent to the Lord. This is the way to contact people. We are the light of the world (Matt. 5:14) and the children of light (Eph. 5:8). Whenever we contact people, we should be a light shining over them. People must come to us to be under our enlightening, not our condemning or rebuking.</P><P>When an elder first comes to a church, he may think that the church is very good and that there are many things for him to do in that church and many people to help. Gradually, however, he may come to know the backgrounds of everyone in the church life. Then he may feel that he is jobless because there is no one good enough to help. This is why sometimes it is not good for certain elders to stay too long in a certain church. Some elders eventually become an "information desk," knowing many things about everyone in the church. It is very good if an elder can be in a city for fifteen years and seemingly know nothing about anyone except how to minister Christ to them.</P><P>Knowing too much about people may be illustrated by married life. In the initial years of our marriage, we did not know much about our spouse. Therefore, we loved our spouse blindly. Every lover is a blind person. Love blinds people. However, when our eyes "gain their sight," our love diminishes, and when we know everything about our spouse, our love is spoiled. It would be marvelous if the elders could love everyone in the church life as much as they loved them in the first year they became an elder. When I hear an elder complain about the brothers or sisters, this is an indication that he is finished as an elder. He has lost his ground to help anyone in the church. Only the "blind" elders are the real helpers.</P><P>When we first came to the church life, we did not know anything about the brothers and sisters. As a result, we were pleasant to everyone. Gradually, however, we came to know certain ones, and eventually we could not be pleasant to them. Our eldership has been robbed by our knowledge of the saints. In the beginning of our church life, we had a "honeymoon," but after a few years, certain saints may have even become our adversaries. This is because we know each other too well. This is the hardest part of being an elder. There are many lessons to learn in this regard.</P>
