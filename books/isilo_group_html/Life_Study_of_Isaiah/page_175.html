Christ with All the Members of His Body<br>to Be Consummated as the Enlarged Tabernacle<br>and Temple of God&#151;the New Jerusalem</H2><P>In the New Testament, we are made a part of this sanctuary, so in the Epistles we are told that we are God's temple (1 Cor. 3:16). Christ as the Head and we as the members of His Body are the temple of God. Eventually, this temple will consummate in the New Jerusalem, the enlarged, extended sanctuary of God. Christ with all the members of His Body will be consummated as the enlarged tabernacle and temple of God&#151;the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2-3, 22).</P><P>In Revelation 21, John said that he did not see the temple in the New Jerusalem, because God and the Lamb are the temple. In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for both God and us for eternity. The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in. God dwells in us, and we dwell in Him. God is our dwelling place, our sunshine, our air, our water, our food, our rest, and our everything. We also become His enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest. In the New Jerusalem, all of God's children throughout the ages will be His roommates for eternity. All of those who followed Satan will be his roommates in the lake of fire. The church life is a life in which we take our God, our Lord, our Christ as our sanctuary and as our roommate.</P><P>In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus charges us to abide in Him (John 15:5). The word abide means not only to remain but also to dwell. In John 14:23 the Lord said, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him." The abode is the dwelling place. This is a mutual abode for the Triune God to abide in the believers and for the believers to abide in Him. In Ephesians 3 Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us into our inner man, so that Christ could make His home in our hearts (vv. 16-17). This is Christ making us His home for us to take Him as our home. If Christ takes us as His home, we can be assured that we will have Christ as our home. Then He will live with us and we will live with Him. This is God and man living together as roommates. Eventually, the conclusion of the divine revelation is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the aggregate of God and man living together. For eternity God will love man, man will love God, and God and man will live together as roommates.</P><P>It is amazing that seven hundred years before Christ was born, Isaiah prophesied that this One, who is Jehovah's Shoot to branch out Jehovah, in His divinity, into humanity, would be the sanctuary of all His chosen ones. When we are in God as our sanctuary, enjoying Him as our roommate, we see Him everywhere. He is our sunshine, our drinking water, our food, and our air for us to breathe. It is wonderful that we can take a deep breath of God as our fresh air. We enjoy God in all these aspects when we dwell in Him as our sanctuary, our dwelling place.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_174.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_176.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 175</div><br></body></html>
