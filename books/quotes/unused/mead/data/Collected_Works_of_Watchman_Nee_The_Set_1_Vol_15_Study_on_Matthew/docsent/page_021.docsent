   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER SEVEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 1-5: "You...be judged" is the opposite of "you judge."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here it does not say that "you...be judged by others" but simply "you...be judged."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that this refers to being judged by God 1 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Judgment here is not the ordinary discerning judgment or the ordinary proper opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 We need to have a proper view toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord said clearly that the Pharisees were hypocrites Matt 23:13 , but He also said that He did not come to judge the world John 12:47; 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul said that the Corinthians were not spiritual but fleshy 1 Cor 3:1 , yet in chapter four he said, "Do not judge anything" v. 5 . 2 When a matter concerns a particular person, we should let him know.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Judging is not only an attitude in our heart, but sometimes it is also expressed through our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever someone comes to us to ask about another person, we must first find out whether the asking one has any relationship with that person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If it is just for the sake of satisfying the itching ears, then it is not necessary to answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If it is because he is concerned about the spiritual condition, then it is all right to tell him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord told the disciples to accept the teachings of the Pharisees, but not to imitate their behavior Matt 23:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In his last book Paul wrote concerning Alexander 2 Tim 4:14 , Demas v. 10 , Phygelus, and Hermogenes 1:15 in order to help the recipient of his letter to guard against them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Judging here includes the following two meanings: 1 judging as a judge and 2 being critical or faultfinding.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1 Judging as a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first mentioning in the Old Testament of this kind of judgment see Exo 18:13-27 shows that it is a judgment carried out by the rulers or officials.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Do not judge" means do not be a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, a Christian should not be a government official in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once he becomes a government official, he can be neither merciful nor meek.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, he will lose two kinds of blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Christian must not even once represent the law to judge others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The result of not judging others is "that you be not judged."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This does not mean that anyone who is not an official judge will not be judged before the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here, to be judged is to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2 Being critical or faultfinding.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many types of behaviors are borderline behaviors.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For instance, losing one's temper is permissible, but losing one's temper and committing sin are very close.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are not careful, we will cross over the border; if we are careless, we will step into the realm of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The examples of the Lord and Paul show that we should speak frankly only when it is profitable to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise, we should not speak, especially 1 if we have some bad intention, such as being jealous of others; 2 if it is because of our sin; or 3 if it is because we do not know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more a person knows himself, the more lenient he is on others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 2: "For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse gives the reason for not judging others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are two principles in the Bible; one is righteousness and the other is mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you choose to treat people according to righteousness, your reputation, position, and wealth will not suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You can protect yourself with righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the result will be that "with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>James 2:13 says, "For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you choose the principle of mercy, which is the principle of overflowing mercy in Matthew 5, God will also measure to you with the measure of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>James 2:13 goes on to say, "Mercy triumphs over judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 3: "And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother's eye, but the beam in your eye you do not consider?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The preceding verses say that we should not judge; the Lord exhorted people with mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here it tells us that it is improper for us to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The preceding verses are concerned with the result in the future; this verse deals with the condition today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here it is not a matter of whether or not one has a beam in his eye; rather, he has it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If one says that there is a splinter in another's eye, it must be that he has a beam in his own eye.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since he judges that the other has a splinter in his eye, it must be that he himself has a beam in his own eye.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If one can see a splinter, which is so tiny, one should be able even more to see a beam.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>1 Since you can see the splinter in your brother's eye, this shows that you are quite an expert in sinning, that you are experienced in committing sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, it is easy for you to see even a splinter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>2 It must be that you have an improper attitude toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most of the time you see the splinter in your brother's eye because you have a beam in your own eye.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more sins we have, the more critical and faultfinding we are.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here the use of the word "brother" shows that the sermon on the mountain is spoken to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 4: "Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the splinter from your eye, and behold, the beam is in your eye?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The preceding verse is regarding the observation of another's sin, whereas this verse is regarding the exhortation concerning another's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 5: "Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother's eye."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord said it is good to remove the splinter from another's eye.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, one should remove the beam from one's own eye first and then remove the splinter from his brother's eye.</S>
