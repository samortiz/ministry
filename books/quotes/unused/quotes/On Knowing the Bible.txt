Perhaps some brothers and sisters may think that during each lesson we will be studying the Bible itself; but this is not what we will do
In the past two thousand years, Christians all acknowledge that no one can truly know the Lord without knowing the Bible
The spiritual inheritances God has given us are the Spirit which cannot be seen and the Bible which can be seen
Among Christians throughout the ages, some have leaned toward the Spirit within which has resulted in great errors
In other words, if there were only the Spirit within and not the Bible without, man would easily commit errors
If there are only the tracks without, but not the fuel within, the train may be on the right track, but it cannot move
For a train to run, and to do so smoothly, there must be the coordination of two aspects: the inner aspect and the outer aspect
Unfortunately, throughout the ages, Christians lean either toward the Spirit within or toward the Bible without
They thought that it was sufficient enough to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
These things show us that a proper Christian should be balanced; he should be full of the Spirit within and should know the Bible without
Some have studied so much that they have counted how many times each letter in the alphabet is used in the Bible
Similarly, they have also counted the number of times each letter of the Greek alphabet is used in the New Testament
It is amazing that they found that the numerical value represented by each word in the Bible can all be divided by seven
On the other hand, for those leaning toward the letter, every line they speak is backed by proofs, yet they are very dead
We must understand properly the letter of the Bible and must properly use our spirit to sense the spiritual meaning in the Bible
To read the Bible well, we must train our mind for this and, perhaps even the more, exercise our spirit for this
In contrast, some people do not understand electricity at all, yet their bodies have actually contacted electricity
They are able to contact electricity because electricity is there, and because their bodies are not insulated from it
For our mind to understand the Bible is one thing, and for our spirit to touch it, to contact it, is quite another
It is not sufficient merely to understand the Bible with the mind; we must also contact and touch the Bible with the spirit
While we need to touch and contact the Bible with the spirit, it is also necessary to have the understanding in the mind
We must realize that the reason we want the mind to understand the Bible is so that our spirit can contact and touch its words
If there is a person here who is illiterate, and he opens up the Bible to read it, how can his spirit be touched?
He must at least be able to identify the words in the Bible before he can read it and be touched by it in his spirit
Of course, there are certain passages, such as John 3:16, which present no technical difficulty in their wording
In the same principle, the words in the Bible may be quite common, yet they are very specific and contain many particular terms
If we have not been properly trained in these specific terms and technical matters, we will have a hard time understanding as we read
In short, this training is for everyone to learn to understand the Bible with the mind and to touch it with their spirit
Just imagine where a person would be if he could not speak or write or use any kind of language to express what is within him
If you are one who cannot speak and can never use language to express yourself, then even if you are here, it will be as if you are not here
If in the universe there were not the existence of words, then there would be nothing for us to do here today; everything would be over
It is impossible for man to research the universe, mankind, and the existence of God today without coming to the Bible
Peter 1:21 says that the prophecy in the Bible, that is, the words of the Bible, is spoken 'from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit'
The Holy Spirit is like the wind, coming upon those speaking for God, to carry them along, bearing them in their speaking
It tells us that the word in the Bible was not only spoken by those being borne by the Holy Spirit, but also by man speaking from God
Please notice that not only did the Spirit of God speak through him, but God's word was in his very mouth and was spoken through his mouth
Matthew 4:4 says, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
We can draw a very clear, simple, and accurate conclusion: the Bible is the word of God spoken by His Holy Spirit through the mouth of man
Although many astronomers, geologists, and other kinds of scientists have done much research, they do not know what the universe is about
Of course, if we want to say more, we can say that it also explains the condition of man and points out the way to man's salvation
The Bible is the breathing out of God, in the same way that my speaking here this morning is the breathing out of myself
For this reason many times when we read the Bible not only do we feel the presence of God but we feel that we contact and touch God within
When we read the Bible and touch God in the spirit, we have the realization deep within that we have absorbed God
If you read the Bible properly, not only will you feel that you have touched God, but you will feel that you have tasted God
If you read the Bible in the proper way, not only will you feel the presence of God, but you will have the feeling that you are touching God
The greatest joy or blessing of being a Christian is to touch and taste God Himself through the God-breathed word
We must learn to use our spirit to contact these words we must touch Gods breathing out in the words and must touch His element in the words
Since the day you heard the gospel until now, how many times have you been moved by the Holy Spirit apart from God's word?
Although you are moved by the Holy Spirit, it is hard to separate the Holy Spirit from the word in these cases
It is hard for you to say whether you are moved by the word or by the Holy Spirit, because at such times the Holy Spirit is in the word
There were only His verbal instructions, such as His instructions to the forefathers, including Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
In Genesis we see that before the Bible was written, God often appeared to the forefathers and gave them verbal instructions
In 1901, a black pillar was discovered in Persia on which were inscribed some of the laws of the ancient times
Some of them were similar to the Law of Moses, yet it was inscribed five to six hundred years before the time of Moses
If we want to know how the Bible was written, we need to know about the alphabets and languages used by the ancient civilizations
The three terms, 'Adam,' 'Eden,' and 'Sabbath' in the book of Genesis chapter two are probably Akkadian and not Hebrew
The people there were descendants of the tribe of Shem, and the language they used was the Babylonian language just mentioned
Some have taken the 'language of Canaan' in Isaiah 19:18 to mean the language used by the Israelites, the descendants of Abraham
Historians have postulated that a large portion of the subsequent Hebrew language was developed from such a language of Canaan
Although Greek was commonly used throughout the Roman Empire, the Jews nevertheless still used Aramaic among themselves
If there were some in the synagogues who did not understand Hebrew, there would be someone to translate it into Aramaic
Many historians have postulated that the language used by the Lord Jesus to speak with the people daily was probably Aramaic, not Hebrew
The words that He spoke in Mark 5:41, 'Talitha koum,' and in Mark 15:34, 'Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,' were all Aramaic
The book of Ruth is connected to the preceding book of Judges and the following books of Samuel in history and in time
From chapter twenty-five on, the rest of 1 Samuel and the whole book of 2 Samuel were surely not written by him
It is hard for Bible scholars to ascertain who was the author of Kings, but some think that Jeremiah was the author
Probably Mordecai was the author, because in 9:20 and 23 it is mentioned that Mordecai recorded the happenings then
Among the Psalms there are some that do not mention any author, but the authorship of most of them is identified
In addition to these, there are quite a few that were clearly written by David, even though the author was not clearly stated
The sons of Korah are plural in number in the manuscript, and this may therefore refer to more than one person
Bible scholars admit that this Korah is the Korah recorded in Numbers 16 as the one leading the rebellion against God
If Job was written by Elihu, and if more than one of the sons of Korah wrote, then there were more than thirty-two authors
Among them, all except Elihu, the probable Gentile author, and Agur and Lemuel, whose tribal sources are unknown, were Israelites
There were scholars, religious persons, politicians, military leaders, kings, priests, prophets, common people, shepherds, and farmers
Peter was also a fisherman without much education, but he was called by the Lord to become the first of the twelve apostles
As to the places where the books were written, some were written in the wilderness; some, in a palace; some, on an island; and some, in jail
Although the Jews acknowledge that the whole Old Testament was from God, they gave the Pentateuch of Moses a very special position
In all the Jewish synagogues throughout the world today, there are at least two or three copies of the Pentateuch of Moses
It only needs to grow up gradually, to bloom, and to bear fruit; spontaneously men will recognize what kind of tree it is
After Ezra there was a group of scribes among the Jews called 'The Great Synagogue' who continued with this compiling and ascertaining work
After the apostles passed away, there was some confusion due to the fact that some people wrote books in the names of the apostles
Not long after Polycarp was martyred, the New Testament was viewed basically the same way among all the different churches
397 at the Council at Carthage the whole Bible including both the Old and the New Testament was recognized and acknowledged by Gods people
The arrangement we now have of the books of the Old Testament was not the original sequence in the Hebrew Old Testament
They were arranged quite properly according to the spiritual context, and Bible scholars acknowledge God's sovereignty in this arrangement
The original Hebrew Old Testament was divided into three parts, in accordance with the Lord's speaking in Luke 24:44 and 27
The five books of the Law of Moses, the eight books of the Prophets, and the eleven books of the Psalms totaled twenty-four books
The authoritative Jewish historian Josephus said: 'We are not like the Greeks, having a lot of books that do not agree and are contradicting
315 who said, 'Please read the Holy Scripture, the twenty-two books of the Old Testament, which were translated by the Seventy-Two'
His words also clearly prove that in the translation of the Septuagint , there were no fourteen apocryphal books in the Old Testament
If the fourteen books of the Apocrypha were already among the Old Testament books, the Lord and the apostles should have quoted them
, and in the Old Testament part, which was a Septuagint translation, it included the fourteen books of the Apocrypha
It might have been the objection to this move that caused the Eastern Greek Orthodox Church to call a council at Laodicea in A
361 there was a big question whether or not these apocryphal books should be included in the canon of Scripture
The fourteen books of the Apocrypha were added in by the Roman Catholic Church arbitrarily and cannot be trusted
Within this subject, there are four persons: the first is God, the second is Satan, the third is man, and the fourth is Christ
In the past, when Christians spoke about Christ, they only spoke of redemption; the matter of building has always been overlooked or missed
On the other hand, it also says that though man may 'destroy this temple,' Christ will 'raise it up' in three days
When we speak of Christ, we should not merely see Him as the redeeming One, but we must also see Him as the building One
Satan was proud and rebelled against God; he maliciously damaged God's creation and caused man to fall and to be lost
The subject of the Old Testament is that God created, Satan damaged, man fell, and God promised the coming of Christ for redemption
The Christ in the Old Testament was only a hope for man, because He was only promised by God to the fallen man as a Redeemer
The subject of the New Testament is Christ coming to redeem sinners and to build up the church according to God's plan
When we put the subjects of the Old and New Testaments together, we have the subject of the whole Bible as presented earlier
The Bible not only reveals Christ Himself; it also reveals the bride and the Body of Christ, which is the church
In the Bible there is the story of God contacting man through Christ, but there is also man occupying a very important position
For this reason, the first scene presented to us in the Old Testament is the story of a man seeking for a wife
Not only does John introduce the Lord Jesus as the redeeming Lamb, but he also introduces Him as the Bridegroom who has the bride
All the redeemed people and the Redeemer become one as the mystery of the universe, which is Christ and the church
If we take away Christ from the Bible, the Bible will become an empty book, like an empty vessel without its content
At the same time, no one can know Christ well without knowing the Bible, because the Bible is the explanation of Christ
We suggest considering him as one before the captivity because he spent most of his time as a prophet before the captivity
By dividing the prophets according to the time of captivity, there are these three categories of books of the prophets
If we also consider Lamentations a book of the prophets, there are seventeen books of the prophets from Isaiah to Malachi
Some have grouped the longer books of the prophets as major prophets, and the shorter books of the prophets as the minor prophets
The four Gospels cover the experiences of the Lord Jesus on earth together with the experiences of His disciples in following Him
Next, we develop some spiritual experiences during the course of the history, and then there is the hope and the anticipation for the future
There are many facts and experiences, and then at the end, there is an expectation and a hope, which is the return of the Lord Jesus
In the ancient time, the subdivision of the Old Testament among the rabbis was like what the Lord Jesus said in Luke 24:44
In other words, the Lord's word in Luke 24:44 was based on the subdivision of the Old Testament into three categories by the rabbis
When the Jews mention Moses, sometimes they are not referring to the person Moses, but to the five books of the Law written by him
Among the Christians and the Jews, there are five different ways of referring to the first five books of the Old Testament
They are referred to as the Pentateuch of Moses, as the Pentateuch, as the Law of Moses, as the Law, and as Moses
In the original Hebrew Old Testament, these books were together as entire books without the distinctions of first and second books
The usual order is as follows: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, and Malachi
The ancient church fathers combined these into twenty-two books to match the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet
If a train has no railroad tracks to run on, not only will it be unable to run smoothly, but it will also be without protection
If one studies the Bible and expounds it blindly and carelessly, the result will be inconceivable and even dangerous
It is very dangerous for a person to judge according to what he thinks and to interpret according to what he perceives
If we want to study the Bible properly and understand it accurately, there must be the restrictive interpretation
If we want a restrictive exposition of the Bible, we need to find out the principles and laws of Bible interpretation
We have to grasp firmly the fact that when God inspired men to write the Bible, He used words that are fully comprehensible to man
No matter how difficult or out of place a literal interpretation appears to us, we have to adhere strictly to the literal meaning
Some could have turned to a spiritual interpretation, suggesting that the virgin could mean something else rather than an actual virgin
Again the book of Zechariah in the Old Testament prophesied that the Lord Jesus would enter Jerusalem the last time on a colt
Only when a literal interpretation of a prophecy or parable leads to absurdities or improprieties can we interpret them spiritually
We cannot interpret a sentence, a verse, or a section of the Bible spiritually for the first part and literally for the second part
If one would interpret the Spirit in the second part literally, he must interpret the water in the first part literally also
Since one cannot interpret the Spirit spiritually, neither can he interpret the water spiritually; it must be interpreted literally
For the different parts within a same passage, either they must all be interpreted literally, or they must all be interpreted spiritually
In interpreting the Bible we have to pay attention to one more thing one portion of the Word is not sufficient to represent the whole truth
The devil argued that He could jump from the top of the temple and would not be hurt because there is such a promise in the Old Testament
When the Lord heard that, He answered right away, 'Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God'
If the devil cannot stop someone from following the Bible, he will cause that one to quote the Bible in an isolated way
In a similar way, the exposition of any single verse cannot be based on its own context; instead it must be based on the whole Bible
It says Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens and Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God
If the first part of one expression specifies a condition, then all first parts of matching expressions specify conditions also
If the second part of one expression specifies a blessing, then the second parts of all expressions specify blessings also
The Lord says Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you and so on
The Jews offered their gift at the altar then for the purpose of drawing nigh to God and fellowshipping with Him
We cannot teach people to go to the altar to offer gifts now just because the Lord Jesus has spoken such a word
We must see that we cannot neglect the background; if we do, we will not understand the exact meaning of the Bible
It is true that God spoke of keeping the Sabbath, but this is a matter in the dispensation of the law and not in the dispensation of grace
In the same principle, God promised His chosen people in the Old Testament that they would prosper and enlarge their territory on the earth
Even the clothing worn by their priests and their rituals of worship are all a borrowing of the principle of the Old Testament
In the Bible, there are at least these three kinds of people to whom God speaks His words: the Jews, the nations, and the church
They point out the Jewish background of the words in Matthew saying that the Lord Jesus was clearly referring to offering gifts at the altar
The Lord also said that when one encounters the great tribulation, he should pray that his flight may not be on a Sabbath
If it were so, this would be very serious, because the whole book of Matthew would no longer be our inheritance
The kingdom people not only include the saved ones among the Jews, but they also include the converted ones from among the nations
In studying the Bible, before we make a decision on an interpretation, we must first ascertain the person to whom a word is spoken
There are also some types that are objects, such as the lamb typifying Christ and the brass serpent also typifying Christ
In the Old Testament, many persons, events, and objects are types, but it is not up to us to decide whether or not they are types
At the most, we can only borrow these persons, events, and objects as illustrations and use them to explain the truths in the New Testament
If we apply them, we will find new meaning to the Bible and will have a better, more accurate, and thorough understanding
