   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE ONCE FOR ALL Scripture Reading: Matt 3:11; Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4; 8:14-18; 9:17-18; 10:44-47; 11:15-17; 19:1-6; Mark 16:16-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible we see clearly that God had an eternal purpose in eternity past to work Himself into a group of human beings, that He might be their life, nature, and everything, and that they might be His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible calls this corporate expression the Body of Christ, the church, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ultimately this corporate entity will consummate in the New Jerusalem, the eternal expression of God in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A GOVERNING PRINCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s purpose is a kind of governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would understand what is revealed in the Bible, we first of all must see the governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not have such a governing principle, our understanding of the Bible will be loose, wild, and full of error.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is similar to white lines marking the lanes on the highway.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are there to regulate us, and we must drive our car within them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, whenever we come to the Bible, we must take heed to the governing lines and principles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The regulating lines of the Bible are God s eternal purpose of working Himself into us that He may be our content, and we may be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How can God accomplish this?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is by His anointed One, the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ came to accomplish God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not come simply to save us from hell that we might go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That is altogether too low.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Neither did He come to make us spiritual and heavenly like the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are all religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why we need the governing principle of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God wants to work Himself into us as our content, making us His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>FIVE STEPS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For Christ to accomplish His purpose, He had to pass through several steps.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first was incarnation, the second was crucifixion, the third was resurrection, and the fourth was the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then the fifth step was the baptism of His Body into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we are waiting for the sixth step, which will be His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have seen that incarnation means the mingling of divinity with humanity, the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was a real wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God and man were mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God was brought into man, and man was made one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This man s name was Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus was and still is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s eternal purpose was to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now Jesus became such an example.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He became God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the real meaning of the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the meaning of crucifixion?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not simply say that it is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Crucifixion did accomplish a full, complete, and finished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But redemption is not the only significance of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Crucifixion is also the termination of all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everything that is old, negative, dead, dark, and subtle has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even before we were born we were terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not attempt to understand this with our logical mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All spiritual things cannot be fully comprehended by our logical mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Two thousand years ago we were all terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what the Bible says!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a young child many of us sang the song, Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now we can say, I was terminated this I know, for the Bible tells me so.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not what we think or feel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must forget about our thinking and feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We only need to accept the pure word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How were we created by God?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is clear that we were born of our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet the Bible says that God created us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We were created by God when Adam was created six thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all were created in Adam, and we all became fallen in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Adam s fall was our fall, because we were all within him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before we were born, we were fallen in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the same principle, before we were born, we were on one hand redeemed and on the other hand terminated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now we can see how we were terminated at the time of Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We all were terminated there.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul says in Galatians 2:20, I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We were terminated two thousand years ago on the cross with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Crucifixion means termination, and resurrection means germination.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All the old creation was terminated, and the new creation was germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After this, we have seen that the ascension means inauguration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Surely this is a heavenly language to say that incarnation is mingling, crucifixion is termination, resurrection is germination, and ascension is inauguration.</S>
