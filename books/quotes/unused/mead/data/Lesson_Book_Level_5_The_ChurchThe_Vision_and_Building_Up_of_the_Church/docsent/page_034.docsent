   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After seeing all the glorious details of the status of the church, we will address the two crucial aspects of the church the universal and local aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The truths in the Bible always have two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Govett called it "the twofoldness of the truth.''</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A sheet of paper has two sides as it cannot exist with one side only; likewise, the church has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most Christians do not see the two aspects of the church, and therefore have made many mistakes concerning this matter for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order not to make the same mistakes, we must pay close attention to this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. THE TRUTH ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most Christians would agree that they need the fellowship of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, there are very few Christians who are not members of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most Christians have a church, but the question is, do they have the proper church or an improper church?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today in every large city there are too many different so-called "churches.''</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the city of Seoul, Korea, the Roman Catholic Church is very prominent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, it is wrong to associate the word Roman with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible there is no Roman Church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Colossians 3:11 tells us that in the new man there is neither Greek nor Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, there is no such thing as the Jewish Church or the Greek Church in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, there is no Anglican Church, no Chinese Church, no Korean Church, no Presbyterian Church, no Baptist Church, and no Pentecostal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All these "churches'' are improper because they are not scriptural, not according to God's holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to know what is proper regarding the church, we need to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have been studying the Bible concerning the matter of the church since 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this chapter I wish to present to you a brief outline of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This brief, accurate, and clear outline is the cream of my nearly sixty years of study concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am happy to present this outline to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My desire is to impress you with the proper practice of the church life according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is nothing wrong with the church itself, but the way Christians practice the church life might be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Out of all the different ways of practicing the church life among Christians today, it is difficult to find one that is right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be right in the practice of the church life is to be according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The proper practice of the church life is not according to culture, not according to society, not according to any kind of religious background, and not according to our imagination; it must be absolutely according to the holy Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE UNIVERSAL ASPECT A. Including all New Testament Believers</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is only one church in the universe; thus, the church is universal, comprising all the believers in Christ throughout time and in every place Eph 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The universal church comprises all of God's redeemed saints in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Old Testament saints, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Moses, David, and Isaiah, were not members of the New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The New Testament church began at the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John the Baptist was not in the New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus said, "I tell you, among those born of women, there is no one greater than John; yet he who is littler in the kingdom of God is greater than he'' Luke 7:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows that John was not a member of the New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At His coming back, the Lord Jesus will close the church age, and many Jews will repent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Zechariah 12 gives us the details of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Jews will be saved, but they will not be in the New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are the most blessed people because we are in the most blessed age, the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church has a universal aspect, it includes Peter, John, Paul, and all the believers through the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It also includes us, and it includes those who will follow us in the future.</S>
