Now let us look at the churches. "The seven lampstands are seven churches." The church is a lampstand; it is not the lamp. This is because the church is just a stand, shining forth the light of God's lamp (2 Pet. 1:19). The church is a lampstand and not a candle because the light of the church comes through the Holy Spirit and is completely dependent upon the Holy Spirit. It is not like a candle which burns by itself and which shines by its own power. It is very important to remember this. We should know that we ourselves are wholly under God's judgment. Whatever is out of the self cannot please God because there is nothing good within us. We must not be presumptuous in any way. Even in God's work, we must not use the abilities of our natural life. As the lamp cannot shine without the oil, likewise we cannot use our natural abilities to accomplish any fruitful work for God.</P><P>From an earthly point of view, we are insignificant men, but from God's point of view, we are vessels in the heavenly temple. Now we have our representatives in the heavens! The lampstands are already in front of the Lord Jesus! Now our spirits have reached the heavens and soon our bodies will follow. Although presently we are still on earth, in spirit we have already become vessels of the heavenly tabernacle. Soon we will be there as priests serving God.</P><P>With regard to the seven churches, which are represented by the seven lampstands, we should understand three things:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>(1) These seven churches were real churches existing at that time.<br>(2) These seven churches represented the sevenfold history of the church.<br>(3) The conditions of the seven churches exist simultaneously in the church's sevenfold history.</P><P>In reading chapter one verses 4 and 11, we see that the original intention of the Lord was to send the seven epistles to the seven actual churches existing at that time. Although we know that these seven churches represent the churches throughout the ages-we will speak of that in a moment-we must not think that Christ's intention was for us to wait until these two thousand years have passed and the conditions of these seven churches have all become history in the seven periods of the churches before He returns. Such a thought will only make man slumber! On the contrary, our Lord often spoke to these churches that He would be coming again and they must be watchful. "Become watchful....If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief" (Rev. 3:2-3). This kind of word proves that in those days there was already the possibility of the Lord's second coming. Also our Lord called these seven churches "the things which are." When He said "which are," He meant "which are." What He paid attention to was the present and not the future. So the things of the seven churches which the Lord spoke of were the actual happenings in those days. There was already the possibility of His second coming at that time! We must never assume that the Lord will not come and that we must wait until the fulfillment of such and such prophecies before He will come. This kind of thought is not approved by the Bible. Rather, this was the attitude of the evil servant, whose words were, "My master delays" (Matt. 24:48).</P><P>This is real. However, the reason that our Lord only spoke to these seven churches, to my mind, is because there was a deeper intention. The churches at that time were not just seven. In the province of Asia alone, there were a few more churches. Moreover, those that needed admonishing, warning, and encouragement were not just these seven churches. The well-known churches, such as Antioch, should also have received this kind of epistle, but our ever unmistaken Lord only chose these seven out of many churches and various backgrounds to receive His special exhortations. Are not all His acts full of significance? Our Lord knows what to do. Although these seven churches were actually present at that time and were in the actual situations they were described to be in, should not our Lord have had a greater and broader meaning in choosing them? Was it not His intention to select churches that would match the conditions of the churches in the future in order to reveal His will toward them (the churches in the future)?</P><P>After we read carefully over chapters two and three, we will see that the Lord's intention was to use these seven churches to reveal the general state of the church from the time of the apostles to the end of this age. We have many reasons to support this. We have said that what the angel revealed in verse 1 will happen in a short time. Would this not indicate that those things not revealed by the angel will be completed in a longer period of time? The message in chapters two and three is not revealed by the angel, so it will be fulfilled over a longer period of time.</P><P>Moreover, in the original text there is no definite article before these seven churches. This indicates that the Lord was not pointing only to these seven churches. They were but a group representing all the other churches. In addition, the word "seven" in this book is a very meaningful number. The meaning of the word "seven" is completion. Seven churches indicate one whole church. If we would turn our eyes from the seven actual churches on the earth to their representation in the heavens, we will be even clearer. The Lord Jesus Christ was walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands. If the seven lampstands were pointing only to the seven churches at that time, those other than and those after these seven churches would not be counted as churches! There were only seven golden lampstands in the heavens! Does this mean that churches other than the seven were not churches? Hence, these seven churches represented by the seven golden lampstands are the representatives of all the churches in the world.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 04: The Christian (2) &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
