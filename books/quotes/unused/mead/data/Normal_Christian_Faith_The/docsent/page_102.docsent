   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN TOWARDS THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A friend asked me once, "I have believed in Jesus Christ and received forgiveness of sins through His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now that I am saved, what should my attitude be towards my country, towards society, and towards international problems?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Should I take a passive stand and close my ears to everything, or should I actively participate in the solution to all problems?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have to admit that this is not an easy question to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a big issue.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot give an answer in two or three sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, this matter does have a close relationship to our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to clarify this matter, I want to spend this chapter to briefly mention the proper Christian attitude towards social and political problems.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE TWO COMINGS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, the Bible shows us clearly that Christ has to come to earth two times.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first happened in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During His first coming, He accomplished certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the second coming, He will accomplish more things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We hope that He will come soon and that we do not have to wait too long.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But He has His time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is not apathetic towards all the social and political problems.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But He has His time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can see from the Bible that in His first coming, He mainly dealt with sin, delivered the sinners, and dispensed a new life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His second coming He will take care of the social problems and renew the political system.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our personal salvation was clearly settled at His first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our nation, society, and existing systems will be taken up effectively at His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>MANY PROBLEMS IN THIS WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What Christ settled in His first coming has been mentioned in the previous chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need not repeat them again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We want to look at the problems of our present situation, our country, and our political systems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As Christians, we have certain stands and attitudes concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we are not trying to solve all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only when Christ comes the second time will these matters be thoroughly settled.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We admit that there are many vices in our society.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot deny that our country has many needs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The system is basically unhealthy; there are numerous contradictions in our political framework.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Tensions build up constantly on an international scale, and the future is gloomy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Modern youth are especially concerned about these issues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more they ponder these matters, the more they are confused.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everywhere there are intelligent men trying to tackle these problems, and everywhere you can find more problems.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some wonder how man can survive on this planet in the next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Others study the global impact of food shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then there is the question of the environment and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>People ask why there has to be crime and injustice and why the prisons are always filled with inmates.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Others challenge the validity of class existence with some members of society being fed well while doing nothing, while others sweat all day only to find themselves in deeper poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everywhere there are crises: between nations, between races, and between colors.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I admit that there are problems everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, man is busily enacting laws to prevent catastrophes from happening.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, the more laws man institutes, the more lawlessness runs rampant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many issues are attacked and upheld with equal vehemence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some people kill thousands of animals daily to satisfy the stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Others think it abhorrent to maltreat even the smallest creature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because all these issues arise in our world, there is an endless train of questions passing through our minds daily.</S>
