<h2 class=head2>C. In Poetry—Job to Song of Songs</h2><p>The poetry in the Old Testament is only of five books: Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. They unveil that the Triune God Himself, not ethics or morality, should be man’s pursuit as his perfection. This one sentence covers the central, intrinsic revelation of Job. The Psalms unveil that this God was incarnated to be a man in the flesh to be His Anointed, who is His delight, who has been exalted by Him, and who should be received, treasured, and exalted by His chosen people. Ecclesiastes unveils that all things in the human life under the sun are vanity of vanities, and Song of Songs shows that Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the unique satisfaction to God’s chosen people. Thus, we should pursue God as our perfection, and we should pursue after Christ as our satisfaction. God should be our perfection, and Christ can be our satisfaction.<h2 class=head2>D. In Prophecy—Isaiah to Malachi</h2><p>The seventeen books of prophecy from Isaiah to Malachi unveil that the Triune God embodied in Christ will come to be the God-man (Isa. 7:14; 9:6) to accomplish redemption (ch. 53) for the fulfillment of God’s eternal economy according to the preceding three categories of the books in the Old Testament. They also unveil that the accomplishment of the processed and consummated Triune God in Christ will consummate in the new heaven and new earth (Isa. 65:17; 66:22; 2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:1).<h2 class=head2>E. A Concluding Note</h2><p>All the above points present us a vivid portrait of the all-inclusive Christ in and for God’s eternal economy in the Old Testament. In types, we see that Christ is the centrality and universality of God’s eternal economy and the divine blessing to all God’s chosen people. In history, we see that the all-inclusive Christ is the God-promised good land which all God’s chosen people should take, possess, inherit, and enjoy to the uttermost, even to the level of kingship. In poetry, we see that Christ is the unique perfection for God’s chosen people to pursue after and the unique satisfaction for God’s chosen people to obtain and enjoy. Then in prophecy we see that the Triune God has become a God-man to accomplish His full redemption for the fulfillment of His eternal economy which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth.<p>Isaiah prophesied about the new heaven and new earth for Christ to be the centrality and universality in the entire new heaven and new earth as illustrated by the New Jerusalem. In the four sections of the Old Testament Christ is revealed as the centrality and universality of God’s economy.
