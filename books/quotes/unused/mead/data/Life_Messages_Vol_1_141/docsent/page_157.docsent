   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For myself, I can testify that I have no desire to be anybody.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Lord, thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have the highest commission, that of living You out.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not be preoccupied with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Christ is lived out, all these negative things will flee away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more you try to deal with your sin, or overcome the world, or gain the victory over your weakness, the more you will be troubled by these very things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You are not commissioned to overcome sin, weakness, or the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your commission is to live Christ out.</S>
