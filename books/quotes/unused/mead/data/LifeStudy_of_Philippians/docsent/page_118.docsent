   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SHINING AS LUMINARIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HOLDING FORTH THE WORD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 15 and 16 Paul continues, That you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To shine as luminaries is to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the salvation in chapter two equals the salvation in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The operating God equals the Spirit with the bountiful supply, and shining as luminaries is equal to magnifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to verse 16, the way we shine as luminaries is to hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is rather difficult to understand adequately the meaning of the phrase holding forth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It means to present something to people, to offer them something, and even to apply something to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To hold forth the word of life is to offer such a word to others, to present it to them, and even to apply it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is to minister Christ to others, to offer Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What do you offer to your family, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, friends, or classmates?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What do you present to them?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Your answer should be that you offer Christ to them, present Christ to them, and apply Christ to them in their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word of life is actually the living expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To shine as luminaries is to magnify Christ, and to hold forth the word of life is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A DEFINITION OF LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both 1:19-21 and 2:12-16 refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter one Paul says that his circumstances will turn out to his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then instead of being put to shame, he will magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter two Paul charges us to work out our salvation according to God s operation within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then instead of murmuring and reasoning, we shall shine as luminaries, holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Philippians 2:12-16 is thus a definition of 1:19-21.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1:19 we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This Spirit is the very God who operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, to magnify Christ is to shine as luminaries without murmuring or reasoning, and to live Christ is to hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>SATURATED WITH THE WORD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This brings us to a crucial matter: to live Christ we must first receive the word of life and be constituted of it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From the time we were born, we were gradually constituted of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Culture was infused into us by our family and our society.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, the culture infused into us became our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Automatically we lived according to the culture which had been constituted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We also live what has been infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Children live according to what has been infused into them by their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now that we have been saved, we should no longer live culture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, a believer from China should no longer live Chinese culture, philosophy, or ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, he should live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But how can we live Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we would live Christ, we need to receive the Word into our being and allow it to saturate us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Word which is saturating us will gradually replace the culture which has been infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we are infused with the Word, the more we shall be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Spontaneously our thought, love, aspiration, and conversation will become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then instead of living culture, we shall live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The only way to live Christ is to be saturated with His word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word of life infused into us will wash away the elements of culture and become the new constituent in our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we shall live Christ.</S>
