<p>In the church we must have life, training, and fruit-bearing. Every member of the church should be a branch that bears fruit. The word of the Lord in John 15 is emphatic and definite. He said, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman. Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). If we are saved, we are a branch in the vine. We cannot deny this. Therefore, we must realize that every branch in the vine must abide in the Lord to bear fruit. This is not a small matter. The Lord said, &ldquo;If one does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned&rdquo; (v. 6). Some Bible scholars have misunderstood this verse. If we take this as a word concerning salvation, we will not be able to understand it. This word is not about salvation; it is about the enjoyment of the life supply of the vine tree in order to bear fruit. To be cast out is not to be lost. Some Pentecostals use this chapter to deny that our salvation is eternal. They say that someone may be saved one day, lost the next day, and saved again the next morning. This kind of salvation can be compared to an elevator that goes up and down. However, in chapter 10 of the same Gospel the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand&rdquo; (vv. 28-29). The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is eternal and once for all.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that we will never suffer any dealing, discipline, or punishment from the Lord. In actuality, we may suffer all these. After someone is born, he cannot be unborn by behaving wrongly. Rather, a genuine child is disciplined when he makes mistakes. What the Lord said in John 15 is that the branches that do not bear fruit are first cut off from the supply of the vine tree, then dried up, and eventually burned in the fire. In my Christian life, I have seen many withered ones and even some who were &ldquo;burned,&rdquo; unable to come back to the life supply. The withered ones are through with regard to the enjoyment of the life-juice of the vine tree. We must be careful not to play games with the Lord and the church. About twenty years ago, certain ones opposed, criticized, and condemned Brother Watchman Nee. Eventually, all those criticizers became withered. They did not lose their salvation, but they were finished regarding the enjoyment of the life supply.</p>
<p>As branches we must bear fruit. If anyone has not borne fruit for several years, I am very concerned for him. There is the danger that such a one may be cut off from the life supply. We must endeavor and be desperate. We must say, &ldquo;Lord, I am one of Your branches. Why do I not bear fruit? I must bear some. I cannot go on like this anymore. Lord, have mercy on me that by Your grace I may bear at least one fruit.&rdquo; If we will bear even one fruit, the life supply will flood in. The life-juice will stream in, and we will bear more fruit. To bear the first fruit is a breakthrough. We must have such a breakthrough. We need to go to the Lord to have a thorough dealing with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRADING WITH OUR TALENT AS FAITHFUL SLAVES</h2>
<p>In the parable of the talents in Matthew 25, the problem is not with the one who had five talents or the one who had two but with the one who had one talent. This one said, &ldquo;Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow. And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours&rdquo; (vv. 24-25). The master did not argue with him. It is as if he said, &ldquo;Yes, I am a hard man, but do not come to blame me. Since you knew who I am, you should have done the gathering and reaping.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents&rdquo; (v. 28). This is the divine economy. The human economy is to take care of the ones who do not have something. If someone has five talents, we would ask him to spare some for the ones who have less. However, the divine economy is not like this. The more we have, the more the Lord will add to us, but the more we do not have, the more the Lord will take from us. The reason that we do not make a profit is that we do not use the talent we have. Our excuse is that we are not apostles, elders, or leaders of a service group. However, it is good to be a &ldquo;no one.&rdquo; The Lord does not use the &ldquo;someones&rdquo;; He uses the &ldquo;no ones.&rdquo; If we think that we are someone important, we need to be reduced to be no one. When we are finally no one, the Lord will come in to use us. Therefore, we should not excuse ourselves by saying we do not know how to do something.</p>
<p>Too many of us are making excuses. How much profit have we made for the Lord? All the reasons for not making a profit are only excuses. We can make excuses for ourselves, but when the Lord comes, He will ask us to give an account to Him. At that time our mouth will be shut, and we will have no excuses. In this regard, the Lord is a &ldquo;hard man.&rdquo; He admits that He reaps where He did not sow and gathers where He did not winnow. However, it is not true to say that the Lord has sown nothing. At least He has sown one talent into us. We all have something. No one can say that he never received anything from the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord does not require us to make the same quantity of profit. We simply need to make a certain profit. The five talented one made five talents more, and the two talented one made two talents more. If the one talented one had made only one talent more, he would have received the same praise from the Lord. Five plus five, two plus two, and one plus one are all the same to the Lord, and He will praise each one equally. We must be careful not to fail to exercise what we have. If we are not careful, the talent we have will be taken away and given to others. The situation in the church today is not properly balanced. Some are very useful and others are not very useful, because the latter do not exercise their talent. We must all go to the Lord desperately that we may bear fruit and make some &ldquo;interest&rdquo; for Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Normal Way of Fruit-bearing and Shepherding for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
