   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The problem today is that we Christians are always self-centered and self-concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We do not see the Body or realize that the Body is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In today's situation everybody has his own choice according to his own taste.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A brother may like everything to be nice, quiet, and in a good order in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He may want all the men to wear ties and all the ladies to be modestly dressed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He wants everyone to come into the meeting one by one and be seated in an orderly way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is this brother's taste, so he tries to find such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, that becomes his choice according to his taste.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the other hand, there is another brother who also has his own taste.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He likes meetings that are unrestricted and noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So he would also travel around to find a meeting where everybody is so free to dress the way he wants and shout and be excited.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, he will take a meeting of his choice according to his taste.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All these different tastes create trouble, and all the different choices cause divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may like a certain kind of meeting, but we should not make that a choice for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, the church life is not up to our choice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us consider two brothers who were born into the same family and have the same family name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The family name is not a matter of choice, but a matter of destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all have to see that the church is not a choice but a destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we see this, many problems will be spontaneously solved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, whether or not these two brothers like each other, they are still brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brotherhood is not up to your choice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is also a matter of destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the first one does not like the second one, he cannot blame the second one but can only go to blame his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you do not like a brother, do not blame him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have to go to the heavens to blame the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That is your destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is a brother to you in your destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No matter how you feel, you have to love him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Friendship is a matter of choice, but brotherhood is not.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brotherhood is a matter of destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church we have brotherhood, not friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose you are a brother in Atlanta.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps one day some of the other brothers in Atlanta would mistreat you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you decide to give them up, that proves you do not know what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is a matter of destiny, and so is the brotherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you see this, you will realize that in the Body of Christ there should not be any ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I may like to be quiet, but being quiet should not be my ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I may like to be noisy, but being noisy should not be my choice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all have to learn to be general, realizing that the church life is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus has abolished all the ordinances and has slain the enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, He can make us all one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Look at the situation when we all gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have many different kinds of people, yet we can all meet together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no such thing as a Puerto Rican church, a Mexican church, a Japanese church, a Chinese church, a Texan church, a Californian church, or an Anglican church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is simply the one church, which is the unique Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord is going to recover this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without this being recovered, it will be difficult for Him to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all have to see that the church is Christ, and this corporate Christ includes all kinds of real Christians.</S>
