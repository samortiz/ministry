   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Practicing the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the beginning, the way we carried out our service, the way we met, and the practice of the gospel preaching were done eighty percent according to the way of the Brethren in the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One notable example was the translation and compilation of a hymnal called "Hymns for the Little Flock.''</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Brethren saw at that time that the church should not have a special name on earth, in the same way that the moon is the same moon everywhere on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether in the Philippines or in America, there is only one moon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although there are many countries on this earth, this does not mean that there are many moons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is still one moon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When this moon is over Taipei, it becomes the moon in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When it is over Japan, it becomes the moon in Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today, there may be hundreds and thousands of churches on earth, but there is only one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From the beginning, Brother Nee took the lead among us not to use any special name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once there is a special name, there will be division.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, the Assemblies of God, the Lutherans, the Baptists, and the Presbyterians all denominate their churches by different names.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, the church is divided into many pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is like saying that there is a Holiness Moon, a Baptist Moon, a Presbyterian Moon, and a Lutheran Moon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a complete distortion of the truth, and we cannot follow this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although we do not have any special name, in the practice of the church and in its content, we do have justification by faith, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, baptism, the presbytery, the laying on of hands, and many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We include all these items which we ought to have.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, others could not give us a definite name.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they saw our "Hymns for the Little Flock,'' they began to call us "the Little Flock.''</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This forced Brother Nee to make the declaration repeatedly that we are not the "Little Flock Church.''</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The name "Little Flock'' is only the name of our hymnal; it is not our name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Advance and Furtherance of the Practice</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was at this time that I came into the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was around 1933 or 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know that our practice was very much according to that of the Brethren at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But by 1933, Brother Nee began to consider some of the unsuitable and unscriptural conditions among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1934, he published a book entitled The Assembly Life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1937, he put out another book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In these two books, he made many adjustments.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From that time on, we have gradually recovered many new items.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By 1984, we have spread what we practice, believe, preach, and teach in the Lord's recovery to all six continents throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before 1962, the Lord's recovery among us was mainly confined to the Chinese-speaking world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was not until 1962 when I began to work in America that I was led to do my best to have the English-speaking work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the first year, we began to publish an English magazine called The Stream and also some English books.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first book was The All-inclusive Christ, and the second was The Economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After ten years, I began to conduct the Life-study Trainings in America.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every year we have two trainings, one in winter and one in summer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After twelve years, we finished the study of the whole New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These trainings were carried out by me, first by preparing the text and the footnotes with the outlines, and then by releasing the messages according to what was prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In total, we conducted twenty-four of these trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every training was for ten days, with thirty messages.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this way, there were over seven hundred messages.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These messages were given in English, and they were translated and published in other languages as well.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through these publications, the Lord's recovery spread everywhere over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By 1984, there were over eight hundred churches all over the six continents of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can say that on every continent, there is the testimony of the Lord's recovery.</S>
