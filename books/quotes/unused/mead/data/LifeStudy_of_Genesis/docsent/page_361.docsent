   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abraham's living was a practical living in oneness with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham did not suddenly have a vision in which God told him that He had a high purpose to carry out on earth, that He needed him, and that Isaac had to be married in order for God's purpose to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no such vision in chapter twenty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, the record in Genesis is common and human.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to this record, a man had a son in his old age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When this son was thirty-seven years old, the wife and mother died, and the father buried her in a very meaningful way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The father and the son, both of whom were now unmarried, were left alone, living together in that sad condition for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The son might have said, "Father, where is my mother?" and the father might have replied, "Son, where is your wife?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The father was burdened to take care of his son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps he said, "I have lost my wife, and my son is now forty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This surely is the right time for him to get married.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we are surrounded by Canaanites, none of whom would ever be accepted by God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no record that God said, "Abraham, let Me charge you to send someone to your own country to get a wife for Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I will never allow you to take a Canaanite woman as a wife for your son."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although there is no record of God's saying this, Abraham did have this understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From where did he derive it?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It came from his living in accordance with God's concept.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abraham was a man who lived in oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I live in oneness with a certain brother day after day, there will be no need for him to tell me of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I will already know what he likes and what he does not like, what pleases him and what offends him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I love him and live in oneness with him, whatever I say and do will be in accordance with his likes or dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am sorry to say that many Christians do not live in oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When important matters arise, they kneel down and pray, "O Lord, what is Your will?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, they do not follow God's will but their own concept.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not know God's will by praying in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would know God's will, we must live in oneness with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we live in oneness with Him, He will not need to tell us what He desires, because we shall already know it by being one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Abraham was desperate to take care of his son's marriage, he would not accept a Canaanite as Isaac's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we had been Abraham, we might have taken the easy way and said, "There are many girls here in the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why can't I choose one of them as the wife for my son?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There may be one very nearby."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham did not think this way, but sent his oldest servant far away, back to the country from where he came, to find a wife for Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although God never told Abraham to do this, what Abraham did was according to God's inner will and concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we have seen, Abraham knew God's will and mind because he was living in practical oneness with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Abraham was not the only person who had such a living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All those mentioned in this chapter were living in an atmosphere of oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Abraham, the oldest servant, Rebekah, Laban, Bethuel, and Isaac were all living in oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that everyone in the churches will see that we need such a living for the fulfillment of God's purpose today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not need to pray and seek after God's will; we need to live in oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we live in oneness with Him, we shall share His concept, and whatever we think and do will be in accordance with His feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God will not need to say anything, for we shall sense what He senses, knowing His inner feeling because we live in oneness with Him.</S>
