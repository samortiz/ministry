   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE WITHSTANDING THE DEVIL Scripture Reading: James 4:7; 1 Pet 5:8-9; 2 Cor 2:11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The devil is known also as Satan Rev 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was first a cherubim, created by God Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>28:12-14 , and he was an archangel Rev 12:7; Matt 25:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later, he rebelled against God by uplifting himself to be equal to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of this, God judged him Isa 14:12-15; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>28:15-19 and he became Satan, the adversary of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the original text the word Satan means "an opposer, an adversary."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The devil opposes everything that God does.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition, he always sets himself against God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We want to look at the way the devil attacks God's children and how they withstand him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I. SATAN'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will look at Satan's work in four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. Satan's Work in the Human Mind</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second Corinthians 10:4-5 says, "For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds, as we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows us that Satan uses every high thing as a stronghold to surround man's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order for the Lord to gain us, He must first overthrow the strongholds of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He must do this before He can charge into man's thought and take it captive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan's Reasonings and Temptations</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What are reasonings?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This word in Greek can be translated "imagination" or "thought."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan often surrounds us with many imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Men are foolish; they think that these thoughts are their own.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, they are the strongholds of Satan, and they prevent the mind from submitting to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Often Satan injects a kind of imagination into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we think this imagination is from ourselves, we fall into his snare.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Often thoughts develop which have no basis in fact; they are merely imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many so-called sins are imaginary in nature; they are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of the so-called problems among the brothers and sisters come from our imagination; they have no factual basis.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Often Satan injects a wild thought into our mind, and we are completely oblivious to his work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he injects a sudden thought into our mind and we accept it, we are accepting his work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we reject this thought, we reject his work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many thoughts are not our own; they are actually concocted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must learn to reject these thoughts from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Most of Satan's temptations come through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan realizes that God's children will rise up and withstand him vehemently if he attacks openly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason he tempts us by sneaking in stealthily and planting a thought in our mind unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once the thought gets into us, we begin to think about it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the more we dwell on a thought the more we feel justified and right, we have fallen into his snare.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The thought that we have accepted is Satan's temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we reject Satan's attacks in our mind, we will shut off the most vulnerable entrance of his temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many problems among God's children are problems in the mind; they are not real problems.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes when you see a brother or a sister, you may feel that he or she has a problem with you or that there is a distance between you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This may result in a barrier between you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually, there is nothing between you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The so-called problem is merely Satan's attack in your mind or the mind of your brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such problems are unnecessary problems.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's children must reject sudden thoughts and sudden feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They must learn never to give in to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here, we need to issue a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not be overly concerned about thoughts from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are people who go to one extreme of paying no attention at all to Satan's thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are also people who go to the other extreme of paying too much attention to thoughts from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A person can easily be cheated if he is not alert to thoughts from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the same time, a person can lose his mental sanity if he is obsessed about thoughts from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a person pays too much attention to Satan's temptations, his mind will become confused, and he will easily become a prey to Satan's snares.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As soon as a person's eyes are not focused on the Lord, he will find himself in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, we need to see that Satan does attack our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the other hand, we need to realize that as soon as we reject his attacks, that is the end of them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If a person has to reject Satan day and night, something is wrong with his mind; he is heading down the wrong road.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one hand, we must be familiar with his wiles; if we are ignorant of them we will be cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the other hand, we cannot be overly concerned because that will also lead us into deception.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As soon as our eyes are set on him, he has gained what he wants.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This distraction will render us useless, and we will become obsessed with his thoughts day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Any brother or sister who is overly concerned with such thoughts has already been deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must learn to maintain a proper balance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>An excessive concern is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a person's mind is constantly worried about thoughts from Satan, he is in reality giving ground to Satan to enter into him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must never go to the extreme.</S>
