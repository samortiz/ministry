<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the service meetings of the church in Taipei from November 1958 to January 1959. According to a report in <em>Church News,</em> Brother Lee gave a series of messages concerning the building of God in a conference for the island of Taiwan from October 26 to November 4, 1958. These messages were published in the book entitled <em>The Building Work of God.</em> Then in response to an invitation from the church in Taipei, he fellowshipped with the responsible saints concerning the relationship between building and service. There were sixteen service meetings. The eighth meeting involved fellowship concerning how to lead the young people and is published in the booklet entitled <em>How to Lead the Young People,</em> and the fourteenth meeting involved fellowship concerning the practice of preaching the gospel by the church. The remaining fourteen meetings are included in this book. These messages were originally published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine from 1959 to 1960.</p>
