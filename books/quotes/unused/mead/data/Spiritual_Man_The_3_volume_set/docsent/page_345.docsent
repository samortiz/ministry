   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God has no delight in seeing His children become sick.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His love would rather see His children pass through favorable days.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, He knows there is a danger: when believers have favorable days, all their love for Him, all the words of praise for Him, and all the things they do for Him are done only because of the favorable conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He knows that it is very easy for our heart to be turned away from Him and His will and turned toward His gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, He allows sickness and other similar things to come upon us so that we will see whether we are for God or for His gift.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If, in every adverse circumstance, we do not seek after anything by ourselves or for ourselves, we are indeed seeking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sickness can reveal if a man is after his own will or if he is after God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We still have our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our daily life is too filled with our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In God's work, in our dealing with people and matters, in our thinking and opinions, there are too many indomitable wills.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, God has to bring us to the door of death so that we will see the plight of those who resist Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God allows us to pass through profound grief and pain in order to break us and cause us to give up the self-will that He deplores.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Countless numbers of believers do not seem to hear what the Lord says to them during ordinary days, but when the Lord makes their bodies suffer, they become willing to obey completely.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord's way is to resort to scourging when the admonition of love has lost its effect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The purpose of His scourging is to break our self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It would be well for every sick believer to examine himself concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Aside from our own hopes and desires, what God hates the most is our self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Self-love damages spiritual life and destroys spiritual works.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God cannot expel self-love from within us, we can never soar in the spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our self-love is especially related to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To say that we have self-love is to say that we love our body and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, in order to abolish our self-love, God allows many sicknesses to come upon our body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we love ourselves and are afraid that our body might become weak, God allows it to be weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are afraid to see our body suffer, yet God allows it to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We long to recover, but our sickness worsens day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We want to preserve our life, but ultimately even the hope of life is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Naturally, God's dealing varies from person to person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some dealings are heavier, while others are lighter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, God's intention to eliminate self-love is the same in both cases.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many strong believers have to wait until they approach the door of death before they give up their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the body is broken down, when life is at stake, when sickness has engulfed one's health, when pain has worn out one's strength, and everything is shattered, what else is there left to love?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At this point, the believer may want to die, and he may realize that he is hopeless and that there is nothing more to hold onto in his self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is unfortunate that even when he reaches such a point, he still does not know how to turn around and grasp the promise of God's healing.</S>
