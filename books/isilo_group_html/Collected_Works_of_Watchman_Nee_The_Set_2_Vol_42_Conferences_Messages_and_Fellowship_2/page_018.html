No. The head has to bear the responsibility of every member of his household. Many have often remarked that there is no middle ground between salvation and perdition. But actually there is some middle ground. The Gentiles are in an absolute position&mdash;the position of perdition, and Christians are also in an absolute position&mdash;the position of salvation. In a Christian family, even though strictly speaking one cannot say that there is some middle ground, there do exist some neutral positions. This is because the children of Christian parents do have a closer standing than the Gentiles as far as receiving eternal life is concerned. I am not necessarily alluding to the family of pastors or those in the denominations, and I am not referring to those who are not assuming a genuine headship. I am referring to the children of those who are assuming genuine headship in the family. These children are standing on the ground of grace, and they are more apt to receive eternal life.</p><p>Paul said that the children can be sanctified because of the faith of the parents (1 Cor. 7:14). Why are we saved today? We are saved because Christ has become our head. When we submit under Him, we are saved. In the same principle we must be the head to our children. The real issue is whether or not we are the head of our household. If we are the head, God will hold us responsible for our family. God has not demanded that we bear the responsibility of our brothers, but He demands that we bear the responsibility of our children. When we stand before the judgment seat, those without a family will only be judged for their own lives. Similarly, the sisters will only be judged for their own lives. But those who have a family and children will not be judged merely for their own lives, but for their household as well. Whether or not we have actually assumed the headship, God still considers us as the head of our family. This is the difference between the male and female in the family. The male bears the responsibility of his wife as well as the whole family.</p><p>I know one brother in the Lord who is a real head in his family. Before his family believed in the Lord, he took the initiative to believe in the Lord. Without discussing the matter with his wife and children, he burned and removed every idolatrous thing in his house and then gathered his whole house together, announcing, "Our whole family is going to believe in the Lord. Even if some of you do not want to believe, you are counted as having believed." What each individual in the family does is another issue. But the head of the family has the right to announce that his whole family is a believing family. The blood of the lamb was struck on the doorpost of the house, not on the doorpost of the rooms. Salvation comes to man with the household as the basic unit. In my observation, the brothers who are the proper head in their family always find their whole family saved. The only difference is in the timing; some in the family believe earlier while others believe later. But none in the family remains an unbeliever forever. It is always a household salvation; the whole family is saved eventually. All the brothers who are the head in their family should stand firm in this matter. First bring the whole family into a saved standing, and then every member will be saved one after another.</p><p>At Princeton University there was a highly educated college professor who was also a good brother. He believed fully in the teaching of household salvation, and he declared to his sons that his whole family was to be a believing family. When the children were small, he gathered them together every day for family worship. Later, when the sons grew up, they left home and gave up their faith, turning to evil works. The colleagues of the professor mocked him, saying, "Your conviction is wrong." But he told his colleagues, "My sons have not become old yet. I believe that my whole family will eventually be saved." Later the father died, and the sons still were not saved. But twenty years later, the sons gradually were saved one after another. We have to believe in the Lord. If we have faith in this matter, our whole family will be saved even if it means waiting for a few years or a few decades.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
