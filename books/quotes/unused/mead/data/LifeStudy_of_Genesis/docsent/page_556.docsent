   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e The Scattering of Levi Becoming a Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 49:7 Jacob said that Levi should be scattered among the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Joshua 21, this prophecy was fulfilled through the casting of lots.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of Levi's faithfulness and absoluteness, Levi was scattered among the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moses, a God-man, was very happy with Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, he could not annul the prophecy of Jacob; rather, he had to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the Lord said to Moses, "Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites, of the inheritance of their possession, cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them" Num 35:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each of the twelve tribes had to set aside some cities for the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The selection of these cities was made by lot.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There was no maneuvering in this matter, for the lot did not permit the exercise of any maneuvering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Altogether, the Levites were given forty-eight cities Num 35:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Out of these forty-eight cities, six were to be cities of refuge Num 35:6; Josh 20:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These cities were conveniently located throughout the land of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Three were on the east side of the Jordan, and three were on the west side.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A manslayer could easily flee to one of these cities of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the scattering of Levi according to the curse actually became a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Levites brought people to God and God to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, in ancient times, it was a blessing to have some Levites in your city or in your territory Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>17:7-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These cities of refuge are a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all are manslayers, and Christ is our city of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you really think that you have never slain anyone?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all have slain our parents, our husband or wife, or our children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The brothers in the brothers' house have all slain one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After we have slain someone, we need to flee to a city of refuge; that is, we must run to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The scattered Levites not only brought others to God; they also brought God's refuge to sinful people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may apply this to our situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are true Levites, wherever we are, Christ will be present as a city of refuge for others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our dwelling will be a city of refuge into which sinners can flee for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way we bring God's refuge to sinful people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sinners do not need to run to a cathedral; they simply need to flee to God's refuge, to the cities where God's priests dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In these days the saints in Anaheim are grouping together according to neighborhoods.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that each group will be a city of refuge and that many unbelievers will flee to this refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this refuge those who have committed sins will find the covering they need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because there are so few Levites, there are hardly any places of refuge in the city of Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must be today's Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must be desperate, absolute, and faithful to slay our fleshly desires so that we may be God's Levites, God's priests.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are Levites, then wherever we live, our dwelling place will be a city of refuge into which sinners may run for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through the cases of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi we see the possibility of either losing or gaining.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether we shall lose or gain depends upon our attitude and upon our reaction to various situations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May God have mercy on us so that we may react in a way that will cause us to gain and not to lose.</S>
