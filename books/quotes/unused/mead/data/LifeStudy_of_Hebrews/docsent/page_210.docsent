   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AMBITION FOR LEADERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may say, I am not an elder and I don t want to be a leader among the Lord s children.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I want to be free, take it easy, and not be bothered by this kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although you may say this, I do not believe it, for everyone likes to be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you say that you do not like to be a leader, you are a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Deep within, you enjoy being a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the service groups are arranged, you like to be number one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You do not want to be the last.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sisters may say, As females, we don t care for the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sisters, do not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose a piano service group is formed which includes five sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every sister on the group will be concerned about the order in which the names are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the fifth sister hears that her name is mentioned last, she may be so bothered that she will be unable to pray for a week.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She may say, If I can t be the first, I should at least be the third, but I m not even the fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have been saved for over fifteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why should I be the last?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What have the elders done?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Don t they have any discernment?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the ambition for leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I thank the Lord for this ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a good ambition, far better than the ambition to be the President of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is good that Christians have such ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we had no ambition, we would be like chairs and benches, and God could do nothing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But because we are so ambitious, God can do something with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Probably only those who are aged are no longer ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A brother who is close to eighty years of age may have no ambition, but a young man may desire to be today s Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I encourage all the young people to be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would be happy if all the young people would desire to be today s Peter or Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our life-study of Genesis, we have seen that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob plus Joseph are aspects of one complete person in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In like manner, we should not consider Korah as being separate from Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In our nature, we have the same ambition Moses had.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Moses was forty, he was ambitious to take the lead to rescue God s people from the tyranny of the Egyptian king Acts 7:23-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, in Moses there was also the rebellious element of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Young brothers, I know that you have both the positive nature of Moses and the rebellious nature of Korah within you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even worse, the negative elements of Dathan and Abiram are also in you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the following message, we shall see that God has judged the rebellious nature and resurrected the positive element, the element of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you had never been saved, you would have no ambition among God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why are you so ambitious in the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Simply because you love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you did not love the Lord and if you had no ambition, you would be like the street people, wandering about aimlessly, having no ambition to be anything for God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But today, as those who are in the church loving the Lord, you are ambitious and expect that one day you will be qualified for the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a good ambition, yet it must be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But we must also realize that within us we also have Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and all the rebellious elements.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the same time that we are ambitious for God s goal, we are also rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I understand this very well because I have been sick of this disease myself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE REBELLION OF THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>AGAINST THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not only is there within us the rebellion against other leaders, but many times our soul rebels against our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Often our mind says, Spirit, why cannot I serve God?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why cannot I, the mind, do something for God?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Have you not had this kind of rebellion within you?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many times my soul has rebelled against my spirit, saying, Spirit, I don t agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am smarter than you are and I can do a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You are a part of Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Am I, the soul, not also a part of Witness Lee?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Are we not all the children of God?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why do you, the spirit, take so much upon you?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many times in functioning we have used our soul in a rebellious way to show that our soul can do something for God and that we, the natural man, can do some service for God without exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a type of rebellion.</S>
