   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Romans 8:24: "We were saved in hope."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We praise and thank the Lord that we are saved!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But there are still two salvations that are not yet accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why we have to pursue them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a person is not yet saved, we tell him that the minute he believes he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This salvation refers to the salvation from the punishment of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though we are already saved, we still need to be saved from the power of sin, and we still need to seek after the glory of the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why we have to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mr. D.L. Moody was a powerful preacher and a capable soul-winner.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But he said that he had never in his life seen a lazy man be saved!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that even though a man may want to be saved from the punishment of hell, if he is lazy, he cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you" Eph 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During the past few weeks, I have been speaking on the fact that we cannot do anything, and that the minute we try, we suffer greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if we surrender and believe, Christ will do everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This, however, is only half of the story; there is still the other half, which is the working out of our own salvation with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to be responsible for this part.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do not do this part, we will become unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is true that Christ has died for us, shed His blood, and resurrected and ascended for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some think that since this is the case, all they have to do is worship and be absolutely passive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no more need to pray, to read the Bible, or to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the very fact that God has accomplished salvation means that we should be all the more zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has done it, and we should work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But how can we work it out?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The next verse tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Philippians 2:13: "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verses 12 and 13 can be considered two sides of one glorious truth; they include everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we look at the first verse, we may think that we have to do everything ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if we look at the second verse, we see that everything is done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, these verses say that we should work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, they say that God will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are not contradictory words; they are complementary words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 12 says that we should work it out, while verse 13 says that God will enable us to work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These two verses explain a very important two-sided truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From the Bible we see, on the one hand, that God has many solemn commandments; He commands that we do this and do that.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems as if He has put an unbearable burden upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are pressed beyond measure, unable to move our feet, and are pressured to the point of death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, there seem to be many promises of God which promise that God is doing this and that for us; everything seems to be according to His grace and everything seems to be His work; it seems as if we have nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because some do not understand this two-sided truth, they become biased.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people think that everything is related to God's commandments, and that we have to obey them ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They see God's commandments as a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, they cannot lift it, yet on the other hand, they cannot drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They feel that they are pressured to the point of death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then there are some who think that everything is according to God's grace and God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God accomplishes everything, and man does not have to be responsible for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Inevitably, this leads to laxity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These biases no matter which side one is biased toward are dangerous in that one can neither fulfill the scriptural commands nor obtain the scriptural promises.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's truth is equally important on both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is working in us, and at the same time, we are working it out; we work out what God has worked into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we merely allow God to work within us without working out this work ourselves, we will have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, if we try to work things out ourselves without allowing God to work within us, this also will result in nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything with the human life can be summed up in the words "the willing and the working."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To will is an inward resolution, while to work is an outward act.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We act out whatever we have inwardly resolved to do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the meaning of willing and working.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The willing refers to the condition of our heart, while the working refers to our outward conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet both our inward willing and our outward working are the result of God's operating within us for the accomplishment of His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the willing is done through God's operation, and all the working is done also through His operation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We often want to obey God yet find ourselves unable to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But God tells us that He will work in us to the extent that we will obey and work out what needs to be worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many Christians find it very painful that they cannot do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They often want to tell God how painful it is to try to obey Him, and that they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They do not want to love the world, yet they cannot stop loving it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They do not want to hate others, yet they cannot stop hating.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God has not ordained that we should suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His intention is to operate in us until we become able to do whatever we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, we should say to the Lord, "Although I cannot obey, give up the world, or love others, I ask that You operate within me until I become willing to obey You, drop the world, and stop hating others."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you believe, you will see a change after you pray this way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even a matter that you have not been able to overcome for a period of three to four years will be overcome through such committing and believing.</S>
