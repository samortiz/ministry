<h1 class=msg>Lesson Twenty-Four</h1><h1 class=msg>OUR PATTERNS FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>Phil. 2:5-10; Acts 4:18-20; 26:16-19; 1 Tim. 1:16</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Jesus Christ our Lord being a pattern for us</li><li>Peter being a pattern for us</li><li>Paul being a pattern for us</li><li>John being a pattern for us</li><li>Being faithful to the end for the building up of the church</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>In this final lesson we will reveal the lives of four men whose human living became our pattern for the building up of the church. These men began to seek the Lord when they were young. Some came at a young age, some came at an older age; nevertheless, they all were considered young men when they first started to pursue the Lord. Therefore, do not look down upon yourselves, but look to these patterns.<h2 class=head1>I. JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD BEING A PATTERN FOR US</h2><p>Jesus Christ our Lord is our first pattern for the building up of the church. He is not only the Head of the Body, He is also a pattern. He humbled and emptied Himself for the church (Phil. 2:5-10). He gave up His position, status, glory, comfort, and throne to become a man. He was inside Mary’s womb for nine months. He was under the authority of Joseph and Mary for thirty years. He submitted Himself to His own creatures. He allowed Himself to be apprehended, mocked, tried unfairly, and crucified by His own people. He passed through these human sufferings to redeem His chosen people. Then He resurrected that they may be regenerated to be the sons of God and members of His Body. He ascended in order to pour out the Spirit upon the members to form His Body. He went through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension for the building up of the church. He did not sit on the throne in the heavens and command us to build the church. He took the lead in self-humbling and self-emptying to do the Father’s will. There is no other way to build the church. We are not capable of building the church as sinners. Therefore, He took the first steps to lead us through the process necessary for the building up of His church. He was faithful and He is our pattern.
