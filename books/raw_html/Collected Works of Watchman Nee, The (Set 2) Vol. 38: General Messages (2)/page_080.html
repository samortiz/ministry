<h2 class="head1">THE SCORCHING OF THE SUN</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, without light we will not realize how shallow we are. Without the scorching of the sun, we will not understand why those who spring up fast also wither away fast. How often we are deceived into complacency with our spiritual state! Yet we regard ourselves as wonderful people! To our great surprise, when the sun comes up and scorches us, we immediately wither away.</p><p>Why does God permit the scorching of the sun to come to us? Why does He allow difficulties to befall us? Brothers and sisters, this is the ultimate expression of the Lord's love&mdash;the cross. There is nothing which can cultivate our spiritual life as much as the cross; no trial can be better than the cross. When we heard the word of truth, we immediately accepted it with joy and consecrated ourselves to God. Perhaps we fancied that we were all right. In reality we overestimated ourselves. God purposely sent us trials and the cross so that we would see ourselves. Yet sometimes we end up having an argument with God because He acts contrary to our expectations. He tells us to go to places that we do not want to go to. He assigns us to work that we do not want to do. Therefore, we are dissatisfied. Inevitably, we misunderstand God, blame God, and have an argument with Him. Brothers and sisters, please remember that arguments bring us into dryness. All spiritual dryness has its beginnings in our controversy with God. If God gives way and we win, we will be doomed to wither away. Therefore, the cross is a test to us; it decides whether our life will end in richness or dryness. In other words, whether our life will be abundant or dry depends on how we deal with our argument with God. If we prevail and God yields, the only result for our life will be dryness. Therefore, we must never rejoice in our apparent victory or delight in our freedom. This merely points out the fact that our life is withering away and that our living will soon degenerate. The experience of many Christians testifies to this fact. Our life does not remain abundant when God yields. If there is an unresolved dispute, an unsolved problem, or an unclarified point between God and ourselves concerning His will, we must be extremely careful. If we are double-minded and not satisfied with God's arrangement, choosing the path which we consider to be good, we will not have to wait until the issue becomes apparent; we will begin to wither away immediately.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should not imagine that we can acquire something simply by listening to a message. God has to create an environment for us to actually feel the need for the word we hear. This will test whether we have accepted the word genuinely or superficially. God has to create an environment to show us that no teaching of the Bible can be ours without paying a price. For example, after we have listened to a word on endurance, God will arrange tribulation for us because "tribulation produces endurance" (Rom. 5:3). After we have heard a word on obedience, God will confront us with hardship so that we can learn obedience from the things which we suffer (Heb. 5:8). After we have heard a word on gentleness, God will bring us face to face with many irritating people and matters so that we will be "gentle toward all" (2 Tim. 2:24). After we have heard a word on faith, God will seem to hide Himself from us and take no notice of us when we call upon Him so that we will not "doubt in unbelief" but be "empowered by faith, giving glory to God" (Rom. 4:20). Each time we hear a word, something always seems to be waiting to test us. Brothers and sisters, if we can stand the test, the word will become real in us.</p><p>God will never allow us to simply listen to a message or consecrate ourselves; He must test us. He can only use the vessels which stand firm after the tests. Once an older sister, long in the service of the Lord, spoke to a young brother who was about to embark on the Lord's service, and said, "Every piece of bread that is consecrated to the Lord's hands must be broken before it can be distributed to others. Unbroken bread cannot multiply and will not sustain others' lives. We often consecrate ourselves to God yet hope in our heart: `Lord, I have consecrated myself to You, but please do not break me up!' We all want the bread to remain intact forever and stay permanently untouched. But every piece of bread in the Lord's hands must be broken. If you do not want to be broken, do not place yourself in His hands." Brothers and sisters, these are words of experience by one who knew the Lord. All the bread that is placed in the Lord's hands will be broken by Him. This is where the difficulty lies with many Christians. They listen to a sermon and joyfully say, "Lord, I consecrate everything to You." But when the Lord breaks them, they yearn to be delivered from their environment. Brothers and sisters, on the one hand, we are captured by God, but on the other hand, we are unwilling to be broken by Him. This is a struggling life. If we want to have an abundant life, we must allow God to send many trials to us.</p>
