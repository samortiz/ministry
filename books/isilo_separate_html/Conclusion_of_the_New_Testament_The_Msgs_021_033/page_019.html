<p>In Revelation 3:14 we see that Christ is the beginning of the creation. He is the origination of the creation of God. This is an important concept. Some translators have said that Christ is the Originator, not the origination. However, the meaning here is not originator but origination. Christ is the origination of God&rsquo;s action to create the universe.</p>
<p>We may say that as the beginning of the creation Christ is God&rsquo;s &ldquo;prototype.&rdquo; In manufacturing often a prototype is made, and the mass production follows later. Such a prototype is the beginning of what is to be produced. Christ is the Firstborn of all creation and the beginning of creation. He is the first in creation, and He is the prototype.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. All Things Created in Him,<br />
through Him, and unto Him</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:16 says, &ldquo;In Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;In Him&rdquo; means in the power of Christ&rsquo;s person. All things were created in the power of what Christ is. All creation bears the characteristics of Christ&rsquo;s intrinsic power. Furthermore, &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; implies that Christ is both the sphere and the element of creation. All things were created in Christ as the sphere and the element. &ldquo;Through Him&rdquo; indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed. Finally, &ldquo;unto Him&rdquo; indicates that Christ is the goal, the consummation, of all creation. All things were created unto Him for His possession. Therefore, the process of creation was carried out in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ.</p>
<p>In his note on Colossians 1:16 in his <em>New Translation,</em> J. N. Darby says that the words &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; mean in the power of Christ&rsquo;s person, and that &ldquo;He was the one whose intrinsic power characterized the creation.&rdquo; Commenting on the meaning of the Greek preposition used in the phrase &ldquo;in Him were all things created,&rdquo; Darby says that it is &ldquo;used generally for the character in which a thing is done&rdquo; (<em>Collected Writings,</em> Vol. 33, p. 87). He also states that the &ldquo;creation of all things was characterized and wrought by the inherent power which is in the Lord Jesus Christ, and all things subsist together as one ordered and law-governed whole by the same constant and inherent power&rdquo; (<em>Collected Writings,</em> Vol. 31, p. 188).</p>
<p>Christ is the active instrument through which creation was processed. In this process God&rsquo;s power is expressed, made manifest. This is revealed clearly in Romans 1:20, a verse which says that the &ldquo;invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen, both His eternal power and divinity.&rdquo; In all created things God&rsquo;s power is made manifest. Hence, in Darby&rsquo;s words, creation bears the characteristics of Christ&rsquo;s intrinsic power.</p>
<p>Christ is related to creation in a subjective way. He did not create the universe merely in an objective way as an objective Creator. He did not, so to speak, stand apart and call everything into being. On the contrary, the process of creation took place in Him, that is, in the power of His person. Christ is the unique power in the universe. His very person is this power. Therefore, creation was processed in Him. This means that He was not merely an objective Creator but also the subjective instrument through which creation was processed. For this reason creation bears the characteristics of Christ&rsquo;s intrinsic power.</p>
<p>The Bible says that all things came into being through Him, or were created in Him. The words &ldquo;through Him&rdquo; and &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; are subjective. According to the Greek, we may translate the last prepositional phrase in Colossians 1:16 either &ldquo;for Him&rdquo; or &ldquo;unto Him.&rdquo; It is better to render the Greek &ldquo;unto Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;For Him&rdquo; is objective, but &ldquo;unto Him&rdquo; is subjective. All things have been created in Christ, through Christ, and, ultimately, unto Christ. These expressions indicate that Christ has a subjective relationship to creation. Creation is not simply for Him; it is also unto Him. This means that it consummates in Him. The three prepositions in, through, and unto are used by the apostle to point out the subjective relationship of Christ to creation. Creation took place in the power of Christ&rsquo;s person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him as its consummation. Such a relationship is subjective. Because of His subjective relationship to creation, Christ expresses God in creation. Creation expresses the characteristics of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
