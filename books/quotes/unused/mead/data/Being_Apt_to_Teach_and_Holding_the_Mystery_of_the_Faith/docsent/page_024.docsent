   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW CHRISTIANS BEAR FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 84 and John 15 are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 84 uses animals to signify Christians, showing how we are like the sparrow and the swallow, worthless and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Real Christians are just like this in the eyes of the world, having no attractive form or beauty and without ability or education.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are small and worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, all those who come to the altar have to be small.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without being small, one cannot come to the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 15 uses a plant to symbolize Christians, showing that we are just like the branches of a vine, which are not fit for use as lumber.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, they appear to be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Also, the period of time during which they blossom is so short that their flowers are hardly seen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As branches of the vine, we have no other use except to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, Christians are useless in the eyes of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They have no other use besides the overflowing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Christians are very small and worthless in the eyes of the world, they can lay their young like the swallow in Psalm 84.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They can propagate the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christians who have experienced the cross are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They seem to be useless, yet they can produce other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is just like the branches of the vine in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every branch that does not bear fruit shall be taken away, but those that bear fruit express the life of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>EXPERIENCING THE CROSS BY BEING JOINED TO THE LORD'S RESURRECTION POWER</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Psalm 84:4 speaks about dwelling in the house of God to fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 15 speaks of abiding in the Lord to fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord, Christ, is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, to dwell in the Lord is to dwell in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalm 84 speaks about the altar, that is, the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 15 says that the branches have to abide in the vine, emphasizing our union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are the two ends of our spiritual experience, which is the most precious experience in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Union with the Lord cannot be separated from the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>True union with the Lord requires a real experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we want to have the real experience of the cross, we must be joined to the Lord in His resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To know the power of resurrection, we need to love the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the New Testament God does not look at a person's children in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, God looks at a Christian's spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the spiritual side, if a Christian does not have any children, this means that he is barren.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a most shameful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Psalm 1 says that a person who fears God is like a tree that yields its fruit in its season v. 3 . Revelation 22 also says that in the New Jerusalem the tree of life yields its fruit each month v. 2 . What God regards as important is fruit-bearing, that is, the multiplication of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 15 shows us that our abiding in the Lord and the Lord's abiding in us is for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not bear fruit, then we surely have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may feel that we are all right and that our prayers are effective.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if we do not have fruit, this indicates that there is something wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord said to Peter, "Do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Feed My sheep" John 21:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Song of Songs, the Lord also told His pursuer, "Pasture your young goats / By the shepherds' tents" 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everyone who loves the Lord has young goats under his shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A person who wants to bear fruit must on the one hand have fellowship with the Lord to be filled with the Lord's life by receiving His abundant life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, he must have the experience of the cross and be broken so that he can flow out the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Without being broken, he cannot have the overflow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people have much prayer and fellowship with the Lord, yet they have no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is because they have not been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul told the Galatians, "My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you " Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a person is not broken, he cannot have any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person who has been broken is like water, having no form of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No matter where he is, he can adjust.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Wherever he is, he can flow in and also flow out life.</S>
