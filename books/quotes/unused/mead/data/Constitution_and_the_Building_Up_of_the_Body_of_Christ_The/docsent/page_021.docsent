   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE BELIEVERS' GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UNVEILED IN THE WRITINGS OF JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we want to see the believers' growth in life unveiled in the writings of John.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the entire New Testament, the writings of John speak about life the most.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the synoptic Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not speak about life as much as John does.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 7 the Lord Jesus said that the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it v. 14 . But in John the Lord said that if we come to Him and drink, rivers of living water will flow out of our innermost being 7:37-38 . He also said that if we drink of Him, we will never thirst again 4:14 , and that if we eat of Him, we will never be hungry again 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. Its Source</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The believers' growth in life has a source, and the source is the eternal Word God in eternity John 1:1-2; 1 John 1:1 in whom is life John 1:4a; 1 John 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Singing to the Lord can help us to grow in life by contacting God as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would sing a hymn such as #1151 in Hymns three times every morning for one week, we would be different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of being dead and dying, we would be those who are living and growing in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Its Base 1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Redemption of Christ as the Lamb of God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The base of the believers' growth in life unveiled in the writings of John is first the redemption of Christ as the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Termination by the Crucifixion of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>in the Likeness of the Serpent</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The base of our growth in life is also the termination by the crucifixion of Christ in the likeness of the serpent John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ in typology is a lamb, but have we ever realized that Christ in type is also a brass serpent?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, so Christ as the Son of Man was lifted up on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He died as the Lamb of God because of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was lifted up on the cross in the form of a serpent because we became serpentine in our old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We were bitten by the old serpent, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Genesis 3 the old serpent came to poison our first mother and first father, so we also got poisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, we were poisoned nearly six thousand years ago when the first couple was poisoned by the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, we became serpents Matt 3:7; 12:34; 23:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why Christ died in the likeness of the serpent, the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 , to deal with and terminate the old serpent, Satan, the devil, and the serpentine nature within our old fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is seen in the type of the brass serpent lifted up in the wilderness by Moses in Numbers 21.</S>
