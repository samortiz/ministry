   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this lesson we want to see something concerning the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The King James Version renders the word fellowship as communion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Communion is a good translation, but its true meaning has been somewhat spoiled by traditional thought and usage.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Philippians 2:1 the apostle Paul speaks of the fellowship of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A number of translators consider that the spirit mentioned here is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But actually this is not the Spirit of God but our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know this because it is mentioned in the context of a list of our spiritual virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Philippians 2:1 Paul speaks of encouragement in Christ, consolation of love, fellowship of spirit, and tenderheartedness and compassions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are not the virtues of God but our spiritual virtues, so the spirit here must be our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to make this point clear to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is very important because this verse tells us that the fellowship of life is going on in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our spirit is the location of today's fellowship which we have with the Lord and with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 15:4-5 the word fellowship is not mentioned, but we know that these verses in fact refer to the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In these two verses the word used to indicate fellowship is abide.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said, "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This mutual abiding actually is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I. THE MEANING OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE A. Sharing in Common</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Greek the word for fellowship means sharing in common.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First Corinthians 10:16 says, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We share the Lord's Body in common, and we share the cup in common, so the Body and the cup become our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Philemon 6 Paul speaks of "the fellowship of your faith."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Philemon had a faith and with that faith there was a kind of sharing in common.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. The Flowing of the Divine Life within Us</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fellowship of life is the flowing of the divine life within us 1 John 1:2-3, 6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can illustrate this with two things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, the circulation of the blood is a very good illustration of the flowing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The blood within our physical body flows, circulates, all the time, and this circulating, or this flowing, is a good picture of the spiritual fellowship of life, the flowing of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another illustration that can be used is the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The current of electricity is the moving of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In like manner, the fellowship of life is the moving, the flowing, of the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all know the blood circulation needs the vessels of our body and the electrical current needs the wires.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are like the vessels and the wires for the spiritual flow of the divine life.</S>
