<p>The Bible reveals that a proper Christian should love the Lord, take Him as the center, and give Him the preeminence, the first place. Such a person should have a proper condition in his daily life. His schedule should have a proper time to rise and to go to bed. He should do everything in a regulated way. We must be such people, living a normal life; everything we do should be through prayer and consideration, whether it is going to bed, rising in the morning, eating our meals, or taking care of our business. If, according to our situation, it is right for us to rise at 6:30 in the morning, we should practice this daily. The first thing we should do after waking up is to draw near to the Lord. Before getting out of bed, we should call on the Lord without disturbing others. Following this, we should read a short portion of the Lord&rsquo;s Word. We should read at least two verses from the Bible, pray-reading the verses, reading by praying. Then while we are preparing for the day, we should muse over these verses. This is the proper condition of those who love the Lord as normal Christians.</p>
<p>We should not conduct ourselves according to our mood. We should not do something when we are happy but not do it when we are unhappy. Strictly speaking, a Christian should not have an unhappy moment. This is the reason that the Bible tells us to rejoice in the Lord always (1 Thes. 5:16; Phil. 3:1; 4:4). To rejoice is to be happy. A Christian should not be unhappy. Ephesians 4:26 says, &ldquo;Do not let the sun go down on your indignation.&rdquo; In other words, our anger should not last longer than twenty-four hours. The sun goes down once every twenty-four hours. Hence, our anger should vanish when the sun sets; otherwise, it is a sin. This is a command of the Lord. Christians should always rejoice and always give thanks to the Lord. If we begin our day in this way, we will live Christ throughout the whole day, and we will be filled with thanksgiving to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN OUR LIVING<br />
AND TAKING THE GOSPEL AS OUR MAIN OCCUPATION</h2>
<p>If a person lives Christ in his dealings with others and at home, work, and school, he will definitely preach the gospel. If he does not preach the gospel, he will feel empty within. We should preach the gospel not only when we knock on doors at an appointed time; we should preach the gospel everywhere. We should begin with areas that are close to us and then continue with areas that are farther away. This principle was set by the Lord Jesus. He said, &ldquo;You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (Acts 1:8). We should preach to our relatives, then to our friends and colleagues. If we are in the condition of Philadelphia, we will preach the gospel from morning until evening. This does not mean that we will drop our occupations and serve full time. Every Christian with a normal living should have a proper job where he works faithfully and competently. However, he should not sell himself as a slave to his occupation for the sake of a promotion or an increase in salary. Revelation 18:13 says that the souls of men are sold as cargo in Babylon the Great. This refers to men who sell themselves for employment. There is no need for us to sell ourselves for employment. We can have a job and preach the gospel at the same time. Apparently, our job is our main occupation; however, before the Lord our main occupation is to preach the gospel. Our job is a secondary occupation that enables us to cover our living expenses; our main occupation is to live for the Lord. Thus, our employment is actually our secondary occupation.</p>
<p>Apparently the main occupation of the young people is to study. However, because of their love for the Lord and His word, preaching the gospel becomes their main occupation, and their studies are secondary. Our primary occupation should be the preaching of the gospel. Every brother and sister in Philadelphia should preach the gospel and take the gospel as their primary occupation; their profession should be their secondary occupation. Even becoming the director of a manufacturing factory is but a secondary occupation. Our primary occupation is to earnestly preach the gospel to all our fellow employees and then to their families. We may feel that it is difficult and embarrassing to knock on doors, but if all the brothers and sisters preached the gospel in their daily living, there would be no need to knock on doors. If we would speak to our families, colleagues, and employees, they in turn would speak to the people around them.</p>
<p>It is normal for a teacher to preach the gospel to his students, to his colleagues and other staff members, and to their families. Even a junior employee can preach the gospel. Fifty years ago in Tsinan, Shantung Province, there was an important official who had studied in the United States. A believer, who considered gospel preaching to be his main occupation, worked as a janitor in the same department as this official. Every day after cleaning, the believer placed a gospel tract on the official&rsquo;s desk. When the official saw the gospel tract, he would angrily throw it away. Even though the brother would see the discarded gospel tract when he emptied the trash, he was not discouraged. Instead, he would place another gospel tract on the official&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>The brother, who worked as a janitor, not only placed gospel tracts on the official&rsquo;s desk; he also prayed desperately for the official. One day the official decided to visit the brother at home in order to know the reason he was receiving the gospel tracts. The brother and his wife were both saved and loved the Lord; hence, there was a pleasant situation in their family. The official and his wife admired what they saw and believed in the Lord. After believing in the Lord, preaching the gospel also became the primary occupation of the official. If all the brothers and sisters in Taipei were like this, we would not need to go door-knocking. A normal Christian works during the day and goes to meetings in the evening. He meets with his family at home, visits new believers in their homes, and meets together with several homes in a larger meeting.</p>
<p>A Christian should be living and active every day. When he rises in the morning, he should call on the Lord, read the Bible, and fellowship with the Lord. When he goes to work, he should preach the gospel. Throughout the day he should call on the Lord, sing, give thanks, praise, and pray. When he goes home in the evening, he should have a good meeting with his family. Meeting is our relaxation, our entertainment. In the meetings we sing, pray, read, and speak. As a result, everyone understands the truth, knows the Bible, and is able to speak for the Lord. Everyone speaks because there are no pastors or preachers. This kind of meeting inspires people to speak and function, and all kinds of gifts are manifested in the church life. Others should not be prevented from speaking if they have the gift of teaching. Although not all are teachers, all can speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>Regardless of what our condition is, we must see the picture in the Bible and be normal Christians. We should not rely on the messages given by gifted brothers on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Every day we must all study the truth systematically. The error of the Protestant denominations is that they only have a few famous speakers who give messages. A student who always listens to famous lecturers but never does any homework will not learn much. This has been our mistake. First Corinthians 14:26 says that when the church comes together, &ldquo;each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation.&rdquo; The Bible does not indicate that in a regular gathering of the church only one person should speak while others listen. Rather, all the saints should open their mouths and manifest their function.</p>
<p>In order to manifest our function, we need to call on the name of the Lord, pray-read His word, and fellowship with Him once we wake up in the morning. We need to know that our jobs are secondary occupations. Preaching the gospel is our primary occupation. In the evening we should attend home meetings or small group meetings, and we should all speak for the Lord. We should not have only one person speaking in our meetings; we all should speak. The more we exercise to speak, the more we will be able to speak. This should be our living.</p>
<p>I was saved and began to love the Lord before I was twenty years old. From that time I have pursued the Lord and diligently read the Bible and spiritual publications. When the pastor in the denomination where I was saw that I was pursuing the Lord, he invited me to speak in the big auditorium of the chapel. Because I was nervous after receiving this invitation, I began to practice speaking. I went to the seashore and spoke loudly to the ocean. A new believer who practices speaking after his salvation will not be afraid to speak even to a large number of people. If all the brothers and sisters practice this, we will surely be the church in Philadelphia, not Sardis or Laodicea.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> </body></html>
