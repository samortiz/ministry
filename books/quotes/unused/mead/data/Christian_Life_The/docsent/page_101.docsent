   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As our outer man is being consumed by the killing work of death, our inner man, that is, our regenerated spirit with the inward parts of our being, is being metabolically renewed day by day with the supply of the resurrection life.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, the Lord did not allow me to travel to the villages.</S>
