   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE JUDGMENT OF THE HOLY ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 17 Peter continues, And if you call upon as Father the One who without respect of persons judges according to each one s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse Peter comes to the matter of God s government, the particular point that he covers in his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The judgment of God is for the carrying out of His government.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy One who has called us as the Father has regenerated us to produce a holy family a holy Father with holy children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As holy children, we should walk in a holy manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Otherwise, the Father will become the Judge 4:17 to deal with our unholiness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He begat us with life inwardly that we may have His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He disciplines us with judgment outwardly that we may partake of His holiness Heb 12:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His judgment is according to our work, our conduct, without respect of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, we should pass the time of our sojourning in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we call upon Him as our Father, we should also fear Him as our Judge and live a holy life in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 17 Peter is not speaking of the final judgment of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In that sense the Father does not judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son John 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God s government in this world, exercised with regard to His children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Accordingly it says, the time of your sojourning here Darby .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is God s judgment on His own household 1 Pet 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since these two Epistles are concerned with the government of God, the judgment of God and of the Lord is referred to repeatedly 2:23; 4:5-6,17; 2 Pet 2:3-4, 9; 3:7 , as one of the essential items.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It began from the angels 2 Pet 2:3-4 and passed through the generations of man in the Old Testament 2 Pet 2:5-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then in the New Testament age it begins from the house of God 1 Pet 1:17; 2:23; 4:6, 17 and continues until the coming of the day of the Lord 2 Pet 3:10 , which will be a day of judgment on the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles before the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the millennium, all the dead, including men and demons, will be judged and perish 1 Pet 4:5; 2 Pet 3:7 , and the heavens and the earth will be burned up 2 Pet 3:10b, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The results of the varied judgments are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, by all these judgments the Lord God will clear up the entire universe and purify it so that He may have a new heaven and a new earth for a new universe filled with His righteousness 2 Pet 3:13 for His delight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God judges according to each one s work without respect of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The work in verse 17 refers to conduct, behavior, as in Romans 3:20 and Galatians 2:16.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>PASSING THE TIME OF OUR SOJOURNING IN FEAR</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 17 Peter urges us to pass the time of our sojourning in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a holy fear, as in Philippians 2:12.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It refers to a healthy, serious caution for us to behave in a holy manner.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such fear is mentioned a number of times in this book because its teaching is concerning the government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To pass the time of our sojourning in fear means to walk in a holy fear of God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The words pass the time include every minute of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Years ago I visited some saints in Las Vegas.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Certain of them suggested that I visit a gambling casino just to see what it is like.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I replied, No, I shall not go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If it were not for your invitation, I would never come to this evil city.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because you have invited me, I am now here with you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But I will not go to see a gambling casino.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I had gone to such a place, then a certain amount of time that day would not have been passed in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every minute of our sojourning must be in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is related to the holy manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In all our manner of life we need to become holy, separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verses 18 and 19 explain why we should pass the time of our sojourning in fear: Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why should we pass the time of our sojourning in fear?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because we know that we have been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is because we know this that we now pass the time of our sojourning in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The point here is that the holy manner of life should issue out from the dear and precious redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul tells us that Christ has redeemed us from the curse of sin and from this evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peter, however, tells us that Christ has redeemed us from the vain manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is vain to indulge in worldly entertainments or to purchase worldly clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The vain manner of life may also be related to the way we do our shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some sisters very much like to go shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every week they go to the department store at least to look around even if they do not buy anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do you not know who you are?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are sons and daughters of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As children of the King, you should not go to a department store in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the contrary, you should be stately and dignified even in your shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I use this as an illustration of being redeemed in a practical way from the vain manner of life.</S>
