   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 15 Date:July 10, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER P. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family, and it was difficult for me to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While I was in my office one day, I asked out of curiosity if there was ever a man on earth who never lied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My boss told me that only Christians do not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I began to look for such ones in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later I was saved in a China Inland Mission church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I became a seeking Christian and subscribed to The Christian as well as The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the same time, I wanted to become rich, and the Lord had to stop me through an illness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By then I had been saved for two years already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After I returned home, my sickness went away, and I began to work in the Bible Society, hoping to have an opportunity to go to college and later to study in America.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the Lord caused me to become sick again, this time almost unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He showed me that the the world is about to pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I told the Lord, "I will crave the things in the world no longer."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I said this, my sickness went away.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I intended to go to Chefoo to recuperate, but I wanted to take up a teaching job in order to spend time studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Soon my school colleagues rallied together against me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day I felt that they had insulted me too much.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I lost my temper and hit some of them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They hit back, and there was a brawl.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time Brother Witness Lee came to Chefoo and started the Lord's table, and I had already broken bread with the brothers there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was overjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the school increased my work so that I could not go to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord gave me a word, and I quit my job.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later I began to serve the Lord together with Brother Witness in the church in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1940 I went to Shanghai and received some training.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time I had tuberculosis and became sick again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am like a piece of decayed wood that cannot be carved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For the past few years I have been downtrodden.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I lost all interest in the work, my health deteriorated, and I became quite depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the Lord's mercy that I can come up to the mountain this time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As far as my health is concerned, I cannot even walk around.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thank the Lord that I saw something through the messages on Thursday and Friday.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am no longer struggling to climb up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This will only become a hindrance to me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I ask the brothers and sisters to pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT The Lord as the Center</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times a man suffers unexpected sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people think that the Lord will protect their health as long as they are working for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since they have wasted themselves in His service, they think that He surely will preserve them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day I became gravely ill and was vomiting blood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This came as a great surprise to me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I did not understand God's reason for doing this to me, and I fell into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps it was because I did not follow the law of the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But it also could have been God's dealing with me to remove my trust in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 2 Corinthians 1 Paul spoke of his afflictions in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was excessively burdened, even to the point where he despaired of living, having the judgment of death in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Response of death can be rendered "judgment of death" in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although this death has yet to be executed, the judgment has been pronounced already.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul realized that this was so that we would not "base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead" v. 9b . How strict the apostle was in dealing with his self-love! With many people, as soon as they have an inkling of the judgment of death such as being found with tuberculosis or vomiting blood , they are decimated, and they sink subconsciously into self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, our whole life is a journey towards death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even as we are sleeping in our bed we are walking towards death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of course, the reality of death does not come to us until we experience such sicknesses as tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then it seems as if a death pronouncement has been made on us; we sense the transience of human life, and everything seems to be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a man is at his critical hour, death becomes real to him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His self-love is severely threatened.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even his own life is at risk.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At such times his future hinges on how he reacts to the blows.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He may lose his future and everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many times a question will arise in him: "What do I really believe?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What am I hoping to receive?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If our faith is based on our physical life, we will only find spiritual respite and faith when our physical life revives.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Subconsciously, this means that our physical life has become the center of our being; even our spiritual life is something ancillary.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The result of making our own life the center is that every spiritual thing in us leaks away at critical junctures.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They leak away like water leaking from a broken barrel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The best test of what is our center occurs when the Lord threatens our life a little.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the natural life is the center, we forget all spiritual work and service because we are about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If our natural life has become our center, it is good that God smites us because we have built up a wrong center in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should center everything around the spiritual things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our center should not be our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The result of having a wrong center is losing everything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Suppose a widow only has one son.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She has consecrated herself to the Lord, along with her only son.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If her son dies, her consecration will be greatly tested.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>She will feel as if the floor has collapsed under her.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She will say, "All of my prayer, trust, and consecration have come to nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This immediately shows that her whole life has been revolving around her only son.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The same can be said of our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we have centers other than the Lord, our true nature will be exposed as soon as these centers are threatened.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Basically a Christian should be clear where his center lies.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The subconscious center of many people is themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If their center is the spiritual life and the Lord, it will not matter whether ten physical lives are lost.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we become sick, we should not ask for recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Instead, we should let go of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is no need to worry or hope for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If our life fails, let it fail.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have to confess humbly that our center has been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have to turn back to the Lord and acknowledge Him as our only hope.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Every saint should learn this basic lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We should find out whether or not our center is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Actually, we may have many centers in addition to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We can ask God why He is not merciful to us and why He deals with us as He does.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, we will realize that our center is not the Lord but ourselves only when death is knocking at our door.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the reason you cannot rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You have to discard all the things that contribute to your self-centeredness.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now is not the time to recover your faith and work.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Your center is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you recover your former faith, service, and zeal, it will not do you any good.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord's purpose is to remove your very person.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Many people do not touch God's center, and they hold on to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>You should say to God, "I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I can let go of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The God whom I serve is still the Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>God, let everything that can fall fall!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Let everything that can be removed be removed!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Even if something can be recovered, I do not want it.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If this thing has not passed through death, what good will it do me to seek after it?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>God, my life is in Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I will let go of everything!"</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>No human worry will resurrect you.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>No human hope will resurrect you.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The only One who can resurrect you is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If your center is the Lord, your course will be straight.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The Lord is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>May the Lord deliver you out of other centers.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Some workers have the work as their center.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>How foolish this is!</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The work is not the center.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Nothing is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>A man cannot have any center other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The Lord alone is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Only this will give you the full rest.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Any center apart from the Lord will be destroyed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Do not think that this is cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>This is your protection; it keeps you on the straight pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>You should have no center other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>His hand is gradually destroying everything other than Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>He will not allow anything else to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Ephesians 1:10 says, "Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Unless the Lord becomes your very center, you cannot serve Him.</S>
