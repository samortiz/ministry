        <h2 class="head1">THE COMPLETED REVELATION IN THE BIBLE<br />
NOT BEING EASILY SEEN</h2>
<p>In our ministry of the word in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we are also burdened for the completion of the revelation of God. It is easy for Christians to see the teachings in the Old Testament, in the Gospels, and in Acts, but few Christians see the central revelation in Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. This central revelation is not concerning husbands loving their wives or wives being subject to their husbands. It is not concerning worshipping God, fearing God, or even loving God. Worshipping God, fearing Him, loving Him, loving one&rsquo;s wife, being subject to one&rsquo;s husband, honoring one&rsquo;s parents, being perfect, being well-pleasing to God, and being redeemed and regenerated are revelations in the Bible. However, these revelations are not the completing revelation. The completing revelation is &ldquo;the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations&rdquo; (Col. 1:26). This mystery is &ldquo;Christ in you&rdquo; (v. 27). Thousands of Christians read the Bible, and they see many things but not the central revelation in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.</p>
<p>Those in Christianity have heard many sermons concerning how to worship God, how to fear God, how to get saved, how to do good deeds, how to please God, how to preach the gospel, how to be filled by the Holy Spirit, how to have power from on high, how to testify for the Lord, how to love one&rsquo;s own wife, and how to be subject to one&rsquo;s own husband. However, in Christianity we did not hear a message concerning &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; We heard everything but the central revelation of God. To those in Christianity the Bible seems to consist only of thirty-nine books in the Old Testament and the four Gospels and the one book of Acts in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Some in Christianity may speak concerning Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Paul&rsquo;s other Epistles. However, when they speak concerning Romans, they speak only of man being sinful, the need of redemption, being justified by faith, presenting one&rsquo;s body as a living sacrifice to prove the well-pleasing will of God, being subject to authorities, and paying taxes where taxes are due. Much has been spoken concerning Romans. However, there is one point that has not been spoken, and this point is Romans 8:10: &ldquo;If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo; Hence, people generally neglect the completing word, the word that completes the revelation of God.</p>
<p>The same applies to us. We receive many teachings and much light from the messages that we hear and from reading the Life-study messages and the writings of Brother Nee. However, we lack the central light. The truths concerning baptism, bread-breaking, and head covering have been proclaimed for over forty years, but we do not see God&rsquo;s completing word. We read the Gospels but do not see the central revelation. We even read Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, which are full of the central revelation, but we do not see it.</p>
<p>Although we have been in many wedding ceremonies, we probably never heard a minister say, &ldquo;So-and-so, you are in Christ, and Christ abides in you. You cannot be a good husband in yourself. Christ wants to be the good husband in you.&rdquo; At every wedding ceremony the minister reads Ephesians 5 and then exhorts the couple, saying, &ldquo;Groom So-and-so, are you willing to love your wife from this day on? Bride So-and-so, are you willing to be subject to your husband from this day on?&rdquo; In the prayer books for the ministers there is even a special section on how to conduct weddings. It is true that loving one&rsquo;s wife and being subject to one&rsquo;s husband are in the Bible, but these are not the completing word.</p>
<p>The completing word is the mystery that has been hidden from the ages and from the generations. This mystery is &ldquo;Christ in you.&rdquo; Paul in his Epistles elaborates on this mystery. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we too are elaborating on this word. Our ministry of the word is a ministry that completes the divine revelation.</p>
<p>Christians are ignorant concerning God&rsquo;s completing word, and even many elders and co-workers among us do not see the completing word. It is possible to talk about coordination, about the younger ones being subject to the older ones, and about many other things, yet we may not have a basic understanding of the completion of God&rsquo;s word. Coordination is not the completion of God&rsquo;s word nor is the breaking of bread or head covering. The completion of God&rsquo;s word is &ldquo;Christ in you.&rdquo; However, people do not see this word when they read the Bible, because it is a mystery. Even though this mystery is emphasized in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, people read it but do not see it.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
