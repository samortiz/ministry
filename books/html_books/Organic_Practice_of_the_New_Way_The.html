<p> This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in March 1989 in Taipei and Taichung, Taiwan.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">A BIRD&rsquo;S-EYE VIEW<br />
OF THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; John 15:16; 1 Cor. 14:3-4, 24b-25, 31, 39; Acts 6:4; 2:42</h1>
<p>After four years and four months of study and learning concerning the practice of the new way, we have now reached a conclusion. Broadly speaking, we have studied thoroughly the four steps of begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building. The first step is to preach the gospel by visiting people. This is spiritual begetting. The second step is to nourish the newly saved ones in the home meetings. This is nourishing. The third step is to help these ones to attend the small group meetings, where there is not only the teaching, but the all-inclusive perfecting as well. This is spiritual teaching. The fourth step is for everyone to prophesy in the church meeting. This is building. Instead of saying begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building, we can also say begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and building. The teaching is actually the perfecting. The result of perfecting is that everyone comes together to prophesy for the Lord. This is the practical building up. All these four steps have their theoretical basis in the Scripture, and they are a conclusion we have drawn through our experience of nearly seventy years in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, plus a summary of the materials that we have collected through our research.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCORDING TO THE REVELATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is an entirely new revelation. It has inherited nothing from the Old Testament. This revelation began first with John the Baptist and was continued in the Lord Jesus. The record of the four Gospels is a record of the ministries of these two persons. After the Lord Jesus, there were the twelve apostles, with the one hundred twenty that coordinated with them in their service. They are represented by Peter. There was much revelation through them in the first half of the book of Acts. Then we come to Paul, who not only occupies the second half of the book of Acts, but wrote his own Epistles, fourteen of them in all, from Romans to Hebrews. After Paul, the aged John followed with his mending ministry, and the revelation of the entire New Testament economy was complete. These revelations constitute the canon of the New Testament. Hence, from Matthew to Revelation, we have God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is the entire New Testament revelation, and which forms the teachings of the apostles. Although the church became degraded and deformed even before the early apostles passed away, this book of revelation is preserved intact until today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FEW MAJOR RECOVERIES IN HISTORY</h2>
<p>After the church became degraded, the Roman Catholic Church appeared. From approximately the sixth century until the sixteenth century, for a period of ten centuries, the history of the West was known as the Dark Ages. Throughout this period, although the Bible was there, it was locked up by the Catholic Church. The Holy Spirit would not tolerate this, nor would the seekers of the Lord agree to this. Therefore, in every century the Lord raised up some men for the move of His recovery work. A brother by the name of E. H. Broadbent has written a book called <em>The Pilgrim Church.</em> In that book, he pointed out the line of recovery throughout the ages and included all the recovery works from the second century until the sixteenth century.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Recovery of Luther</h2>
<p>The consummation of all those recoveries was the recovery with Martin Luther. Luther recovered the truth of justification by faith and unlocked the closed Bible; he made it an open book. He did some study concerning the matter of the church. At the beginning, he thought that he would only recover the truth and would not leave the Catholic Church. He still considered the Catholic Church the only church of God on earth, and he felt that he could not start something new.</p>
<p>But God&rsquo;s sovereign hand would not allow him to stay in Catholicism. At the beginning, when he conducted the reform and sounded out the truth, the Catholic Church had no intention to remove him. For a while, he was allowed to carry on the work of reformation with the truth. Later, when the truth he preached became too prevailing and the Catholic Church was too much affected, the Catholic Church plotted to remove him. At that time, the rulers of Germany were unwilling to be subject to the control of the Catholic Church and had already separated from Rome politically. When the Church sought the life of Luther, Germany stepped in to protect him and through him established the German state church. This is the first state church in history. After that, the nations in northern Europe followed this example one after another. All kinds of state churches, such as the Anglican Church, the Swedish Church, and the Danish Church, came into being. This was the age of the state churches. By the end of the sixteenth century, the independent churches such as the Presbyterians, the Baptists, and the Congregationalists were also formed. This indicates that from the time of Luther&rsquo;s reformation many believers have been studying the way Christians should meet, worship, serve, and work. But this was only a beginning. Not much had taken form yet.</p><h2 class="head2">The Mystics Emphasizing the Inner Life</h2>
<p>Not long after this, the main body of Protestantism, in particular that system of state churches under the influence of Luther, became weak in the matter of life. Although in the matter of truth they were more clear than the Catholic Church, their condition was like that of the church in Sardis in Revelation, being weak and dying. For this reason, the Lord raised up the mystics within the Roman Catholic Church, who emphasized the inner life. They paid particular attention to the pursuit of the inner life and the spirit. The leading ones among this group were Father Fenelon and Madame Guyon. They were quite good in the experience of life, and they said quite a lot concerning the Body of Christ. They even knew something concerning the principle of the Body of Christ. However, they did not have the practical church life. They remained in Catholicism and were not even fully delivered from idolatry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Beginning of the Church Life<br />
through the Moravian Brothers</h2>
<p>After the mystics, a brother by the name of Zinzendorf was raised up in the eighteenth century in the southern part of Germany near Bohemia. He received many persecuted and exiled Christians. Brothers from different denominations went to him for refuge. He prevailed upon all these brothers to give up their doctrinal disputes and backgrounds, and to meet together in oneness. There they began to practice the church life. In church history, this group of people was known as the Moravian Brothers. Although they brought in a great revival, it can only be considered as an elementary stage. Nothing was fully on the right track yet.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Further Recovery of the Church Life<br />
and the Opening Up of the Truth<br />
through the Brethren</h2>
<p>Almost another century passed by. By the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England. Among them there were many famous teachers, including J. N. Darby, Benjamin Newton, and William Kelly. They were raised up at about the same time and became extremely prevailing. The vision and revelation poured out of them like waterfalls. Not only did they see the light in a thorough and complete way; they have opened up the prophecies, the types, and many basic truths such as the dispensations, the distinction between the Old and the New Testament, and the matter of law and grace. At the same time, they made quite a lot of progress in different aspects of practices such as the way to meet, worship, serve, and work. Unfortunately, they paid too much attention to the truths. In a short time, within thirty years, Darby and Newton began to have different views on the truth concerning the second coming of Christ. One was for rapture before the tribulation. The other was for rapture after the tribulation. From that time on, the Brethren were divided. Up until today, they have been divided into over a thousand groups. Due to this division, the Brethren became desolate by the twentieth century.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY IN CHINA</h2>
<p>Because of the failure of the Brethren, the Lord could not get through in the West. For this reason, during the 1920s the Lord went to the Far East and began His new recovery in the virgin soil of China. The first one raised up by the Lord among us was Brother Watchman Nee. He was a very brilliant person, and he was especially capable in reading books and selecting materials from them. He was saved at the age of seventeen and began to publish books at the age of twenty. By the age of twenty-two, he had collected about three thousand volumes of basic books in Christianity covering subjects such as church history, biographies, sermons, and commentaries. Not only had he read through these books; he extracted the best points from each one. He was able to introduce others to all the truths beginning from the second century. Today, we have collected most of these truths in the New Testament Recovery Version. Concerning matters related to the church meetings, worship, and service, there was nothing before Zinzendorf. Something worthwhile was there at the time of Zinzendorf. By the time we come to the British Brethren, there are more that deserve attention. When Brother Nee began his ministry, he picked up eighty percent of the practices of the British Brethren, such as the way to meet, worship, break bread, and work. These matters were practiced among us for over ten years.</p>
<p>After 1933, Brother Nee went on and began to see further light from the Lord. He began to put question marks on some of the Brethren practices of the church life. Finally, his study led him to conclude that the Sunday morning message meeting with one person speaking and all the others listening in a big congregation should be condemned. He strongly rebuked this practice in the two books <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> and <em>Church Affairs.</em> He mentioned this matter first in 1937 and then again in 1948. The following summer, the mainland fell into the hands of the Communists. Thereafter, Brother Nee was put into prison. He remained there for over twenty years until he passed away in 1972. He did not have a chance to see the matter put into practice.</p>
<p>In 1949 I came to Taiwan. At that time the conditions in Taiwan were very harsh. Brother Nee was in prison, and we had lost our support. It was difficult to have a start in the work. Notwithstanding, we had inherited what Brother Nee had given us through his thirty years of studying, and we continued to work in Taiwan. Although I was very clear at that time that Brother Nee had condemned the Sunday morning message meeting of one person speaking and all the rest listening, speaking according to the circumstances, the time was not ripe for any change. We continued with this for over thirty years. By 1984, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery had fully penetrated into the English-speaking world and had spread from the United States to six continents throughout the world, with over eight hundred churches. However, the condition among us was somewhat like that of the church in Sardis in Revelation. Before God, we had everything. But nothing was completed (Rev. 3:2b). Some churches could be compared to animals in hibernation; they were half-asleep. For this reason, we spent over four years here in Taipei to make a study based on the record of the Bible and the practices of Christians throughout the ages. We believe that the result of our study is complete and scriptural.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR STEPS IN<br />
THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY&mdash;<br />
BEGETTING, NOURISHING, TEACHING, AND BUILDING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Begetting&mdash;Gaining People by Knocking on Doors</h2>
<p>The service that God ordains for us in His New Testament economy is first to &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19). The meaning of the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; is very extensive. When you go, surely you have to visit people. After our prolonged study, we have discovered that to visit people by knocking on their doors is the most effective way to carry out the going.</p>
<p>In order to take care of the begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building all at the same time, we should not beget too many all at once. If we do, we will not be able to nourish them. It is better that we beget only a few and then care for them properly. Hence, we do not need to knock on doors every day. We do not even need to do that every week, or every month. For example, there may be five or six brothers and sisters who are burdened to go out. You should then come together to pray until all the sins in you have been thoroughly dealt with and all of you are full of life. You can then go out three to a team to preach the gospel by visiting others by knocking on their doors. If you devote one evening a week to do this, after four weeks, you will gain about a dozen people. Dividing these new ones among the three, each will have three or four to care for. Then you should temporarily stop the door knocking and should spend your time to care for these three or four people.</p>
<p>If you care for them once every two or three days and continue this way for half a year, at least one out of three or four of these new ones will remain. This one that remains, after having been cared for, nourished, and helped for half a year, will be able to function in the church. By then, you can begin afresh, three to a team, to go out and knock on more doors. In another four weeks, you will gain about another dozen new ones, with each one of you caring for three or four. Then you will stop the door knocking again and will care for these new ones for another half a year. In this way, by the end of the year, you will surely have two remaining fruit. The Lord said, &ldquo;I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain&rdquo; (John 15:16). If you would follow this way conscientiously, you will definitely bear two remaining fruit each year.</p>
<p>Moreover, you need to work according to your ability. Do not baptize too many people and leave them there without the proper nourishing. Also, do not try to go out all at the same time in a big crowd. Simply take your time to go out, three by three, at your convenience. According to the statistics we received from the Training Center, we should knock more on what we call the &ldquo;warm doors.&rdquo; Everyone has friends and relatives. You should put the people you know on a list, and you should visit them and preach the gospel to them after careful arrangement and proper telephone appointment. You can also ask the new ones to give you their business cards, with a few words on them to their friends and relatives, explaining that you are a devout Christian desiring to visit them. After such arrangements, the three of you can set out together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Nourishing&mdash;Caring in the Home Meetings</h2>
<p>After visiting people, preaching the gospel to them, and bringing them to salvation, you should care for them in the home meetings. This is like a mother who has just given birth to a baby; she has to nurse the baby. All the mothers know that it is very easy for a child to die during the first three months after he is born. The mother must care for the baby carefully and cautiously. After three months, the condition is more stable. In the same way, after you baptize a person, you should preferably spend one to two hours to nourish and teach him. Within three days, you must go back to him. Thereafter, you should visit him on an average of once every three days, or two times a week. If you care for him in this way for a month, his condition will become stable. To get the best result, the same person should beget, nourish, and care for the new one.</p>
<p>The home meetings are easy to conduct. But it requires your diligence. After a person is baptized, immediately you have to help him to call on the Lord so that he would know that he has a spirit and that the Lord is the Spirit and that He is living in him. Thereafter, once every three days, you should go back to him and teach him one lesson each time. For the content of these lessons, you can refer to the ten points that we have mentioned before. After a month, you should start bringing him to the small group meetings and the district meetings.</p><h2 class="head2">Teaching&mdash;Instructing and Perfecting<br />
in the Small Group Meetings</h2>
<p>How should the small group meetings be conducted? The key is to be organic. The small group meeting should begin from your own home. Although the time of the meeting may be scheduled at 7:30, you should begin praying at home before seven o&rsquo;clock. While you are on the way to the meeting, you should continue to pray and praise. When you arrive at the brother&rsquo;s house, you may find that some brothers are there already. You should then begin the meeting by praising, praying, or fellowshipping. The content of the meeting should be of the following items only: the first is fellowship; the second is prayer; the third is mutual care; the fourth is the teaching of the truth; the fifth is the pursuit of life; and the sixth is the mutual encouragement and teaching, and the preaching of the gospel by going out to visit people. Every time the small group comes together, whatever it does, the content should be one of these six things. Some may arrive early. They can begin praising or praying, or interceding for the ones that are sick, or giving testimonies of healing, thus caring for one another. Perhaps some may ask about the significance of the Lord&rsquo;s Table. Every attendant should speak a little. In a few minutes, the truth will be made clear. If others have not covered the matter thoroughly, you can spend a few more minutes to explain a little the meaning of the breaking of bread. This is what I mean by an organic small group. All of you need to learn to practice this.</p>
<p>If you are willing to do this for six months and the new ones see this kind of example week after week, spontaneously they will also become organic. In this way, after half a year, of the dozen or so new ones, at least a few will be able to &ldquo;graduate,&rdquo; to leave the original small group to establish their own new small groups. They will preach the gospel by visiting people accordingly. And after people are saved, they will learn to nourish them in their homes and will set up organic small groups. In this way, after a saved one learns in a small group for half a year, he can do everything. He can preach the gospel and can bring in the new ones. He can set up new small groups, and he can prophesy. Whatever you can do, he can do also. An organic small group should have this kind of perfecting. In this way, the gifts and the riches in life that are in everyone are manifested. As a result, everyone will be able to prophesy in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building&mdash;Prophesying in the District Meetings</h2>
<p>To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. It is to supply Christ to others. This is the main work in the church meetings. The whole chapter of 1 Corinthians 14 talks about prophesying. It promotes, uplifts, recommends, and encourages prophesying. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; In the end, verse 39 says, &ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy.&rdquo; Once you prophesy, you excel (v. 12), and the meeting becomes rich. Verse 31 says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; Everyone can do it. No one is unable to do it. Verse 24 says, &ldquo;But if all prophesy.&rdquo; This means that all should prophesy in the meetings. As a result, when an unbeliever comes, &ldquo;he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you&rdquo; (vv. 24b-25). Prophesying enables all to &ldquo;learn and all be encouraged&rdquo; (v. 31). Moreover, to prophesy is to speak to men for building up and encouragement and consolation, that the church may be built up (vv. 3-4). Hence, we all need to learn to prophesy.</p>
<p>In order that everyone can prophesy, there is a practical and simple way, which is to have every saint revived every morning. Every week, divide up a chapter of the Bible into six portions, and read one portion each morning, picking out two verses in it for pray-reading. Then write down the inspiration and response every day. On Saturday evening, pray-read over the inspirations that are written, and compose a paragraph from them for prophesying. Preferably, you should help the brothers and sisters to improve a little on these compositions so that the content will be concise. You should also tell them that these compositions are simply memos. During the district meetings, they should not read from them. Rather they should speak them out as in ordinary speakings. During the speaking, if they have further inspiration, they should add a few words to them. In this way, the saints will pick up the boldness in the meetings and will be able to speak for the Lord. Of course, the most difficult thing to learn in prophesying is to have the spiritual inspiration. If there is no inspiration, it will become mechanical, and the result will not be a prophesying. For this reason, the prophesying has to be living and organic. Brother Nee once said that if a speaker can never have instant utterance, his message will never be strong. A strong message requires instant utterance. In other words, there is the need for instant inspiration, plus the utterance to express it. Hence, when we speak for the Lord, we have to pay attention to the instant inspiration. With the inspiration, there is also the need for the utterance to express it.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING IN THREE THINGS</h2>
<p>You need to be a living person, and your prophesying needs to be living. In short, you must be a person who seeks after the Lord and loves Him. At the same time, you must exercise yourself in three things: (1) prayer, (2) living Christ, and (3) fellowship. In Acts chapter six, the twelve apostles gathered the disciples together and said, &ldquo;But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (v. 4). Acts 2:42 also says that from the day the three thousand were baptized, &ldquo;they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo; Therefore, in order for your prophesying to be living, you must first be a person of prayer. You must also be a person who seeks after life, living daily in the spirit, and having the proper testimony in your daily life. This testimony is not merely one of being a nice person, living properly according to ethics and morality, but the testimony of one who walks according to the spirit in everything in your daily life and who lives Christ all day long.</p>
<p>In addition, you must be a person who knows how to fellowship in the church. Everything that has to do with your Christian life or church service should be brought into fellowship. Today, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has spread to the whole world. Due to the convenience in traffic, communication is frequent among the churches. The elders should have the discernment and the proper fellowship so that false ones will not come in. From my youth, I have received the training to fellowship in everything. I have always kept this principle of fellowship.</p>
<p>In your fellowship you have to learn to be honest and to speak in a genuine way. When someone asks you about the condition of a certain brother, you should fellowship the truth. You should not brush the matter aside. You have to realize that our fellowship is not a matter of finding out other people&rsquo;s faults. Rather it is to perfect others and to build up the church through this kind of fellowship. In this way, everyone will receive the benefit.</p>
<p>If you will spend six days a week to learn the Lord&rsquo;s word this way and will be a praying person, living Christ, and bringing everything into fellowship, when you stand up to speak, your speaking will surely be living and organic. In the district meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, you will surely be able to prophesy and will build up the saints and the church. All these require your learning and practice.</p>

<h1 class="title">THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:16; 1 Cor. 9:19-23; 1 Thes. 2:7; John 21:15; Eph. 4:11-12</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You from the depths of our being. You have gathered us together here. May You bring every one of us and the whole meeting into Your Holy of Holies. We are looking to You here, touching Your throne of grace. May we open up ourselves to You that You may have a way within us. May You also open Yourself to us that we may have a way in You. Lord, defeat Your enemy, and gain all of us. Gain our inward being, and touch the innermost part of us. May every one of us be open before You and offer You a fresh consecration that we may have a renewed revival and a fresh beginning. Lord Jesus, may You speak to the depths of our being again and touch our feelings. Gain our spirits thoroughly to be Your eternal habitation, so that we can be one spirit with You and that You can have a way to move on this earth. Lord Jesus, we love You, and we want to follow You. We desire to live for You and to live You out on earth. Lord, while we are speaking here, be one spirit with us, and speak in our speaking. Grant us the fresh words, the words that touch Your heart&rsquo;s desire. Reveal to us Your own word. Lord, the enemy has no ground here. All the power of darkness is removed. May You be everything here. May all the glory go to You. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR STEPS IN THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>This time we want to consider practically this new way that we have arrived at through four and a half years of studying and research. After all the study and investigation, we have to admit that the four major steps in this way are all revealed in the Bible and are ordained by God, that is, (1) the begetting of people through the preaching of the gospel, (2) the nourishing of people through the home meetings, (3) the perfecting of people through the small group meetings, and (4) the building up through the prophesying in the big meetings. Thank the Lord. After these four and a half years, the church in Taipei has finally been put on the right track and is on the right way. These four steps comprise the structure of our meetings, worship, service, and living for the Lord. To put the matter in a simple way, this structure is of one kind of gospel preaching and three kinds of meetings&mdash;the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the district meetings. However, although this structure is here today, there is the urgent need to have its content enriched.</p>
<p>The reason we were not satisfied with the past way is that it did not afford the saints the proper development in three things: the begetting, the nourishing, and the teaching. Our way in the past was too general and too vague. Now, as long as a brother or sister has a little desire for the Lord after he or she is saved, we can lead him or her on step by step, from begetting to nourishing, and from nourishing to teaching. The teaching here is the same as the perfecting in Ephesians 4. The gifted ones are not there to do the work directly. For example, the evangelists are not there to preach the gospel directly. Their main job is to perfect the saints to do that which they are capable of doing. This is like the college professors. They do not engage directly in the trade that they are teaching. Rather they are there in the school to perfect the students. After a few years, when the students graduate, they can do the same thing that the professors do. This is what we hope to see. But the message meetings we had in the past made everyone a passive listener. No one was perfected. Although we have seen from the Bible during the past few decades that every saved person is a priest and, as a result of this, we have been strongly advocating the universal priesthood, yet we have never arrived at this point.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AS PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL OFFERING MAN TO GOD</h2>
<p>A priest is one who offers sacrifices to God. The sacrifices offered by the Old Testament priests were the bulls and goats. The sacrifices offered by the New Testament priests are the saved persons. The strongest proof of this point is in the case of John the Baptist. He was born into a priestly family and was therefore born a priest. Moreover, he was the firstborn and the only begotten, and he should therefore have inherited the priesthood from his father. However, John the Baptist did not behave in this way. He did not live in the temple. On the contrary, he lived in the wilderness (Luke 1:80). When he came out to work, he did not kill bulls and goats for sacrifices. Rather, he called for people to repent and offered the repentant ones to God one by one (Matt. 3:1, 5-6). Hence, what John the Baptist did was a sign, showing others that the age had changed. The Old Testament age was over. The Old Testament priests have now been turned to become the New Testament priests. This can be proved from Romans 15:16. There Paul says, &ldquo;That I should be...to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, we are all priests of the gospel. If we do not bring sinners to salvation and offer them up to God, we have forfeited our priesthood. We have seen in the past that according to God&rsquo;s desire, the priesthood is not composed of a minority of people. It is not composed of one tribe, or one clan. Rather it should include all the saints. However, those who participate in the spiritual work of helping others in knowing the truth and experiencing life are still the minority. This is why, when I came back in 1984, I brought up the matter of a change in the system. The old system has created a distinction between the clergy and the laity. This is an Old Testament situation. In the Old Testament, among the Israelites, only those of the house of Aaron in the tribe of Levi were allowed to be priests. All others were not allowed to be priests. Even the Levites were only there to help in the miscellaneous chores. They were like today&rsquo;s housekeepers in the meeting halls.</p>
<p>At this point, I would like to ask how many fruit you have borne this year. These fruit are the sacrifices you offer up to God. In the old creation, fruit trees bear fruit once every year. But in the new creation, there is fruit-bearing every month. Each month there is the yielding of fresh fruit (Rev. 22:2). Hence, if we do not bring one person to salvation a month and offer him to God, we are not fulfilling the duty of a priest. It is not a small thing for branches not to bear fruit and for priests not to offer up sacrifices.</p>
<p>The Lord speaks concerning the matter of fruit-bearing in John 15. There He says, &ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit&rdquo; (v. 16). The word &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; here has the sense of commissioning, just like an ambassador being commissioned by a government. The Lord has commissioned us to go forth to bear fruit. If we do not bear fruit, the Lord says again, &ldquo;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away&rdquo; (v. 2). This is a very dangerous situation. It does not say here that one will not be saved if he does not bear fruit. By no means does it say that. God&rsquo;s salvation is eternal. However, if a branch is cut off from the tree, it cannot enjoy the sap of the tree any longer; the fellowship with the tree is cut off. No doubt you are saved. But if you are cut off, you will not be able to enjoy the riches of the life of Christ. I say this to stir you up. Today the Lord has not returned yet. We may think that we all can take it easy. But if the Lord returns today, what will you do at the judgment seat? In Matthew 25 the Lord told the slave who did not gain any profit that such an evil and slothful slave would be cast into outer darkness where there will be gnashing of teeth (vv. 26, 30). Today, no matter how much we suffer, our labor will be only for a few decades. It cannot be compared to the suffering we would receive from the Lord&rsquo;s punishment in the future. Since the Lord has chosen us and has appointed us to go forth to bear fruit, we must go, labor, and strive to save the sinners. Only then will we have fruit to offer to God.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL BY VISITING PEOPLE<br />
AND BRINGING THEM TO SALVATION</h2>
<p>How do we bear fruit by bringing people to salvation? During the past four years or more, we have practiced the visiting of people by knocking on their doors to save men through the preaching of the gospel. Strictly speaking, it is not a matter of knocking on doors. Rather, it is a matter of contacting people. To save people, we have to contact them. For example, to catch the fish, whether with a rod or with a net, we have to go to the places where there are fish. How can we not contact people when we are living in human society? Our communal life is simply a people-contacting life. First, we all have our relatives and in-laws. How many of these relatives do we have? Are they all saved? I am afraid that three-quarters of them are not saved yet. All these are the targets of our door-knocking. The Lord says in Acts 1:8 that &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo; In preaching the gospel, we work from the center to the circumference, and then to the remotest part of the earth. Hence, you must first preach the gospel to your close relatives. Next you should go to your cousins and in-laws. In addition, your neighbors, classmates, and colleagues are all good potential targets. There are also lots of people in the public parks on the weekends. You can stop by one of the parks and preach the gospel to someone there. The opportunity abounds everywhere. The question is whether or not we are willing to do it.</p>
<p>If you are to preach the gospel to your classmates, first you have to build up a reputation. When they know that you are a &ldquo;Jesus-fanatic,&rdquo; and that the more you speak about Jesus, the more people change, they will begin to trust in you and will gradually believe in what you preach. There was a brother who used to work in the Telegraph Company. He preached to others all the time. His colleagues nicknamed him &ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo; When he came into the office, everyone made fun of him by saying, &ldquo;Hi, Jesus!&rdquo; One day, the Telegraph Company encountered a problem. There was a sum of money that needed to be entrusted to someone. Everyone agreed that it should be entrusted to &ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo; After all, it was &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; that they trusted in. When you preach the gospel and others mock you, there may be the feeling of being ill-treated. However, others know in their heart that you are actually the reliable one.</p>
<p>It is so strange that when men talk about politics, the economy, or Chinese Confucianism, they become proud and loud. But when they talk about Jesus, they feel shameful; nothing seems to be able to come out of their mouths. This sense of shame is from the Devil. Actually, to talk about Jesus is the most glorious matter. Do not accept the feeling from the Devil. Every one has a conscience. Every one knows that the most reliable people on earth are those who persistently preach the gospel to them. When others begin to realize this, you can go on one step further by telling your colleagues, &ldquo;You know that I am zealous for preaching the gospel. Do you have any relatives? Please introduce them to me, and make an appointment for me, so that I can go to visit them.&rdquo; In this way, many more will be contacted. Hence, there is no need to knock on the strangers&rsquo; doors. There are enough people we know for us to knock on their doors.</p>
<p>As to the preaching of the gospel to the neighbors, there is the need first to have proper conduct and a testimony among them. If you would take care of the relationship with your neighbors in a proper way, they will honor you. After this, you can pay a visit to their homes and begin to preach the gospel. In this way, not only will they be saved, but they will introduce their friends to you as well. This introduction and spreading will bring a few to salvation, and the few families will become a small group. This is all very possible. The question is whether or not we are willing.</p>
<p>The same is true for preaching the gospel in the schools. Whether in the high schools or the colleges, the ones the students listen to the most are their own fellow-students. The second group that they listen to are the teachers. The third group, which they listen to only partly, are the parents. Hence, to preach to the classmates is the easiest thing to do. The eels in the sea latch onto each others&rsquo; tails. When you catch one, a whole train follows. This is the same with the students. As long as you catch one, many will follow one after another. You may even be able to start a small group meeting within a week. This is absolutely true. I have experienced this myself.</p>
<p>Today there are three million people in the city of Taipei. We have too many opportunities for preaching the gospel. Hence, it is not a question of whether or not the gospel preaching is workable. Rather, it is a question of whether or not we are willing. What is your actual relationship with the Lord? Is the Lord real? Or is He not real? The Lord will come, and we will have to reckon our accounts with Him. Is this word true or not? If we believe that every word of the Bible is true, then can we say that our life today is one that we are not ashamed to give an account for? This is why Paul said, &ldquo;Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:16). He also said, &ldquo;I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish&rdquo; (Rom. 1:14). He was a debtor of the gospel. Again he said, &ldquo;For though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all, that I might gain the more....To all men I have become all things, that I might by all means save some&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:19, 22). If this is the attitude we all have today, the number of saved ones will surely increase more and more. At the same time, if we love men&rsquo;s souls this way, surely we will be men of prayer. Every day, we should spend some time to pray for the sinners. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, look at the multitude of sinners. Lord, save them! Lord, I love You, and I love them for Your sake. Grant me to meet more sons of peace.&rdquo; The Lord will answer our prayers. This is the first step, the step of begetting. Paul said to the Corinthians, &ldquo;For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:15).</p><h2 class="head1">NOURISHING PEOPLE IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>As soon as a person rises up from baptism, you need to have a long time of fellowship with him. This is his first home meeting. I suggest that you talk to him about the Lord being the life-giving Spirit and being one spirit with us. You should tell him, &ldquo;The Jesus whom you have believed in has become the life-giving Spirit today. Originally, He was God becoming the flesh on earth. But for the bearing of our sins, He died on the cross for us and shed His precious blood. After He died and was buried, He resurrected again after three days to become the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is just like the air; He is everywhere. Although He cannot be touched or seen, He is more real than everything else. Everyone needs Him. Moreover, this Spirit is personified; that is, He is a person, a divine person. That is why if you call on Him today, He will enter into you. In addition, when God created us, He created us with a spirit. Not only do we have an outward body; we have a soul within also. Inside the soul, there is a spirit, which is our innermost person. Today, this pneumatic Lord has entered into our spirit and has regenerated our spirit, so that the two spirits are now one spirit. Now your calling and praying must be from this spirit.&rdquo; Following this, you can lead him to pray. By then, he may feel ashamed of himself. You can then lead him to confess his sins to the Lord. As long as a person is willing to confess his sins, everything will work out. This is like a person who has taken the wrong kind of food into the stomach. When the wrong food is vomited out and the stomach is cleared, everything will be recovered. When a person has &ldquo;vomited out&rdquo; all his sins, the result is the filling up of the Holy Spirit. With all these words, you have enough to talk about for the first home meeting. After this, you should set up an appointment for the next meeting. Preferably, it should be within the next one or two days. The reason for this is that newborn babies need special care.</p>
<p>Before you go to his home the second time, you should first pray at home, and you should confess your sins thoroughly and be filled with the Holy Spirit. While you are on your way, you should sing along the way. The best song to sing is the one you taught him the last time. When he hears your singing from within his house, he will join in as soon as he greets you, and the home meeting begins. This home meeting does not begin at his home. Rather, it begins from your home. This is what we mean by being organic. After you sing a few times, spontaneously, you can utter a simple prayer, &ldquo;Lord, how we praise You. We are all rejoicing. Our brother is happy, and we are happy. How wonderful this is! This is Your grace to us.&rdquo; There is no need for religious prayers. We have to turn our prayers into a kind of ordinary speaking.</p>
<p>Following that, he may open his mouth to say, &ldquo;Yesterday evening I was saved. This was really marvelous. But this morning, while I was rejoicing, suddenly I began to feel sad. Why is this?&rdquo; This is a question that has to do with the truth. It also has to do with life. If two have come to his house, you may not necessarily be the first to answer. The other one can first answer the question, &ldquo;According to my experience, when I am happy and there suddenly comes a sad feeling, often it is the Lord speaking to me that I have a problem within. You can pray to the Lord and ask Him why you are not happy. Gradually, you will be clear.&rdquo; After he says this, you can add some more to show him that this is the Lord trying to point out something within. For that reason, he should pray more to the Lord, so that the Lord will reveal Himself clearly to him. For example, some have cheated their companies before they believed in the Lord. They have coveted some money. Later, the Lord was shining on them and gave them a feeling towards this matter. They would then pray and would ask the Lord for strength and courage to confess the transgression and to return the money. When he obeys this way, he will feel happy. Some may have hidden away items like an image of Buddha. The Lord causes him to remember these things, and when he moves them out of his house, he will be filled with joy. This kind of fellowship has, on the one hand, the teaching of the truth and, on the other hand, the leading in life. In this way, he will be helped to grow in life.</p>
<p>The home meeting does not need to have a set topic. A question that a new one raises can become a topic. If the new ones are not very aggressive in asking questions, you can ask them questions instead. For example, you can ask them if they have prayed in the morning. This question will bring out many more questions. As for ourselves, first, we need to have some foundation in the Bible, some edification in the truth, and we need to love the Lord and have the experience of life. Only then will we know the others&rsquo; condition, and only then will we be able to help them. We are all going on the same way. I have walked through it ahead of you. Now I am leading you on in the same way. When we go to the meeting, we are not going to a worship service. Everything has to be organic. This requires practice. What I have just spoken is not imaginary. I have experienced these things and they have proved to be effective, powerful, and far-reaching.</p>
<p>After you leave the new ones, they will begin to experience something according to what you have instructed them to do. When you come back the next time, they will say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! What you told us the last time was really right. Now I feel very refreshed within.&rdquo; Based on this, you can go on to say something more: &ldquo;This feeling of refreshment is there because the sins within you are removed. Now the Lord has the ground within you, and He can now move in you. From now on, in your daily life, whatever you do, whether things great or small, you have to follow the sense of the Lord within you. This sense is the sense of the spirit and the sense of life.&rdquo; In this way, you have given him another lesson.</p>
<p>There is no need to be too legal or regimented. Everything depends on how the Holy Spirit leads. If you would visit this one in this way ten times a week, he will surely become stable. All the mothers know that the period after a child is first born is the most dangerous one. It is easy to catch diseases at that time. But after a month or two, the condition will become more stable. When we help a newly baptized person to go on, the principle is the same. As soon as a person is baptized, immediately we have to feed him. This is why the Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;Do you love Me?&rdquo; If we do love Him, then we have to &ldquo;feed the lambs&rdquo; (John 21:15).</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING PEOPLE IN THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Not only do you have to feed a newly baptized one, but you must bring him to a nearby small group meeting as well. You need to tell him, &ldquo;Christians are communal. They are not like the butterflies. Rather they are like the bees and the sheep. Let me take you to see a group of Christians nearby.&rdquo; However, by bringing him to the small group meeting, you should not let the others take over your job; you have to continue feeding and caring for him.</p>
<p>Concerning the small group meetings, I would first beg you to drop the all too legal practice that you have had before. The principle of attending the small group meeting is the same as that for the home meeting. You must be a person who is revived. Before you go to the meeting, you must first pray and have yourself enlivened. You must confess your sins thoroughly and be filled with the Holy Spirit completely. In this way, you will be a praying, singing, and living person. The small group meeting should consist of the following five things: fellowship, prayer, mutual care, the teaching of the truth, and the guidance in life. The Chinese are traditionally taught to be quiet. But when we come to the small group meeting, the minute we see each other, we have to speak. One may say, &ldquo;The Bible is wonderful. This morning I read Matthew chapter one. The name Jesus Christ is really sweet.&rdquo; Another may say, &ldquo;Yes, I also realize that Jesus Christ is wonderful. However, maybe I could share something with you. I don&rsquo;t know why, but for the whole day today, I have had a problem with coughing.&rdquo; In this way the fellowship begins. Perhaps by that time not everyone has arrived yet. You do not have to wait for everyone to be there. Instead you can start praying, &ldquo;O Lord, remember our brother&rsquo;s cough.&rdquo; After the prayer, perhaps one brother would say that he has a good remedy, that it is not expensive, but is very effective, and that this brother can try it. This is what we mean by mutual care.</p>
<p>In this way, the brothers and sisters will get to know each other and will care for each other like members of the same family. This way will capture, support, and perfect people. The brother that you have invited may ask a question, &ldquo;I have read the Bible, and I have listened to you speaking on justification and reconciliation. But what do all these terms mean?&rdquo; Once this question is raised up, everyone will answer. After one finishes, another may add on, with more points. The older and more mature ones can speak something deeper at the end. We must build up an atmosphere where everyone answers. In this way, everyone speaks and will not take up much time. Perhaps some may bring out a question, &ldquo;What does the life of God mean?&rdquo; Everyone begins to answer again. In the answer there is the teaching of the truth as well as the guidance in life. If throughout the fifty-two weeks of the year there is this kind of teaching week after week in the small group meetings, everyone will receive much edification in truth and life. Moreover, everyone will be able to tell others about these things. This is what we mean by an organic practice.</p>
<p>Those that we have begotten through the gospel are nourished in the home meetings. They are also taught in the small group meetings. This teaching is the perfecting. It is like the perfecting of a soldier in the army. First, he is taught the marches and the steps. Then, he is equipped from head to foot. Lastly, he is provided with guns and bullets. This is the perfecting described in Ephesians 4:12.</p>
<p>I hope that the brothers and sisters would not merely listen to these words, but that you would set your mind before God to practice these points. First, we must go out to preach the gospel. Second, we must nourish the newly saved ones. Third, we must bring them to the small group meetings that they may receive the fellowship, the intercession, the care, the teaching, and the leading. To do this, we must first consecrate our time before the Lord. Every week we have to set aside two evenings. In principle, one evening is for saving people, and the other is for the small group meetings. The Lord will surely bless this kind of practice.</p>

<h1 class="title">THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 9:22-23; 1 Thes. 2:7; Eph. 4:11-12; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39</h1>

<li>Teaching-Eph. 4:11-12.</li>
<li>Building-1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I have said to the co-workers, elders, and all of you during the last week or two comes down to two things: the small groups and the prophesying. Tonight we want to see the four things related to the organic practice of the new way. They are begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building. To beget is to preach the gospel to gain the new ones (1 Cor. 9:22-23). To nourish is to have the home meetings and to be nursing mothers in the homes of the new ones (1 Thes. 2:7). To teach is to have the small group meetings for the perfecting of the saints (Eph. 4:11-12), and to build is to prophesy in the district meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:31).</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING ACCORDING TO THE BLUEPRINT</h2>
<p>Tonight I feel that I cannot go on speaking in the same way. The reason for this is that in the past few meetings what we did here was like lecturing in the classroom, with some research done. But when I went down to the actual work site, I realized that either we have not started building, or we were not working according to plan. For this reason, I will make the matter very clear by speaking in another way. This does not mean that I have changed again. I must declare that I have not changed at all. We are still on begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building, and the gospel, the homes, the small groups, and the districts. The gospel is for the begetting. The home is for the nourishing. The small groups are for the teaching, and the teaching is for the prophesying, resulting in the building up of the church. This blueprint has been drawn out clearly since last fall. However, all we had was simply a blueprint. Everyone seemed to be busy. But no one was busy according to the blueprint. Some have not even started on the work yet. Therefore, from this week on, all of you have to start working. While you are building, your blueprint must be accurate. You must not build something rectangular when the blueprint calls for something circular. If you do, you will have to rebuild everything.</p>
<p>For this reason, I will consider carefully with all of you the detailed way for the carrying out of this work. I hope that I can speak in a thorough way and that you can listen to my speaking in a sober way. We have to make the way to carry out this work very clear. Every week, over five thousand people are meeting in the church in Taipei. Among them, at least two to three thousand are active in service. This is quite a large number. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the blueprint was not clear and that many have not actually started building, we have been moving around a lot, but accomplishing little according to the plan. I realize that we cannot go on wasting our time like this. Hence, I want to say that from now on, every way must be stopped. We have to listen carefully first before proceeding on with the work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO CARRY OUT THE WORK</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Division into Small Groups</h2>
<p>The first item in carrying out the work is to divide up the small groups. All the meeting halls have to make a proper division of the small groups. This does not mean that the elders and co-workers divide them up for everyone else. Rather, they are there just to assist the saints in dividing among themselves. When you divide up, there is no need to be too legal. Respect the wish of each individual. At any rate, everyone must belong to a small group meeting. If you do not have one, you are not qualified. Even if we have to give up our sleep and meals, we have to meet in the small groups. As to the number in the small groups, it must not be less than twelve and must not be more than twenty. Each small group should be from twelve to twenty in number. I hope that you will clearly settle this matter of the division of the small groups within two weeks. Every one has to be identified with one small group.</p><h2 class="head2">Everyone Being Revived</h2>
<p>After the small groups are established, the brothers and sisters have to start meeting in the small group meetings. The first thing to do in the small group meeting is to see whether or not everyone is revived. This revival is a morning-by-morning revival, a day-by-day overcoming, a life that lives Christ, that speaks Christ, and that attends every meeting there is. The revival that we talk about in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is easier than all the revivals that Christians have sought after throughout the previous centuries. All we need to do is go to the Lord every morning when we wake up and pour out everything we have in us in a genuine way from the depth of our being. In this way, we will be cleansed and will be enlightened by the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord will fill us, and we will be able to consecrate ourselves to Him to live the overcoming life. After ten minutes, our whole being will be revived.</p>
<p>Following that, we should move on with the sun, which means to walk according to the Lord Jesus who is rising up within us. In the end, we will become like the sun, just as the Lord Jesus is. In at least three places the Bible compares those who love the Lord and follow Him to the sun. Proverbs 4:18 says, &ldquo;But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.&rdquo; Judges 5:31 also says, &ldquo;But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.&rdquo; Matthew 13:43 says, &ldquo;Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&rdquo; Hence, every morning we need to have a new beginning before the Lord to be revived anew. For this, we all have to make a vow to the Lord and to consecrate ourselves.</p>
<p>We must be revived. Only then can we be living persons. In order to walk the new way, we must be the new man. The new man is the living man. The old man will not work. The oldness I am talking about is not oldness in age. Some have said that Brother Lee does not want old folks anymore. This is a total misunderstanding. I never reject those that are old in age. I am only rejecting the old man. The old man cannot take the new way. Hence, the first thing to make clear in the small groups is that everyone has to be revived and have clear dealings before the Lord. Everyone has to consecrate himself honestly to the Lord and live for Him, that God&rsquo;s New Testament economy may be realized in us. Only by this can we walk the new way. The new way requires a revived and living people to walk in it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel to Gain New Ones</h2>
<p>The second thing the small group has to do is consider whether or not there are new ones among them. If not, the small group meeting cannot go on. Where do the new ones come from? The only way to gain new ones is by preaching the gospel through visiting people. Three persons will be grouped into a team and will go out to preach the gospel by knocking at others&rsquo; doors. There can be two to three teams in a small group. Every week they should go out at least twice, the more the better. After doing this consecutively for a few weeks, surely a few new ones will be gained. Next, they should distribute the new ones among them, and the saints in the small group should start caring for them specifically one by one. I hope that every one will have at least two new ones in their hands. Preferably, each should have three to care for. If the base number for a small group meeting is twelve, with eight to nine being the regularly active ones, they can care for at least eighteen new ones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Nourishing and Leading the New Ones</h2>
<p>After we baptize the new ones, we should begin having home meetings with them. At the beginning, if possible, we should go to nourish them once every two to three days. After a month, we can visit them once a week. When we go to the home meetings, we have to lead the new ones to attend the small group meetings and the Lord&rsquo;s Day district meetings. In other words, within a week after a person is saved, we should work into him all four things: the begetting, the nourishing, the teaching, and the building. Furthermore, we should continue to do this every week. Of course, among the new ones, there are better ones and worse ones. Their condition also varies from time to time. As soon as the number you care for becomes less than two or three, you should look for others to go with you to preach the gospel by knocking on doors. This will replenish the number of new ones. If we would all do this, the number will surely increase. A small group that originally has twelve people will bring in over ten new ones after six months, and those twenty or more people will be established in the small groups. By then, we can divide this small group of twenty or more people into two small groups.</p>
<p>As soon as the small group is divided, we repeat the same thing. Begin by considering whether or not everyone is consecrated and whether or not everyone is revived. Then go out to preach the gospel by knocking on doors and gain some new ones. Furthermore, care for and help the new ones. If there is a shortage, replenish the number immediately. In this way, after another half year, we can divide again. Originally there was only one group. After half a year, it becomes two. By the end of the year, it becomes four groups. In the four groups, there are at least forty people. In this way we have a two and one-half times increase. If you will all practice this way, you will find that such a result is not that hard to achieve. Even if we take a big discount, we may still have, with a base number of twelve at the beginning of the year, an addition of fourteen by the end of the year. In all we will have twenty-six. This is surely attainable. Why were we not able to do such a thing in the past? It is because we did not have the way. There were too many blueprints. Everyone was wasting his time on useless ways. Now I am presenting before you this way of building according to plan. I hope that you will all build according to this plan and will practice these three steps. They are the three phases of the small group. Number one is the morning revival. Number two is the gaining of the new ones. Number three is nourishing and helping the new ones to have home meetings, small group meetings, and district meetings.</p><h2 class="head2">Having Organic Small Groups</h2>
<p>Following this, we have to go on to consider how the small group meetings should be conducted. According to the organic practice of the new way, the small group meetings must be organic. In order to show you what is organic, I must first show you another blueprint of what it is to be non-organic. The non-organic way is the way of a worship service. A worship service is for worshipping God. This is good. But the set of religious formalities that have to be carried out is not good. The meetings in Christianity, especially the worship hour on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, whether in the West or in the East, all consist of some prescribed procedures and programs. Before the meeting, a printed program that was prepared ahead of time is passed out to every attendant. On it is printed the name of the leader of the songs, the prayers, the reading of the Scriptures, and the names of the preachers. All these activities are performed by the professionals who have been trained. The congregation has nothing to do. They only sit there. There is no need to labor, and everyone is spared the trouble. This kind of worship neither affords the enlightening, the supply, nor the edification or the perfecting, much less the building up of the church. This is a vain worship service, and it annuls God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and the New Testament economy.</p>
<p>What then is not a worship service? To be organic is opposed to a worship service. The small group meeting has to be organic. It should not be in the way of a worship service. However, I must say that even today, at least over half of our small groups are still in the way of a worship service rather than in an organic way. Most of the small group meetings have a set time for starting the meeting. When the time comes, the people come and sit. They look at the clock and at the leading brothers. After a while, some brother calls a hymn for singing. Then some prayers follow. After the prayers, everyone waits for one another again. Gradually, some reluctantly begin to say something. At a certain point, a brother would say that now is the time for sharing. Only then will everyone share a little. In the end, all the meetings follow the same pattern. Although there is no program sheet, in reality the programs are all there. The only difference is that they are not printed. Although there are the prayers, the fellowship, the mutual care, the studying of the truth, and the enlightening in life, the way is still that of the worship service. There is the lack of the organic flavor. Even when there is some organic flavor, it is very weak.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Rejecting the Worship Service,<br />
but Having Everyone Functioning</h2>
<p>The real small group is organic. It is not a worship service. Organically speaking, the small group meeting begins at the latest from our homes. From that time on, we begin to pray. While we are on the way, we rejoice and praise. It is like what the psalmist says, that we are glad when others say to us, let us go into the house of the Lord (Psa. 122:1). When we arrive at the meeting place, we do not care whether there are people there already; we simply begin to pray and to praise. If other brothers and sisters come in, they spontaneously join in. Some can also give testimonies or discuss questions related to the truth. Another may come in with problems which he opens up in fellowship for mutual intercession and help.</p>
<p>This kind of meeting does not follow a set rule. Everything is organic. Any question can be raised up in this meeting. The answers should not come from some specialists. Every attendant is a learner, and every attendant is also a teacher. The amount one speaks depends on the amount he has. But everyone has something. Hence, every one should share that little bit that he has. When sharing his portion, no one should give long stories, and no one should take up too much time. If a question is raised up, and there are seven or eight answers with a word of some weight and experience at the end, the whole thing will only take about ten minutes, and the question will be thoroughly discussed. If it is a question that concerns the truth, everyone will have learned something. If it is one that concerns life, everyone will be stirred up to pursue after it. When a new one attends this kind of meeting ten times or more, he will also become organic in less than three months.</p>
<p>In this kind of small group meetings, every attendant is living. Spontaneously, everyone will be a priest. The gospel is preached, the new ones are brought in, the questions are answered, the truth is learned, and there is mutual fellowship and care. Hence, within one small group meeting, everything is there; the content is all-inclusive. For this reason, a small group meeting should last for at least an hour and half. If it is shorter, it will not be a good meeting. I am describing a little to you to show you that the small group meeting is not a worship service. It is a picture of the daily life of a Christian. It is natural, and it is not peculiar at all.</p>
<p>Today I have to cry out aloud and declare that the Lord Jesus worked on earth for three and a half years. Not once did He attend a worship service. Never did He call a meeting. Rather, He was conducting a small group in an organic way. This small group comprised the twelve disciples, with Peter, James, and John being among them. He did not have a set date of meeting, nor did He have a set time and place. He was living together with the disciples, teaching and leading them along the way. If you do not understand what an organic small group is, just look at what the Lord Jesus did with the disciples during the three and a half years and you will understand.</p>
<p>Today, for the sake of convenience, our meeting should have a proper date, time, and place. But we should not bring in elements of a worship service. Do not come together for a worship service and at the same time neglect your living. We are not Christians for a worship service. We are Christians for a living. When we, the ordinary Christians, come together to meet with no intention of having a worship service and having no set procedures, all the brothers and sisters who attend will have the opportunity to develop the spiritual function within them. In this way, meeting by meeting, we will receive some good perfecting, and the gifts will be developed (Eph. 4:11-12). In the end, everyone will be able to do what he is supposed to do.</p>
<p>In the past, the old system of meeting did not afford the Holy Spirit the opportunity to develop the gifts within the saints. At the same time, it annulled the spiritual function of the saints. It only caused people to sit through the meetings with their mouths shut, listening to others speaking, while they themselves never had their spiritual gifts developed. Now we have the organic practice of the new way. All the opportunities are there before everyone. Whosoever will can make it. There is something within everyone. As long as they will speak meeting by meeting, sooner or later, everything will be manifested. Every time we have this organic small group meeting, everyone learns, and everyone teaches. You will perfect me, and I will perfect you. In the end, everyone will open their mouths, and everyone will become useful.</p><h2 class="head2">Practicing to Prophesy</h2>
<p>When we have the begetting, the nourishing, and the teaching, we still need the building. What God wants is a corporate vessel, which is the church, the Body of Christ. We have paid much attention to this matter in the past. During the past two years we have also studied much concerning this. In the end, we see that there is one chapter in the Bible that talks about the building up of the church. It is 1 Corinthians chapter fourteen. It mentions the word &ldquo;building&rdquo; at least five times. This chapter deals with nothing other than prophesying. Only prophesying builds up the church. A few verses are particularly important. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; Verses 3 and 4 say, &ldquo;He who prophesies speaks to men for building up and encouragement and consolation....he who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the church.&rdquo; Verse 24 says, &ldquo;But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.&rdquo; Verse 31 says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.&rdquo; From these verses, we see that the most important thing with our meeting is the prophesying, which is to speak for the Lord, to speak Him forth, and to speak the Lord into people. Through the speaking of the Lord&rsquo;s word, the riches of Christ are released and are dispensed into all the attendants. Finally, verse 39 says, &ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy.&rdquo; From this, we can see that this whole chapter is on prophesying from beginning to end.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Five Main Points concerning Prophesying</h2>
<p>Today in Christianity, this light has been lost. The result is that the Body of Christ is not built up. Even among us, there is not much building. The reason is that there is not this kind of prophesying. Hence, from now on, we must pay attention to this matter and must promote it. In order to prophesy, there are a few things which are indispensable. First, we must love the Lord and have fellowship with Him. We must live before the Lord and be a person who is joined to Him as one. Second, we must spend the effort to learn the truth. We need to read much of the Bible and the spiritual publications. The good thing is that this kind of books are abundant among us. Books like the Recovery Version of the Bible, the <em>Truth Lessons,</em> and the <em>Life Lessons</em> should be read much, the more the better. When you read them, you should allow the Lord&rsquo;s word to saturate, fill, and penetrate your whole being, so that in the end, the words become your constitution. The Lord&rsquo;s word will be mingled with you. It will even become you. Third, you must be flexible, walking according to the Spirit, and receiving instant and fresh inspiration all the time. Fourth, you should learn to have a heavenly, enlarged view, to know Christ and the church, and not to have your own opinions or view, but to have the view of God. When you study the word of God this way, with the experience of life, the inspiration of the Spirit, plus the spiritual light and view, it will be easy for you to prophesy for the Lord. Fifth, you should be prepared to prophesy in your daily life.</p>
<p>At present, many districts are practicing reading one chapter of the Bible each week. The chapter is divided into six portions with one portion each day to be used in the morning. In every portion, two verses are selected for pray-reading, together with some footnotes and passages from the Life-study Messages. The inspiration received during the daily enjoyment of the Lord is jotted down in brief. On Saturday, these points are put together and composed into a composition for prophesying. The next morning, it can be brought to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting for prophesying. This method is very helpful. But it is not enough to depend only on this, because it can become merely a composition, a thesis, or an interpretation of the Bible, which does not have the nature of prophesying. The real prophesying is the outward expression of the indwelling God through the word of God. This happens when God is within you, and you are one with Him. It is not a doctrine. Rather, it is an inspiration. There is no self-opinion. Rather, there is the spiritual insight. Moreover, during the speaking, there should not be any banal or common speaking. While one is speaking, he should look to the Lord for fresh utterance and instant inspiration. This will greatly increase the spiritual nature of the prophesying and will make the prophesying filled with fresh revelation.</p>
<p>I hope that you will practice these five points: fellowshipping with the Lord to be one with Him, being saturated with the Lord&rsquo;s word and being constituted by it, being living in the spirit to receive constant inspiration, being without self prejudice but with God&rsquo;s view, and learning to speak with revelation using the fresh feelings and expressions. This is the best kind of prophesying. It is not merely a teaching or instruction based on others&rsquo; words. Nor is it merely some personal testimonies. In the church meetings, the highest speaking is the prophesying. Second to this is the teaching. The testimonies rank third.</p><h2 class="head2">Examples of Prophesying</h2>
<p>I hope that in the future we will see more of the prophesying in our meetings, even to the point that it will be more than the teaching. There is also no need to have too many testimonies. In this way, the content of the meetings will be rich. When we are speaking, there is the need to have the biblical materials. For example, in the praises of Mary the mother of Jesus in Luke chapter one, many words of the Old Testament were quoted throughout the whole passage. This shows that she was full of inspiration, that her view was broad and her choice of expression fresh, with much revelation. It was a good example of a proper prophesying (vv. 46-55). Before this, the blessing of Elizabeth (vv. 42-45), and following this, the prophecy of Zechariah (vv. 68-79) were in the same principle. Not only were there the words of the Bible and the fresh utterance, but the broad view and the spiritual revelation. When all these elements are added together, we have the prophesying.</p>
<p>This kind of prophesying cannot be acquired in two or three days. There is the need to live this kind of life for a long time. Prophesying is the highest expression of the Christian life. If we live this way, spontaneously, we will be able to speak for God, to speak forth God, and to speak God into others. Week by week, if all prophesy this way, doubtless all the saints will receive the enlightening, the cleansing, the nourishing in life, the help in the truth, and the spiritual perfecting to be built up together into the Body of Christ. For this reason, everyone needs the small groups. In the small group there is the fellowship, the prayer, the reading of the Bible, the mutual care, the learning of the truth, the pursuit of the growth in life, and the perfecting. First we are perfected in the small groups. By the time we come to the prophesying meetings in the church, everyone will be built up together. By then, the Body of Christ will be built up, and we will have succeeded in having the proper Christian meeting and service.</p>

<h1 class="title">A BELIEVER&rsquo;S LIFE OF MORNING REVIVAL<br />
AND DAILY RENEWAL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Prov. 4:18; Judg. 5:31; Lam. 3:22-23; Psa. 119:147-148; 2 Cor. 4:16; Titus 3:5-6</h1>
<p>We all know that in God&rsquo;s creation and arrangement everything has its law and principles. The center of all things is life. If our universe today has only the heavens and the earth, but does not have plant life, animal life, or human life, then the universe is void and desolate. Although mankind&rsquo;s living together invariably brings in friction and arguments, where life is, there is joy, and there is pleasantness. The greatest characteristic of life is metabolism. The flowers bloom during the flowering season, and the fruit trees bear fruit during the fruit season. The plant life behaves differently according to the four seasons of the year. Likewise, the animal life has different characteristics for the four seasons of the year. In winter, many animals enter into hibernation. But when spring comes, they begin to propagate again. The human life is much higher than the plant life. It is even much higher than the animal life. Hence, according to God&rsquo;s law of metabolism in creation, man&rsquo;s life cannot be monotonous, having no change whatsoever from day to day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST STEP IN THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>We can discover one law from man&rsquo;s physical life. The human body needs a revival every morning. After we rise up in the morning, our whole body needs a revival. We need to wash our faces. After that, all our sluggish feeling is washed away. After we wash our face and our mouth, and cleanse our lungs through deep breathing, our whole being is renewed. This proves that every morning the human body needs a renewal. The morning hour flies by quickly. One hour is over in no time. This is why the Word of the Lord says, &ldquo;Redeeming the time&rdquo; (Eph. 5:16). The period of time that needs to be redeemed the most is six to seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning. During this hour, every minute is precious. We have to redeem this time.</p>
<p>If you are really busy, I would rather see you sacrifice part of your time of physical exercise and use it for spiritual benefit. When Paul wrote the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, he had the thought of the exercise of the spirit. He said in 1 Timothy 4:7, &ldquo;Exercise yourself unto godliness.&rdquo; The exercise here is like some kind of gymnastics. We have to exercise our spirits and to live out Christ in our daily lives. Paul said in 2 Timothy 1:7, &ldquo;God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind.&rdquo; All the parts of our spirit are like the parts of our body; they need exercise. There are many ways to exercise. Some Chinese like the &ldquo;Eight Section Brocade&rdquo; exercise, whereas others like the &ldquo;Tai-chi&rdquo; boxing. The Westerners have aerobic exercise, golf, and jogging. But the simplest way to exercise the spirit is to call on the name of the Lord. During the past twenty years or longer, we have learned to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Every one among us knows how to call on the name of the Lord. This kind of calling is very good. But this is not the main body of our prayer; it is only the prelude to our prayer. When we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; what follows? We cannot simply call on the Lord without praying. There must not be a prelude without the main theme. After we call on the Lord, we have to go on to speak to the Lord. We can say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You! I want to live for You!&rdquo; The first step in the exercise of the spirit is to pray, which is to speak to the Lord.</p>
<p>Many people pray with their mentality, in their mind. To speak to the Lord in the mind, to pray in the mind, is to exercise one&rsquo;s mentality. The prayer that comes from the exercise of the spirit is different from the prayer that comes from the exercise of the mentality. When you call on the Lord Jesus and say to Him that you would love Him more and would live to Him, this is a prayer that stirs up your spirit. The more you speak this way, the higher your spirit becomes. However, you must be careful not to turn back to your mind after a while. Once you turn back to your mind, you should have a warning sign that goes up like the red signal light at the crossroad. At this time, you must immediately call on the Lord Jesus and turn to the spirit to speak in the spirit. Hence, to pray is the first step in the exercise of the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECOND STEP IN THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
PRAY-READING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>Not only do the New Testament saints call on the name of the Lord. Even the ancient psalmists in the Old Testament called on the Lord as well. David said in Psalm 119:147, &ldquo;I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.&rdquo; The crying here is to call by saying &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; It is also to pray and to speak to the Lord. To cry unto the Lord is to call on Him and to speak to Him. We cannot call on Him without praying to Him, and we cannot say His name without speaking to Him. The longer we speak to the Lord, the better it is. The calling plus the speaking to the Lord is like a man&rsquo;s deep breathing. When you speak out all that you have, you are breathing out. When you take in the grace of the Lord, you are breathing in. We breathe out carbon dioxide, and we breathe in the oxygen from God. In this cycle, spontaneously we are cleansed within, and our whole being becomes healthy.</p>
<p>After this crying, David said that he &ldquo;hoped in thy word.&rdquo; In hoping in the Lord&rsquo;s word, it is better that we do not speak, lest we interrupt the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. David said again, &ldquo;Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word&rdquo; (v. 148). This shows us that in the experience of the Old Testament saints, there was the prayer, the hoping in the Lord&rsquo;s word, and the meditation on the Lord&rsquo;s word. Today, for us, the New Testament believers, the quickest way to receive the Lord&rsquo;s word is not to meditate on His word; rather it is to pray-read His word. It is easy for the mind to receive the Lord&rsquo;s word with its mental faculty. But in pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s word, there is the crying and the calling, and it will be spontaneous and natural to turn the Lord&rsquo;s word into prayer.</p>
<p>For example, you may have read Genesis 1:1 in the morning, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; If you consider these ten words, you may wonder what is the beginning. The beginning is surely the start. But it is the start of what? For you to do this is to meditate on the Lord&rsquo;s word. If you would turn these ten words into pray-reading, you would say, &ldquo;Lord, in the beginning. Lord, in the beginning. Without You there is no beginning. With You there is the beginning.&rdquo; When you speak to the Lord this way, your spirit will be full of feeling. Perhaps you will say, &ldquo;Lord, may my wedding engagement have You as the beginning, and may my wedding have You as the beginning. May my future home have You as the beginning, and may my childbearing also have You as the beginning.&rdquo; Following that, you will pray-read, &ldquo;God created.&rdquo; You may say to the Lord, &ldquo;God, it is not by imagination or by illusion, but by creation. Only You can create. We cannot create. The most we can do is but to manufacture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we have tasted the pray-reading, we will treasure every word of the Bible. If I had the time, I could pray-read Genesis 1:1 for a whole day. The more we pray, the tastier it becomes. &ldquo;O God, You have created the heavens. We cannot create the heavens. Today we can only enjoy the heavens. You have done too marvelous a work in creating the moon, the stars, and the sun in the heavens. Not only have You created the heavens; You have created the earth as well. All things on earth are created by You!&rdquo; This kind of pray-reading will fully mingle the Lord&rsquo;s word with our spirit. It will give our spirit the greatest exercise.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING ACCORDING TO THE MOVING OF THE SUN</h2>
<p>When you have thoroughly pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s word in the morning, during the day this word will speak and work within you, and your spirit will spontaneously be strengthened. In the evening, you will be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, and when you come into the meeting hall, you will spontaneously cry, &ldquo;Hallelujah! In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; There will be no need for anyone to remind you. You will spontaneously stand up in the meeting to speak. The reason there is nothing to say in the meeting is that there is not enough pray-reading in our daily life. If a saint has pray-read enough, he will surely have a lot to speak when he comes to the meetings, because there is too much to speak about. The twenty-seven books of the New Testament alone provide us with enough to pray-read. If we would call on the Lord and pray-read His word every morning, our whole being will be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word spontaneously throughout the day.</p>
<p>Hence, our time in the morning is most precious. It is best for us to spend as little time as possible on other things and to spend this time instead on pray-reading. In order to save time, when I am dressing in the morning, I begin to call on the Lord and pray-read His word. If your wife is not awake yet, you should not shout and cry aloud. You can pray from within. While you are putting on your shirt, you can pray-read the verse you read yesterday: &ldquo;In the beginning...God... created...the heavens...and the earth.&rdquo; While you are washing up, you can also pray-read. You can do two things at one time. Perhaps at the beginning you do not feel comfortable doing it. But after a while, you will feel comfortable. If you would spend half an hour or even fifty minutes there praying and reading the Lord&rsquo;s word, and finally mingling the praying with the reading, your spirit will be enlivened. With such a morning, your whole being will have a revival.</p>
<p>The Christian revival does not occur in the afternoon or at sunset. Rather it occurs in the morning. The Christian life is not a sunset. Rather it is a dawning of the sun. In fact, we ourselves are the sun. Judges 5:31 says, &ldquo;Let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.&rdquo; Proverbs 4:18 says, &ldquo;But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.&rdquo; A Christian&rsquo;s life should be one that follows the moving of the sun. When the sun rises, we should rise with it. We keep rising until the perfect day, which is noon. The Christian life does not have afternoons. Whether we are among the worldly people, or in the church meetings, we should bring the shining light to others. For this reason, it does not matter how busy we are, we have to spend some time to exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world, there is no one who is not busy. We have to use our time just as we use our money. There must first be a budget. We have to devote the first part of our time to the Lord. The first thing we do every morning when we rise up is to exercise our spirit, because today the Lord is in our spirit. For us to enjoy the Lord, to receive Him, to gain Him, and to experience Him is altogether a matter of the spirit. If our spirit is not functioning today, our relationship with the Lord is through. For this reason, every morning when we wake up, the first thing we must do is exercise our spirit. We have to call on the Lord. If circumstances permit, we have to take up the Bible and pray-read. If it is inconvenient to do so, we have to pull out some verses from our memory and pray-read with them. Whatever we do, we have to spend some time pray-reading. This way of exercise is like having a thorough bath from inside out in the Lord&rsquo;s word. It is like taking a spiritual shower; we are washed from head to toe in the Lord&rsquo;s word, and our whole being is fully refreshed.</p><h2 class="head1">DAILY RENEWAL OF ALL THE INWARD PARTS</h2>
<p>Paul said in Titus 3 that our salvation today is through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit (v. 5). The salvation here does not refer to salvation from hell. Rather, it is a daily salvation, being delivered daily from all kinds of difficulties, temptations, entanglements, and every weakness, frustration, and lust. We are those that need salvation daily. Every day we need to be saved by the Lord. This salvation is first through the washing of regeneration, and then through the renewing of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a divine person. He washes and renews us with the divine elements. When God comes into us and is mingled with our life, His life in us brings in washing. When we eat, drink, exercise, and bathe in God, our whole being is enlivened.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit washes us within, it brings in a renewing. This is the first lesson early in the morning for every Christian. I myself exercise this way. In the morning when I wake up, I do not speak to man first. Rather, I first speak to God. I would not open my mouth to any man before I open my mouth to God. I would say, &ldquo;O Lord, I love You!&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I am coming to You!&rdquo; Every morning, all I do are these two things: calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading His word. These two things are the morning exercises for a Christian. If you would exercise yourself in these two things every morning, surely you will be revived. You will become the rising sun, with the shining, dawning light that shines brighter and brighter until the perfect day. Fifty years ago, I read the verse in Judges 5 that says that those who love the Lord are as the sun that goes forth in its might, and I told the Lord, &ldquo;O God, I love You. May I be as the sun that goes forth in its might before You.&rdquo; May this verse also become your aspiration and your daily prayer.</p>
<p>I have said all this to show you that we Christians are different from the people in the world. The worldly people at most meditate or contemplate in the morning. But what we are doing is not meditation. We are calling on the Lord and pray-reading His word. This fills us up with the Lord and refreshes us from within. At the same time, when we call on the Lord, the Holy Spirit comes, because today the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit. When we call on the Lord every morning, there is a deep realization within that the Lord Jesus has come. We have really found Him! In the end, our whole person will be changed. This is what is meant by a revival.</p>
<p>This revival is like our daily wash-ups; one does not do it once for all. There must be a daily washing. According to the law of nature, the sun rises once every twenty-four hours. When we move with the sun, we should also have a rising up once every twenty-four hours. Moreover, we have to be as bright as the sun shining in its might. If we are like this spiritually, every day we will surely live a renewed life. In the words of Paul, our inner man will be renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16). The inner man signifies our regenerated spirit within. This spirit, together with all the inward parts, is being renewed by the daily metabolism that comes about through the supply of the resurrection life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTFLOW OF A RENEWED LIFE&mdash;<br />
KNOCKING ON DOORS AND MEETING IN HOMES</h2>
<p>These days we have been talking about all kinds of practices in the new way: the preaching of the gospel by knocking on doors, the home meetings, the small group meetings, and prophesying in the meetings. All these are but outward ways and activities. The new way is actually a way of life. Today, all of us have to live a life of touching the Lord every morning to be revived every day. Every morning we need a new beginning. To us every day should be new. In this revived and renewed living, we will spontaneously care for others, and we will spontaneously share with others the Christ whom we enjoy and the Savior whom we have received. In this way, others will be able to enjoy with us the portion that God has given to us. God has not given the privilege of preaching the gospel to the angels. Rather He has given this utmost honor to us. Therefore, in our daily life, we spontaneously go out to visit people. This visitation is to bear gifts to others&rsquo; homes. We politely offer the Christ that we enjoy throughout the day as a gift to others. This is our duty. It is also our honor.</p>
<p>We do not necessarily need to knock on new doors. Rather, we can first go to the people that we are acquainted with. For example, we can go to the houses of our cousins and in-laws. Then there are the neighbors, colleagues, classmates, and friends. Surely you will be able to open the doors of these ones. You can go through these doors one by one. This is something that you should do. You should bring people to the Lord with joy, baptizing them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, that they may receive the Triune God as their life. After a person is saved, you have to feed him as you feed a newborn baby with water and milk. This work of caring and feeding is a great job, and a glorious one. When a person is barren, he needs to study how he can beget children. When some children are born, there is the need to study how to have the birth control, and how to take care of the feeding. In the same way, after you beget people with the gospel, you have the responsibility to feed them and to care for them.</p>
<p>You cannot care for too many people all at once. It is enough to have three to five. At least you should go to the new ones&rsquo; homes once a week. The home meeting is a part of a Christian&rsquo;s life of revival and renewal. When you go, you can begin by singing on the way. When you arrive at others&rsquo; homes, you can knock at the door with singing. When others&rsquo; hear you from inside the door, they will come to the door singing also. The meeting will begin right there. When you go to the new ones&rsquo; homes, do not hold up the Bible in a religious way, or invite others to read with you, as if you are holding a family worship. You should not bring a religious ceremony with you. Instead you should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading and should answer the new ones&rsquo; questions. You can read the Bible a little with them, and you can explain to them a little to solve their problems. By such a way, their understanding will be opened.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYONE BEING A PRIEST<br />
OF THE GOSPEL TO SERVE GOD</h2>
<p>When you nourish the new ones in this way once or twice a week, week after week, in half a year the new ones will be greatly helped by you, and they will be established. By that time, you can tell them that the life of a Christian is a communal one. All Christians like to be with other Christians. We are God&rsquo;s sheep. We do not like to live alone away from the flock. We should meet with the brothers and sisters that live close to us. In this way, you bring them to the small group meetings. Soon after this, they will become a member of the small group. Our small group meetings do not have any set program or procedures. In these meetings, we can sing, pray, or speak. You can fellowship a little about the verses that you pray-read in the morning. When everyone hears this, some may spontaneously begin to pray. Perhaps one would say that today he has a certain burden. Everyone will then pray for this burden. Hence, in the small group meeting, there is fellowship, there is mutual intercession, and there is mutual care, including shepherding and help. Among us there are no pastors or preachers. Every one of us, whether young or old, male or female, is a priest and can serve God.</p>
<p>Paul said in Romans 15 that he was a priest of the gospel offering up gospel sacrifices. The priests in the Old Testament offered up bulls and goats for offerings. The priests of the New Testament offer up souls. Paul offered up the Gentiles as gospel sacrifices (v. 16). When we meet in the small group meetings, everyone is a priest. Everyone can speak. If anyone asks a question, it is best if everyone can say something, rather than nominating one to give the answer. After the first one finishes, the second one can add a little. Then the third one can add more words. If seven or eight people would all speak for a minute or two concerning what they know and experience, the result will be most beneficial to the listeners. This will make the group meeting living and rich. Every attendant becomes a speaker, and every speaker is a listener. In this way, everyone speaks. Everyone listens. Everyone learns, and everyone teaches. Those who have been saved for thirty years can speak something deeper. But those who have been saved for three months can also speak a few words from their experience, that is, from what they know in their elementary stage. Everyone is a teacher, and everyone is a student.</p>
<p>When the new ones see this in the small group meetings, their eyes will be very much opened. In half a year, they will pick up all these matters related to the feeding, the care, the questions, and the answers. By that time, the small group meeting will have over twenty people. You can then divide the group into two and encourage them, saying, &ldquo;Now we have to bring others to salvation. We do not need to get help from others. And we do not need to hold any big meetings. The simplest way is to go out to visit people. Earlier, we knocked on your doors and helped you to be saved. In the same way, now you need to knock on others&rsquo; doors and help them to be saved.&rdquo; There may be some older ones in the group who cannot go out. They can stay at home to pray. After you go out to visit people for three or four weeks, every group can bring in three or four people. Then you can start another cycle. Begin by nourishing the new ones in their homes. Then bring these new ones to the small group meetings to equip and perfect them. In half a year, the small group will reach thirty in number again, and you can divide into two groups again. No one takes the lead in the small groups. Every attendant in the small group is a leader. In this way, the church will have the increase and the spread.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord. After four and a half years of studying, we have found the way for believers to be revived every morning and to be renewed every day. In our daily lives, we have the gospel preaching, the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings. In the past, the big meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day was for one person to speak and all the others to listen. Now the brothers and sisters are divided up into districts. Every district has about fifty people. Every one of these fifty can speak. Everyone can pray. Everyone can call a hymn, and everyone can say something. We do not encourage too many testimonies. Testimonies often become story-tellings, and the time is wasted. We hope that those who want to testify would speak for half a minute only and would put emphasis on the words they have pray-read in the morning and the experience they have had from them. When everyone speaks something, spontaneously it will become a message that speaks forth the word of God. In a meeting of fifty people, at least twenty can stand up to prophesy. There is no gossiping. There is no opinion. There are no arguments. Everyone speaks the Lord&rsquo;s word and expresses the Lord&rsquo;s riches. Such a meeting is an exhibition of Christ.</p>
<p>In the meeting some may speak about one aspect of Christ. Another may speak about another aspect of Christ. This kind of meeting will supply, enlighten, comfort, and perfect all the attendants. The result is that the riches of Christ will be dispensed into all the members of the Body. These members will then become the materials for the building, and the church will be built up. This is the Christian life. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery on earth must arrive at this goal. If we would live this way every day, going out to visit people, bringing others to salvation, attending the small group meetings, enlightening others, and functioning in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting by presenting the riches, the church will be built up.</p>

<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You from the depth of our being. We are filled with adoration to You. Lord, how we thank You that in this end time, You have come to us in many ways and have spoken to us with words of love, light, and revelation. You have not left us in darkness, but have brought us into Your light. Tonight we are meeting in Your light. May Your light shine among us. May every corner be full of Your shining that every heart be enlightened by You. Lord Jesus, speak to us. How we thank You that You are one spirit with us today. Your Spirit has become one spirit with our spirit. May You be with the speaker as well as the listener tonight. We are all one spirit with You in this Spirit. Our spirits are joined together, fellowshipping together, and even mingled together. We receive Your word in our spirit. Lord, may You overcome in the Spirit, and may You subdue us in the Spirit. Gain us, and even capture us in the Spirit. Fill us up, and saturate us.</p>
<p>Lord, we thank You for being with us this way. We pray that You would speak to us intimate words in Your presence. Speak to us words that are in Your heart, so that we would not only hear them, but would see them, enter into them, and even experience them, that we can become a good testimony to Your word. Lord, shame Your enemy. We even bind Your enemy, the evil one, who is Satan, the Devil, in Your prevailing Name. Lord, tonight we chase him out of here. Glorify Your own name. Bless Your children, and build up Your Body. Lord, may You speak to us intimate words tonight. Speak to us the secret, that we may receive the keys. O Lord Jesus, grant us the utterance, and grant us ears that can hear. Lord, Your victorious blood is our trust. We come to You always by Your blood, and we serve You and are accepted by You through Your blood. Cleanse us again, and sprinkle the blood upon us. Anoint us fully, and pour out the anointing, which is the all-inclusive, completed Spirit upon every one of us. Amen.</p>
<p>Tonight is our second meeting here. I know that you have all heard messages recently concerning the new way. Hence, tonight I want to fellowship a little concerning the secret of the new way. We know that to do anything, there is the need to have the secret. Otherwise, one will labor in vain and not succeed. Therefore, I will do my best to show you point by point the crucial items of this new way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD VISITING MAN AND<br />
PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO HIM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In the Old Testament</h2>
<p>Although the term &#8220;the new way&#8221; has been with us since October 1984, for the last four years or longer, most of the brothers and sisters still have a natural understanding concerning the new way. Their understanding is not deep. They think that the new way is to change the method of preaching the gospel. Formerly we invited people to come to listen to the gospel. Now we preach by visiting people instead. However, we have to realize that this way has not been invented by us. Rather it has been discovered by us.</p>
<p>In the Bible the first one to preach the gospel by visiting people was God Himself. When Adam, the man created by God, was tempted to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his eyes became opened; he began to know his own shame, and he made an apron out of fig leaves and hid among the trees in the garden to avoid the face of Jehovah God (Gen. 3:1-8). At that time, God did not give him up. He came to seek after him and preached the gospel to him. God was not inviting people to come to Him in heaven. Rather, He came personally from heaven to earth and came to Eden where Adam was, and He called, &#8220;Where art thou?&#8221; (Gen. 3:9). This was God&#8217;s calling. It was God knocking at the door of Adam&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>Although the words, &#8220;Where art thou?&#8221; sound simple, the meaning is profound. It is not a question of where you are geographically, but a question of where you are before God. God wants to show you that today you are in the place of condemnation by God. You are in a place of being lost, the place right at the portal of the lake of fire. That is why God came to visit you and to preach the gospel to you.</p>
<p>In God&#8217;s first visit, His gospel was only a promise; there was no fulfillment. He said to the deceiving snake, &#8220;And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel&#8221; (Gen. 3:15). This is the promise contained in the gospel. The main focus is the seed of the woman, who is Jesus, the One begotten of the virgin Mary in the New Testament. However, God did not fulfill the promise at that time. After two thousand years, at the time of Abraham, God promised to give to Abraham the good land and through him to bless all the families of the earth (Gen. 12:3). What God promised to Abraham was the seed of the woman. He was confirming His original promise. After another two thousand years, which was four thousand years after man&#8217;s creation, a messenger of the Lord appeared one day to a righteous man, Joseph, in a dream and said, &#8220;And she [Mary] will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus....and they shall call His name Emmanuel&#8221; (Matt. 1:21, 23). It was by then that God&#8217;s promise to Adam was fulfilled.</p><h2 class="head2">In the New Testament</h2>
<p>Next we come to the New Testament. When the Lord Jesus was thirty years of age, He came out to fulfill His preaching ministry. During those three and a half years, He did not gather together one gospel meeting. Neither did He put out any advertisement to invite people to come hear the gospel. Rather, He came among men to visit men. Luke 19 gives a record of His coming to Jericho, a cursed city, to visit a tax-collector by the name of Zaccheus. The tax-collectors were much despised by men then. They were not at all respected by others. The Lord Jesus, however, visited this one. He received the Lord&rsquo;s visit and took Him in for hospitality. This is one example of the Lord visiting people (Luke 19:1-10).</p>
<p>John 4 records that the Lord Jesus was going from Jerusalem to Galilee. According to the map of the ancient world, there were many ways to travel to Galilee. But the Lord said that He must pass through Samaria (v. 4). This was not a necessity geographically. The Lord did this because there was a dishonorable woman who was a God-chosen son of peace in Samaria. The Lord knew that it was not an easy thing to visit her. Therefore, the Lord handled the matter wisely. He waited for her at the sixth hour by the well where she came to draw water and visited her (vv. 6-7). By this we see that the Lord Jesus came personally to be among the people to contact them.</p>
<p>Hence, both from the Old Testament and from the New as well, we see this light. The old way of gospel preaching in Christianity is wrong. We should not invite people to come listen to the gospel. Rather, we should follow the Lord&rsquo;s example to visit people.</p>
<p>The Lord called Peter and Andrew in Matthew 4 and said to them, &ldquo;I will make you fishers of men&rdquo; (v. 19). We know that for a fisher to fish, either with a hook or with a net, he cannot do so by standing there and inviting the fish to come ashore. He must go to where the fish are. For example, one day Peter asked the Lord Jesus concerning the matter of paying taxes. The Lord told Peter to &ldquo;go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for Me and you&rdquo; (Matt. 17:27). This shows us that to fish, we have to go; we cannot ask the fish to come. The way we have taken in the past was really wrong.</p>
<p>The God-ordained and God-revealed way in the Bible is to go. At the end of the four Gospels, we see the same revelation. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo; In Mark 16:15 He says, &ldquo;Go into all the world and preach the gospel.&rdquo; Even when the Lord was on earth, not only did He go to visit people Himself, but He sent disciples to go out as well. First He sent the twelve disciples (Luke 9:1-9). Next He sent the seventy (Luke 10:1-24). In the end, when the Lord resurrected from the dead, He sent all the disciples to all the world to preach the gospel, not only to all the nations, but to all the creation as well. This is the way that God has shown us from the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW WAY BEING<br />
A WAY OF DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:20 says, &ldquo;By a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; The veil here is a type of the flesh of Christ. When the flesh of Christ was crucified on the cross, this veil was rent, and a new and living way was open for us. This way is now prepared in the new creation and is ready for us to walk on. For the same reason, our flesh has to be broken, and we have to deny our soul life. Only then can we walk on this new way in resurrection. Everything that is in the old creation is old. Only by being in the new creation can there be newness. If we preach the gospel by the old creation and serve God by the flesh, our way is an old way. But whenever we preach the gospel and serve God by the new creation, that is, by our spirit, we have the new way.</p>
<p>What then is the new way? The new way is the way of death and resurrection. This way requires that we deny ourselves. By this, we would not be in ourselves, the natural realm, the old creation, or the flesh, but would be fully in the new creation and in life. This is the new way. The secret of the new way is death and resurrection. The natural man cannot take this way. Much less can the flesh take it. It is wrong for a man to assume that, just because he has a higher education or has lived through all the sufferings of the human life, he is qualified to preach the gospel. If we have this thought, even if we say that we are taking the new way, in reality we are not in the new way, because everything we do is in the old creation. The service in the new way requires that we deny the self, the flesh, and the natural strength.</p>
<p>The Lord treasures our love towards Him. He asked His disciple Peter after His resurrection, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; Peter answered, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, You know that I love You&rdquo; (John 21:15). Peter dared not say too much. Before the Lord went to the cross, he had said to the Lord, &ldquo;Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You&rdquo; (Matt. 26:35). But when the Lord Jesus was arrested and judged, he denied the Lord three times (Matt. 26:75). I believe this was a big blow to Peter. It showed him that he could not love God with his natural strength. The natural man is worth nothing; it is useless. Man&rsquo;s natural strength must be denied and dealt with.</p>
<p>After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, He specifically sought out Peter. On the one hand, He called Peter with the miracle of the casting of the net to train him to trust God for his living (John 21:1-14). On the other hand, He recovered Peter&rsquo;s love to Himself, and He charged him to shepherd His church. He prepared him for his future martyrdom, so that he would not follow Him with his natural strength, but would follow Him in resurrection and in the new creation.</p>
<p>We have to see today that we must preach the gospel to all the nations, to bring them the Lord Jesus, the Bible, and the truth, and to dispense to them grace and life. John 15:16 says, &ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain.&rdquo; We cannot remain in our homes or in the meeting halls. We have to go forth to bear fruit. As to how far we should go, we should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading. But we have to see that when we go to preach the gospel, we cannot depend on our natural strength. Such strength is worth nothing. We have to learn to take the Lord&rsquo;s strength as our strength and to preach the gospel in resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECRET OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Visiting People<br />
for the Preaching of the Gospel&mdash;<br />
Being One with the Lord, Fearing No Difficulties</h2>
<p>When we visit people for the preaching of the gospel, we will encounter all kinds of difficulties. Second Timothy 1:8 says, &ldquo;Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God.&rdquo; The gospel here is personified (see Rev. 6:2, note 2). Since the gospel is persecuted and put under a hard trial, we the gospel preachers, as the companions of the gospel, must suffer evil and be persecuted along with the gospel.</p>
<p>This is why, when the Lord sent us out to preach the gospel, He gave us first Himself. The word &ldquo;go&rdquo; in Matthew 28:19 was spoken by the Lord in His resurrection. He said, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo; Every one of us who has believed into Him is resurrected with Him. In resurrection He has entered into us. First we received the Lord Himself. Then He gave us His power. In addition, He gave to us all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). For this reason, when we preach the gospel today, we do not do so by our two lips only. Rather, we command people to believe in Jesus by the Lord Himself, by His power, His authority, and His word. We must have this kind of faith, realizing that we are one with the Lord, that we are joined with Him as one spirit, that our going is His going, and that He is going with us. When we speak, the Lord speaks. Those who receive us, receive the Lord, and those who reject us, reject the Lord.</p>
<p>In addition to this, when we preach the gospel, we must not be afraid of difficulties. Although the Lord is with you, although His power is your power and His authority is your authority, and you can even heal sickness, cast out demons, and work wonders and miracles, all of this does not mean that you will not encounter difficulties.</p>
<p>When Paul preached the gospel, he also performed many miracles. However, sometimes he was also arrested and imprisoned. At such times, the Lord did not always release him or rescue him. As a result, some co-workers were tried and began to doubt. Some even left Paul. Hence, in preaching the gospel, there are times when we will encounter difficulties. We have to be prepared. We must persevere and must not be discouraged by any means or stopped by any frustrations. We need to realize that to take this new way and to preach the Lord Jesus in death and resurrection is a life-long task; it is not a matter of being stirred up by a moment of interest and of continuing for only a month or two. We have to take this new way all the days of our life. For this reason, Paul exhorted us not to be ashamed of the gospel, but to suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God. This is the secret of preaching the gospel in the new way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Home Meetings&mdash;<br />
Nourishing the New Ones as Mothers<br />
Cherishing Their Children</h2>
<p>According to our experience, if three or four brothers and sisters go out to preach the gospel by knocking on doors twice a week, spending two hours each time, they will gain three or four. If they continue to do this for three weeks, they will have over ten new ones to care for. We have to care for these ones continually for about half a year. Only by this will they gradually grow up.</p>
<p>In caring for the new ones, after we baptize them, we should not leave immediately. After they have changed their clothes, we should talk with them for at least an hour. This is to feed them with milk for the first time. Thereafter, we need to feed them by going back to them once every three days. During the first month, we should go to them as often as possible. Only by this way will they have the full care.</p>
<p>Paul said to the Thessalonian believers that he was one who &ldquo;as a nurse would cherish her own children&rdquo; (1 Thes. 2:7). Paul was a brother. But in treating the Thessalonians, he was like a nursing mother cherishing her own children. The word &ldquo;cherish&rdquo; is difficult to translate. In the original language, it is used to describe a mother soothing her child. Sometimes the child feels cold, or he is bitten by mosquitoes. He would feel uncomfortable and would cry. The mother would then soothe the child by covering him with a warm blanket or applying some ointment to him. In addition, the mother would embrace him affectionately and would rock him back and forth, up and down in her arms. When the child is comforted, the mother is at peace. This is the meaning of cherishing.</p>
<p>We are a failure if we go to the home meetings today in a way that is like the preachers or pastors going to a worship service; we should not wait for an appointed time and then go to the brothers and sisters&rsquo; home in that way to lead them in singing the songs and reading the Scriptures. Paul was a pattern to us. When he nourished the new ones, he cherished them like a nursing mother. We have to comfort and soothe the brothers and sisters. Perhaps they have difficulties. We should then give them some answers or some consolations. After they are more stable, we can bring them to the small group meetings. When they see the other brothers and sisters fellowshipping with one another, praying and caring for one another, and mutually asking and answering questions, they will be shepherded and cared for.</p>
<p>If the three or four brothers and sisters that we gain through door knocking during the current period are no longer able to meet with us after they have met with us in their homes for two months, we have to ask our companions to help us to knock on more doors and take on more new ones to care for. In short, we need to have three to four new ones under our care and guidance all the time throughout the whole year.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Small Group Meeting&mdash;</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Everyone Leading, with No One Behaving<br />
in the Way of a Worship Service</h2>
<p>The small group is the all-inclusive unit of the church life. In the church life, if the small group meeting is not strong, the church life will not be strong. The secret of a sustained, healthy church life is simply the small group meeting. The small group is the practical church life and the practical church service.</p>
<p>However, we must remember that the small group meeting is not a worship service. A small group meeting is not one where everyone meets together at a specified time and place. In the new way, we may begin meeting at home at a quarter after seven, even when the scheduled time for meeting is half-past seven. Actually, our meeting should begin from the time we have our revival in the morning. During the whole day, we live in such a revival until we come to the small group meeting.</p>
<p>On our way to the meeting, whether we are riding in the car or walking on the street, we should either be praising or singing. When we arrive at the saints&rsquo; home, even when there are only one or two there, we do not wait. There is no set program or procedure for the small group meeting. Nor is there any leader. Every brother and sister is a leader. When you are there, you are the leader. When I come, I am the leader. Everyone who comes can be the leader, and everyone is free to sing, pray, or read the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Mutually Asking Questions<br />
for Guidance in Life and Truth</h2>
<p>Furthermore, everyone can ask questions in the small group meeting. Everyone can also answer the questions. For example, I am an old man. I have a problem about whether I should retain a beard. I can ask, &ldquo;Can a man of my age keep a beard?&rdquo; Such a question can be raised in the small group meeting. The small group meeting is there to solve my problems. If there is a young sister in the meeting, and she thinks that she is not a brother, nor an elderly one, nor a leader, and should therefore sit there quietly, she is wrong. We have to see that everyone who comes to the small group meeting is qualified to speak.</p>
<p>If the young sister realizes this, she may say, &ldquo;To me keeping a beard is a troublesome matter. Recently we were pursuing a study of the book of Leviticus. There it says that all the hairs of the body have to be completely shorn. Although I am a young sister, I feel that according to the Bible, it is better not to have a beard.&rdquo; Another elderly sister may say, &ldquo;She is absolutely right. Although she is young, her words contain the biblical light. To me it is troublesome for an elderly person to have a beard. It is more simple for him not to have one. In these days, no one likes to see people with a beard. Whoever has a beard makes others feel uncomfortable. Those without beards are more proper. For the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, it is better that the brothers do not have beards.&rdquo; This is a good example of a teaching. After this, a small sister speaks again, and then another brother adds something. Finally a more experienced one may put in a few words. In less than five minutes, the question is answered.</p>
<p>This is a very good practice. Those that dared not speak before, now will dare to speak. Those that could not speak before, now are able to speak. Those who considered that they were unqualified before, now will realize that everyone is qualified to ask and to teach others. Throughout the fifty-two weeks of the year, we should have this kind of meeting at least once a week. All the attendants of the small group meetings will then be like children of an educated family. When they speak, they will be filled with light and truth.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of speaking the wrong thing in the meetings. We are all learning here. If we are not learning, we will not make any mistake. If we are learning, surely we will make some mistakes. We are practicing at the same time that we are learning. This is the secret of the small group meetings in the new way.</p><h2 class="head3">Having No Natural Affection<br />
in Shepherding and Care</h2>
<p>Furthermore, if there are those who have physical illness, they can share that matter briefly in the small group meetings. Perhaps the brothers and sisters will receive the burden immediately to pray for them. In this way, we can see that the small group meetings include shepherding and nourishing. For example, the church in Taichung has over seven hundred brothers and sisters. If we have ten or more to a small group, we can have over fifty small groups. All the ten or more brothers and sisters in each small group can shepherd one another and nourish one another. This will be more thorough than the care of eight or ten elders. For this reason, the function of the small group is all-inclusive.</p>
<p>The small group meeting should carefully avoid one thing. If fifteen brothers and sisters have been meeting for half a year, they will be very familiar with one another and will care for and love one another. After half a year, their number may increase to over thirty. At that time they should divide into two groups. However, everyone may be unwilling to divide. At that time we should be careful. Perhaps the natural affection has become too strong among them. We have to see that we only have love between the brothers and sisters; we do not have any tie in friendship. Everything of the natural affection has to be rejected. We only care for one another by the love in the Lord. Only then will the Lord have a chance to spread His kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEART BEING THE GOOD GROUND,<br />
TRUSTING IN GOD&rsquo;S GRACE TO TAKE THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>If we truly desire to take the biblical way, we must pay the price to live a revived and renewed life. We should not depend on ourselves, but should depend on the resurrected Lord and His power, His authority, and His speaking. Every week we should consecrate two evenings for the Lord. We should do this not only for a year or two, but until we see the Lord face to face. This is not an easy matter. It requires much prayer on our part so that we will deny ourselves and will not trust in ourselves. Only by this can we persevere and put such a thing into practice.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples the parable of the sower in Matthew 13. He said that the sower went forth to sow and that four kinds of results were borne. The seeds that fell by the wayside are the first kind. The birds came and ate them all up. This means that although the Lord sowed the seeds, some hearts are hardened by the traffic of the way. This typifies the heart of some being hardened by communication with the world. As a result, it becomes hard for the seed to get in (vv. 3-4). Second are those who appear to be good ground outwardly, but actually are shallow and rocky places. There being not much earth, the seeds immediately sprang up. But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and because they had no root, they were dried up (vv. 5-6). In the third case the ground was the normal earth. But it was filled with thorns. The thorns typify the anxiety of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the temptations of the lusts (v. 7). When we have these three kinds of things, it will be difficult for the Lord&rsquo;s word to have the ground in us. The fourth kind of result comes from those that fall into good ground (v. 8). The good ground typifies the good heart. It does not have the worldly traffic to harden it. Nor does it have hidden sins, the anxiety of this age, or the deceitfulness of riches. Only this kind of heart can receive the Lord&rsquo;s word and can allow it to grow and bear fruit, even up to a hundredfold.</p>
<p>This parable of the Lord is very scientific. He pointed out laws from our everyday, practical lives. We cannot break these laws. Hence, we have to deny our self, trust the Lord, and depend on His resurrection power, His authority in ascension, His Spirit, and His word. In this way, our heart will have no worldly communication, hidden sins, or bondages of lusts. Instead it will be fully a fertile ground. Only then can the will of the Lord be accomplished. This is what the new way is striving for today.</p>
<p>Everything in this new way requires the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Paul said, &ldquo;But by the grace of God I am what I am...yet not I, but the grace of God with me&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:10). For this reason, all of us have to know the grace of God, which is just the very God enjoyed by us in death and resurrection. Only when we are in this One can we be the top kind of person to take the new way that is humanly unattainable. This way is absolutely not in the old creation or the natural realm. Rather it is in the new creation and the realm of resurrection. This is why in everything we have to trust in the resurrected Lord, in His resurrection power, in His authority in ascension, and in His all-inclusive Spirit. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p>

<li>Concerning the small group meeting-Heb. 10:24-25; 1 Thes. 2:11; Eph. 4:11-12; Acts 20:20, 27, 31.</li>
<li>Concerning prophesying-1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tonight we will continue with the secret of the new way. First we want to point out two passages in the Bible. The first is Ephesians 4:11-16. The second is 1 Corinthians 14:1-40. Christians throughout the ages have never entered into the experience of these two passages of God&#8217;s words. This is why we have never seen the condition described in these two passages being manifested in church history.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING BEING TO SPEAK FOR GOD<br />
AND TO SPEAK FORTH GOD</h2>
<p>Take for example 1 Corinthians 14. Formerly, we thought that this chapter talks about spiritual gifts. Because of this we did not dive into the depths of this passage. But recently the Lord has shown us specifically that it is not only on spiritual gifts. Rather, it emphasizes and exalts in a particular way the matter of prophesying. Today, many Christians do not understand the matter of prophesying. In the Chinese Union Version, this word is translated as the &#8220;preaching of a prophet.&#8221; But the Greek word for prophesying means to speak for God.</p>
<p>We can see a basic principle both from the Old Testament and from the New, which is that God hardly ever spoke to man directly. For the most part He reveals things to man through dreams or revelations. Sometimes He has to put a man into an ecstasy before such a one can understand the mind of God (Acts 10:10). On the other hand, the Bible shows us that in many portions and in many ways, God spoke of old to the fathers in the prophets (Heb. 1:1). The word <em>prophet</em> refers to one who prophesies. When God has something to say, He does not speak directly. Rather, He takes a man to be His mouthpiece. Such a man then speaks for God and speaks forth God.</p>
<p>When we come to the New Testament, the prophets not only speak forth God; they also speak God into people, which means that they dispense Christ into men. When men hear the words, not only do they receive the words, but they receive into them a Person and a Spirit, who is the Lord Jesus Himself. Hence, to prophesy is to speak the Lord Jesus into people.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:1 says, &#8220;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&#8221; Christians always think that love is the most important thing. Paul indeed devoted the whole of chapter thirteen to speaking of different aspects of love. But at the beginning of chapter fourteen, he mentioned three things, which are love, spiritual gifts, and prophesying. Of these three things, the spiritual gifts were received by us when we were regenerated. The love is also easily obtained. But the most neglected item is prophesying.</p>
<p>The spiritual gifts are the spiritual capabilities. When a child is born, he is endowed with some natural capabilities. He can cry, and gradually he can see with his eyes. After a few months, he can even utter with his mouth, &#8220;Papa, mama.&#8221; This is the result of the gradual manifestation of the capabilities. After this, he begins to crawl and to stand up. This proves that he is a living person, with all the functions of the life within him. All these functions manifest themselves bit by bit as the life grows.</p>
<p>If you are not saved, regenerated, or you do not have the life of God, you would not have any spiritual gift. As long as you are a saved person, you will have spiritual gifts. The life that you received at regeneration is a high life. It is even a super life, one that is divine and eternal. Doubtless, it will impart to you spiritual gifts.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEKING TO EXCEL<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>At the same time, we have to see that among all the spiritual gifts, the most excellent and outstanding one is prophesying (1 Cor. 14:1). To prophesy is to speak for God, to speak forth God, and to supply Christ to others. This is the greatest of all gifts.</p>
<p>Paul said in 1 Corinthians 14:12, &ldquo;Since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church.&rdquo; We should seek to excel for the building up of the church. In other words, we have to excel over the low pursuits. The reason Paul spoke this word is that the saints in the church in Corinth desired after tongue-speaking. However, to speak in tongues is easy. But it is low. This is why Paul told the Corinthians, &ldquo;But he who prophesies speaks to men for building up and encouragement and consolation. He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church. Now I desire that you all speak in tongues, but rather that you may prophesy; now greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up&rdquo; (vv. 3-5). Paul pointed out that the reason prophesying excels is that it is not merely a prediction, but a speaking for God. It is extraordinary, and it builds up the church. For this reason prophesying excels.</p>
<p>The content of the prophesying is words for building up, encouragement, and consolation. Following this, Paul said, &ldquo;If therefore the whole church comes together in one place....if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). If such a one has some secrets of the heart, such as refusal to confess or hatred for others, he will be convicted and judged when he comes to such a meeting where everyone prophesies one by one to speak forth God and to speak God into others. &ldquo;The secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you&rdquo; (v. 25). This is the excelling of the prophesying. It is also what God treasures. For this reason, Paul exhorted the Corinthians again, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one&rdquo; (v. 31). &ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy&rdquo; (v. 39).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF CHRISTIANITY ANNULLING<br />
THE SPIRITUAL FUNCTION OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Christianity has given up this matter. The reason for this is that it is not an easy thing to have. The light that the Lord has led us to see today is to realize and recover 1 Corinthians 14 in this end time. Throughout church history since the passing away of the first group of apostles, this chapter of the Bible has never been practiced. Christians dare not even speak too much about this chapter. In its place they have found a way of substitution by having pastors and preachers who have gone through theological training to preach exclusively in the church buildings. The rest of the believers simply come and listen. This developed into a distinction between the laity and the clergy. There was no more the prophesying, and the spiritual function within all the saints was annulled.</p>
<p>Let me relate a story to you. When I was a little over forty-one years old, I contracted tuberculosis. It was necessary for me to rest for two years. The doctor told me that the first half year I had to rest completely. I must lie in bed all the time, and must not get up to move around. After six months of lying in bed, when I tried to get up from the bed to walk, my two feet could hardly hold me up. I discovered then that when the legs are not exercised for six months, they lose their function. Furthermore, the doctor told me that if a man&rsquo;s eyes are covered and are not allowed to see for a prolonged period of time, they will lose their ability to see. The function of the eyes will then be annulled.</p>
<p>This is a very serious matter. In Christianity, people listen to sermons week after week and year after year. In the end, all the spiritual functions in the saints are annulled. However, the Bible has revealed to us the proper way to meet. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one&rdquo; (v. 31). From these verses we see that when we come to the meetings, we have to open our mouths. When our mouths are open, our hearts are open, and our spirits are open as well. At least we can say four words, &ldquo;O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; The more we sing and speak, the more living we will become, and the more the spiritual function within us will be manifested.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECRET OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Prophesying&mdash;</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Need for the Spirit, Light, and Revelation</h2>
<p>Today the Lord needs to recover this matter of prophesying. Every brother and sister in the recovery has to practice prophesying. However, prophesying does not mean a sharing or a testimony after others finish delivering a message. According to my experience, to prophesy is firstly not a matter of ordinary speaking. Second, when one speaks, he must do so with the spirit. Third, there must more or less be some revelation or light in the speaking.</p>
<p>Today, our speaking in the meetings is mostly restricted to common, human talks or long stories. There is very little of the element of prophesying. However, we can learn about prophesying from Paul&rsquo;s word. He said, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:1). On the one hand, these words are very simple. Yet on the other hand, they are very uncommon and contain much light and revelation. When we read them, we can sense a certain spiritual element in them. Hence, when we stand up to speak for God, we have to learn to speak forth God. We have to practice pushing the words out from our spirit. Moreover, we should not speak too hastily nor too long. In whatever we speak, we should let others touch the spirit in the words.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Diving into the Bible and<br />
Being Saturated with the Word</h2>
<p>Although prophesying is not an easy matter, we know that what is recorded in the Bible must be fulfilled. The Lord says that &ldquo;the heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall by no means pass away&rdquo; (Matt. 24:35). First Corinthians 14 is the word of God. If this word is not fulfilled, the church will not be built up, and the Lord will not return. This is why Paul said that we have to pursue love and to desire earnestly the matter of prophesying.</p>
<p>Our attitude towards prophesying should be one of desiring. We should even be so hungry that we would beseech the Lord in earnestness, saying, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to us. First Corinthians 14 has not been fulfilled among your saints. Lord, if it is not fulfilled, the church cannot be built up, and You cannot come back. For the building up of the church and for Your coming back, be merciful to us, and grant us the prophesying.&rdquo; If you seek earnestly this way, the Lord will hear your prayer.</p>
<p>However, the principle of prophesying is not only a matter of the Lord&rsquo;s moving. On our side, there is also the need for learning. In particular we have to dive into the Bible and be saturated with the Lord&rsquo;s word. In this way, the Lord&rsquo;s word, like living water, will soak us thoroughly without and permeate us thoroughly within. When we are full of the Lord&rsquo;s word inwardly and outwardly, we will spontaneously be able to prophesy.</p>
<p>Luke chapter one records that while Mary had the Lord Jesus conceived in her womb, one day she went to see her relative Elizabeth. At that time Elizabeth had also conceived John the Baptist. When the two met, they uttered words of blessing and praise to one another (vv. 42-45, 46-55). Some have spent time to study the psalm of praise by Mary and have found that every point of this praise is taken from the Old Testament. I believe that she was very familiar with the Old Testament. This is why in her praise she could quote the words of the Old Testament. This proves that she was a person who was permeated with God&rsquo;s word inwardly and soaked with it outwardly. She was filled inwardly and outwardly by the word of God. This is why she was able to speak for God and to speak forth God.</p>
<p>This shows us that if we desire to prophesy, not only do we need to be moved by God, but we must also cooperate with God to read His word and get it into us, so that His word becomes our constitution. In this way, the Lord will speak through us. This is the principle of incarnation. Hence, on our part, we must be prepared. We have to be familiar with the Word of God. At the same time, there should not be any barrier between God and us. We have to confess our sins, transgressions, and weaknesses thoroughly. The Lord&rsquo;s blood will cleanse us and will make us clean inwardly and outwardly. In this way, we are ready to receive the anointing of the Holy Spirit. On the one hand, we have the Word and the Spirit. On the other hand, we have the moving of God. By these we can prophesy. This prophesying is something issuing forth from the spirit, and it brings with it light and revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Mutual Speaking and Exercising</h2>
<p>Moreover, there are secrets to proper prophesying. We can practice at home first. The husband may speak to the wife, and the wife may speak to the husband. After speaking to one another, they can criticize each other. This is a very good way of practicing, and it will improve our prophesying. It is like practicing piano; the more we practice, the more skillful we become. The less we practice, the harder it will be for us to advance. Hence, there is the need for constant practice even in the matter of prophesying. In the end, our posture, tone, air, and spirit of speaking will all become a genuine prophesying, instead of being merely a testifying or an ordinary speaking. If everyone would learn to speak for God and to speak forth God in this way, the Lord will surely be able to fulfill and recover the words in 1 Corinthians 14.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS PERFECTING PEOPLE<br />
TO BECOME THE APOSTLES. PROPHETS, EVANGELISTS,<br />
AND SHEPHERDS AND TEACHERS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:11 tells us that the ascended Head has given gifts to the church. He has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers. The reason He gave these gifts is not for the work of preaching the gospel or other matters, but for the perfecting of the saints.</p>
<p>We have also seen from the New Testament the gathering that is for the perfecting of the saints. Hebrews 10:24-25 says, &ldquo;And let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together... but exhorting one another.&rdquo; From the context of the passage, the above verses should not be referring to the big meetings, but to the small meetings, such as the small group meetings. In this kind of meeting, everyone can speak to one another and exhort one another. Gradually there will be the perfecting. Paul also said in Acts 20:20 that he &ldquo;did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house.&rdquo; On the one hand, there are the public meetings. On the other hand, there are the house-to-house teachings. Paul did this &ldquo;for three years, night and day...admonishing each one with tears&rdquo; (v. 31).</p>
<p>Paul admonished the brothers and sisters night and day in their homes. It may have been in the home meetings, with the nourishing and the supplying. It may have been in the small group meetings, with the care and the teaching. Nothing concerning God&rsquo;s plan, His economy, and His eternal purpose was held back from the saints, for the perfecting of the saints.</p>
<p>Hence, we have to see that in order to perfect some to become the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and the teachers, everything depends on the small group meetings. For example, we may have fifteen brothers and sisters meeting here in a small group meeting. Among them there are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Nobody is waiting for any one person to speak. Instead, everyone is speaking, and everyone is listening. Some may ask, &ldquo;What is it to prophesy?&rdquo; Perhaps a brother may answer, &ldquo;According to my knowledge, to prophesy is to speak for God, to speak forth God, and to speak God into others.&rdquo; Another may say, &ldquo;To speak God into others is to dispense Christ.&rdquo; In this way, everyone can go on to discuss the matter of prophesying. In the end, one brother who is more experienced in the matter of prophesying may say, &ldquo;In order to prophesy, we must push the word of God out from our spirit. There should also be much light, revelation, and content, which are the riches of Christ, the eternal life of Christ.&rdquo; Here we see the saints perfecting the saints, and also the apostles perfecting the saints. In the end, everyone is perfected to prophesy.</p>
<p>Perhaps at this juncture a sister would ask a question about the preaching of the gospel. An evangelist may happen to be there. He should not be there preaching the gospel. He should be there perfecting everyone to preach the gospel. He should speak clearly concerning the matter of preaching the gospel. All the listeners will be perfected, and they will become evangelists also.</p>
<p>If we have this kind of small group meetings for fifty-two weeks of the year, after a newly saved one has attended such meetings for thirty times, he will more or less be perfected, and he will begin to do the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</p>
<p>In addition, we have to take note that though the more gifted brothers and sisters should function more, their functioning should not replace that of the other brothers and sisters. If there is replacement, the clergy-laity system will come in, and it will produce a religious system, killing the spiritual organic function of the believers. We have to learn to perfect the brothers and sisters. First give them the chance to speak. Ask the newly saved ones to ask questions, with others answering. We will speak last. In this way, not only are the newly saved ones perfected, but the ones who answer will also be perfected. By this, everyone will be perfected in the small group meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WORD OF WARNING</h2>
<p>Today, we have to take the new way, and to change the old methods to the new methods. But we must remember that we should not change too fast. If we do it too fast, people will be left behind and will not be able to catch up. In the Old Testament, it is recorded that when Jacob led his wives and children and the livestock to meet his brother, he knew that he could not journey too fast. He said to his brother, &ldquo;Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant; and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure&rdquo; (Gen. 33:14). Jacob knew their endurance, and he said that they would journey on softly.</p>
<p>Today, the church in Taichung is a big church. There are a few hundred people. If we go too fast, the older ones and the younger ones may not be able to catch up. Hence, we have to go on slowly and to make changes step by step. As an illustration, the church in Taipei has nearly five thousand people. We have spent almost four years to turn around this carriage carrying five thousand people. In the new way, on the one hand, we have to be positive. But on the other hand, we cannot go too fast. Rather we should take the normal speed according to the condition of the brothers and sisters. I believe that the Lord will bless us.</p>
