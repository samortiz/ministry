<h1 class="title">THE DISCIPLINE OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 12:4-13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br />
OF THOSE UNDER DISCIPLINE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Struggling against Sin,<br />
Having Not Yet Resisted unto Blood</h2>
<p>Let us consider Hebrews 12:4-13, point by point.</p>
<p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;You have not yet resisted unto blood, struggling against sin.&rdquo; In this verse the apostle said that the Hebrew believers had struggled against sin. But even though they had suffered much, gone through great trials, encountered various problems, and met with much persecution, they had not yet resisted unto blood. If we compare these sufferings with that of our Lord, they are quite light! Verse 2 tells us that the Lord Jesus despised the shame and endured the suffering of the cross. What a believer goes through is far less severe than what the Lord went through! The Lord Jesus despised the shame and endured the suffering of the cross unto the shedding of blood. Although the Hebrew believers also suffered some shame and endured the cross, they had not yet resisted unto blood.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Finding the Reasons for Our Sufferings</h2>
<p>What should a person expect after he becomes a Christian? We should never put a false hope before the brothers. We should show them that we will encounter many problems. However, God&rsquo;s purpose and meaning are behind all of them. We can expect many trials and tribulations, but what is the purpose and meaning behind all these trials and tribulations? Unless the Lord grants us the privilege of becoming martyrs, we will probably not have the chance to resist and struggle against sin &ldquo;unto blood.&rdquo; But even though it is not a resistance unto blood, we are nevertheless resisting! Why do these things happen to us?</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Not Fainting nor Regarding Lightly</h2>
<p>Verses 5 and 6 say, &ldquo;You have completely forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons, &lsquo;My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him; for whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apostle quoted Proverbs in the Old Testament in this portion of the Word. He said that if the Lord disciplines us, we must not regard it lightly; and if the Lord reproves us, we must not faint. A believer should adopt these two attitudes. Some regard difficulties, sufferings, and God&rsquo;s discipline as insignificant matters. They do not think much of them and easily allow God&rsquo;s discipline to slip by. There are also some who faint when they go through the Lord&rsquo;s reproach and fall into His hand. As Christians they feel that they have suffered too much hardship in their environment and that it is too hard to live the Christian life. They expect their way to be smooth. Their thought is on entering the pearly gates and walking on a golden street wearing fine, white linen garments. It never occurred to them that Christians would experience all kinds of difficulties. They are not prepared to be Christians under such circumstances. They faint and waver at the difficulties along the way. Proverbs shows us that both of these attitudes are wrong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Not Regarding Lightly<br />
the Discipline of the Lord</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s children should not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord. If the Lord disciplines us, we have to pay attention to it. Everything the Lord measures to us has a purpose and meaning to it. He wants to build us up through our experiences and environment. All of His discipline is for the purpose of perfecting us and making us holy. All of His discipline works His nature into our nature. As a result, we become disciplined in our character. This is the purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s discipline. He does not discipline us without reason. He disciplines us for the purpose of making us vessels. The Lord does not allow suffering to come to His children without a cause. We do not suffer for the purpose of suffering. He does not give us tribulation simply to make us suffer. The purpose in all our suffering is that we would partake of God&rsquo;s holiness and nature. This is the goal of discipline.</p>
<p>Many children of God have been Christians for eight or ten years, yet they have never given serious consideration to God&rsquo;s discipline. They never say, &ldquo;The Lord is disciplining me. He is dealing with me, chastising me, and molding me into a vessel.&rdquo; They do not see the purpose of God&rsquo;s chastisement, dealing, and carving work. They go through their experiences capriciously. They are not bothered by what they see today; they let it slip by. They are not bothered by what they see the next day; they are not concerned about what the Lord&rsquo;s will is, and they disregard it time after time. To them it is as if God purposelessly allows people to suffer. Please bear in mind that the first reaction of God&rsquo;s children should be to respect and honor God&rsquo;s discipline. The first thing we should do when we experience something is to find the meaning of our experience: Why have things happened this way? We must learn to respect and honor God&rsquo;s discipline. We should not regard it lightly. To regard it lightly is to be careless about it. It is to say that God can do whatever He wants to do and that we must simply go through these experiences mindlessly and aimlessly.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we should not regard the discipline lightly. On the other hand, we should not make too much of it. If the Christian life became nothing but a story of suffering and frustration, it would be too much of a discouragement to us. This is to make too much of our discipline. We must learn to accept the discipline of the Lord and to see that His discipline and reproach are always meaningful. At the same time, we must not be discouraged by discipline.</p>
