   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROPHECY OF JEREMIAH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jeremiah s ministry began from the thirteenth year of Josiah s reign and continued until the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, from about 629 to 588 B.C. During the forty-one years of his ministry, the kingdom of Judah was rapidly declining.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The situation outside of the country was that strong neighboring nations, such as Assyria, Egypt, and Babylon, were watching greedily and seeking an opportunity to invade.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Within the country all the people, from the king and leaders above to the common people below, forsook God, worshipped idols, and were corrupt in morality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though there was a revival during the reign of Josiah, it was only for a brief moment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the reign of Johoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, the kings of Judah did what was evil in the eyes of Jehovah 2 Kings 23:32, 37; 24:9, 19 .</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jeremiah s prophecies concerning the kingdom of Judah contain two main points.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, since Israel did not listen to the word of the prophets to turn from their evil way and the evil of their deeds, Jehovah would send Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon in the north, to destroy them and make them an astonishment, a hissing, and an eternal reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jeremiah also prophesied that Israel would serve the king of Babylon for seventy years Jer 25:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, after the fulfillment of seventy years, Jehovah would punish the king of Babylon and make Babylon an eternal desolation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seventy years are counted from 606 B.C., when Nebuchadnezzar first took Jerusalem, until 536 B.C., when Cyrus the king of Persia made a decree for the return of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. Their Returning after</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>the Completion of Seventy Years</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the children of Israel were taken captive for seventy years, God stirred up the spirit of Cyrus the king of Persia and caused him to make a proclamation throughout all his kingdom to encourage the children of Israel to return and build the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This fulfilled the prophecy spoken by God through Jeremiah the prophet, Thus says Jehovah, When seventy years are fulfilled for Babylon, I will visit you and establish My good word to you, to bring you back to this place 29:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result of the stirring of the hidden God, King Cyrus made a decree, charging the children of Israel who were in captivity to return to Jerusalem and build God s temple Ezra 1:1-4; 2 Chron 36:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the record in the Scriptures, there were three returns of the children of Israel from captivity.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, under the leadership of Ezra, a descendant of the priestly family, the children of Israel had a second return from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the kingdom of Persia, Ezra was not a ruler with a high position; rather, he was a priest and a scribe who was skilled in the law of Moses 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although he did not have any position in Persia, the king granted him all his request and made a decree concerning those who returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ezra trusted in God and was one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was skilled in the word of God, and he also knew God s heart, God s desire, and God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, he had an excellent character and reputation before the king.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was only a cupbearer, that is, one who served wine to the king.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet in his living and conduct he built up a wonderful situation, obtaining the respect of the king.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He asked the king to send him to Judah that he might rebuild the city of his fathers graves Neh 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nehemiah asked the king to grant him letters for the governors beyond the River so that they would let him pass through to Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He also asked for a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the Park, which belonged to the king, so that he would give him timber vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The king granted Nehemiah all his requests.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Under the leadership of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah the children of Israel returned from captivity and were reconstituted to be the testimony of God, the expression of God on earth, and a people absolutely different from the Gentile nations.</S>
