   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>g. To Pray</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may also pray in the name of Jesus John 14:13-14; 15:16; 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This does not mean that we pray a long prayer and conclude it with the words "in the name of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That is too formal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, I do not oppose this, for I have done this many times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, I would say that in our prayer it is good to call on the name of Jesus and say, "O Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I come to pray!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the name of Jesus, you will have a real burden to pray, and it will be very easy to have the assurance that your prayer has been heard and answered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we call on the name of Jesus, we shall have the assurance that we shall receive what we have asked.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the Lord Jesus told us to pray in His name, He proceeded to say that the Spirit will come to dwell in us John 14:13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the indwelling Spirit has very much to do with our prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to pray in the name of Jesus, we need the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are in the Spirit, we are in the reality of the name of Jesus in which we are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>h.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To Be Gathered Into</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The name of Jesus is also for us to be gathered into Matt 18:20, "in" should be changed to "into," Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>. Whenever we come together to meet, we should be gathered together into the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we may meet for the purpose of having the life-study, we do not gather into the life-study, but into the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever you come to a Christian meeting, you must realize that you are being gathered once again into the name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have been put into the name of Jesus, but we are not yet very deep into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we need to come back again and again to be gathered into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can all testify that after every meeting we have had the sense deep within that we have entered further into the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Christian gatherings will bring us more deeply into the appreciation of the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>i.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To Cast Out Demons</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The name of Jesus is also good for casting out demons Acts 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To know the power of the name of Jesus, use it to cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Demons know the power of the name of Jesus better than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Demons are subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From our experience in China, where there were many cases of demon possession, we have learned that when we cast out demons, we must tell them that this Jesus is not the ordinary, common Jesus, but that He is the designated Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must say, "Demon, I come in the very name of Jesus, the Son of God, who was incarnated to be a man, who was born of a virgin in Bethlehem, who was raised in Nazareth, who died on the cross for my sins and for the sins of this person that is possessed, who was resurrected from the dead, and who has ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I come in the name of this Jesus, and I command you to leave!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Immediately, the demon will depart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, if you say, "I cast you out in the name of Jesus," the demon will not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Demons know the power of the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you cast out a demon, there is no need to pray that much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Simply say, "I come in the name of the designated Jesus, and you must go!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Jesus comes, demons must flee.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To Preach</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The name of Jesus is for us to preach Acts 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we preach, we must preach in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Preaching in the Lord's name must be done in the Spirit, for the Spirit is the Person of the Lord and the reality of His name.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we preach in His name, we need the Spirit to make it real.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through all the things that can be done in the name of Jesus, we see that whatever we do and whatever we are must be in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Never forget the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His name is a sweet name, a rich name, a powerful name, a saving name, a healing name, a comforting name, and an available name.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the name that is exalted, honored, and respected.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And it is the name feared by the enemy.</S>
