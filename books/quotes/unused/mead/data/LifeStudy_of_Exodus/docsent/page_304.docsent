   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Close to the Frame as Receptacles</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>for the Poles to Carry the Table</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From verse 27 we see that the rings were close to the border as receptacles for the poles to carry the table.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This signifies that both the linking and the moving are dependent on the connecting and strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that the frame was for connecting and strengthening and that the rings were for linking and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fact that the rings were close to the frame indicates that the linking and the moving are dependent on the connecting and the strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If among us there is no connecting or strengthening, there cannot be any linking or moving.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are disconnected from one another, we shall not have the strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then it will be impossible to have the linking or the moving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But because we have the connecting and the strengthening, we also have the linking and the moving.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How meaningful it is that the golden rings were placed close to the connecting and strengthening frames!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>J. Two Poles of Acacia Wood</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 28 speaks of the poles: And you shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold; and the table shall be carried with them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once again, the acacia wood signifies Christ s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here the poles made of acacia wood signify that Christ s humanity is the strength for moving.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fact that these poles were overlaid with gold signifies that Christ s divinity is the expression of the move of the table.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The acacia wood is the strength, and the gold is the expression of God in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the poles made of acacia wood overlaid with gold signify that the move of Christ as our life supply is by His two natures mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>K. The Dishes, Cups, Jars,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>and Sacrificial Bowls</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 29 says, And you shall make its dishes, and its cups, and its jars, and its sacrificial bowls with which to pour a drink offering; you shall make them of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The dishes were for displaying the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When you serve a meal, you put the food in serving dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same principle, the dishes were used for displaying the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The cups contained frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Frankincense signifying Christ s resurrection was poured upon the bread of the Presence displayed on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cups were used to contain this liquid frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The jars and sacrificial bowls were used for pouring the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these utensils were made of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This signifies that the divine nature of Christ is the means through which we partake of Him as our life supply and our offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we consider our experience as Christians, we shall know that this interpretation of the details related to the table is accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord that He is God s ark and our table!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the embodiment of God s testimony and also the feast for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the ark, the law is within Him and the cherubim are upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the table, the bread of the Presence is displayed on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we remain in the tabernacle to serve God, we shall enjoy Christ as such a portion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE BREAD OF THE PRESENCE SIGNIFYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>AS THE FOOD FOR GOD S PRIESTS A. The Presence-bread, the Face-bread</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Exodus 25:30 says, And you shall put upon the table bread of the Presence before Me continually.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The King James Version and other versions adopt the rendering showbread in place of bread of the Presence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Old Testament the bread on this table in the Holy Place has two names: the first, found here in Exodus, is the bread of the Presence; the second, found in 1 Chronicles 9:32, is the bread of arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In both places the King James Version says showbread.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This expression is very close in meaning to the bread of arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the bread was arranged in a certain way, there was a show, a display, of the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, by the term showbread we do not have any realization that the bread is related to the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This bread is not only for a show, display, or arrangement; it is also the bread of the Presence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The bread of the Presence is surely an unusual expression.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In ordinary language we do not have such a term, for this is not part of our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>People do not ordinarily speak of the food of God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But this is precisely the meaning of the term bread of the Presence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It denotes the food of God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, the Hebrew word means face.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, verse 30 speaks of the presence-bread or of the face-bread.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When you have this bread, you have God s presence, God s face.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, when you eat this bread, you eat the presence of God, the face of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, this bread is not merely for show or display.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have pointed out that the table of the bread of the Presence was not far from the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This table was thus before God, in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps we can illustrate the significance of the bread of the Presence by pointing to the delight a mother has in preparing a favorite meal for her son.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although a certain mother may be in her seventies and her son in his fifties, she still loves him and enjoys cooking for him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Suppose her son comes to visit her after an absence of several years.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The elderly mother may prepare a meal she enjoyed cooking for her son and that he especially enjoyed eating when he was young.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She recalls that her beloved son enjoys this particular dish very much.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, she prepares the meal for him and serves it to him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As he eats the food she has prepared, her eyes are upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He enjoys this meal in his mother s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, this food is the food of his mother s presence, his mother s face.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In a sense, this meal is virtually the presence of his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By eating this food, he eats his mother s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When he eats this food before his mother, it becomes the food of his mother s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In like manner, the bread on the table in the Holy Place is the bread of God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This bread is very different from manna.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Manna could be gathered and eaten far away from God s face.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have indicated that no matter where they may be, Christians may have manna without God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we consider our past experience as believers, we shall be able to confirm this.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Did you not experience manna years ago, before you came into the church life in the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But did you enjoy God s presence at that time?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now in the midst of the built-up saints we have a portion of Christ with God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although words cannot explain this adequately, if we have had the experience, we shall also have the understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Praise the Lord for the bread of the divine presence, the bread of God s face!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the church life we are feasting on the face of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The presence-bread, the face-bread, signifies Christ as the food of God s priests.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This food was to be enjoyed by them in God s presence and it was to bring them into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We know from our experience that when we enjoy Christ as such a portion, this enjoyment brings us into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Actually we are enjoying Christ as our life supply in God s presence.</S>
