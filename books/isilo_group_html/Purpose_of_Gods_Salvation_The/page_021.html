<h1 class="title">LOVING THE LORD TO RECEIVE REVELATION<br />
AND TAKE ACTION</h1>
<p>John 20:1-18 is concerning the Lord&rsquo;s appearing to Mary the Magdalene after His resurrection. &ldquo;Now on the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was yet dark and saw the stone taken away from the tomb. She ran therefore and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him. Peter therefore went forth, as well as the other disciple, and came to the tomb. And the two ran together, yet the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came first to the tomb. And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there; however, he did not enter. Then Simon Peter also came, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beheld the linen cloths lying there and the handkerchief which had been over His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in one place apart. At that time therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, entered, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He had to rise from the dead. The disciples therefore went away again to their own home. But Mary stood outside at the tomb weeping. Then as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb and beheld two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. And they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him. When she said these things, she turned backward and beheld Jesus standing there, yet she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that He was the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away. Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God. Mary the Magdalene came, announcing to the disciples, I have seen the Lord, and that He had said these things to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This portion reveals a person who loved the Lord and sought Him. There are three key points in this portion. First, this person was attracted by the Lord to love Him. Second, the issue of loving the Lord was a new discovery, a new revelation, concerning the Lord. Third, this lover of the Lord took action based on the new revelation that she received from loving the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ATTRACTED BY THE LORD TO LOVE HIM</h2>
<p>The four Gospels show that not many people appreciated or loved the Lord Jesus when He began His ministry. People were touched by His words and revered Him because of His miracles, but not many people had a loving response to the Lord. In other words, not many people were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love when He began His ministry. At the end of the Gospels, however, there were a few people who had been attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love and had an inner response to His love. The Lord&rsquo;s love was a like strong magnet that drew people to Him. In the Lord&rsquo;s last journey on earth He went to Jerusalem. For three and a half years the Lord&rsquo;s work had been contrary to the Jewish tradition; hence, the atmosphere in Jerusalem was against Him. What the Lord did on the earth was also incompatible with earthly politics. Eventually, the Jewish rulers, the Herodians, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the rulers of the Roman government all joined forces to oppose the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was a lowly carpenter from Galilee, but His words and deeds in the three and a half years of His ministry caused an intense reaction in the land of Judea. We may say that He upset the whole Jewish society. Many people were moved by Him, many were helped by Him, and many feared Him. The rulers of the Jewish society were very jealous and opposed Him because He had an indescribable attracting power. When we read the four Gospels, we can sense that the atmosphere in Jerusalem was against the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus died on the cross during the Jewish Passover. According to the custom of the Jews, every male was required to go to Jerusalem to keep the feast. Because the Jewish rulers had conspired to kill Jesus while He was in Jerusalem to keep the feast, this talk spread through the Jewish society before the Lord Jesus arrived in Jerusalem (John 11:55-57). Being a man of God, the Lord Jesus was neither dismayed nor intimidated; rather, He obeyed God&rsquo;s will and went up to Jerusalem. The disciples sensed the atmosphere and knew that it was dangerous to go up to Jerusalem (Mark 10:32). The disciples would not have dared to follow the Lord into Jerusalem had they not been attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love. This shows that the disciples were attracted by the Lord.</p>
<p>For three and a half years the Lord Jesus&rsquo; deeds attracted a few people, including some women, to love Him (15:40-41). According to Jewish custom, only the males had to go up to Jerusalem three times a year to keep the major feasts&mdash;the Feast of the Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles. The women did not have to go up to Jerusalem. Hence, it sufficed for Peter, James, and John to go up to Jerusalem with the Lord Jesus. The women did not have to go; it might seem superfluous for the women to go up to Jerusalem. But these women were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Some of these women were probably clearer than Peter, James, and John that the Lord would be arrested and put to death. The women understood that it was their last opportunity to contact the Lord and were reluctant to leave Him; thus, they accompanied the Lord to Jerusalem together with the disciples. The atmosphere in Jerusalem was antagonistic toward the Lord Jesus, but these women did not fear the threatening situation; instead, they followed the Lord Jesus because they were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Six days before the Passover, the Lord Jesus went to Bethany. As He reclined at table, Mary came with an alabaster flask of costly pure nard, broke it, and poured the ointment over Him (Matt. 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8). Mary poured out her love on the Lord Jesus because she was attracted by His love.</p>
<p>Even though the atmosphere was against the Lord Jesus when He was on the cross, one of His disciples, Joseph from Arimathea, dared to ask Pilate for His body. Furthermore, Nicodemus, who had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes. Joseph from Arimathea and Nicodemus took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the burying custom of the Jews (19:38-40). They did this because they were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Even after the Lord Jesus was buried, Mary the Magdalene was so attracted by His love that she had to go to His tomb. Everyone else went home, but she went to the tomb to find the Lord. On the first day of the week, the third day after the Lord Jesus had been buried, Mary the Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was yet dark (20:1). She did not go there to work; she went because she was attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love. She loved and missed the Lord so much that she could not help but go to His tomb. Mary&rsquo;s going early, while it was yet dark, shows that she loved the Lord and missed Him so much that she did not wait until daylight. She eagerly went to the Lord&rsquo;s tomb early in the morning with the hope of finding her Lord.</p>
<p>May we all see this picture. People followed the Lord Jesus to an antagonistic place, poured precious ointment upon Him before His death, followed Him all the way to the cross, requested the Lord&rsquo;s body, and anointed and buried it in the midst of a frightful atmosphere, because they were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love. It was because of this love that a sister went while it was still dark to find her Lord in the tomb.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Purpose of God's Salvation &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
