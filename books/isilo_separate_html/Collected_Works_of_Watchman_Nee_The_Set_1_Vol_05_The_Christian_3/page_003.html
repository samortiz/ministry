As such He is sitting on the throne of His Father. This shows Him in His Godhead. No other creature on earth can share with Him in this respect. Later, in His words to Laodicea, He indicates this: "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne" (3:21). In the future the overcoming saints will sit with the Lord Jesus on His throne. However, they will not be able to sit on the Father's throne. At the beginning of this book, John saw the Lord Jesus like the Son of Man. Soon, He will receive His throne in His status as the Son of Man. Both He and His redeemed ones can sit on this throne. Yet this is something for the future. Before that day comes, these ones should fight for the Lord and should labor and strive to overcome in the battlefield, as He has overcome. This teaching shatters Thyatira's dream! According to the teaching of this Scripture, how can the church exercise authority in this age? Either the Roman Catholic Church hopes to exercise authority before Christ exercises His, or it hopes to sit with Christ on the throne of God the Father and exercise authority from there. What an absurdity this is! This is why the Lord Jesus purposely reveals Himself here as the Son of God.</P><P>Matthew 18:18 says: "Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven." We must realize that this word does not refer to the authority of the church in the world. This verse refers to the matter of the excommunication of the saints. We can see this fact from the context of Matthew 18. This act of excommunication is an act originating from the zeal of God's people concerning His holiness. God's goal towards His people is to have them express His holiness in a definite way. If some among them fail, the rest should bear the responsibility before God to execute God's command of excommunicating the sinful saints. If God's children act according to His commands, God will be with them. Whatever they bind, God will also bind, and whatever they loose, God will also loose. No one can bind anything apart from the word of God. No one is commissioned exclusively by the Lord to open up His word. If anyone obeys God's word, God will work with him. Authority is with the word of God; it is not with the people. If a person has no guidance from God's word, yet Christ binds and looses according to him while he continues in his disobedience to God's word, such binding and loosing is to shame Himself.</P><P>Hence, all authority of the church, unless derived from an obedience to God's word, is rebellion to Christ. No one can serve two masters. Our conscience can be responsible to God alone. All holiness and morality begin from here. If there is any deviation from God's word, no right can be right, and no wrong can be wrong. There will no longer be any distinction between right and wrong. God's purpose is for man to obey His word. It is true that we have to "listen to the church." Yet, it is only when the church is obeying God's word that the saints have a responsibility to obey it. Otherwise, to obey the church is to rebel against God. All those who are telling others to listen to the church without listening to the Bible are under the teaching of Thyatira. They should listen to what the Lord says, that He is "the Son of God" and that He alone has eyes like a flame of fire.</P><P>Even now, only the Son of God has eyes like a flame of fire. We have to be careful about how and what we hear. Other than His word, nothing should have any authority to dominate us. Because Thyatira has forgotten that the Lord is the One with the sharp two-edged sword, He reminds them that He is the One with eyes like a flame of fire and feet like shining bronze, which trample under them anything that His eyes do not approve of.</P><P>In spite of this, the faithful saints in Thyatira can receive consolation through this title. Particularly if we look into the place of the Son of God in the Bible, we will find the meaning of this title here. In John 5 we see how as the Son of God He is the source of life and the life-giver. Since the life we receive from the Lord Jesus through faith is so powerful, even when the body that contains this life dies, it will still resurrect to receive eternal life. However, those bodies that do not have this life will resurrect to judgment (5:29). Not only will we receive eternal life in the future, we even now have eternal life already (v. 24). Although we must all stand before the judgment seat, that judgment seat of Christ will not determine whether we will have eternal life or not. Rather, it is because we have life that we will have to stand before the judgment seat of Christ. The judgment there is not to determine if we have life or not. It is to determine our position in glory. Although some will have their works completely burned, the life they possess is common to all those standing before the judgment seat. This is the minimum requirement. If we think that one must wait until he dies before he can know if he has life, even though he has believed in the Lord Jesus already, it is a shame to the grace of the Lord. He said that when we believe in Him we have life. If we believe in Him, surely we will have life.</P><P>As the Son of God, the Lord Jesus not only gives us life but freedom as well. In John 8:36 He says, "If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed." Freedom and life are what the Lord Jesus gives to us as the Son of God. However, this does not mean that everyone who has life is free. Often we see many people who have life, yet they are still bound by many things. This is the experience of the person in Romans 7. He surely had life already. Yet in experience he was like a slave. He sighed, "I am fleshy, sold under sin...Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" (vv. 14, 24). However, he was freed in Christ. Hence, he said: "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" (Rom. 8:2).</P><P>As the Son of God, the Lord Jesus gives us life and freedom. He died for us and bore our sins. As a result we have life. He was crucified with us, so that we die to sin with Him. As a result we are free. Everyone who has life can be free, because this is the Lord's gift to us as the Son of God. When we believe in the only begotten Son of God, we become the sons of God. As sons of God, we are in the Father's house and are completely free.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
