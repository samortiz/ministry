 <h2 class="head1">SUPPLYING THE WORD IN MEETINGS OF MUTUALITY</h2>
<p>There is another need that we have not taken care of in the past. We should grasp the opportunity in every meeting of mutuality to supply others with the word. This can be in the prayer meeting, the bread-breaking meeting, and the fellowship meeting. In some localities there is no ministering of the word in the prayer meetings. Instead, the saints sing some hymns and pray a little. After this, the meeting is ended. Such a situation is neither normal nor proper.</p>
<p>Some of the brothers and sisters who come to a prayer meeting may be new believers, others might not know how to pray, and still others might not be in the mood to pray. Hence, without the ministry of the word, the meeting will be tasteless and the saints will lose the desire to attend the meeting. In other prayer meetings there is a lack in the ministry of the word and a lack in leading the saints to pray. The prayer meeting is like a boat without a rudder; it is tossed about in every direction by the wind. When the wind blows from the east, the meeting drifts toward the west; when the wind blows from the west, the meeting drifts toward the east. This kind of meeting is not attractive, and after filling up the time drifting here and there, the meeting will come to an end. This kind of meeting will not attract people; moreover, it is an offense to the Lord and to the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Therefore, in meetings such as the bread-breaking meeting, the prayer meeting, and the fellowship meeting, there should be a supply from the ministry of the word. The serving ones should not sleep peacefully; they should continually consider how to stir up the meetings. The meetings should be stirred up by the ministry of the word and by leading the saints in selecting hymns, praying, speaking, and giving announcements. The hearts of the brothers and sisters should be stirred up, and they should be helped to open their mouth one by one to pray in the meeting.</p>
<p>In particular, those who serve in the ministry of the word should release a word in every prayer meeting. But it should never be done in a rigid way. A word should also be released in the bread-breaking meeting, but it should not be done rigidly. We should be flexible. Something can be spoken before breaking the bread or after breaking the bread. One can even give a short word of fellowship while the bread and the cup are being passed. We should simply follow the flow of the Spirit. Those who minister the word should be prepared to release a word in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Bread-breaking Meeting</h2>
<p>Many new believers do not have much knowledge concerning the significance of breaking the bread. Therefore, our continual speaking should stir them up in these matters. However, this kind of stirring up is not educational in nature. We can give an educational word in prayer meetings, but we should not do so in the bread-breaking meetings. These meetings differ in focus and in significance. There should not be anything educational in the bread-breaking meeting. An educational element will kill the meeting. If we feel the need for an educational word, it should be given after the bread is broken. Any word released before the bread is broken or during the passing of the bread and the cup should not be educational; otherwise, it will kill the Spirit. Any educational speaking for correction, instruction, or explanation should be given after the bread-breaking meeting. But we should avoid giving an educational word prior to and during the breaking of the bread, because it will distract the saints from the Lord. We should speak a word that will bring the saints into the Lord instead of out of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading People to Appreciate<br />
the Sweetness and the Beauty of the Lord</h2>
<p>When we began meeting in northern China, the word was ministered in every bread-breaking meeting. All the speaking was to lead people into the sweetness, glory, and beauty of the Lord. Once when we were about to break the bread, I stood up and shared a short word concerning the Lord being sweet and lovely to those who know and appreciate Him. I used various portions from the Gospels to show that the Lord was anointed on the head (Matt. 26:6-7), anointed on His feet (Luke 7:36-38), presented with frankincense and myrrh at His birth (Matt. 2:11), and anointed with spices for burial (John 19:39-40). Hence, from His head to His feet and from His birth to His death, the Lord is sweet and lovely. This speaking caused the brothers and sisters to know the Lord whom they were remembering.</p>
<p>In another bread-breaking meeting, I read from Isaiah 53: &ldquo;He will see a seed, He will extend His days... / He will see the fruit of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied&rdquo; (vv. 10-11). Then I continued with a portion from the Psalms: &ldquo;When I awake, I will be satisfied with Your likeness&rdquo; (17:15). These two portions speak of satisfaction from two sides. In simple words I then explained, &ldquo;Our gathering here is the issue of the Lord&rsquo;s labor; He is satisfied when He sees us. Not only so, when we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we are like those who have awakened from sleep. We are befuddled in the world, but when we come to the bread and the cup, we are awake. We are awake in Him, we behold His face, and we are satisfied. This is a story of satisfaction from two sides: we satisfy Him, and He satisfies us.&rdquo; Then I called a hymn related to this topic. We had numerous situations of this nature that were not educational but included a considerable amount of education.</p>
<p>On another occasion I stood up and said that the Lord was given a name which is above every name (Phil. 2:9). I then spoke for fifteen minutes concerning the Lord&rsquo;s name, showing the brothers and sisters that we are saved in this name, we have been placed into this name, we pray in this name, and we overcome Satan by this name. This speaking brought the saints into the Lord&rsquo;s name. After this we were all touched when we sang a hymn concerning the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>In another bread-breaking meeting I spoke on the bread and the cup. It was a simple message showing that the bread is a story of life and the cup is a story of blessing. The Lord&rsquo;s life, symbolized by the bread, is for our enjoyment. Also, God Himself and all that He is have become our blessing in the cup. In an earlier message I focused on the cup and began speaking on the significance of the cup according to Psalm 16:5, which says, &ldquo;Jehovah is the portion...of my cup.&rdquo; A cup signifies the portion we should have. Originally, our portion was the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath. This portion is the lake of fire. Revelation 14 speaks of a group of people whose portion is the lake of fire burning with brimstone (v. 10). The portion that God measured out for them is the lake of fire, the cup of His wrath. When the Lord went to the cross, He took the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath. The Lord said, &ldquo;The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?&rdquo; (John 18:11). He drank the cup of wrath for us. Because the fire of God&rsquo;s wrath was burning Him when He was dying on the cross, He said He was thirsty. This corresponds to the Lord&rsquo;s words in Psalm 22: &ldquo;All my bones are out of joint. / My heart is like wax; / It is melted within me... / My tongue is stuck to my jaws&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). This describes the Lord&rsquo;s thirst. On the cross the Lord&rsquo;s blood was shed, which constitutes the cup of salvation for us, and this cup runs over with blessing.</p>
<p>As we remember Him, when we see the cup, we should realize that He drank the cup of wrath, which was our portion, on our behalf. He then gave us the cup of salvation that runs over with blessing. When we break the bread to remember the Lord, we are receiving the cup of blessing. If we speak concerning the bread and the cup in the fellowship meeting or prayer meeting, our speaking will not draw people&rsquo;s attention, but when we speak of them during the bread-breaking meeting, our speaking becomes very attractive.</p>
<p>We should not speak in an educational way concerning the Lord Jesus&rsquo; person and work in the bread-breaking meeting; instead, we should speak in an ordinary way with love. We should speak like someone telling a love story. We are saying how wonderful the person is whom we love. For example, we can read a portion from Song of Songs describing Him as &ldquo;dazzling white yet ruddy, / Distinguished among ten thousand&rdquo; (5:10). We can then say something concerning <em>white</em> and <em>ruddy.</em> We should also point out the Lord&rsquo;s beauty and loveliness so that others can have a real and sweet knowledge of Him. The bread-breaking meeting is to remember the Lord&rsquo;s work and to glorify and exalt His name. Therefore, we can even say something concerning His return. Since the Lord&rsquo;s table implies His coming again, this word can be very sweet. As often as we eat the bread and drink the cup, we declare the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes (1 Cor. 11:26). The Lord said that after He drank the cup with His disciples, He would not drink it again until that day when He would drink it new with them in the kingdom of His Father (Matt. 26:29). A short word can bring saints into the Lord&rsquo;s coming. While the saints remember the Lord, they are awaiting His coming. A word given from a heart full of feeling stirs people up.</p>
