<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AS TYPIFIED BY ISAIAH,<br>THE PROPHET OF JEHOVAH,<br>FOR A COVENANT OF THE PEOPLE<br>TO RESTORE THE LAND</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 49&#151;50; John 14:10; Hosea 11:1; Matt. 2:15b; John 13:31b; Rom. 8:33a, 31, 34a</H1><P>Chapters forty-nine and fifty of Isaiah present Christ as typified by Isaiah, the prophet of Jehovah, for a covenant of the people to restore the land. In this message we will consider these two chapters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE THREE PERSONS OF THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH</H2><P>In order to understand Isaiah 49, we need to see the three persons of the servant of Jehovah&#151;Christ (vv. 5-9a), Isaiah the prophet (vv. 1-4), and Israel (v. 3). Both Isaiah the prophet and Israel consummate in Christ. All three are one servant. First, all are Israel. Israel, of course, is Israel, Isaiah was an Israelite, and Jesus Christ was a typical Israelite. Thus, as Israelites they all are one. Second, as a whole, Israel was God's servant, His witness, in the Old Testament. Isaiah as a part of Israel also was a servant of Jehovah. In the New Testament Christ is unveiled as the Servant of God (Mark 10:45) and His Witness (Rev. 1:5). This again shows the oneness of Isaiah, Israel, and Christ as servants of Jehovah. But in the New Testament, our oneness with Christ as servants of God is seen more clearly, because the New Testament says that we are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). Together we are one corporate Christ. Since we are in this corporate Christ, and Christ is the Servant of God, we also are one servant of God, one witness of God. This is God's eternal view, and this is the view we need to have in order to understand Isaiah 49&#151;50.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Isaiah, the Prophet of Jehovah</H2><P>Isaiah, the prophet of Jehovah (typifying Christ as the Servant of God for God's speaking&#151;John 14:10), served Jehovah as His mouthpiece to speak forth His word, which is the embodiment of Himself (Isa. 49:1-4). Isaiah spoke for God, but Christ spoke for God much more. In His ministry on earth, the main thing He did was speak for God. Even after He ascended to the heavens, He continued to speak, for He spoke in the speaking of the apostles. The Epistles of Paul, for example, are a continuation of Christ's speaking.</P><P>The word of God is God's embodiment. When we speak forth God's word, we speak forth God. We cannot speak forth God without speaking forth God's word. We all need to learn how to speak forth God's word.</P>
