   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE SEVEN MOVING WITH GOD AND UNITED WITH CHRIST Scripture Reading: S.S. 3:6-11 BECOMING WORTHY OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO MOVE WITH GOD IN UNION WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Song of Songs is a romance of Christ with His elect, written as poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us review the crucial points, or crystals, which we have covered thus far.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, there is the initial pursuit by the lover.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, the lover is brought into the inner chamber of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Third, the lover is directed to enter into the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in the church life there is the transformation to transform us, the saved ones, absolutely in the divine life, making us the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fifth, there is the mutual gain and enjoyment of Christ and His lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sixth, Christ calls His successful pursuer to go to the cross that the self might be broken and the natural man might be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Seventh, the lover of Christ is brought into the full realization of the flourishing riches of the resurrection of Christ by which she is encouraged and empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This corresponds with Philippians 3:10 to be conformed to Christ s death by the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After passing through the above stages, the lover of Christ is worthy of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At this juncture she is seen as one who is moving with God and united with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may talk about God s economy and yet not be in it because we are not the proper kind of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A PILLAR OF SMOKE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Song of Songs 3:6 says, Who is she who comes up from the wilderness / Like pillars of smoke?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such an illustration is used only twice in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Exodus 14 refers to God as the pillar of cloud who brought Israel out of Egypt unto Himself for the fulfillment of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now in Song of Songs the seeker of Christ has become like a pillar of smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She is spiritual and steady, unshakable, so she is qualified to move with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After this vision, Song of Songs presents two other signs of the lover of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One is the bed in the night during the wartime 3:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The other is the palanquin in the day for the celebration of the victory from the war vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Following this there is a call for the daughters of Jerusalem to come to see Solomon in his bridal love v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At this point the seeker of Christ has passed through the cross and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In resurrection she has been transformed to be a spiritual person, not a physical person; she is like smoke, but she is a pillar that can stand on the earth touching the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In experience she has become God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the experience of God becoming man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She is a spiritual person standing on the earth as a ladder, bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven Gen 28:12; John 1:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The heaven needs her and the earth also needs her.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of Christ s believers, His members, should be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the pillar, the ladder, that brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should be unshakable and spiritual like God, who is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul in 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul was qualified to be such a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we study Paul s Epistles, we sense that this man was just like God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was a spiritual man, not a natural, soulish man, nor a fleshly or fleshy man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because he was such a person, like God, he was the only writer of the New Testament to touch the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 he exhorted Timothy to charge certain ones not to teach different things from God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then in Ephesians 1:10 he said that in the economy of the fullness of the times, all things would be headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Ephesians 3:8-9 he also said that he had been charged to announce the unsearchable riches of Christ to the nations and to enlighten all to see God s economy.</S>
