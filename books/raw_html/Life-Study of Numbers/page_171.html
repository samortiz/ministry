<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Inheriting the Land<br>by Lot according to Their Families</H2><P>"You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; for a large one you shall enlarge his inheritance, and for a small one you shall decrease his inheritance; wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit" (v. 54). Here we see that the children of Israel were to inherit the land according to two things: according to their tribes and according to the lot. The size of the tribes was a matter of the increase in life, and the lot was a matter of God's sovereignty. This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ today mainly depends on our increase in life and on God's sovereignty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Consequences of Not Driving Out<br>the Inhabitants of the Land from before Them</H2><P>In verses 55 and 56 we see the consequences of not driving out the inhabitants of the land from before them. If God's people had not driven out the inhabitants, those whom they had allowed to remain would have been as pricks in their eyes and as thorns in their sides. Moreover, these inhabitants would have troubled them in the land where they dwelt, and God would have done to them as He thought to do to those inhabitants. This means that the portion of the Gentiles under God's curse would have become the portion of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Boundaries of the Good Land<br>and Its Distributors</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Boundaries of the Good Land</H2><P>Numbers 34:1-15 speaks of the boundaries of the good land. The boundaries of the land of Canaan signify Christ in His resurrection and ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Southern Boundary</H2><P>The southern boundary (vv. 3-5) was from the wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom; from the end of the Salt Sea (the Dead Sea) on the east, turning south to the ascent of Akrabbim, crossing to Zin, ending south of Kadesh-barnea; then extending to Hazar-addar, crossing over to Azmon, turning from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt, and ending at the Great Sea (the Mediterranean Sea).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Western Boundary</H2><P>The western boundary (v. 6) was along the Great Sea and its coast, from the south to the north. The Great Sea signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ.</P>
