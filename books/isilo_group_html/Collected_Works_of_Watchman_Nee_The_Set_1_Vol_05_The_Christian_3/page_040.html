Christ said: "Thy word have I hid in mine heart" (Psa. 119:11). This is the character of the faithful ones in the latter days. Paul told Timothy, "But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come. For men...having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power...But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse" (2 Tim. 3:1, 2, 5, 13). Yet, there is a proper way for God's remnant to take. "But you, continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them and that from a babe you have known the sacred writings" (vv. 14-15). When all around in the world is changing, only the Bible, God's Word, can preserve us. If we draw near and keep God's written word, we will be kept safe in perilous times. The Old Testament which Timothy studied when he was a babe plus the New Testament which he had "learned" from the apostle are our guide today. It is not a great manifestation of power or the performance of miracles that will preserve us. The most important thing is God's written word. The Lord did not say that they have power. Rather, He said that they have kept His word.</P><P>"My word." God has called us to keep Christ's own word and to draw near to Christ Himself rather than to the word of the church. If we accept the word of the church, it means that the church has the authority. But if we accept the word of Christ, it means that Christ Himself has the authority. We should judge everything by the word of Christ. Even the church should be judged by this word. At the time of the failure of the church, the Lord has not charged us to listen to the church. We have seen how in Thyatira the words of Jezebel were considered inspired and authoritative. We have also seen in Sardis how this self-claim and self-boasting has been rejected. However, although the church was not inspired, she was still teaching. Man now says that we already have an open Bible, and we praise the Lord that this indeed is the case. As a result of this, it is right that there should be much shining of the light. But what about the creeds? The Protestant creeds pay much attention to the fundamental doctrines of the gospel, but even this is man's teaching. Whatever they may say, they originate from man. Of course, at the beginning, these creeds were what those who drafted them believed in. Later, through difference of opinions, different creeds were established. After this, the dispute concerning the creeds increased. At this point, there are divisions upon divisions, sects upon sects. It has become a great shame to Protestantism.</P><P>Of course, on the one hand, the Protestant churches today no longer consider themselves the unique "catholic" church like the Roman Catholic Church does. However, on the other hand, the different Protestant creeds show that Protestantism is for sectarianism. To set up any creed outside the Bible, no matter how scriptural it may be, is to build up a wall and to shut out those with different opinions. "If you are not one with us, please go away to set up another sect." If the church of God will not accept all regenerated persons, but will add some creeds to the Bible, it is a sect already. Thank God that He has called us to keep the word of Christ. Otherwise, the simple children will be lost in the present confusion of creeds, organizations, and names. What we should keep is His word and not the church's word.</P><P>Everyone who would keep Christ's word should not be bound by anyone. His conscience can only be responsible to one master. He should follow the Lord as if he were the only Christian on earth. One's knowledge of God and His word and one's walk according to His word should be gradually increased. In the present age of apostasy, the most important thing is to take care of keeping God's word.</P><P>The word of Christ brings us closer to Christ. It will preserve us and will separate us from the deception of the end time and will cause us to walk contrary to it. The characteristic of the present time is impostoring. "But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse" (2 Tim. 3:13). "These things I have written to you concerning those who lead you astray" (1 John 2:26). What we see at the present time are but impostorings and the leading astray of people. Soon, the unique Antichrist will surely appear. However, "even now many antichrists have come" (1 John 2:18). Hence, we must not "believe" in them (Matt. 24:23). Those who "did not receive the love of the truth" will be deceived by "all power and signs and wonders of a lie" (2 Thes. 2:9-11). Therefore, we must hold fast the truth of the Bible so that we will not be deceived by those who come as impostors of messengers of light. The only guarantee is the keeping of the word of Christ. This is a personal matter, because deception comes in privately. Once we are not watchful, we will fall. The power of deception is like that which the serpent used to deceive Eve; there is always the danger of our being corrupted from the purity which is toward Christ (2 Cor. 11:3). What can save us from this danger? It is not the outward display of power in the form of miracles and works of wonders. These things are, on the contrary, mostly instruments of deception. We cannot deal with Satan with miracles and works of wonders, for we are weak to the uttermost. Our security lies in our personal adherence to the Bible of Christ and in our not denying His name.</P><P>"Kept My word." How much this word encompasses! This word includes the form as well as the detail of the Lord's commandments. The believers in Philadelphia were not keeping a line here and a line there. They did not give it up when the price became too great. Rather, they kept it "through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report" (2 Cor. 6:8). If our motive is not to obey in everything, we will obey in nothing. The Lord will not compromise with us. He will not allow us to obey Him in some things and disobey Him in other things. Unless He is Lord of all, He is Lord of nothing. We should understand what it means to keep the Lord's word. If there is any significance to the word "keep," it should at least mean an absolute obedience. We should obey what we consider to be less significant just as absolutely as what we consider to be more significant. We should not consider any of the Lord's commandments as too small but should obey the "smallest" in the same way that we obey the greatest. This is to keep the Lord's word. This is often a test to our motive. Are we willing to follow the Lord in the dark, instead of being in doubt, and to go out by His leading, not knowing where we will be going?</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 05: The Christian (3) &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
