The main thing that ordinary brothers have to deal with is sin. The workers, however, have to deal meticulously with everything that hinders their work.</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with the Disposition</h2><p>The first thing that a worker has to deal with is his own disposition. Different workers have a different character according to their natural disposition. Some are righteous by disposition. Others are strict or shy by disposition. Every person has his own special disposition. Some people are stubborn. They may be good in many aspects, but they have a very stubborn disposition. Even if the whole world would say yes, they would still say no. If a person has such a disposition, he surely will have problems from time to time in his coordination among the co-workers. It is difficult for such people to coordinate or work together with others. Hence, every worker should find his weakness before the Lord. If you do not know your weakness before the Lord, all you have to do is mark down your failures. After a few times, you will know what your weakness is. After you know your weakness, you should deal with it in a specific way.</p><p>We are not saying that a worker cannot have any weakness at all. We are saying that he should not have any habitual weakness. We have to get rid of the peculiarities in our character. Some people have "soft" ears&mdash;they believe everything they hear. Others have "hard" ears&mdash;they do not take any word easily. These are all flaws in our character, and they must all be removed. The circumcision in Colossians 2 refers to the cutting away of these things. A man who is truly dealt with by the cross may not be completely void of peculiarities, but his peculiarities surface only occasionally.</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with Attitudes</h2><p>A worker must not only deal with his character, but must deal with his attitudes also. Not only are his ordinary and obvious conduct and attitude noticeable to others, but his body movements and the gestures of his hands and feet are under others' scrutiny. Others pay attention to the way he speaks, gestures, and walks, as well as to his voice, expression, and look. One co-worker always lambasts others in his sermons because he has the habit of lambasting others. Another co-worker likes to cast side-glances at others. Although his eyes are perfectly normal, he has developed a habit of casting side-glances at people, which he subconsciously exhibits in his public speakings and private talks. We the co-workers cannot give room to criticism in these areas. We should not become a conversation piece, and we should not draw attention away from our message to our peculiarities. Another co-worker always points his fingers at others. This is also an offensive characteristic. If a man has picked up some improprieties in his daily life, these improprieties will show up in his messages. These undesirable characteristics must first be dealt with in a clear way in our daily lives.</p><p>A handsome face may be something that one receives from God, but the expressions that are on the face are a direct product of the person's character which developed after birth. If a man is always happy, he will have a joyful expression on his face all the time. However, if a man always argues with others, he will always have an unhappy face. A man cannot make himself look beautiful or ugly, but the expressions on his face are very much related to his living and character. He can pick up certain expressions, and he can also get rid of these expressions. Of course, my purpose for saying these things is so that you will pay attention to spiritual things. It is not for the purpose of paying more attention to grooming yourself or adjusting your facial expressions.</p><p>A brother in Shanghai had a fierce look when he first came to Shanghai. I tried to get to know him and found out that he had a bad temper. However, his complexion changed after a few years. He became a soft person, and his character changed. A man's facial expression is a reflection of the person himself. One's inward character is often manifested through his facial expressions. Several times Miss Barber seemed to be speaking like a fortune-teller about certain brothers. Eventually, we found out that what she said was exactly what had happened. For example, a brother once took shelter in a Buddhist temple for a night. When Miss Barber saw this brother, she said that darkness was written all over his face. He must have been exposed to the power of darkness. Later someone asked him, and he confessed to Miss Barber's words. Sometimes I can tell a person's condition from his appearance. (I am not saying that I can predict.) A person's facial expressions are very much related to his inward condition.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> </body></html>
