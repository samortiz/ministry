   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>That churches are the local expression of the Body of Christ is an established fact, so we need not go into that here; but some explanation is called for regarding the gifted ministers whom God has set in the Church as the expression of the ministry of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul is clearly dealing with the question of Christian service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He likens the workers to different members of a body, and shows that each member has its specific use, and all serve the body as belonging to it, not as distinct from it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 27 he writes, "Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually"; and in the following verse he says, "And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A study of these two verses makes it clear that the gifted ministers of verse 28 are the members of verse 27, and that the Church of verse 28 is the Body of verse 27; therefore, what ministers are to the Church, members are to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They hold their position in the Body on account of their functions the "hearing" and "smelling" of verse 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The gifted ministers are the functioning members of the Body, and all their operations are as members.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are to the Church what hands, feet, mouth, and head are to the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's servants do not minister to the Church as apart from it, but as its members.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are in the Body, serving it by the use of those faculties which they, as members, possess.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A church in any locality is an expression of the one life of the Body, while its ministers are the expression of the difference and yet oneness of its ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 12 deals with the subject of the Body of Christ, not in its life aspect but in its work aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The whole chapter is taken up with the question of ministry, and that ministry is spoken of as the functioning of the different members, from which it is evident that in the thought of God all ministry is on Body ground.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ministry is the practical expression of the Body, an expression of the diversity in unity of its various members.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we see that when the life aspect of the Body of Christ is expressed, there you have a local church; and when the work aspect is expressed, there you have a manifestation of the gifts God has given to His Church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In reading 1 Corinthians 12:28 one cannot but be arrested by the striking difference between the description of the first three gifts and the remaining five.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul, under the inspiration of the Spirit, takes special care in enumerating them "first apostles, second prophets, third teachers."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first three are specifically numbered, but not the rest; and they are quite distinct in their nature as well as in their numbering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are men; the rest are things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The three first-named gifts of the Lord to His Church apostles, prophets, and teachers stand apart from all the others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are ministers of God's Word, and their function, to edify the Body of Christ, is the most important function in the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are the representatives of the ministry of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The only scriptural record of the sending forth of apostles is found in Acts 13, and there we see that it is the prophets and teachers who set them apart for their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Scripture provides no precedent for the separation and sending forth of men by one or more individuals, or by any mission or organization; even the sending out of workers by a local church is a thing unknown in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The only example provided us there is the separating and sending forth of apostles by the prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the significance of this?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Antioch the prophets and teachers were chosen of God to separate Barnabas and Saul for His service, because they were the ministering members of the church, and this separation of the apostles was a question of ministry rather than of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Had it related to life, and not specifically to service, then it would have been the concern of the whole local church, not merely of its ministering members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But let it be noted that, though Barnabas and Saul were not separated for the work by the entire church, they were sent out not as representatives of a few select members, but as representatives of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their being separated by the prophets and teachers implied that they did not go out on individualistic lines, or on the basis of any organization, but on the ground of the ministry of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The emphasis, as we have seen, was on ministry, not on life, but it was a ministry representing the whole church, not representing any particular section of it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is clearly expressed by the laying on of hands.</S>
