   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S SOWING HIMSELF INTO PETER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When was Peter saved?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a difficult question to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Was Peter saved when he was called in chapter one of Mark?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you say that he was not saved then, I would ask, How could Peter have been called without being saved?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible reveals that once we are called, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if we say that Peter was saved when he was called in Mark 1, we may wonder why he did not show any signs of being a saved one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peter was selfish and natural.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was always in himself, not giving any indication that he had been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps Peter was saved when his mother-in-law was healed, or when he declared that Jesus is the Christ, or when he saw the Lord Jesus transfigured on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in none of these situations does Peter give any indication of being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter told the Lord Jesus that even if the others would deny Him, he would never deny Him 14:29, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This might be a sign that Peter was saved by that time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, soon afterward Peter denied the Lord Jesus three times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then he went out and wept 14:72 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps that was when he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It certainly is difficult to determine the time Peter was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From chapter one of Mark until the time the Lord Jesus in resurrection came to the disciples, breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 was a long time of sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I believe that the Lord s sowing of Himself into Peter began in Mark 1 when the Lord called him and he followed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sowing continued until the resurrected Christ breathed on the disciples who had come together in a closed room.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I believe that the Lord s sowing was complete at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One proof of this is that in chapter one of Acts Peter is a different person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No longer is he natural.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Acts 1 Peter truly bears the signs of having been saved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My point here is that the Lord Jesus as the Sower went through a lengthy process to sow Himself into Peter and the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In your experience has it not taken the Lord time to sow Himself into you?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In asking this question I am not referring to salvation, regeneration, justification, or reconciliation in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am speaking concerning our enjoyment of God s salvation experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some may think that for the Lord to take three and a half years to accomplish the sowing of Himself into Peter was too long.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, to the Lord this is not long at all, for to Him a thousand years are as one day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead of emphasizing the Lord s teaching and training of the disciples, the Gospel of Mark gives us a clear view of how the Lord was doing the work of sowing Himself into them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From chapter one through chapter sixteen the Lord was sowing the seed into the earth of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He even brought this earth with Him wherever He went, all the while sowing Himself into it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CHRIST IN US</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The crucial point is that God s New Testament economy is not a matter of improving our culture, religion, ethics, morality, character, or philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Neither is the New Testament economy of God merely a matter of helping us to improve in being more scriptural, spiritual, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God s New Testament economy is to sow Himself into us so that we may live a life according to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Is it merely a doctrine to you that God in His economy is sowing a wonderful Person, Jesus Christ the Son of God, into you?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is the Lord not a real and living Person within you?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some Christians oppose the fact that Jesus Christ actually dwells in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They claim that He is in the heavens and is represented in us by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But from the Word of God and our experience we know that Jesus Christ is not only in the heavens but is also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He dwells in us as the life that lives according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
