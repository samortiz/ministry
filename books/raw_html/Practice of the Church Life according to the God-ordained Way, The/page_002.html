<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PREREQUISITE OF<br>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE<br>ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:4b; Eph. 3:16-19, 8-9; 1:23, 4, 5, 11, 13, 14, 22; 4:3-6; Col. 1:15-19; 3:4a; Acts 9:31; 14:23; John 17:11, 22-23; Matt. 16:16-18; Eph. 5:25-27; Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10; 1 Cor. 1:13</H1><P>Prophesying, in the sense of speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord, is very high. Most Christians today are not qualified to touch the matter of prophesying. The church is built up by means of gospel preaching, the teaching of the Bible, prophesying, and many other things, but according to an objective view of the New Testament, the highest of these things is prophesying.</P><P>Many Christians hold the concept that to prophesy is to predict. However, to understand a word such as prophesy in the Bible, it is helpful and even necessary to consult the writings of those who have studied the Bible over the past twenty centuries. If we attempt to read the Bible without the help of others' writings, we may not see the light concerning the divine revelation in the Bible. Concerning the matter of prophesying, in his expanded translation of 1 Corinthians 14, Kenneth Wuest, a highly regarded student of the Bible, rendered the Greek word for prophesy as "impart to others the divine revelations." Thus, Wuest said that to prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is not to predict but to impart the divine revelation to others.</P><P>To reach the high standard of prophesying unveiled in the Bible, there is a prerequisite, a condition that must be fulfilled first. This is similar to the requirement that a person finish high school before he can be admitted to a university. In this message we will consider four items as a prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way. Without the fulfilling of these four items there is no possibility to have the genuine prophesying among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TO SEE THE ECONOMY OF GOD</H2><P>The first item of this prerequisite is that we must see the economy of God (1 Tim. 1:4b). Although the economy of God is mentioned clearly and strongly in the Bible, many Christians do not know anything concerning God's economy. In 1 Corinthians 9:17 and Ephesians 1:10, the King James Version renders the Greek word oikonomia as dispensation. Although this rendering is not wrong, the proper significance and denotation of the word dispensation has been lost in the English language. Among Christians this word is generally understood to refer to an age, or a period of time in which God deals with man according to a certain principle. Thus, it is difficult for any reader of the Bible to understand the correct meaning of the word oikonomia.</P><P>The Greek word oikonomia means household law and denotes a household management, a household administration, a household government, and, derivatively, a dispensation, a plan, or an economy for administration (distribution). The economy of God is God's household economy, His household administration, which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church (1 Tim. 3:15), the Body of Christ. In speaking of the dispensing in God's economy, I prefer to use the gerund dispensing rather than the noun dispensation, because the latter is somewhat ambiguous. When we speak of God's dispensing of Himself, the meaning is clear, but if we speak of God's dispensation, the meaning is obscure.</P>
