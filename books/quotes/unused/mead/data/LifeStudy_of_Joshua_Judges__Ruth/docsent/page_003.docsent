   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This typifies the believers practical experience of the riches of the blessings in Christ as revealed in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Israel s Crossing of the River Jordan</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Israel s crossing of the river Jordan typifies the believers experience of the death of Christ Rom 6:3-4a; Col 2:20 , not the believers physical death.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Israel s Entering into the Good Land</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Israel s entering into the good land typifies the believers experience of taking over the heavenlies, where Satan and his power of darkness are Eph 2:6; 6:12 , not the believers going to heaven after their death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is all related to Israel s possessing and enjoying the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>B. The Scarlet Thread</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Israel s taking possession of the good land was in the line of bringing forth Christ by gaining two females Rahab and Ruth These two women play a crucial part in the bringing in of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rahab as the mother of Boaz became one of the ancestors of Christ Josh 2:1-21; 6:22-25; Matt 1:5a .</S>
