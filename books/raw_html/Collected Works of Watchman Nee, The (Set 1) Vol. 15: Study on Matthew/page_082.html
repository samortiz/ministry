<P>Verse 9:"And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens." The word "father" here does not refer to the father in a family but to a father in the church, one who is in authority, such as the "fathers" in Catholicism. (The following "Father...who is in the heavens" proves that the "father" here denotes a religious father.) Unfortunately, by the second century the church fathers had come into being in the church; these were actually the disciples of the apostles.</P><P>Verse 10:"Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ." An instructor is less honorable than a rabbi; it refers to a religious person. To be called a rabbi is a great thing, and one should never accept such a title. The Lord has ordained that we call one another brothers and sisters.</P><P>Verse 11:"And the greatest among you shall be your servant." This is the second time the Lord mentioned this matter (see Matt. 20:26-27). The principle here is most important. To be genuinely great does not depend on fame, position, or title; it depends only on whether one can work and serve.</P><P>Verse 12:"And he who will exalt himself shall be humbled, and he who will humble himself shall be exalted." This is the way of the cross. To humble oneself is a self-initiated humbling. A person does not need to wait until he is despised by others; he should be without vainglory in himself.</P><P>Matthew 23:13-33 mentions seven woes. (Verse 14 is found only in some ancient manuscripts and does not have sufficient support from the authorities.) The first through fourth woes belong to one category, and the fifth through seventh woes belong to another category.</P><P>Verse 13:"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you close off the kingdom of the heavens in the face of men; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to enter." The Lord said woe only to the scribes and Pharisees. He did not say woe to the sinners, the harlots, the tax collectors, the Sadducees (the modernists), and the Herodians (traitors). This is because the woe of the latter group of people is obvious; even the women and the young ones all know it, and it is not worth describing. However, the Pharisees and scribes were like the respectable ones in the church; people think that they should receive a reward and a blessing. Hence, the Lord specifically exposed their real condition. "You close off the kingdom of the heavens." The kingdom of the heavens refers to a spiritual realm; it signifies the genuine church on the earth, the corporate entity that loves the Lord directly. The Pharisees and scribes prevented people from believing in Jesus; their unrighteousness stumbled others, and their erroneous teachings caused others to fall.</P><P>Verse 15:"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go about the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves." They proselytized Gentiles to Judaism. They zealously preached and declared that the Gentiles who worshipped idols would perish, and that they ought to worship the only true God, who created the heavens and the earth. After these Gentiles entered into Judaism and became proselytes, the Pharisees and scribes could not nurture them, nor could they testify anything to them. Instead, they brought in their original wickedness in addition to the wickedness of the Pharisees. Therefore, they became "twice as much a son of Gehenna."</P><P>Verses 16-17:"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound. Fools and blind men, which is greater, the gold or the temple which sanctifies the gold?" These were the laws they added, that is, that the gold is greater than the temple. The reason they prized gold as greater was because gold is valuable.</P><P>Verses 18-19:"And, Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift which is upon it, he is bound. Blind men, which is greater, the gift or the altar which sanctifies the gift?" The Pharisees considered the gift as greater than the altar because they were for the gift. However, the Lord said that the temple and the altar were greater because they sanctified the gold and the gift. Here the Lord shows us the teaching related to sanctification. To be sanctified is not to uproot the root of sin, as in pulling out a painful tooth. Otherwise, what would both the gold and the gift pull out? To be sanctified means to be separated. There are gold and gifts everywhere, but those that are separated unto God are sanctified, and no one can touch them. It is the same with the sanctification of the believers; to be sanctified is to be separated from among men. There are two sanctifications, which are typified by the temple and the altar. The temple typifies Christ (Matt. 12:6; John 2:21), and the gold in the temple typifies our abiding in Christ. The altar typifies consecration, the consecration after being saved, which is to be separated for the Lord's use.</P><P>Verses 20-22:"Therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by all the things upon it; and he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it; and he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it." These verses point out how their laws were hypocritical and without foundation.</P><P>Verses 23-24:"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you give a tenth of the mint and the anise and the cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the lawâ€”justice and mercy and faithfulness. But these you should have done and not neglected the others. Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but swallow the camel!"</P><P>The following three woes speak of their living. They kept the ordinance of the law in vain and had no heart to walk in justice, mercy, and faithfulness. They would strain out the smallest gnat from their food, but would swallow a camel without feeling anything.</P>
