   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEADING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE PRACTICAL BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The brothers have expressed a desire to lead the church into the practical building and to send workers to propagate overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I wish to fellowship some practical steps concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am burdened to spend several weeks to help the churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During this time we may focus on perfecting the saints responsible for the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the larger localities we need to perfect the saints and focus on the practice of building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During a recent elders meeting some elders suggested that we use this time to have a life-study of the books of the Prophets in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though I want to study these books, I feel we should focus on the practice of building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have considered the building up of the church, and I hope to learn something during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In particular, I want to learn how to administrate a large local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before I went overseas, I said to the brothers that I wanted to see how the Brethren administrate the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While we were overseas, we contacted the Brethren several times but did not receive much help from them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The closed Brethren continue to be closed, and the open Brethren are so open that they want their young people to study in seminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Sparks was also discouraged by the present condition of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even some brothers in America said that they visited the Brethren, and their meetings are desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, since we clearly see the building, we have to spend time to find a practical way to have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>EXPECTING SOME TO PROPAGATE OVERSEAS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the fellowship in the last two meetings and from fellowship with some of the saints, I have the assurance that some brothers and sisters have a burden to go overseas for the propagation and that we need to strengthen the testimony here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The testimony here is not to make a display of ourselves but to have a place with a strong testimony so that we can render help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then saints from different places abroad can come and stay for some time to obtain practical help.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can also call a large meeting for saints from different places to come and participate, and we can have a time of training.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe that this will render much help.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The service the Lord is leading us into is not something that we can put in writing and send out in printed form for other believers to read and understand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Printed messages cannot meet this need.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are many skills for us to learn in our service, even if we do not feel that this is our need.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is difficult to understand something that is described only in printed material.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to receive the proper knowledge, it is best to see a practical demonstration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In secular terms, we need to send people out as technical personnel, who can live in a place for two to three years to help the local church there and then move to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The technical personnel go out to instruct people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church here also needs to serve as a factory where believers can come to learn and to do an internship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In principle, this should be our future situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should send saints out, and saints can come here to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not know where we should go or how many believers should be in the city we go to.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These matters depend on the burden that the brothers receive from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not expect anyone to push us if we do not have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not expect me to motivate you to carry out a work for which you have no feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to see a vision and receive a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we should devote ourselves wholeheartedly to our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do this, we can receive help and be motivated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must respond before someone can help us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Where we should go depends on the burden that we receive from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It may be of the Lord that many places overseas are waiting for help from Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Japan and different places in Southeast Asia are expecting helpers to come from Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The door is wide open.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the brothers have the burden to learn some lessons and to receive a burden to labor in these places, we will receive the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as we go and labor, God s blessing will be upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course, wherever we go to labor will not be as convenient as here.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is our home where everything is convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we go abroad, we will need to learn many things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We will need to learn the lesson of faith to take risks, to meet different needs, and to deal with different problems.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In all of this we should trust that the Lord s grace is sufficient and that His blessing will overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should also consider how to give practical help to the saints who visit us from overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not try to do something too large.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have been reluctant to have a training on how to practically carry out the building, because of the practical arrangements that need to be made.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We do not want the training to be formal and lack flexibility.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, because the procedure for entry into Taiwan is complicated, a large number of people cannot come at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are willing to conduct a large training and the entry procedure into Taiwan is relaxed, we might be able to have a training in the fall of next year.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>More saints will be able to come at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I believe that the Lord is leading us to have some saints go out and is leading others to come here to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way the Lord will have a practical way to propagate among us.</S>
