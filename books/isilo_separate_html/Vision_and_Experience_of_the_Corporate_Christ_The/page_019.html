Living Stones for God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>From his days as a young disciple, Peter never forgot that he was a stone or that Christ was the rock on which the church is built. Hence, when Peter had grown old, he wrote in his first Epistle, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; (2:4-5). We are living stones not for exhibition but to be built up as a spiritual house. There is no need for us to wait for the next age; God&rsquo;s house is being built on earth in this age.</p>
<p>People today often speak about serving God. Verse 5 reveals that the real service, the service God desires, is not something separate from the building. Service needs to be based upon the building. We first need to be built together; then we can serve.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Building in Paul&rsquo;s Writings</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Growth in Life for Transformation<br />
into Precious Materials for God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>Paul also wrote concerning the building. In 1 Corinthians he wrote that he fed the saints (3:2). He also wrote, &ldquo;We...were all given to drink one Spirit&rdquo; (12:13). We need to eat of Jesus and drink the Spirit for our spiritual growth. Growth brings in transformation, and transformation prepares the proper materials for building. Thus, in 3:9 Paul wrote, &ldquo;You are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s farm is for growth, and God&rsquo;s building comes out of the growth of God&rsquo;s farm. We all need to eat and drink that we may grow and be transformed, and then the building will be realized.</p>
<p>There is an apparent disconnect in the thought in 1 Corinthians 3:9. A farm is for growing plants, but a building is built with stones. Spiritually speaking, plant materials, such as wood, grass, and stubble, are not suitable for God&rsquo;s building (v. 12). Although we are plants on God&rsquo;s farm, we are becoming precious stones through the process of petrification. When we allow the water of life to flow through us, this water brings in all the divine, heavenly minerals, which are all that God is. The flow of the divine life brings the divine element into us and discharges our old element. In this way we are transformed from plants into precious stones. Today we are plants, but we are in the process of petrification. We are growing as plants on God&rsquo;s farm to be transformed into the precious stones for the building.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Taking Heed How We Build<br />
upon the Foundation of Christ</h2>
<p>Paul spoke strongly concerning the building. &ldquo;According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each man take heed how he builds upon it. For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one&rsquo;s work, of what sort it is&rdquo; (vv. 10-13). We must not add wood, grass, or stubble to God&rsquo;s precious building. In the New Jerusalem there will be nothing natural, only precious materials.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ Being the Foundation Stone, the Cornerstone,and the Topstone of God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 2:20 Paul wrote that Christ is both the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets and the cornerstone of the building. The cornerstone is placed to join two walls of a building. The Jewish believers and the Gentile believers represent different walls in God&rsquo;s building, and Christ stands as the connecting cornerstone. The foundation stone lies horizontally to support the whole building, and the cornerstone stands vertically to connect the walls of the building. In Zechariah 4:7 Christ is also revealed as the topstone to cover God&rsquo;s building. The foundation stone supports the building, the cornerstone connects the building, and the topstone completes the building. Christ is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone of God&rsquo;s building, and we are precious stones to be built into this building.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
