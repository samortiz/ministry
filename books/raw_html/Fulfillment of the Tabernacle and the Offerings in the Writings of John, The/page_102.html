<h2 class=head2>A Change of Dispensation</h2><p>Some may think that because a sheepfold is something prepared by God we should remain there. They may point to chapter ten of the Gospel of John and ask, “Wasn’t the Old Testament sheepfold established by God? Certainly God established this fold. Why, then, didn’t the Lord Jesus leave His sheep in the fold?” The reason the Lord Jesus did not leave the sheep in the sheepfold was that the age, the dispensation, had been changed. During the time of the Old Testament, it was right for the sheep to remain in the fold. But the sheep should no longer stay there.<h2 class=head2>Religious Leaders Not Recognizing the Lord</h2><p>There are many religious things in the sheepfold. In the fold people may have the Scriptures, and in name they may also have God. But when the Son of God came, those in the Old Testament sheepfold did not recognize Him or receive Him, but rather rejected Him. The principle is the same with the sheepfolds that have been established after the Lord Jesus came. Those in today’s sheepfolds may talk about serving Christ, but some of them might not recognize Him if He appeared in their midst.<p>The religious leaders in the Old Testament sheepfold had strong religious teachings concerning Christ, the Messiah. But when Christ actually came, those religionists, who supposedly were for the Messiah, did not recognize Him. Instead of receiving Him, they rejected Him. This made it necessary for the Lord to be the door for His sheep to go out of the sheepfold. Through Him the sheep came out of the fold, not to enter another fold but to be His flock. In 10:16 the Lord Jesus said, “And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.”<h2 class=head2>The Difference between the Fold and the Flock</h2><p>A fold is a religious organization, and the one flock is the church. Because some Christians have not been clear concerning this distinction, they use the word “fold” when they should use the word “flock.” For example, a certain gospel song speaks of the “wondrous grace that brought me to the fold.” Actually, the Lord’s grace does not bring us into a fold. On the contrary, by grace the Lord brings us out of the fold into the flock. To be brought into a fold is to be brought into darkness. Grace does not bring us into darkness—grace always brings us into light. The church life is in the light, not in darkness. In the church life we are in the pasture under Christ as our sunshine. Now in the pasture and in the daylight, we enjoy Christ as life in every way.<h2 class=head2>Freedom from Legality</h2><p>The door in John 10 also signifies freedom. In Christ we have the freedom to go in and out. This means that we do not have any legality. The freedom we enjoy is Christ as our life-giver. Because Christ is our freedom, our door, nothing can bind us. We are not bound by any legality. This does not mean, of course, that we are free to indulge the flesh (Gal. 5:13). The point here is that in the church life we are in a condition where we are not in bondage to legality. Because Christ is our door, we have true freedom, and we are not bound by anything legal.
