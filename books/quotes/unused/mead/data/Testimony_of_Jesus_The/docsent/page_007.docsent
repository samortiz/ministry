   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING ONE IN THE GLORY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE EXPRESSION OF THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 17:22 says, The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out, glory is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jesus seemed to be saying, Father, You have given Me the life, the right, and the position to be Your Son in order to express You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now I have given this glory to all My believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They also have Your divine life, nature, right, and position to express You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that we are one in the divine expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are here not expressing a certain doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are here glorifying, expressing, God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not stand for baptism, the presbytery, or even justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We receive justification by faith, and we practice baptism and the presbytery, but we are not standing for any of these.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are standing only for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our glory is not justification by faith, baptism by immersion, or the presbytery; our glory is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have the Son s glory, and in this glory, this glorious expression of God the Father, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is unique, His expression is unique, and His glory is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we are unique in His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the contrary, if we are for the presbytery, the charismatic gifts, baptism, or justification by faith, we are divided.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must all be for one unique expression, which is the glory of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BEING PERFECTED INTO ONE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BY OUR GROWTH IN LIFE UNTO MATURITY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 23 continues, I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be perfected into one is a matter of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may stand as one, but many of us are short of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that we are one but not yet perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Someone may say, I care for the church life, but I am not happy with that certain brother.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To feel this way indicates that we are not perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are short of growth, and we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 4:13 says, Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way to arrive at the practical oneness is by the growth unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though we are in the church life, we may still murmur Phil 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, in the New Jerusalem there will no longer be any murmuring, because at that time John 17:23 will be fully answered and fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to be one, we must have the one goal to express God the Father, and we must have the growth so that we may be perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have the divine nature for our oneness, the glorious goal of our oneness, and growth unto maturity for the perfection of our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is what we need, not a certain doctrine or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we all have the divine nature within us, we have the one goal to glorify God, and we are all growing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, if we hear a young one, new one, or weak one complaining or murmuring, we should not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a family, some little ones are still in diapers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not bothered by them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We simply clean them up, change their diaper, and let them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every mother has the full assurance that after a few years the little ones will be out of diapers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s family is a nursery with many little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is wonderful, and we like to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not despise the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is a family, not an army or a school.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a school all the students should be a certain age, but the church is an all-inclusive family.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, we should not despise the older generation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need the grandfathers, and we must love them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have more experience, and they can give good advice.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to honor, respect, and praise the Lord for the older generation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It would be good to see many generations in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A family is not a fighting army.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the church must still be vigilant.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To this end, we need the young people to fight the battle, just as a nation needs young soldiers for its defense.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to respect the old ones, but we also need to raise up the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Otherwise, we can have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why 1 John 2:12-14 speaks of fathers, young men, and little children.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the proper, all-inclusive church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we practice the church life in this way, there will be no divisions among us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All of the above is according to John s mending ministry for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul s writings contain many teachings, although, strictly speaking, he was not for those things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>John, however, does not speak in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He brings us back to God Himself, as in John 17:21: That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He brings us back to the Triune God as our life and nature, our goal, and our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today we have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now we must all be one to practice the church.</S>
