   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE ONE A WORD OF INTRODUCTION 1 Scripture Reading: Isa 42:1-4, 6-7; 49:5-7; 50:4-7; 52:13 53:12; Mark 10:45</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With this message we begin the Life-study of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mark is not as profound as the Gospel of John, and it does not contain as many teachings as are found in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some readers of the New Testament may think of Mark as the Galilee of the four Gospels, and some may wonder what good can come out of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the Lord Jesus came from Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE LORD S MOVE IN GALILEE AND JUDEA</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Gospel of John is mainly a record of the Lord s move in Judea and of His profound words spoken there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mark, on the contrary, is a record mainly of the Lord s ministry in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mark does not record much of the Lord s move or teaching in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we would have a history of the Lord s life and ministry on earth, we need to learn how to put together the Gospels of John and Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When these Gospels are put together, we can see the Lord s move in the regions of Galilee and Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Judea was a highly respected province, and the city of Jerusalem was located there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the province of Galilee was looked down upon and despised.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord s move in Galilee covered a longer period of time than His move in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to see that the record in the Gospel of Mark is a record primarily of the Lord s move not in Judea but in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the first chapter of the Gospel of John we have a record of profound matters related to Christ s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 1 and 14 reveal that in the beginning was the Word, that the Word was with God and was God, and that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to John 1:14, the disciples also saw the Lord s glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the first chapter of his Gospel John goes on to say that the law was given through Moses, but grace and reality came through Jesus Christ v. 17 . In verse 18 John says, No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, John tells us that in the Word was life, and the life was the light of men v. 4 . All these matters are very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In contrast to the profound matters revealed in the Gospel of John, in Mark s Gospel we see the Lord as the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Gospel of Mark we do not have the God-Savior, as in John, the King-Savior, as in Matthew, or the Man-Savior, as in Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Gospel of Mark presents a particular aspect of Christ, the aspect of the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John we have God; in Matthew, the King; in Luke, the Man; and in Mark, the Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We would hardly expect to hear excellent, profound, marvelous things about a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a sense in which it is not easy to speak on the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Life-study of James we emphasized the contrast between the writings of Paul and the book of James.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The writings of Paul are on a much higher level than those of James.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul s writings are on a divine level, on God s level, and reveal the divine dispensing for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, in the Epistles of Paul we have a revelation of the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The book of James is on a much lower level.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whereas Paul s writings are on a divine level, the book of James is on a human level and emphasizes practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In his Epistle James deals with matters of godliness and character.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The differences between the Epistle of James and the Epistles of Paul are actually very great.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How could we compare something on the human level with something on the divine level?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can we compare practical Christian perfection with the divine economy, or compare living ethically with living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we would know the meaning of practical Christian perfection, we need to come to the Epistle of James.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Concerning Christian perfection, nothing is better than the book of James.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consider, for example, what James says concerning wisdom: But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, forbearing, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, unfeigned James 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>James also says, The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace v. 18 . This teaching certainly is much higher than that of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Concerning Christian perfection and human ethics, the book of James is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this regard we all need to respect James.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nevertheless, no matter how excellent James writing may be regarding Christian perfection, he remains on the human level, and the human level cannot compare to the divine level.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To a certain extent we may use the contrast of the levels of the writings of Paul and James as an illustration of the contrast between Mark and the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How, for instance, can we compare a slave with God?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, how can we compare a slave with a king?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Apparently, the Gospel of Mark is on a much lower level than that of John, Matthew, and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As recorded in John s Gospel, the Lord says such profound things as I am the life 14:6 , I am the light of the world 8:12 , and I am the resurrection 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such words cannot be found in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, in the Gospel of Mark we have the excellent record of a wonderful Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Gospel of Mark we have something that cannot be found in John, Matthew, or Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus is wonderful and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even His name is called Wonderful Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord is wonderful not only in His divinity but also in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Where do we see a portrait of the humanity of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is correct to say that the Gospel of Luke emphasizes the Lord s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In his Gospel Luke presents the Lord as a normal man, as a man fully up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With such a man we see human virtue, excellence, and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, not even all this can compare with the aspect of the Lord s humanity seen in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Mark we see a beautiful expression of Christ s virtues in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe that more of the Lord s excellent virtues in His humanity are seen in the Gospel of Mark than in the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only one of the four Gospels the Gospel of John is on the Lord s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The other three Gospels, called the synoptic Gospels, are on the Lord s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The word synoptic indicates that the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke all have the same view, the view of the Lord s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In these three Gospels we see different aspects of Christ in His humanity: the Lord s humanity in being the King Matthew , the Lord s humanity in being a man who is up to standard Luke , and the Lord s humanity in being a Slave Mark .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Suppose the President of the United States, after completing his term of office, would serve as a janitor.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After being President, he would willingly lower himself to become a janitor to serve others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Would this not be excellent?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The excellency of such a man in his presidency could not compare with the excellency in his becoming a janitor.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I believe that most citizens would appreciate him more in his being a janitor than in his being a President.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>With him as a President we would not see as much of the beauty of his humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But if he would become a janitor to serve others, we would see the beauty, the virtue, in his humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>How beautiful for a person, after occupying the high office of President of the United States, to become a janitor!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I doubt that any of us would feel comfortable in the presence of a President, but we would all feel comfortable with a janitor.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How excellent it would be to see a former President working as a janitor, for we would see in him excellent human virtue!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Which kind of person do you prefer a President or a janitor?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I would rather be with a janitor than with a President.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the President were to invite me to spend the night at the White House, I would not feel at home.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But if a former President were to become a janitor and invite me into his home for the night, I would feel very comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I use the illustration of a President becoming a janitor to help us see the position of the Gospel of Mark in relation to the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the Gospel of Matthew we see the Lord Jesus in His kingship, but in the Gospel of Mark we see the Lord in His slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Which do you prefer the Lord as a King or the Lord as a Slave?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do you prefer a King-Jesus or a Slave-Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Naturally, we may be inclined to appreciate the Lord as a King more than as a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But we all need to appreciate the Lord as the Slave-Savior revealed in Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we appreciate the Lord in this way, then we shall understand the value of the book of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the Gospel of Mark we have a vivid record of the Lord s humanity as a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The last chapters of Mark are especially long and detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The reason is that Mark s purpose is to provide a detailed record to show the beauty of the Lord as a Slave in His human virtues.</S>
