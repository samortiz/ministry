   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brother Nee testified that he received much help from Sister M.E.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Barber, who rebuked him often.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She was very deep in the Lord and had especially learned the lesson of the subjective cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She learned the lesson of bearing the cross, and she learned the lesson of praying and of living in the light of the Lord's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, her shortcoming was in the matter of frankness and rebuking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although she was in China for many years, only one person, Watchman Nee, was raised up through her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Brother Nee, there were over twenty young people under her care, but eventually nearly all left.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only Brother Nee continued to return to her to be rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The problems in a church are often related to the elders, and most of the problems related to the elders arise from the elders' negative spirit, attitude, and tone toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is very difficult not to have a negative spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our spirit, attitude, tone, and gesture may all offend people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the elders should be grave, having a weightiness that inspires and invites honor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This depends upon their spirit, attitude, tone, and gesture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even our listening to people without responding to them properly may offend them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The elders should learn the proper way to listen to others and to respond to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not responding properly to people comes from a negative spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The elders must be happy persons with a joyful spirit, always humble, mild, and easy to contact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one on earth is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone needs the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, regardless of what someone says, the elders should not be bothered by that person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They must realize that this person needs the Lord, and they must be happy with him and try to give him an "injection" of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is to dispense Christ into this person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An elder must be full of discernment; he should not be foolish or dull.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, he should discern without criticizing, despising, and judging.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He must have a keen feeling about others, but he should not criticize or despise them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is wrong to have a despising attitude toward someone because we know him well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if an elder knows others' shortcomings, he must not criticize, despise, or judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The elder himself also has shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this sense, he is the same as the others; it is simply a matter of degree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders should realize that they have their own mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They have to turn their eyes upon themselves and consider themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are not qualified to condemn or judge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, by their appointment, the elders have been put into a position in which it is easy to criticize, despise, and judge, and because they are in such a position, it is easy for others to criticize them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These are the snares, the traps, which Satan has set around the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Almost no elder can escape these traps.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult to be an elder in a local church for several years without being trapped by these snares.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The elders should contact people in a way that is full of love, concern, and sympathy in a meek and humble spirit Gal 6:1 , not in a way to convince, to catch, to arrest, but to recover, to bring people back to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their contact should be with the full realization that what the people need is the Lord and what can solve the people's problems is to meet with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In their contact with others, they should avoid a superiority complex, argument, offense, or any form of humiliation, always remembering well that the church is neither a police station nor a law court, and that we are neither the policemen nor the judges.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>MINISTERING CHRIST TO MEET THE NEED</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>OF EVERY KIND OF PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In their contact with people, the elders should minister Christ to meet the need of every kind of person Eph 3:8; Col 1:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They must seek a way to get people to open to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They must also find the proper utterance to touch people's spirit and catch the proper time to dispense Christ, either with a quotation from the Bible or a word of their inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lastly, they must stir up people's hunger and thirst to seek the Lord by praying with them John 4:15 .</S>
