   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A NECESSARY CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that there is a certain requirement or condition for being found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This condition is that we do not have our own righteousness which is of the law, but that we have the righteousness which is of God based on faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It may seem to us at times that we are found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, there will be no reality in these times unless we fulfill the condition of having the righteousness of God through the faith of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To repeat, we need to be found in Christ in the righteousness of God through the faith of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The phrase in the righteousness of God used in the title of this message points to the fact that this is the condition of being found in Christ in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the crucial aspect of the condition is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AND OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At this point I would like to present a new definition, or interpretation, of righteousness as found in 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this verse righteousness signifies a daily living which is right with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Speaking of his past, Paul says in 3:6 that as to the righteousness which is in the law, he had become blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before he was transferred into Christ, he was a Pharisee blameless in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul thought that in his daily living he was right with man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually he was not right with God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The righteousness which signifies a living that is truly right with God and man must be a righteousness which is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The expression righteousness of God does not simply mean that righteousness belongs to God; it also means that this righteousness is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, the terms life of God, light of God, and love of God do not mean merely that life, light, and love belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The life of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same is true of the light of God and the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God Himself is light and love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In principle, this is also true of the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as the life of God and the light of God are God Himself, so the righteousness of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the living which is right with both God and man must be God as our expression in our daily living, God Himself lived out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This becomes more clear when we consider what it means to speak of our own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our own righteousness is the expression of ourselves, the expression of I. My righteousness is just the living out of me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the righteousness of God is God lived out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is God becoming our daily living and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we love others, our love is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, our humility is not mere ethical humility; it is a divine humility, God Himself living out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are to be found in Christ, we must be in such a condition that God is expressed through us and becomes our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I was young, I thought that the righteousness in verse 9 referred to the righteousness God gives us through justification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, for many years I sensed deep within that this was not the accurate meaning of righteousness here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day I realized that the righteousness of God in 3:9 is actually God Himself becoming our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would have this righteousness, we must have a living which is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must fulfill this condition in order to be found in Christ in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE FAITH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can the righteousness of God become our daily living?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This can take place only through the faith of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as the righteousness of God is God Himself, so the faith of Christ is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The faith of Christ is not simply something which belongs to Christ; it is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only through the hearing of the Word can the faith of Christ become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the Word we are infused with the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the same time, we experience the function of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The issue of this infusion and function is the faith which brings about an organic union between us and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This faith, which is really Christ Himself, causes us to be organically united with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In such an organic union we and God are one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We live, and God lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God lives, and we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not think that we are in God but God is not in us, or that God is in us but we are not in God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the contrary, there is a mutual relationship between us and God: we are in God, and God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this reason the Lord Jesus could say, Abide in Me and I in you John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By means of the organic union which joins us to the Triune God and makes us one spirit with Him, we have the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This righteousness of God definitely is not of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is altogether of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the organic union produced by faith we live out God, and God lives out from within us and becomes righteousness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we are in this righteousness, we are in the proper condition to be found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The thought here is very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if we see it, we would experience the highest aspect of God s salvation and be rescued from all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May we all aspire to gain Christ and to be found in Him in such a condition.</S>
