<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SALVATION OF JEHOVAH<br>TO HIS BELOVED PEOPLE AND THE NATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JEHOVAH THE FATHER'S COMPLAINT<br>AGAINST HIS CHILDREN ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 1:1-4, 10-15, 21-23; 3:8-9, 14-16, 18-23; 5:1-4, 7-8, 11-12, 18-20, 22-23, 24b</H1><P>The first section of the book of Isaiah (chs. 1&#151;12) covers the salvation of Jehovah to His beloved people and the nations. In this message we will consider Jehovah the Father's complaint against His children Israel, paying attention to Isaiah's account of what God said concerning them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE VISION OF ISAIAH<br>CONCERNING JUDAH AND JERUSALEM</H2><P>Isaiah 1:1 speaks of the vision which Isaiah saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. Before the time of Isaiah's ministry, the children of Israel had been divided into two nations&#151;the northern nation of Israel and the southern nation of Judah. At first, Isaiah does not give us an account of the failure of Israel but of Judah. The reason is that Judah bears more responsibility than Israel does. Therefore, God came to Isaiah with a vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JEHOVAH THE FATHER CALLING<br>THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO HEAR<br>HIS COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS CHILDREN ISRAEL</H2><P>In 1:2a Jehovah the Father called the heavens and the earth to hear His complaint against His children Israel. It was not an insignificant thing for Jehovah to do this.</P>
