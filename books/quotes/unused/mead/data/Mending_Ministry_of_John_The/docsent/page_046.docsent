   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IN THE WRITINGS OF JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those in the world do not know what is going on behind the scenes regarding God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 5 opens this view to us, but it is concealed from them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And I saw on the right hand of Him Who sits upon the throne a scroll, written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And no one in heaven nor on the earth nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it" Rev 5:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The scroll must be the new covenant, recording God's thought concerning the church, Israel, the world, and the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When no one was found worthy to open this scroll, John wept v. 4 . Then one of the elders comforted him, saying, "the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals" v. 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What John saw when he looked, however, was a Lamb, not a Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John's Gospel John the Baptist had recommended this same Lamb: "Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lamb here, however, is not concerned with redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is concerned with God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John, then, opens the view to us of the redeeming Lamb now become God's universal Administrator that His purpose might be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely God has an administration over the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Otherwise, how could His purpose be realized?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this administration the redeeming Lamb, the Redeemer, is the Administrator.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When did this scene occur, that the Lamb came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him Who sits upon the throne Rev 5:7 ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It must be right after He ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What John records here is a view, not a prophecy, of what has taken place already.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Christ ascended to the heavens, He received a book from God, thus opening the secret of the universe for the carrying out of God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How great a view of Christ John had!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes, Paul did reveal that Christ is all-inclusive, but he did not say that Christ is the universal Administrator.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why is John's ministry stronger than Paul's?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is because he came to mend what was damaged; a repair has to be doubly strong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wanted to make sure there would be no more damage regarding these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE CHURCH IN THE WRITINGS OF PAUL AND JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now let us compare what the two writers say regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul surely tells us some wonderful facts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One Who fills all in all Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is also the new man Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is also the temple of God, His habitation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John, however, adds two more items of what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Revelation 1 John shows the church as a lampstand v. 12 . What Paul reveals of the church the Body of Christ is in the realm of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Paul, why did you not tell us of the golden nature of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why did you not mention its shining function?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have spent much time with you, brother Paul, but now I must come to John.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has something further to say about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I was with you, I learned that the church is the Body, that it is the fullness, and that it is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But without John I could not have known that the church is also a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A lampstand is stronger than the Body, though both are surely precious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John also reveals the ultimate consummation of the church as the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How much greater is a city than a temple!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul presented the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When it was damaged, John presented something greater, higher, and stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How indestructible is the New Jerusalem!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How strong is the mending ministry of John!</S>
