<h2 class="head2">A Plea for Fellowship (Sheng County)</h2><p>We have recently learned something about how to discern the Body of Christ. There are many brothers who have seen the importance of serving God, consecration, and the church preaching the gospel. We were lacking in the matter of the gospel in the past. We now are preparing to learn how to testify (to outsiders). We read the Bible and pray every day, and every Lord's Day we serve the Lord in different areas. Many brothers are willing to learn from the Lord's grace. Please pray that the brothers would be able to serve God faithfully. Please introduce us to the brothers in Hangchow so that we could have fellowship with them.</p><p>Your brothers in the Lord,<br />Yin Song-sheng, Yin Zong-ming<br />August 13, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: Liban, Sheng county, Chekiang</p><p>By the Lord's arrangement, the church in Ningpo has rented a flat in a building on the 5th Floor, 14 Zhan-Chuan Street. When everything is fixed up, our meetings will move to that address. Please pray for us much before the Lord.</p><p>Chang He-nian, Wang Jian-jen<br />September 12, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 406 Hou Ma Road, Jiangbei Shore, Ningpo</p><h2 class="head2">Service at Kuling (Fukien Province)</h2><p>Thank God for arranging for some of us to be at Kuling. Although there are only five (Brother Kuo Jian-liang, Brother Cheng Chiang, Sister Hai-jen, Sister Bi-xia, and myself), we are all in one accord for the gospel and the service. Although we are weak and immature, we are willing to give our all. We are really busy with the affairs of the clinic, the school, the church, and the Ministers' House. We have no free time from morning to night, but we all thank God and are very joyful. We all go out for the gospel, and we coordinate in the church service with the local responsible brothers. There are forty to fifty people here on the mountain. Most are sick people, children, and elderly women. There are also a few brothers who did the heavy work in the Ministers' House. They now are coordinating together with us to serve God. They (voluntarily) decline wages and rejoice in serving here. We are the only ones bearing the responsibility. Please remember us often.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Zuo Fu-ru<br />September 24, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: Kuling Ministers' House, c/o Xin 14 Hai-Guan-Xiang, Foochow</p>
