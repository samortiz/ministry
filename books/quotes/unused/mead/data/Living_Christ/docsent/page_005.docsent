   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO ONLY LIVING CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 14:23; 15:5; Gal 2:19-20; 5:2, 4; 6:15 MAN LIVING BY THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's eternal plan is to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, Christ being worked into us is God coming into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis chapters one and two, it is clearly revealed that God created man for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God wanted man to be His vessel so that He Himself could enter into man to be his life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man fell because he did not receive God as life, but rather he received something else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God wanted man to receive life; instead, man received the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The tree of life is simple; it is simply life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is complicated; it includes knowledge, good, and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In man's eyes, evil is something undesirable, while both knowledge and good are much to be desired.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everyone loves to have knowledge and good.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not have knowledge, others think we are stupid, and if we are not good, others despise us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the beginning of time up to the present, the existence of the human race has been depending on these two things: knowledge and good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Immediately after you were born, you began to receive knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you were little, your parents sent you to kindergarten, and then they sent you to elementary school, high school, and college.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then just one degree was not sufficient; you had to go to graduate school to get a master's degree, and after that a Ph.D. Wearing one Ph.D. cap was not enough; you had to wear two or three more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Knowledge is what the people of the world desire and seek after today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Knowledge is their human life and their future.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who have knowledge are considered upper class, while those who do not are lower class.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The entire human society lives by knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, there is the matter of good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man must live according to morality and ethics to be a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To elaborate somewhat, this is to have kindness, love, humility, patience, gentleness, and a willingness to yield to others out of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Yielding to others out of humility" is a unique virtue of the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Western languages there is no proper translation of this phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, if there were one and a half seats here, would you sit on half a seat or on one whole seat?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In general, the Europeans and Americans do everything according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the law says that a person can have half a seat, then he would take half a seat; if the law says that a person can have a whole seat, then he would take the whole seat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever people are allowed by law, they would not give it up even to their own father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Western people do not know what it is to yield in humility; therefore, such a phrase cannot be found in their dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet yielding is a traditional virtue among the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there were one and a half seats here, a Chinese would yield not only the one seat but also the half seat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Orientals, especially the Japanese, pay much attention to yielding to others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is this good?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is truly good; this is one of the best virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In terms of virtue, the Chinese and the Japanese are on top.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Westerners know how to claim but not how to yield.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the Oriental culture is superior.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Orientals are a cultured people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, this is the goodness from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today the three things that human society pays constant attention to are knowledge, good, and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every country and every society are full of knowledge, good, and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Evil is condemned while knowledge and good are exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is human culture?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the development of knowledge and the spread of good.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In human culture there is technology, philosophy, and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Technology and philosophy spread knowledge, whereas religion promotes good and uplifts morality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In addition, the law restrains people from committing sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In China, there is an idiom, "to rope people by the law," that is, to prosecute people by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The law is like a rope, tying people up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the law restricts people.</S>
