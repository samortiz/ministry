   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN A FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE WORKING SAINTS Date:Thursday evening, February 9, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong DISPOSITION OF ITEMS OFFERED BY THE STUDENTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, let us make some arrangements concerning the things the students have handed over.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A few sisters have handed over some small jewelry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They should follow Peter's instruction and get permission from their parents before selling them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They should not be unrighteous in claiming their parents' goods as their own.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the same time, we have to realize that these things bring absolutely no profit to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot bring these things to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once they have their parents' permission, they can sell them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A young brother handed over more than two hundred books.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I advise him not to buy any more books.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems as if he has indulged himself in this habit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If he does not deal with his love for books, he will hand over what he has now, but he will buy more later.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In principle, you should pick out items that you are particularly fond of and dispose of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This may hurt a little, but it will do tremendous good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In asking you to dispose of these things, you are being tested.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You will see how much this hurts, and how deep it cuts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more pain you feel, the more reluctant you will be to give them up, but this will build up your Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In three or five years, you will have the constitution of the Holy Spirit, not just His life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The constitution of the Holy Spirit wroughts Christ into our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we become one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ as our life is the basis of the Spirit's constitution; it enables Christ to live within us on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The constitution of the Holy Spirit is the maturity of this process; it enables Christ's disposition to become our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This constitution work is like embroidery; it embroiders Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There may be pain, but Christ will be constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In regard to the other items, I will say a word on behalf of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is happy to return these things to you for your own use, but your feeling toward them should be different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you look at them, you should realize that they are given to you by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not use them carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A Christian must learn poverty while living on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has to learn to own nothing, to have nothing that he can call his own.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are heavenly citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On earth we are merely strangers and sojourners Heb 11:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not settle down in this place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will ask the older brothers and sisters to make proper arrangements for your schooling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I hope that the church will have a detailed arrangement of the items that have been handed over.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A FELLOWSHIP WITH THE WORKING SAINTS Not Being Involved in Pure Commerce</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every Bible student has to agree that, according to the Bible, God has no intention for a Christian to engage in commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I believe all of you are clear that the first case of commerce was with the prince of Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ezekiel 28:16 says, "By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word merchandise refers to a kind of free commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the first mention of commerce in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The last mention of commerce is with Babylon in Revelation 18.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The prince of Tyre was the beginning of profiteering through trade.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was also the beginning of transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The prince of Tyre is a type of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we come to the great Babylon, we find the peak of development in commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Babylon's origin is Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The most severe judgment from God will be brought against Babylon because it will be the consummation of aggrandizement by trade and the epitome of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Revelation 13 speaks of the mark of the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without the mark no one can trade vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, if pure commerce disappears, the mark of the beast will become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more highly developed commerce becomes, the more useful the mark of the beast will be.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One of the fifty-two lessons that we released in Kuling for new believers deals with the proper occupation God has ordained for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is an occupation in which one works with his own hands, producing and manufacturing by his own labor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It should not be a kind of pure trading.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the church does not engage in some mode of production, a Christian will not be able to find anything to do in the church, in which case he will have to go to outsiders for work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because some brothers cannot find the right occupation in the church, they are forced to engage in pure commerce in the secular business world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes they are forced to lie and cheat.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Soon their hearts become corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the future we have to do our best to help the brothers make the right choice; we have to show them the clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps some brothers should start some businesses and hire some brothers to work for them.</S>
