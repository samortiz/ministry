        <h2 class="head1">SATAN ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>With respect to the kingdom, Christ was born King of the Jews (Matt. 2:1-2; 27:11). Satan desires to usurp the kingship of Christ, and he is jealous of Christ. He used Herod, the governor of the Jews, to try to kill Christ. Under His power and sovereignty, however, God preserved Jesus from Herod&rsquo;s slaughter (2:1-23).</p>
<p>Christ was sent forth by God to preach the gospel of the kingdom, telling people to repent, for the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near (4:17). The Lord told the disciples that the nature of His heavenly kingdom is altogether different from an earthly kingdom, and He urged them to seek the heavenly kingdom (5:3, 10, 20; 7:21; 18:3-4; 6:10, 33). However, Satan hindered the disciples from understanding the heavenly nature of the kingdom, causing them to consider the Lord Jesus as only the King of an earthly kingdom; hence, the Lord could not lead the disciples to know His heavenly authority (20:21-23). Satan also stirred up the Jews to try to compel Him to be King through earthly methods (John 6:14-15), thus attempting to destroy the kingdom. Satan wanted the kingdom to lose its heavenly nature. Christ, however, perceived Satan&rsquo;s craftiness and overcame every hindrance. Christ never allowed His authority to become earthly and thus lose its heavenly nature.</p>
<p>Although Satan instigated the Jews to oppose Christ, God arranged circumstances that caused them to welcome Christ as &ldquo;He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel&rdquo; (12:13). Later, Satan instigated the Jews to bring this charge against Christ and sentence Him to death. When Pilate asked Jesus, &ldquo;You are the King of the Jews?&rdquo; (18:33), the Lord Jesus answered, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not from here&rdquo; (v. 36). This means that His kingdom is heavenly, not earthly. Then Pilate asked again, &ldquo;So then You are a king?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;You say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice&rdquo; (v. 37). This reply indicates that Christ&rsquo;s purpose in coming to the earth was to be the King of the kingdom of the heavens. However, the earthly Jews who followed Satan rejected the Lord (19:12-15). In spite of this, when the Lord Jesus was crucified, Pilate wrote a notice that said, &ldquo;JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS&rdquo; and put it on the cross (v. 19). In this way the Lord was marked as the King of the Jews.</p>
<p>Satan caused the Roman soldiers to mock Christ as the King of the Jews, because he hates that the Lord Jesus is the King of the Jews (Matt. 27:27-31). He also caused the rulers among the Jews to ridicule Christ as the King of the Jews (vv. 41-43; Mark 15:31-32; Luke 23:35). However, God used various miraculous events at the time of Christ&rsquo;s death to prove that Christ was extraordinary (Matt. 27:45-54).</p>
<p>Satan instigated the Jews to kill the Lord Jesus and reject Him as their King, but God raised Him up from the dead (Acts 5:30), gave Him all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18), and exalted Him to His right hand (Acts 2:33), making Him Lord, Christ, and Leader (v. 36; 5:31). Furthermore, God sent the Spirit to testify to the Jews through the apostles that He had raised up Jesus, whom they had killed on the cross and that He had made Jesus the Lord, Christ, and Leader (vv. 30-32; 2:32, 36). However, through Satan&rsquo;s instigation, the Jews continued to hate the Lord Jesus and refused to receive Him as their King (Luke 19:12-14). Eventually, however, God will cause the remnant of the Jews to welcome the Lord Jesus and to acknowledge Him as the King who comes in the name of the Lord (Matt. 23:39).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST RECEIVING THE KINGDOM<br />
FROM GOD</h2>
<p>When Christ accomplished redemption, He fulfilled the legal procedure for obtaining the kingdom, and then He ascended to God and received the kingdom from God&rsquo;s hand. In Luke 19 the Lord Jesus compared Himself to a man of noble birth who goes to a distant country, to heaven, to receive a kingdom and then return (v. 12). On the day of Pentecost the Spirit testified through Peter on behalf of Christ that God had made Christ to sit at His right hand until He makes Christ&rsquo;s enemies His footstool (Acts 2:34-35). In 1 Corinthians 15 the apostle Paul testifies concerning Christ, saying, &ldquo;He must reign until God puts all His enemies under His feet&rdquo; (v. 25). Furthermore, Daniel saw in a vision that Christ went before God to receive the kingdom (Dan. 7:13-14). These verses present a great and important matter: In His ascension Christ went to God to receive the kingdom so that when the time comes, His dominion and glory may be expressed.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
