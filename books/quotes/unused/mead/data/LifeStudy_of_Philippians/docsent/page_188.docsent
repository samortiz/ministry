   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PROPER REALIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whether or not we can exercise forbearance in difficult situations depends on the kind of realization and practice we have.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we realize that a particular situation is of the Lord, that it is needed to perfect us, and then thank Him for it, we shall not be anxious or threatened.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We shall be able to say, Lord, I thank You for this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am not threatened by this thing, because I know that I am one with You and that everything which comes to me is Your assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, I also know that You allow this thing to remain that it may help You to fulfill Your purpose and to perfect me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we realize that everything is the Lord s assignment and if we accept His will and thank Him for it, we shall be able to say with Paul, For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is consumed, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the momentary lightness of the affliction worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory 2 Cor 4:16-17, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>. Then we shall not have any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christians often say that the way to be freed from anxiety is simply to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to this understanding, the fact that a person is anxious means that he does not believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in 4:6 Paul does not say that it is by believing that we do not have anxiety in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this context he does not say a word about believing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>SIX POINTS TO UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we would be free from anxiety, we need to understand and practice the six points we have covered in the foregoing message and in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, we need to realize that just as anxiety is the totality of human life, so forbearance is the totality of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, we need to see that the source of forbearance is God and that the source of anxiety is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The third matter is to realize that forbearance and anxiety cannot exist together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reason for this is that forbearance is actually a person, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only when Christ is lived out of us do we have forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is indicated by the fact that in Philippians 1, 2, and 3 Paul speaks of Christ again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He emphasizes magnifying Christ, taking Christ as our pattern, and pursuing Christ as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in Philippians 4 he uses the term forbearance and charges us to make our forbearance known to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, this forbearance is the very Christ revealed in the foregoing chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, to let our forbearance be known is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have seen that God may assign certain sufferings to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But although the sufferings are God s assignment, they do not come from God, but from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The experiences of both Job and Paul illustrate this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The calamities assigned to us by God actually come to us from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan is the messenger who brings these things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God assigned a certain thorn to Paul, and He permitted Satan to bring the thorn to him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Immediately after sending us a certain difficulty or affliction, Satan comes to cause anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This anxiety is not assigned by God and it does not come from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, it is always caused by Satan to frustrate God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have a full realization of this, we shall see the need for Christ as our forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have this forbearance, we shall not have anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if we have anxiety, we shall not have forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fourth matter we need to understand and exercise is that to have a life full of forbearance but without anxiety, we need to be one with the Lord in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be one with the Lord experientially is to be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Fifth, we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means we need to have a time of fellowship with the Lord and to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Prayer does not mean merely to ask the Lord for things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Prayer involves conversing with the Lord, communicating with Him in fellowship, and worshipping Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we spend time with the Lord in this way, we should make known our petitions with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sixth, after praying, having fellowship with the Lord, worshipping Him, and making our petitions known to Him, we shall know what the will of the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, if we are ill, we shall know whether the Lord intends to heal us or allow the sickness to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once we know God s will, we should accept it, experience His sufficient grace, trust in Him, and thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we shall have a life full of forbearance but without anxiety.</S>
