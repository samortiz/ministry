   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR GOD S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-5, 7; Eph 3:2; Col 2:8; John 15:1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The two Epistles to Timothy were written by the apostle Paul during a time of the church s degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because Christianity today is under degradation, what is covered in these two Epistles fits our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are some crucial points in these two books, which are not covered thoroughly anywhere else in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>NOT TEACHING ANYTHING DIFFERENT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>FROM GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The crucial point in the Epistles to Timothy that we will cover in this chapter is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way Paul presents this matter is very impressive and full of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He presents God s economy in a practical way, not in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To teach a doctrine is one thing, but to practice something real is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul did not teach the doctrine of God s economy; rather, he practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul writes to Timothy, Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things 1 Tim 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul does not exhort Timothy to charge certain ones not to teach wrong teachings or heresies; on the contrary, he exhorts Timothy to charge them not to teach different things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 4 Paul continues, Nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God s economy, which is in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The myths Paul speaks of probably include stories of the children of Israel from ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genealogies were the records of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some of the teachings among Christians today minister not the riches of Christ but questions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s economy is a matter not in the mind but in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anything that is in faith does not arouse questions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THREE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 5 Paul writes, The end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we can see three subjective things related to God s economy a pure heart, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our heart needs to be pure, our conscience needs to be good, and our faith needs to be unfeigned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to have these three things within us for the practice of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our heart is impure, if our conscience has some offense, or if our faith is not true but hypocritical, we cannot practice God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A Pure Heart</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s economy requires us first to have a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to consider if our heart is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a basic question.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To care for God s economy, we must have a pure heart, which is a heart that seeks nothing but God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Matthew 5:8 says, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God is the unique goal of our seeking, and we fix our heart only on God, we have a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A pure heart is a sincere heart seeking after God and having no other goal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A Good Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To practice God s economy, we also need a good conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Paul, a good conscience is a conscience without offense Acts 24:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not have any accusation or condemnation against our conscience, it is a good conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can keep our conscience without offense by confessing in order to be cleansed by the precious blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Anytime we have the sense that we are wrong in something, there is an offense on our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A good conscience is one that is void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps when a brother comes home for dinner, he does not feel that his wife s cooking is good and becomes somewhat unhappy, although he does not lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He thinks that after he has worked hard all day, his wife should have cooked something that would make him happy, but it is just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because he is somewhat unhappy, when his wife tries to talk to him, he does not answer but only has a sullen countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After such an instance, the brother will have an offense on his conscience, and this offense will bother him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It does not require a great offense for our conscience to have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As soon as we sense the smallest offense on our conscience, we should confess to the Lord in a simple way and ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After a sincere confession, the Lord applies the blood to us and cleanses us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way the offense on our conscience is washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Unfeigned Faith</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Unfeigned in Greek means not hypocritical.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not perform or pretend but should have genuine faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A pure heart, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith are required for our practice of God s economy.</S>
