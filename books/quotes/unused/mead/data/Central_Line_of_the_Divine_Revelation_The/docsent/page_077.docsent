   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Z. As the Conforming Spirit, Glorifying Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with the Divine Glory of God and of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the renewing Spirit, He transforms us, and as the transforming Spirit, He conforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then as the conforming Spirit, He glorifies us with the divine glory of God and of Christ that the divine glory within us today may be expressed outwardly, in which we will be the same as Christ is in the glory of God Rom 8:30b; Heb 2:10a; 1 Pet 5:10a; Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be glorified in the divine glory is not merely objective.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In my early Christian life I was taught that although we are very mean and low pieces of clay, one day, when the Lord Jesus comes, we will be brought into the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time I did not understand the matter of glorification, so I accepted this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later, I realized that this kind of teaching is too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we as pieces of clay are put into glory, we will remain pieces of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The only difference will be that today we are clothed with clay, but in that day we will be pieces of clay clothed with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way that we are glorified is not objective but very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ as the glory today is already within us as the hope of glory Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is not in us in a dormant way, but He is saturating and permeating us to bring us through the process of conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His conforming us is also His glorifying us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When this glorifying reaches its climax, our body will be redeemed Phil 3:21; Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, we will no longer be clay.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, our clay will be transformed and conformed to the expression of Christ in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AA.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Seven Spirits of God,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>as the Seven Lamps of Fire,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>and as the Seven Eyes of the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the seven Spirits of God, as the seven lamps of fire, and as the seven eyes of the Lamb, the all-inclusive Spirit searches through enlightening and infuses through observing the churches with all the saints by the divine dispensing Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seven Spirits are the Spirit of God intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The seven Spirits as the Spirit of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb, Christ 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This strongly contradicts traditional theology which says that the three of the Divine Trinity are separate persons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Revelation 5:6 the third of the Divine Trinity, who is the Spirit, is the eyes of the second, who is the Lamb, Christ the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are these two separate persons or are they one person?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The eyes of a person cannot be separated from that person to become another person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The third of the Divine Trinity is one with the second of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The seven Spirits of God as the eyes of the Lamb are also seven lamps of fire Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever we close our eyes, we find that we are in darkness; we have no "lamps" by which we can see.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, our two eyes are two lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we were blind, we would have no light, because we would have no lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To have light, we need a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without our eyes, we would have no light, no lamp, to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This illustrates how the eyes are the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because our eyes are our lamps, we must pray so that the Lord will open our eyes that we may have light Acts 26:18; Eph 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord" lit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>. Our spirit is the lamp to bring in the Lord as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our spirit is not the light; it is the lamp to receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But without the lamp, we cannot receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, we must exercise our spirit, which is the lamp, to have a clear conscience so that the light can shine within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The seven lamps of fire are for searching through enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are going to search a dark room, light is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The seven eyes of the Lamb are for infusing through observing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I observe you, my eyes dispense something into you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If I am angry with you, my eyes dispense anger into you and cause you to be angry; but when I am joyful, my eyes dispense joy into you, causing you to become joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that either my joy or my anger is dispensed into you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, before we look at others, we must be full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then our looking at others will dispense the Spirit into them, just as the Lord does when He looks at us.</S>
