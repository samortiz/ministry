<P>The real significance of the pope is in the papal system, and the real control of the saints is in the clergy-laity system. What the Lord wants in the new way is for us to leave the papal system and the clergy-laity system. To remain in these systems is to be a Nicolaitan. The Nicolaitans are mentioned in Revelation 2:6 and 15. According to the meaning in Greek, this group of people are those who climb above the laity. They are a group of people who esteem themselves, the clergy, higher than the common believers. According to Revelation 2:6 and 15, the Lord hates the works of the Nicolaitans with their teaching. The works and teaching of the Nicolaitans are prevailing in both Catholicism and Protestantism.</P><P>The system of one man speaking and the rest listening is a part of the papal and clergy-laity systems. As long as we remain in this realm, we are Nicolaitans. The Nicolaitans are those who put down the Body of Christ and annul the members of the Body of Christ. Catholicism and Protestantism build up a religion to replace and put down the Body of Christ. Spontaneously, they kill and annul all the members of the Body of Christ by depending on a class of people called the clergy. Unconsciously, much of what we do may be in the same principle.</P><P>The church is the Body of Christ and the new man. It is not normal for only a small number of the members of a person's body to function while all the rest are paralyzed. A normal man uses all of his physical members. We need to consider today's situation in Christianity, in Catholicism and Protestantism. Where is such a corporate man, comprising the living, active, functioning members of the Body of Christ to fulfill the purpose of God? There is not such a thing. Mostly what is considered in Christianity is the work of gaining sinners, winning souls, to build up a congregation. That is not for the Body of Christ. Our concept has been captured by that practice. We left Babylon, but Babylon's principle and philosophy still remain with us. We left Babylon, but the Babylonian system would not leave us.</P><P>What is the new way, the God-ordained way? The God-ordained way is to rescue us from this Babylonian capture. We have been captured by the philosophy of the papal and clergy-laity systems. We are still carrying, probably unintentionally and subconsciously, the philosophy of these systems with us in whatever we do. This is why I say that we have to endeavor to change our philosophy. We are not building up any kind of religion. We are building up the Body of Christ, and we are building up the new man. We should be perfecting all the members of the Body and equipping all the parts of the new man, but we do not do much perfecting or equipping. In actuality we left Babylon, but the Babylonian philosophy still goes with us. Unconsciously, we still like to keep this philosophy. There is the need of a revolutionary change from this old philosophy to the new, scriptural principle.</P>
