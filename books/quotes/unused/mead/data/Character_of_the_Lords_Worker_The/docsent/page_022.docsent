   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 24 says, "Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul illustrated his point with the example of a runner in a race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A Christian's service to the Lord and labor for his Master can be compared to a race.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone is running in this race; this is compulsory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one can exempt himself from it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Run in this way, that you may lay hold."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only one of the runners in a race receives the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if we all run, everyone can receive the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the difference between their running and our running.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul used the illustration of a racecourse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This illustration leads to verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 25 says, "And everyone who contends exercises self- control in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is Paul's emphasis: In order for a man to contend, he has to undergo training.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has to exercise self-control in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He cannot eat as he wishes or skip eating as he wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He cannot sleep as he wishes or skip sleep as he wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All athletes who compete in games are strictly disciplined during their training.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are strictly regulated as to what they can eat and what they cannot eat, when they can sleep and when they should wake up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before a game begins, they have to follow strict rules such as not drinking or smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once the game starts, there are stricter rules to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why verse 25 says that everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may think that it is hard to drop their smoking, drinking, or favorite pastimes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when a man prepares for a race, he has to strictly control his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What are the things he has to exercise self-control in?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has to exercise self-control in the demands of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He cannot allow his body to have too many demands or to have too much freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In running a race the body is reserved for only one thing the race.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not for eating, clothing, smoking, drinking, or sleeping, but for running.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many runners have to abstain from sweet and starchy food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This does not mean that these foods are harmful or useless; rather, they do not help a runner in his race.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to be a runner, a person has to exercise self-control in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 27 speaks of buffeting the body; that is, the body is brought into the discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The body has to be under control; it has to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of the faculties of the body are reserved for just one thing running, the kind of running that will win first prize.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 25 continues, "They then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The runners exercised much self-control for the sake of a corruptible crown.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Should we who are after an incorruptible crown not exercise much more self-control?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The corruptible crown refers to the Greek garlands of flowers, which lasted only for three to five days.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A runner had to go through long periods of training before he could have a chance to win such a corruptible crown.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul said, "They then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should pay attention to Paul's comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek runners ran on the racecourse, while we run in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their running was an exercise of the body, while our running is our service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In their running, only one received the prize, but in our running, everyone can receive the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their prize was a corruptible crown, but our prize is an incorruptible crown.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are different contrasts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, one thing holds true in both races exercising self-control in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Self-control is necessary in both cases.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They exercised self-control to win the race, while we exercise self-control to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The goals may be different, but the discipline imposed on the body is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One has to exercise self-control in running the race, and as Christians we also have to exercise self-control in our Christian life.</S>
