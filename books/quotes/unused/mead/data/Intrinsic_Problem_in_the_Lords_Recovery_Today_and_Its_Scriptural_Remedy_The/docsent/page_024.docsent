   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Becoming worldly and even settled in the world led some members of the church to hold the teaching that caused the people of God to stumble in eating idol sacrifices and committing fornication.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To deal with such a complicated case as the case of the church in Pergamos being one with the world and some of its members holding the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans requires us to be one with the Lord in standing against the world as the satanic system of darkness, and requires us to hate idolatry, spiritual fornication, and the sin of hierarchy the evil system of organization in religion.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of all these she is not willing to repent, and for all these the Lord will destroy her Rev 2:21-23 .</S>
