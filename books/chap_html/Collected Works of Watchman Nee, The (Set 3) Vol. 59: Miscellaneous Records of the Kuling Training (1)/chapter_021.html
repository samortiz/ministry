<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE CONDITION FOR<br />BEING AN AUTHORITY&mdash;SUBMISSION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: July 3, 1948<br />Place: Kuling Mountain</h1><p>The condition for knowing God's authority is submission, and the result of knowing His authority is also submission. The more we are obedient, the more we will see God's authority. God's requirement for His appointed authority is submission. Those who cannot submit to authority will never be chosen by God to be an authority. When the Lord was on earth, He praised only one Gentile&mdash;the centurion (Matt. 8:10). Other than him, He hardly recommended anyone. The centurion was praised because he knew authority; he had learned the meaning of faith from his understanding of authority. He knew that authority was in the Lord's word; he knew the meaning of authority. He said, "For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me" (v. 9). The centurion knew that he had authority above him, that he was a man under authority. He also was aware of being an authority to his subordinates.</p><p>Perhaps it is too early for us to speak of authority today. The authority which the church possesses today is spiritual. We must wait for the kingdom to come before we will possess actual authority. The full manifestation will come in the next age. Then the glory, the kingdom, and the authority will all be Christ's. Today is not the time for the church to reign; this is only a time of training and preparation. Dispensationally speaking, it is too early to speak of authority today. However, we have ground to speak about authority today because God has appointed deputy authority in the church today. A servant of the Lord must come to know authority and submission. If a man has never seen the matter of authority, he can never submit. On the other hand, if a man does not have the experience of submission, he can never be an authority.</p><h2 class="head1">SUBMISSION TO DEPUTY AUTHORITY<br />BEING SUBMISSION TO GOD</h2><p>I hope that those who are learning to be an authority will not have a wrong concept: In leading those who, under God's sovereignty, are under them, they should not try to lead them to submit to them. Instead, they should lead them to submit to God's authority. They should not try to lead someone to meet men, but to meet God. If a man only meets men, he still does not know the meaning of authority. Those who have never met God are not submitting to God, but to men only. Actually, a person who has never touched God's authority will never submit to men. In God's sovereignty and according to the order of His authority, some people are placed under us. If we are the deputy authority to them, we have to realize that we are not asking submission for ourselves; we are leading them to submit to God. It is a great mistake for anyone to expect others to submit to himself.</p><p>God has no intention to uphold your own dignity. He has no intention for wives, children, and slaves to just submit to their husbands, fathers, and masters. God's intention is for man to submit to Him. The submission which God requires from man is the same in nature as the path which He has designated for man; it is submission to God. We are not here to maintain our own dignity or position. We are not here to carry out our own order, but to execute God's authority. If we demand that others submit to us, we are merely leading them to touch ourselves. If we are under the illusion that authority means for others to submit to us, we need to go back to the very basics in our training. A deputy authority is merely a temporary appointment from God. We submit to a certain person because he represents God's authority. If we rebel against him, we are offending God's authority. For example, a few brothers from Shangtung once came to our meeting in Yu-Hua-Chun [Editor's note: a training center in Shanghai]. I spoke to them about submission to authority. (At that time I did not have the liberty to say too much.) When they heard it, they tried to practice submission. But when they returned to Chefoo, they would not submit to Brother Witness. These ones only touched men. If we have touched only men, but not touched God's authority, we do not know authority. Those who have seen God's authority will find authority wherever they go.</p><p>In our submission, we must meet God Himself, not just men. Suppose we teach a child in Foochow about electricity and let him touch a bare wire. He will feel the shock from the current. If he goes to Shanghai and tries to touch electricity there, he will feel the same thing. This will teach him not to meddle with electricity carelessly. If he has only touched an insulated wire, however, he has not experienced electricity itself. He may find an electrified wire with black or yellow insulation and play with it out of curiosity. In real life, of course, the result still could be tragic. We are not here to teach men to touch the insulation around the electrical wire, but to help them to touch electricity itself. We have to help people to know authority, not the figures who represent authority. Unless we give them this proper help, we are sending them to certain disaster.</p>
