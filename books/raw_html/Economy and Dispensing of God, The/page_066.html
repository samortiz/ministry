<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Being Kind to One Another, Tenderhearted,<br>Forgiving One Another, as God<br>in Christ Forgave Us</H2><P>Last, we should be kind to one another (v. 32). We must learn always to give in. In Taipei, more than thirty years ago we made benches that could seat four or five persons. Sometimes two husky persons would occupy so much space that it became impossible for the other three to sit comfortably. This is not being kind. In the church life, on the one hand, we should treat others kindly, and on the other hand, we should not fight with others but should always give in. We should also be tenderhearted, forgiving one another.</P><P>Brother Nee once wrote a proverb for married couples. Among the many items that he mentioned, he told the husbands and the wives that from the day of the wedding they needed to learn to say two words: "I'm sorry" and "forgive me." If we say these two words every day, there will be no divorce or separation. Separation and divorce come because people are too proud to say "I'm sorry" or "forgive me" to their spouse.</P><P>In the church life, we are close to each other every day. Often we say things or do things that offend others. We all need to learn to say "I'm sorry" and "forgive me" to each other. But we must not say these words from our lips only; we must first pray, confess to the Lord, and deal with the Lord properly concerning the offenses. Then we can go to the ones whom we have wronged and make restitution. If we do this, there will be no friction between the saints. There will be peace, and we will have a proper church life that is good for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Berkeley, California, on September 2, 1990)</P>
