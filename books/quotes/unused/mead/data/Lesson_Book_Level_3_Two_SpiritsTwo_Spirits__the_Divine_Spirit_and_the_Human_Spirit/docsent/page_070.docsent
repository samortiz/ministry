   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Walking by the Spirit as the Rule</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we consider Galatians 5:25 in light of the other verses where the Greek word stoicheo is used for walk Rom 4:12; Phil 3:16 , we shall see that to walk by the Spirit is to walk by the Spirit as our rule.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit Himself is the way, the rule, the line, the principle, leading toward God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit Himself should be our rule.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we would have the second walk by the Spirit, we must take the Spirit as our rule, our way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This may be illustrated by driving on the highway to reach a specific destination, which is different from merely driving around.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we drive on the highway, the lanes on the highway are a rule.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Driving according to this rule, we are able to reach our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our Christian walk, the second kind of walk by the Spirit is a walk in which the Spirit is the rule.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our rule should not be doctrine or theology.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, it should not be the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul's intention in writing to the Galatians was to tell them that they should no longer take the law as their rule.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Galatian believers had been distracted from the Spirit to the law and had taken it as their rule.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul told them that they were foolish and that they should return to the Spirit as their rule.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since they had life and lived by the Spirit, they should also walk by the Spirit as their rule.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would have the second walk for the fulfillment of God's purpose, we must first learn to walk by the Spirit as our way, rule, principle, and lane.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I encourage all the saints to have the second walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You need to pray, "Lord, I will follow You to have the second walk by the Spirit for the fulfillment of Your purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not want to walk by doctrine, theology, organization, or natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I want to walk by the Spirit as my unique highway."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to 5:25, since we have received life and live by the Spirit, we should now have the second walk by the Spirit as our rule.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been given life by the Spirit that we may walk by the Spirit to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a glorious goal lies before us!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The highway which leads us to this goal is the Spirit, the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we walk on this unique highway, we should neither swerve nor turn around, but move on directly to the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord's ultimate charge is that we live, act, and have our being according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are led by the Spirit by walking according to the inward sense of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Two kinds of walk by the spirit are mentioned in Galatians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first walk is a general daily walk displaying such virtues as love, joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second walk is according to certain elementary rules and principles for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should live by the Spirit and have the second walk by the Spirit as our rule.</S>
