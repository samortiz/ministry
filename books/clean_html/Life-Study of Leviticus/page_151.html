<h2 class=head1>I. THE DISCHARGE FROM MAN’S BODY</h2><h2 class=head2>A. A Man Being Unclean Because of His Discharge</h2><p>“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When any man has a discharge from his body, because of his discharge he is unclean” (v. 2). This signifies that whatever issues from man’s body, whether or not it is according to the law of the physical body, is unclean. Any kind of discharge is unclean.<h2 class=head2>B. Whether His Discharge Runs or Has Stopped, It Is His Uncleanness</h2><p>“This shall be his uncleanness in his discharge: whether his body runs with its discharge, or has stopped from its discharge, it is his uncleanness” (v. 3). This signifies that whatever issues from man’s natural life, whether good or bad, is filthy.<h2 class=head2>C. Everything and Anyone Touched by or Touching Man’s Discharge Being Unclean</h2><p>Verses 4 through 11 tell us that everything and anyone touching man’s discharge is unclean. This signifies that anything touched by or touching the issue of man’s natural life is unclean.<h2 class=head2>D. The Uncleanness Being until the Evening</h2><p>The uncleanness was until the evening (vv. 5c, 6c, 7c, 8c, 10c, 11c). This signifies that the uncleanness of the issue of man’s natural life should be ended (death) that there might be a new beginning (resurrection). The phrase “until the evening” signifies coming to an end through death. Then there will be a new day, a new beginning, which is resurrection.<p>If we would be clean, having a clean place in which to stay, we must come to an end. We must die by taking the cross of Christ. In this way we come to the evening of our old course, the evening of the old creation. Then through the cross and after the cross, we shall be in a new day. We shall be in resurrection.<h2 class=head2>E. Washing the Clothes and Bathing in Water</h2><p>In Leviticus 15 washing the clothes and bathing in water are spoken of a number of times (vv. 5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 10b, 11b). This signifies not only dealing with our outward living and behavior and all the media through which man’s natural life is contacted, but also dealing with ourselves by washing in the water of life in the word of God, purging away anything that is affected by our natural life.<p>We need the cross of Christ to end our old life, and we need the resurrection of Christ to have a new beginning. In addition, we need the water of life, which is the washing, cleansing, Spirit. We also need the word because the cleansing Spirit of life is embodied in the word. Whenever we come in our spirit to the word we touch something within the word that washes us. After we touch this washing element in the word, we shall continue to be cleansed in our being by it throughout the day. Therefore, we need the cross of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the Holy Spirit as the water of life in the word of God. Now we should come to the word with our spirit. As a result, we shall purge away anything that has been affected by our natural life.
