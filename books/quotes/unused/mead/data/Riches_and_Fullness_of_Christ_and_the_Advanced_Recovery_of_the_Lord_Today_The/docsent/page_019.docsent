   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE ADVANCED RECOVERY OF THE LORD TODAY 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:1, 39, 3-5, 12, 24-25, 31, 26 THE GIFTED PERSONS BEING FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I believe today the Lord is recovering Ephesians 4:11-16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These six verses have never been completely opened to the saints throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we have read them many times before, we were still not clear how the gifted persons could perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Beginning from 1984, I spent four and a half years to study this matter, and the Lord showed me that the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers given by the Lord are there to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It can be compared to a university.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are professors in the different departments who teach different subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the beginning, the students may not be very well acquainted with their subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But after four or five years of instruction, all the students are perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word "to be perfected'' in Greek means primarily to be equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It also includes the sense of supply and provision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The result of this kind of perfecting is that the students are able to do what the professors can do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We use this illustration to show how God perfects the saints through the gifts He gave.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS BEING IN THE HOME MEETINGS AND GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know that God has not given many gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the history of the church in the past, we can see that there have not been many apostles or prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same way, there have not been many shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But there are many saved believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, on the day of Pentecost there were at the most one hundred twenty of those who were the apostles, the prophets, and the evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They all learned from the Lord Jesus and were taught by Him for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We know that, first of all, the Lord Jesus perfected twelve disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Among them, four were fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These four were two pairs of brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One pair was Peter and Andrew; the other pair was James and John.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Originally, they knew only how to mend nets and catch fish; they knew nothing about saving men, preaching the gospel, or serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus gathered them together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is like the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They met with the Lord in group meetings for three and a half years, and they learned everything there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, they came to know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some have asked me how to have a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I told them that the best example of the group meeting is found in what the Lord did in those three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can say that for the three and a half years, He mainly established one group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The nucleus of this group meeting had twelve brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Outside of this was a group of sisters with some other people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the day of Pentecost, this group meeting already had one hundred twenty people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They were all perfected by the Lord Jesus during those three and a half years in that group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At Pentecost, three thousand people were saved in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Prior to this, they never knew how to serve God or how to help the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From that day on, they began to meet from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Acts 2 tells us that daily they were in one accord, meeting from house to house v. 46 . These one hundred twenty who had been perfected began to lead the three thousand on in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Among the ancient Jews, sometimes a few generations would live together under the same roof.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If one person were to take care of five households, the one hundred twenty people could take care of at least six hundred households.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps some were saved during the day in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At night, they could begin to meet in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the example of perfecting in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After these three thousand were saved, it was not a matter that they only called special conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, they met in one house after another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In their meetings, not only did they have the fellowship, the prayer, and the breaking of the bread, but they had the teaching of the truth and the preaching of the gospel as well.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, at that time, the function of the home meeting and the group meeting was all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They practiced their church life in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should believe that they had group meetings daily and frequently in the believers' homes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who understood a little more would teach those who understood less.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who had been taught by the Lord would lead on the ones who did not know much about God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This shows us that the perfecting of the saints in the church is carried out in the home meetings and the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul said in Acts 20 that he lived in Ephesus for three years v. 31 . He personally taught and admonished the disciples publicly and from house to house v. 20 . He knew very well that it was not practical enough to have teaching and perfecting in large meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There was the need to go to the saved ones' homes and to have group meetings house by house.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the only practical way of perfecting others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During the last few mornings, I have been speaking to you in public.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the afternoon, all of you went home.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I did not at all have the assurance that you understood what I was speaking of.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I did not know if my words had entered into you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps you have enjoyed very much listening to the words on the "riches'' and the "fullness'' while you were in the meetings, but after you went home, you forgot everything about the "riches'' and the "fullness.''</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do wish that I could stay here for over three years.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If that were the case, I could go from house to house to teach in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you do not have the time in the morning, I could come in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you are busy in the daytime, I could come to you at night, or even at midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At any rate, I would get a chance to tell you how Christ's riches can become your riches, and how these riches can become the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you do not understand these things, I would repeat them again and again until all of you understand and are enlightened by them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this way, you would be perfected and equipped.</S>
