   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LETTING THINGS PASS INTO THE HANDS OF OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The right way is this.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the first day that I come here to serve, I may do ninety percent of the things and leave ten percent in the hands of others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But after one month, I am taking care of only sixty percent, and the other thirty percent has passed into the hands of some others who have come in to serve with me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After another month, I may take care of only thirty percent, and another month later, maybe only five percent, then a little later, only one percent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The rest of the job of the service goes to all the serving brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One sister takes care of the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A brother takes care of the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Another takes care of this, and another takes care of that.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To serve the Lord in this way I need to learn many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Each one of us naturally thinks that he is the best and would never let others do the same thing he does.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if you would learn the lesson to be coordinated with others, you need to learn how to look down on yourself and how to be limited by others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Otherwise, you could not bring people more and more into the building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was a sister in China who was quite capable, educated, and experienced in doing things, and she loved the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, when she came into the service of the church, the more she served, the more everything came into her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After two or three months, it seemed that all the others had been dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day the elders asked her why it was that there were only two or three left in the Lord's service, when a few months ago there had been quite a number.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They asked where the others were.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Her answer was that they did not know how to do things, and they did not do them well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more she served, the more all the others were dismissed because of her ability and her capability.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one could work as fast as she could.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In everything it seemed she was right because she was so capable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in spiritual reality she damaged the church life very much.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She acted independently.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later on, with this sister there was a great spiritual cancer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A cancer is a part of the body that overdevelops, a group of cells that goes wild, that goes too far.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You need to be limited by others so that you will not be a cancer to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You need to be limited by others so that you will be a member coordinated with others, not a cell gone wild.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The best way for us to serve the Lord in the church is this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first week that you come to serve the Lord, you may take care of seventy percent of the things, and the others take care of thirty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The next week, you take sixty-five percent, and the others thirty-five percent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The third week, you may take sixty, and the others, forty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With you the percentage is always being reduced, and with the others it is always being increased.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From another angle, the first week that you come, only five percent of the saints are serving with you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After one week, there are eight percent, then twelve, twenty, and eventually, maybe after one year, one hundred percent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The percentage of the work in your hands is always being reduced, yet the number of the people serving with you is always increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After maybe one or two years, the service will be absolutely out of your hands and one hundred percent in the hands of all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The number of the serving ones will be increased from just a handful to more than a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you take this way, you will learn to be limited, to be broken, and to submit yourself to others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do not serve the Lord with others, you will never know yourself, but when you serve with others, you will be exposed how "good" you really are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this kind of service there are many lessons for you to learn.</S>
