   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FASTENED TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only the high priest had the right to wear the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This typifies that we the believers do not have the right to put on what is signified by the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only Christ wears the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that only He has the fastening power and the girding strength.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ holds us, binds us, and fastens us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may say that Christ links us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The holding power is His divine glory and human beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to remember that the ephod was a piece of clothing used for fastening.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Three plates were fastened to the ephod the two shoulder plates and the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because these plates were fastened to the ephod, they were also fastened, bound, girded, to the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Having been fastened to him, they could not fall away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the significance of the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the High Priest, Christ has the fastening power, the tying strength, and the binding ability.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not have this power, strength, or ability.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes Christians speak of the way the Lord holds us, embraces us, and keeps us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I was young, I thought that the Lord Jesus held us as a shepherd holds a lamb in his arms.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I pictured the Lord as One embracing us and carrying us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if we consider the picture of the ephod, we shall see that the Lord does not merely hold us; He binds us and fastens us to Himself, just as the plates are joined to the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To hold is not as significant as to fasten, and to embrace is not as significant as to gird or bind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are fastened to Christ; we are bound to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yes, Christ bears us and carries us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, He does not carry us like a shepherd carrying a lamb in his arms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, He carries us like the high priest wearing the ephod to which the shoulder plates and the breastplate were securely fastened.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ has fastened all of God s people to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This fastening is through His divine glory and human beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that His divine glory and human beauty are the strength to fasten us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Exodus 28:9 and 10 say, And you shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel: six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the remaining six on the other stone, according to their birth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These onyx stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel symbolize us, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, they signify all God s redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 12 says, And you shall put the two stones upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, as stones of memorial for the sons of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This signifies that God s redeemed people are upon Christ s shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not held in His arms like lambs; we are upon His shoulders like the pieces of onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are the precious stones upon the ephod, the fastening piece, composed of the divine glory and human beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the day you were saved, you have been held by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, do you know what has been holding you all this time?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some would say that Christ is powerful and that we are held by His power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yes, John 10:28 indicates this: And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does indicate Christ s power to hold us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John 10:29 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are two hands holding the believers, the hand of Christ the Son and the hand of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These hands signify power and also love, but they do not imply the divine glory and the human beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the picture of the plates fastened to the ephod, we are tied to Christ by His divine glory and human beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, Christ s divine glory and human beauty are the fastening strength which binds us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are held to Him continually by His divine glory and His human beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING HELD TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to ask ourselves how in our experience we are held by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some may say that they are held by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They may pray, Lord Jesus, I don t have any faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please give me the faith so that I can believe that I am in Your hand and that You are holding me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have often prayed in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have had many experiences of this kind of prayer and of this kind of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the more I prayed like this, the less I seemed to trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more I asked for faith, the less faith I had.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many other Christians have had a similar experience.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps you have prayed, Lord, You are my Keeper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have the keeping grace, You have the power to hold me, and You love me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Lord, embrace me and preserve me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But You know, Lord, when trouble comes, I seem to forget everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, Lord, I ask You to infuse me with Your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>O Lord, infuse Yourself into me as my living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the more you pray like this, the less it seems that faith is infused into you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Forty years ago I became seriously ill of tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>During that time I did not have any faith that the Lord would heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Of course, I did not lose my basic faith, the saving faith, in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But I did lose any faith that the Lord would heal me of tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The elders, the co-workers, and the church with all the saints prayed for me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I had given a number of messages to the saints telling them that the Lord is faithful and charging them to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I encouraged them to trust in Him, for He would never fail them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then I became ill and found it difficult to trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A certain sister who brought my food to me three times a day talked with me about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She asked me why I did not have the faith that the Lord would heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I said to her, Sister, you are right.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I don t have a bit of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Can you please help me and tell me what faith is?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It seemed rather strange that I would ask her such a question.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>She had been saved through my preaching, and now I was asking her to tell me what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>She was very surprised and was not able to answer me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Actually, the situation of every preacher is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>My point here is that when we realize the divine glory and the human beauty of Christ, we are spontaneously fastened to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is no need for us to try to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The fastening power does not come from our faith: it comes from what He is and what He has.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord has the divine glory and the human beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He is glorious, and He is beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Whenever we consider Him or gaze on Him, we are fastened to Him in a practical way in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is no need for us to attempt to believe in Him or trust in Him, for we are already girded to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I enjoy reading and studying the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>As we read the Gospels, sometimes we can see the glory of the Lord, and sometimes we can see His beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Even while the Lord was in the flesh on earth as a man, His glory could be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even in His incarnation He was glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When we read the Gospels, we can see that the divine glory was with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We can also see the Lord s human beauty, a beauty that is fine and very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We do not have the words adequate to describe the human beauty of the Lord Jesus revealed in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But as we read the Gospels, something within our being realizes how beautiful the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>For example, the way He dealt with His disciples and talked with Mary and Martha in John 11 was beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we consider the divine glory and human beauty of the Lord in the Gospels, we are spontaneously fastened to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Then we are held to Him and even carried on His shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>His divine glory and His human beauty tie us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I believe that many of us have had this kind of experience reading the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>By reading the story of the Lord s life on earth, we see His divine glory and His human beauty, and we are fastened to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then we have the sense that we are safe and secure.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We realize that we can never fall away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the experience of the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Do you have such an ephod?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I am quite sure that I do not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If you would study me, you would not be fastened.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I am short both of the divine glory and the human beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Christ, however, is different.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He has the ephod, and with Him there are the divine glory and the human beauty.</S>
