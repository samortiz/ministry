Thank the Lord, when I had no way out, He showed me the right way. But while I was about to obey, as Hymn #68 in the Little Flock Hymnal says in stanza two, "Satan undermine[d] the way." As a consequence, the meeting in Dairen stopped for a long time. Because of this we were weak in life, and sometimes we fellowshipped with the brothers and sisters in the denominations. But we could never gain what we wanted in our innermost parts. As for myself, I just read the Bible in a sloppy way. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>We are so weak, how will we be able to do what we want to do? I myself know that I have not been baptized (I was baptized five years ago by sprinkling in the Lutheran Church. Two years ago, I debated strongly with the obedient brothers in Chefoo, and I even ridiculed them concerning the doctrine of baptism by immersion after sprinkling. I thought I held the proper truth. I was so very proud!) My name is still on the books of a denomination (in Pei Sui Hua County, Harbin). I know that I should inform them of my desire to leave as a testimony that I am renouncing the sin of denominations. These are two testimonies before man that cannot be compromised in expressing one's obedience. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>I hope all the brothers and sisters earnestly pray for us and ask the Lord to revive us. I respectfully greet you and Brother Witness Lee, whom I saw in Chefoo, and all the brothers and sisters.</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>Chiang Ch'un Ching</P><P>Mailing address: Holiness School, Jih Chi Ting, Dairen</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Additional Suggestion</H2><P>In Collection of Newsletters, the specific addresses of the different localities are not clearly provided. It is difficult for me to send a letter to Brother Yuan Chin Chou of Ling Tzu, to Chefoo, or to someplace else. (I have not received a letter from them for a long time.) I sometimes pass through Ch'ang-ch'un, but I do not know Brother Chiang Shun T'ien's address. How can I visit the church there? What is more, if I see a letter in Collection of Newsletters from a brother or sister in trials, how can I send a letter to comfort them? Would it be possible to put the specific mailing address after every letter, to facilitate communication between the brothers and sisters? Please consider.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Answer</H2><P>We completely agree with this suggestion, and beginning in this issue, at the end of each newsletter, we have written the person's mailing address to the best of our knowledge. We hope that in the future, the brothers and sisters who send us newsletters also give us their mailing address&mdash;Editor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM THE MEETING IN KUANG JAU,<br>SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from Brother Nieh Tao Hung<br>in Kuang Jau<br>to Brother Yuan Chin Chou in Ling Tzu</H2><P>To my brother in the Lord, Mr. Chin Chou:</P><P>I arrived in the city yesterday and went to Brother Liu Shou Shan's place. I saw the postcard you sent. We all thank the Father. The believers in this place are all at peace. Please do not worry. I wrote a letter to officially leave the denominations today and have already delivered it personally to the director of the Kuang Jau Presbyterian Church. I have enclosed a copy. Please read it. I hope you can write a letter to the brothers and sisters in the fellowship in Shanghai to explain the situation here, so they can pray for us and give thanks before the Lord. I bless you. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>From,<br>Hung<br>June 5</P><P>The Meeting in Kuang Jau, Shantung:<br>Responsible Brother: Nieh Tao Hung<br>Mailing Address: c/o Hsi Men Li T'ien Yi Hsin Hao, Kuang Jau, Shantung</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_081.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_083.html">Next</a> </body></html>
