<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>LIFE BEING A PERSON FOR US TO LIVE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-3a; 3:14-15; 4:9; 5:4, 11, 12, 13, 16a</h1><h2 class=head1>THE MINISTRIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>The twenty-seven books of the New Testament are largely a record of four ministries: Christ’s earthly ministry, His heavenly ministry, Paul’s completing ministry, and John’s mending ministry.<p>Christians for the most part focus their attention mainly on the earthly ministry of Christ. This is the subject of most Christian messages. Christ’s earthly ministry is recorded in the four Gospels. It begins with the incarnation and ends with the ascension. Included in it are His human living and then His death on the cross for the accomplishment of redemption. By His death He took away our sins and released the eternal life to us. He also terminated the old creation and destroyed God’s enemy Satan. How great were these accomplishments!<p>Yes, Christ’s earthly ministry did accomplish redemption. Redemption in itself, however, did not accomplish God’s purpose. God’s purpose is not merely to have sinners redeemed. His goal is the church. Redemption was the procedure for the producing and building up of the church.<p>In the four Gospels the word church occurs only in Matthew 16:18 and 18:17. The other twenty-three books of the New Testament, in contrast, use this word again and again. From Acts and through all the Epistles to the end of the New Testament not only is the term church used; the church is referred to by many other titles as well. These books reveal the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all; the house or dwelling place of God; the household or family of God; the kingdom of God; the bride of Christ; the new man; the warrior; the lampstand; and, finally, the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation.<p>To say that the New Testament, apart from the Gospels, is a revelation of the church in all its varied aspects is to give a proper, inclusive summary. To see that this is really the case, however, requires our being enlightened. We may study these twenty-three books in a detailed, analytical way without ever realizing the point behind them. It takes a vision for us to see that these books reveal the goal of God’s eternal purpose and that Christ’s complete redemption is for this goal. This goal is the church.<p>How is the church to be produced, built up, and brought to completion? Three ministries are needed.<p>The first is Christ’s heavenly ministry, which began in Acts and will continue right through eternity. It covers a wide span of time. His earthly ministry, in contrast, lasted only thirty-three and a half years. The second is Paul’s completing ministry. The third is John’s mending ministry.<p>In my youth I was taught that Christ’s work is finished. He is now seated on the throne in the heavens, waiting for His enemies to be made His footstool. That He is seated is a strong indication that His work is completed. This is true, but it is only partially true. As far as His earthly ministry is concerned, “It is finished” (John 19:30). When we come to His heavenly ministry, however, it is another story.
