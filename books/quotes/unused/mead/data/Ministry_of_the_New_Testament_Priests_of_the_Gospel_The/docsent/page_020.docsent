   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For such a glorious goal and result, there are requirements for the ministry of the New Testament priests of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These requirements concern what kind of person we are and what kind of life we live.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are persons who love the world instead of the Lord and who live in sin, we have not sufficiently fulfilled the requirements to be New Testament priests of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the outline of this message we have listed nine major points concerning the New Testament priests of the gospel and their living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we must be revived every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every morning we must go to the Lord to have a revival in order that our living will be like the light of dawn shining brighter and brighter Prov 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, we must overcome every day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be renewed, as mentioned in 2 Corinthians 4:16, is to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we remain in our oldness, we are defeated, but if we are renewed day by day, we overcome day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Third, we must live in the Spirit moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not live by our flesh, our soul-life, or the old "I"; rather, we live by the Spirit Gal 5:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fourth, we walk according to the spirit in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead of walking according to our opinions and reasonings, we walk according to the spirit Rom 8:4 , doing whatever the Spirit leads us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A person who walks according to the spirit will not have murmurings and reasonings Phil 2:14 ; also, he will not have selfish intentions and greedy ambitions Gal 5:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Fifth, we must be in one accord and in harmony with the saints 1 Cor 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to have the same mind and to speak the same thing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sixth, we are not blown by the winds of teaching Eph 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Christians pay too much attention to doctrines, they have opinions and thereby create divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we should only care and live for Christ and His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Seventh, we do not teach anything different from the truth concerning the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God 1 Tim 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have clearly seen God's ordained way in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This way is that everyone is a priest of the gospel to minister to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not speak or receive any doctrine that is different from this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eighth, we pray watchfully, labor diligently, and struggle earnestly to carry out each step of the duties of the New Testament priests of the gospel of God Matt 26:41; Rom 12:11; Col 1:29; 1 Cor 15:58 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ninth, we are those who await the Lord's coming by living and working in the light of His judgment seat Phil 3:20; 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These nine major points are an abstract of the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The whole New Testament requires us to be such persons with such a living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we will fulfill the requirements to be the New Testament priests of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Prayer: Lord, we truly praise You for showing us Your ordained way in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We praise You for opening the scriptural revelation to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thank You for giving us a clear, open heaven in these past days.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank You that so many saints can receive Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May all their paths be the paths of the righteous which are like the light of dawn shining brighter and brighter until the full day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May those who love You be like the sun when it rises in its might.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>O Lord, bless the Republic of Korea, bless this people, and bless this land for the sake of Your churches here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even the more, bless all those who are called by Your name that they may all be living believers and become the New Testament priests of the gospel, with everyone preaching the gospel, feeding Your lambs, perfecting the saints, and prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May Your economy be accomplished and Your plan be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May You be glorified, may Your enemy be put to shame, and may all the saints be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Glory be to Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Amen.</S>
