<p>Prayer: Lord, our hearts rejoice and our spirits praise. In this last age You have given us Your revelation in such a deep, far-reaching, and clear way. Lord, You have gathered us together here tonight to study Your holy Word. We are open to You. We call on You in a humble way. Lord, speak an intimate word to us. Although we are young and weak, You are strong and mighty within us. Lord Jesus, may we know You. We do not depend on ourselves, nor do we look at ourselves. We look only to You. Thank You that You have shown us so clearly Your ordained way which is the way revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p>Lord, draw us again tonight that we would run after You. Put Your burden within each one of us that we would all receive Your burden to finish the course You have set for us and to be persons after Your heart and for Your pleasure.</p>
<p>Lord, grant us ears to hear. May You be with our speaking. May You be one spirit with us in our speaking. Lord, vindicate Your own way and confirm Your own words. We call on You in one accord on the ground of the church. While we call on You, You have to do something for Yourself. Lord, we accuse Your enemy. You have to destroy him. Remove his power of darkness. Lord, deliver all of us from his hands and his bondage. We want to give You the glory and give him the shame. May blessing and building be with the saints and the church. Amen!</p>
<p>The first work of the priest of the gospel in the New Testament is to visit people personally and bring in sinners to offer to God as sacrifices. After this first step there are still three more responsibilities. These are my burden for tonight. Let me begin with a word of introduction. Christianity today is a great religion. There are millions of Christians throughout the world. They can be divided mainly into three categories: the first is Roman Catholicism, the second is the different denominations of Protestantism such as the Baptists, the Presbyterians, the Methodists, the Episcopalians, the Lutherans, etc., and the third is the free groups. These free groups belong neither to the Catholic Church nor to the Protestant denominations. Although they can be considered a part of Protestantism they do not belong to the big denominations of Protestantism. They are scattered and free. Today on the whole earth, whether it be the Catholics, the Protestants, or the free groups, and although each has their own way of serving God, all three groups are the same.</p>
