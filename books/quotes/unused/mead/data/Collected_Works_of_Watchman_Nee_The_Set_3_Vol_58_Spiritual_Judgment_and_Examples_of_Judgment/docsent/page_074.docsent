   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My cousin introduced me to Brother Nee's magazine The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I received much help from it and was actually saved through it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After I was saved, I came to know more about the truth and had the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I know that no one loves me in this world like the Lord does.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His love constrains me, and I have consecrated myself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I began to have a burden for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1941 I was a teacher in a commercial school.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The principal of the school considered me quite highly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After working there for five years, I was given the highest position in the school.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I also received spiritual profit through my spiritual pursuit during this period.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I became proud on account of my few good works.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For years I had been learning to serve in the church, but I was dry spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was up and down all the time, living a vacillating life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I saw others loving the Lord and found myself not being able to do the same, I felt condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day a brother fellowshipped with me, and I was revived.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, this fed my pride once again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord allowed me to fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This time the fall was too great; I no longer could stand up.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the winter of 1947 I returned to Swatow and received some help.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I had the strong intention then of dropping everything to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God showed me something through a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I saw all of my relatives coming to my funeral, and I was on my way to my grave.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I told them, "Either you separate yourselves from me, or you will have to take the same way I have taken."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the end of March 1948, I received a letter from Brother Witness inviting me to come to stay for a short time in Shanghai and to attend the national co-workers' fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother Nee also agreed to let me come.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I arrived in Shanghai, and the brothers arranged for me to be a learner in the service through taking a secular job.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was not happy about this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In my fellowship with Brother Witness Lee, I was told that I was unfit, and I knew that I was unfit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later I left to join my uncle in Nanking, but I was still troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now Brother Nee has agreed to let me come to the mountain to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, I was told that I should not consider myself part of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I feel bad about this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am confused, and I am not able to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I know that I am wrong in many things.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am facing a crossroads.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not know what I should do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although I have experienced many dealings from the Lord, I have not learned many spiritual lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am a very emotional person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I love the brothers and sisters very much, but now even my emotion has no taste for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As my emotion cools down, my love for the Lord cools down as well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, I must say that this love for the Lord is still within me.</S>
