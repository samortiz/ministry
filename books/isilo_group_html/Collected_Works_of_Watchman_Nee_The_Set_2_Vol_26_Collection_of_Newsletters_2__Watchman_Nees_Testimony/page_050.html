My hunger has increased. I received your last letter and have already passed it on to the brothers and sisters in Chefoo. We thank you for giving us a distant hope. We have been calling on God for you in our prayers, asking that your body would be strong and that you would have enough strength to serve our Lord Jesus Christ and the brothers and sisters in all the localities.</p><p>We received the petition booklet that you sent us on December 1. Thank you. We really thank the Lord that He truly loves us. We can see so many brothers on the earth. Although we cannot be together in one place, we often meet together before God. When we think of the brothers, we think of Christ; when we think of Christ, we think of the brothers. This is a very sweet matter!</p><p>Please deeply thank our dear brothers in the Lord for us&mdash; Brothers Lee Kuan Hsun, Ma Ti Sheng, Chang Yang Teh, Jan Ch'i Yu, Yang Chen Chung, and all the other brothers. When I was in Hangchow, I enjoyed so much service from them.</p><p>How has Brother Chang Ming Ching been recently? I think of him often. Brother Witness Lee came to Chefoo some time ago (I think you know this) to shepherd the brothers. There was a six-day conference, and the condition was very good. Please remember the assembly in Chefoo especially in your prayer. Ask God to raise up faithful ones to serve the Lord. May you be blessed with peace!</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chao Pi Chen<br />December 1, 1934</p><p>P.S. The brothers in many localities hope that there can be a conference in Chefoo next summer. Please pray for this so that the responsible brothers would understand more and pursue the Lord's will more. Sister Miao is better now because we anointed her and prayed for her. She is still physically weak, however, but we thank the Lord for this.</p><h2 class="head2">Two</h2><p>Dear Brother Witness:</p><p>It has been more than a month since you left Chefoo, and we haven't received any letter from you. We really miss you. You are probably very busy. We are all very well now; therefore, we really thank the Lord. He causes us to see His blessing in everything among us. The atmosphere in the meetings is very free. The brothers and sisters are striving in one accord for the furtherance of the gospel of God. In the last few Lord's Day meetings, we have seen some revival.</p><p>On the Lord's Day of January 20, we had another baptism meeting. Five brothers and five sisters were baptized. Two of the brothers were baptized in obedience to the Lord, but they can also be counted as finally being clearly saved. The other three are new believers. Two sisters were baptized to obey the Lord, and three were newly saved. We baptized them indoors because it was too cold outside.</p><p>Brother Chung Wen Shao, who used to be responsible in Nanking, came from Tientsin to Chefoo on business. We really thank the Lord that he came with Brother Cheng Liang P'u, who is the younger brother of Brother Cheng in Shanghai. He was also baptized into the Lord this time. They went to Tsingtao around the twenty-second.</p><p>Sister Hsia Yu Chieh of Lung Kou came to Chefoo to fellowship with us on January 19. Please pray much for the assembly in Chefoo. Ask the Lord to revive and keep us. May you have peace!</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chao Pi Chen<br />January 21, 1935</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 26: Collection of Newsletters (2) & Watchman Nee's Testimony &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
