Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
According to the Bible there are three main ministries in God's divine dispensation: the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood
To say that a priest is a person who serves God is right, but to say that to serve God is merely to do something for God, is wrong
He must contact God be filled with God and be possessed by God completely that he may be built up with others in the flow of the life of God
The main function of a priest is not to work, but to spend time in the presence of the Lord until he is one with Him in the spirit
Some may argue with me, because according to the record of the Old Testament a priest is one who offers sacrifices for sins
The priest must also enter the Holy Place to spread the showbread on the table, light the lamp, and burn the incense on the golden altar
Spreading the bread on the table, lighting the lamp, and burning the incense are related to the finer experiences of Christ
Although Adam had no need to offer any kind of sacrifice, we must realize that before the fall he was in the presence of God all the time
Adam was not to do anything for God, but to take Him again and again as the life supply so that he would be filled with God
The mercy and sovereign grace of God brought him back again and again to the outer court the Holy Place and eventually to the Holy of Holies
Jacob the supplanter was transformed into a priest of God who lived in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies
He helped them pass through the Red Sea and eventually was brought to Mount Sinai where he stayed for forty days
When they were brought out of Egypt to Mount Sinai, the Lord told them that He would make them a kingdom of priests
It is a group of people filled, saturated, and permeated with God, in order that God might flow out of them as His corporate expression
Their writings indicate that they spent most of their time in God's presence to be filled and permeated with Him
It is not a matter of working for the Lord, but a matter of being possessed by the Lord in the presence of His shekinah glory
Through the church's degradation, Saints this office desolate; Through the weakness of their spirits Preaching doth predominate
Most are leaning on the message, And the preaching emphasize, Yet neglect the priestly praying, And their spirits' exercise
Only serving by our praying, Will our spirits mingled be; Stressing prayer as much as preaching- Thus the church is built for Thee
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God
We must also read a verse from 2 Samuel, 'And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod'
In the last chapter, we saw that a priest is the type of person that God planned to have for the fulfillment of His purpose
He is not merely a person serving the Lord, but one who is in reality mingled with the Lord to fulfill His purpose
Not many Christians talk about the eternal purpose of the Lord, because very few are clear about God's ultimate intention
In other words, God comes into man to be fully one with man, so that it is hard to discern which part is God and which part is man
The tree of knowledge reminded him that Satan is the source of death, and the tree of life, that God is the source of life
It was the tree of knowledge, and any consideration of doing something for the Lord comes from the same source
The Lord's only intention is for us to open ourselves to Him and let Him come into us to fill us and be one with us
From the beginning to the end of the Bible, the tree of life signifies that God is our life supply and our enjoyment in life
The more we enjoy Him, the more we will be taken over by Him; and the more we enjoy Him, the more we will be one with Him
There are many, many ways to speak about this one thing: to breathe Him, to take Him, to drink Him, and even to absorb Him as the sunlight
If we read the whole Bible, we will see that these godly persons were priests who fulfilled the purpose of God
If we read the book of Daniel, we will see that he was spiritually a priest, even though he was not one legally
Further on in Acts, it was while Peter was spending time in the presence of the Lord that the heavenly vision came
The calling was simply an expression of the Lord through those people who were filled and saturated with God Himself
It was there that he saw the Lord the visions about the church the New Jerusalem and even the judgments that will be exercised on the earth
Remember, it was Peter and John who told us that we have been made priests, even the kingly priests, by the Lord's redemption
The Lord redeemed them through the Passover and told them that He intended to make them a kingdom of priests or a priestly kingdom
As we have seen, the Lord Jesus who was the Priest of all priests, brought us into the priesthood through His redemption
We all must be recovered into this priesthood, which means we must be brought back into the real fellowship with the Lord
We must learn how to be possessed and occupied by the Lord until we are filled, saturated, and permeated with the Lord
We need some time to be on the 'housetop,' on the 'island of Patmos,' on the 'side of the river,' and in the 'wilderness'
What the Lord needs is a group of people who are brought into His presence and even into the Lord Himself until they are one with Him
These verses clearly present two main things related to man: the image of God and the authority over the earth
Prophecies shall fail, tongues shall cease, and knowledge shall vanish away, but what about the priesthood and the kingship?
Having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him Who created him'
The prophethood helps the priesthood and the kingship, but it is never helped by the priesthood and the kingship
Which of the three main ministries is related to the image of God and which is related to the divine authority?
Even in the Old Testament dispensation Moses was a priest, not only by birth, but also in reality, because he was in the image of the Lord
Only a priest could have such an image, because only a priest can enter into the Holy of Holies and stay in the shekinah glory of God
Not many will spend time to open themselves to the Lord and remain in the shekinah glory of God as a real priest
There are different opinions, different concepts, different teachings and ideas, all of which only create divisions
Once we enter into the priesthood and are brought into the shekinah glory of the Holy of Holies, all of our concepts will be swept away
Prophecies shall fail, tongues shall cease, knowledge shall vanish away, but the priesthood will remain forever!
As long as we are living, walking, and serving according to the new man, we are in the image of God and in the reality of the priesthood
After the day of Pentecost, Peter and the others were in the presence of the Lord and were even filled with the shekinah glory of the Lord
To be an elder, one must be in the presence of the Lord as a priest and be saturated and permeated by the Lord
When Elijah began to function as a prophet, all the priests had disappeared; even the doors of the temple were closed
When a preacher comes, people gather to listen to his preaching, but when the preacher is gone, the people are scattered
If the priesthood were exercised, we would not so much need a prophet or a teacher as today's Christianity does
Divisions have come out of the teachings, and confusion has come out of the so-called manifestation of the gifts
Whenever we come together, we should not pay attention to teachings or anything else, but simply exercise the priesthood
The above two verses tell us that Christ is the Branch, and as both Priest and King He shall build the temple of the Lord
They are branches of the Branch, and they must also bear the two-fold ministry of the priesthood and the kingship
Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it
The governor and the high priest were the ones to take care of the building of Gods temple but they were a little weak and even discouraged
God only sends the prophet to strengthen the priesthood and kingship that they might build up the house of the Lord
We are in the fellowship of the priesthood, and the flow of this fellowship brings the authority of the throne with it
We have been born in the house of God as priests and kings; now we must be bold enough by His grace to take up this position
We must also open ourselves to the Lord for Him to possess us and saturate us with Himself that He may flow out of us
We do not come to teach others, but we open ourselves to the Lord that His flow might flow through us to others
There will not be teaching with the exercise of the mind, but only the flow through the exercise of the spirit
In today's so-called church service, the minister speaks by exercising his mind, and the listeners exercise their minds to listen
It is only when the priesthood is so weak and the kingship has disappeared that the ministry of the prophet is necessary
The building of the tabernacle was without any prophets, but was very much with the priesthood and the authority
The one who prepared the way and the materials for the building of the temple was David, who was in both the kingship and the priesthood
Also, in the recovery of the temple, there was the governor of Judah with the authority of kingship, and there was Joshua, the high priest
In the two books of the recovery, Ezra and Nehemiah, Ezra was a priest, and Nehemiah was a governor with authority
There is not one book for the prophethood as such, but there are many books for the prophets to help the kingship and the priesthood
Peter 2:5 and 9 tell us that the building of the spiritual house is the priesthood and that this priesthood is holy and kingly
It is needless for you to exercise authority over others; they will sense the authority in you by your being under the authority of the Head
The authority in the church is not by organization or by voting, but is that which comes by being under the Lord's headship
By His grace we must assume this position by exercising our spirit to take the priesthood in reality and to be under the headship
We do not mean that the prophethood is unnecessary, but we must realize that the prophethood is not for the prophethood
The Lord has recovered the prophethood during the past five hundred years, but what is the Lord's purpose in recovering the prophethood?
Even the apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers mentioned in Ephesians 4:11 do not build up the Body directly
Holy priests are living stones For God's building work today; If these stones would builded be, All the priests must learn to pray
CHORUS: To the holiest often come, In the spirit touch the throne, Let the Lord flow thru in prayer, Thus the building work is done
All the saints must serve as priests, That the living stones they be; Each must priestly work perform, Then their functions we will see
In the priests the substance is Of the building work replete; When the priests their work discharge, Then God's house will be complete
Building God and man in one Is their work before the Lord; In this fellowship divine, Saints are built in one accord
When in prayer our spirits blend, Then together built are we, Then a priesthood we become, Off'ring sacrifice to Thee
Grant us grace, O Lord, that we Treasure dear the priestly call; In the spirit serve and pray, That Thy church be built withal
He is the High Priest according to the order of Aaron and also the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec
According to the order of Aaron, He, as a man, was chosen from among men to go to God with all the needs of man
According to the order of Melchisedec, as the Son of God He came from God to impart God unto us and to bless us with something of God
Genesis 14:18-20: 'And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God
Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
Originally, it was common and worldly, but since it must be mingled with the divine nature for the priesthood, it has to be holy
We must never think that we are ready to serve the Lord after going to a seminary, Bible institute, or Bible college
To be real priests, we must be holy, that is, we must be separated from all the things of this world and from all things common
Sometimes the way different brothers and sisters dress simply causes others to question Are these Christians or are they people of the world
When we come to others, after staying in the presence of the Lord, they sense something divine and kingly in us
Christ is typified by the bread and wine, which show the One who died for us and gave His body and blood for our enjoyment
We must first go into the presence of the Lord with all the names of our unbelieving friends and tell the Lord all about their needs
Many times when we go to the Lord with such a need, the Lord will first point out something in us which has to be dealt with
If we are willing to be dealt with, we will be able to stay in the presence of the Lord as holy priests for our unbelieving friends
After staying in the Lord's presence again and again for some time, the Lord will guide us to go out of His presence to our friends
After ten days, on the day of Pentecost, they came out of the presence of the Lord declaring unto the people what the Lord Jesus had done
As Peter stood there speaking, the people sensed something weighty, something divine, and something heavenly and kingly
We as priests must realize that whenever we go into the presence of the Lord with our needs and the needs of others we are holy priests
When we get right with the Lord and are saturated with His glory, we will come out of His presence as royal, kingly priests unto the people
Day by day we must be in the presence of the Lord to bring our needs and all the brothers' and unbelievers' needs to Him
We must be wholly separated unto the Lord in everything in order to bring ourselves and others into the Lord's presence
Zechariah, chapter six, clearly tells us that Christ, the Branch, will build the temple as the Priest and King, not as the Prophet
He said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD
The ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp
After the children of Israel went over the Jordan and entered the land of Canaan, the first warfare was a battle fought by the priests
The Apostle Peter tells us that he and others had to first give themselves unto prayer and then unto the ministry of the Word
Only one thing works, that is, to go to the Lord, open yourself to Him, and let Him fill and saturate you with Himself
The Lord will be your very content and reality and you as a good wife good husband good elder or deacon will be His outward manifestation
Do not ask Him to do anything, but simply open yourself to Him, and let Him fill and saturate you with Himself
In reading the history of the church and the biographies of many spiritual persons, we found the same principle
Without the priests in the Holy Place or the Holy of Holies, there is no direction for the people to work in the outer court
There will be the free course for the Lord to go on and accomplish something through us to fulfill His purpose
Since the recovery of the Lord started, five hundred years ago, the priesthood has not been recovered completely, even today
We believe that in these last years the Lord must recover this priesthood-not the universal priesthood, but the holy and royal priesthood
All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk
In the beginning of the book of Numbers, the Lord told Moses how to coordinate all these different persons into one army to fight the battle
In chapter six, while He was telling Moses how to coordinate these persons, He gave him something as a kind of supplement
Besides His ordination of the house of Aaron as priests, in the sixth chapter of Numbers, He made a supplement
Regardless of whether you are a Levite, a member of the house of Aaron, a man or a woman, the side door is open
During normal times only the main entrance is needed, but when things are abnormal, the side door is necessary
It is not by being appointed, ordained, or even chosen by the Lord, but by voluntarily consecrating yourself to Him
Samuel was not even of the house of Aaron, but he became a priest by being consecrated, separated, and lent to the Lord
Besides all this, Samuel was also a prophet, for he was the one who turned the age into the age of the kingdom with the kingship
There was the priesthood, the authority, the prophecy, and the turning of the age of degradation into the age of the kingdom
Without a doubt, we are in an abnormal state; consequently, we must realize that the priesthood by appointment or by birth is not enough
It is a very hard thing in this country to be separated from worldly enjoyment, because this is a nation of worldly enjoyment
By regeneration all Christians have been reborn priests and kings, but almost all of them have been spoiled by the wine of earthly enjoyment
To take up the standing of the priesthood, we must voluntarily be completely separated from everything of the grape
The Lord's recovery can only be prevailing through a priesthood which is entirely separated from earthly pleasures and worldly enjoyment
Under today's degradation, the Lord needs those who will pioneer the way in absolute consecration-a consecration without any reservation
In this country you can speak to Christians about anything except separation from the world and the denial of self-glory
The third item in the Nazarite's consecration is to not be defiled by anything dead, especially by the death of our nearest relatives
Our business with the Lord is our business with the Lord; it must not be involved with anything of our natural affection
It is simply because of these three things: earthly pleasure or entertainment, self-glory, and natural affection
We may have overcome our natural affections, but one day in the church, a brother standing by us dies very suddenly
We do not exercise ourselves to taste the good things, but to enjoy the trash can-the gossip, the criticism, and the murmuring
We must volunteer to be a Nazarite, such as Samuel, who turned the age of degradation into the age of the kingdom
It was a Nazarite like John the Baptist who turned the Old Testament dispensation into the New and ushered in the Lord Jesus Christ
O how blessed is the priest's life, Christ to him is all in all: All his clothing, food, and dwelling, And his portion therewithal
CHORUS: O how blessed is the priest's life, Christ to him is all in all: All his clothing, food, and dwelling, And his portion therewithal
All the clothing of his service Is the beauty of the Lord; Glorious splendor do his garments, Breast and shoulder-piece afford
When in sacrifice he offers Christ to God as God has willed, Then as food he doth enjoy Him And is with His riches filled
Putting on the Lord as clothing, Christ without he doth express; Eating, drinking, with Him mingled, Christ within doth him possess
Holy, glorious is their dwelling, 'Tis the increase of the Lord; Here the priests built up together Unto God a house afford
All his portion, all his living, Everything the priests possess- All is Christ and Christ forever, In His all-inclusiveness
According to the types revealed in the Old Testament, the relationship between the priesthood and Christ is clearly manifested
Gradually, we will discover that Christ is not only our food, but also God's food and God's satisfaction, for He is the burnt offering
Christ has dealt with their sinful nature, so by His death they can be set free from Sin which dwells in their body
He has been resurrected; thus, we must know the power of His resurrection as the living One who is waving within us all the time
For us to be in the priesthood, we must experience these aspects of Christ and then help others to experience Christ in such a way
Also, they must be helped to realize the resurrected Christ as their wave offering and the ascended Christ as their heave offering
Most of them have not even experienced all the items of these offerings; even those who have are still in the outer court
Thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD
Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant'
When we come to the meetings or contact those in other places, we can present Christ to them as the inner life
Christ is within us, but we must experience Him as the indwelling One and the hidden One within who is our life supply
If you pray, just asking the Lord to take care of your trouble, then you are an outward Christian, that is, a Christian in the outer court
Perhaps, after you pray in this way, the Lord will take away your trouble, and you will shout, 'Hallelujah, praise the Lord'!
We will not just read the Bible by exercising our mind to gain some knowledge teaching or doctrine but something within will be enlightening
We all must experience these items of Christ in the Holy Place: Christ as the inner life and Christ as the inner light
When we experience Christ as the light of life, something within is enlightening and controlling us by the inner light
Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it
When Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations'
When we experience Christ in such an inner way, He becomes our inner life, our inner supply, and our inner light
We must experience the riches of Christ and then bear the living, all-inclusive Christ as the very testimony of God
We have seen five things which must be taken care of by the priesthood: the offerings, the showbread, the lamp, the incense, and the ark
The sixth item which the priesthood must take care of is the tabernacle, which typifies the enlarged Christ as the dwelling place of God
After we, as the priesthood, richly experience Christ, we must take care of the whole church, the whole Body of Christ
In chapter four of Numbers, the priests take care of the tabernacle-the boards, the coverings, and all the utensils within the tabernacle
The priests must take care of the tabernacle, whether it is set in a certain place, or while it is traveling on a long journey
We must continue to examine the relationship between Christ and the priesthood by seeing the living of the priests
Of course, besides food and clothing, there is the matter of their dwelling, which will be covered in the next chapter
The right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for a heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings
He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part
Leviticus 7:6-7 says, 'Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy
As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it'
Like the businessman who handles a certain kind of merchandise, so the priests handle Christ as their merchandise
Christians today are very careless about Christ, and many real Christians do not even relate the word 'enjoyment' to Christ
The showbread is one of the foods for the priests, and we have seen that it signifies Christ as our life and life supply
To handle Christ as the showbread and to minister Him to others, we must first enjoy and feed on Him as the showbread
They shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work
It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together
Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof
Now in the church some may say that he is such a good brother, but before he was saved he was just as good as he is now!
You may say that he is a good brother with a good character, but the flavor or sweet odor of Christ in his outward behavior is missing
When Christ as all these things has been wrought into us, these things will emanate from us as the very expression of Christ
The garments of the priests also contain the aspect of building, signified by the precious stones built into the gold
Jasper and onyx as well as many other precious stones are built up in that golden city the New Jerusalem which is the dwelling place of God
We will eventually be filled and saturated with Christ, and He will become our outward expression and manifestation
Finally, in this building are the 'Urim' and 'Thummim' as the revelation of the Lord's mind concerning His people
Finally, the revelation will come from the Lord through His built-up Body, showing us His mind about His people
May the Lord reveal all these things to us in a practical way that we as priests may experience Christ as our inner food and outer clothing
Thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle'
When we are clear that the new man is the Body of Christ, we can understand that to put on the new man simply means to put on the Body
The food we take in is the inner supply, and the clothing we wear is the outer expression of what we have taken in
The clothing of the priest is mainly composed of five different elements: gold, fine linen, blue, purple, and scarlet
Others will realize that we are not only human beings, but that we have something higher, something which no human words can express
Next, our expression of Christ must also have the fine linen, which signifies the pure righteousness of Christ
We must always be showing others that we cannot live without the scarlet color meaning that we cannot live without the Lords redeeming blood
In our expression of Christ we must give others the impression that we always have the realization we are sinful, defiled, and dirty
It is very interesting to notice that the garments of the priests are composed of the same materials as the tabernacle
Priesthood' in Hebrews 7:11 means the office of the priests, but here in 1 Peter 2:5, it means the body of priests
When we are filled and saturated with Christ, expressing Him in an accurate and full way, we will become God's dwelling place
Where there are the priests, there is always the tabernacle, and where there is the tabernacle, there are always the priests
Many times we express self, the flesh, the soul, the old man, and the natural life, instead of the gold of the divine nature
When we are filled with Christ and express Him in a proper way, we become part of the church and the church is always with us
Teaching by itself can never help people to be dependent, because dependency comes through a transforming work
When we are transformed into the image of Christ and express Him fully, automatically our individualism will be gone
It is only when we feed on Christ and become filled and saturated with Him that we will be transformed into His image
While we enjoy Christ as our nourishment and food and digest Him, He will be saturating and permeating us so that we may express Him
The building up of the church is in the expression of Christ, and this expression comes out of the enjoyment of Christ
Regardless of how many teachings we learn or how many gifts we have, merely by these we cannot have a genuine church life
For one and a half centuries many teachings have been taught in Christianity, but divisions have always been the result
The church life through the priesthood does not come out of merely teachings or gifts, but out of the inner life
In this building of the church we will have the revelation of the Urim and the Thummim to tell us the right way to go on with the Lord
Thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof
The church life is not a kind of human society or religious organization, but is Christ expressed through so many Christians
By shining, electricity becomes the light, and the light is the glory, that is, the expression and the manifestation of the electricity
Within Him is the content of God and all that God is, and upon Him God is expressed and manifested as the glory
When we see the daily living of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels, we see what glory is, and how short of it we fall
The church must have the two cherubim as the manifestation of God's glory, and this glory is continually watching and finding the shortages
When we come to contact the Lord, these two cherubim look at us and check us according to the Ten Commandments
The content of the church life is not according to the standard of human conduct; it is absolutely according to God's glory
The only way we can stand before the testimony of God and the watching eyes of the cherubim of God's glory is by the precious blood
It is a deep and inward Christ, a Christ full of all that God is, and a Christ who is the hidden supply and the resurrection power within us
It is not simply Christ as the trespass offering, the sin offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, or the burnt offering
He is the embodiment of God, and He is the deeper, inner, hidden enjoyment to us as well as the resurrection power
The church life which God is seeking today is something like the tabernacle that is the dwelling of the priesthood
If we would live in the deep part of our spirit, eventually we would have a kind of life that would correspond to God's glory
He is seeking a body of priests who are saturated and permeated with Him to become the testimony of God and the content of the church life
The priest's position holy is; He sacrifices e'er to God, Beholds His beauty, incense burns Of prayer before the Lord
CHORUS: Let us the incense burn Of prayer before the Lord; The lamp we'd light, through day and night Our praise to Him outpoured
No natural light, but just the lamp Within the Holy Place gives sight; Whene'er the priest the incense burns, The lamp he too must light
The grace of God let us extol And stir our heart sweet praise to sing; For priests not only light the lamp, But constant praises bring
Ill offer prayers as incense burns Christs resurrection bring therein Gods wish thus meet His heart give joy And Ill rejoice with Him
Unto the Lord His praise I'll sing As holy priests their songs did raise; O may my heart be filled with Him His love and grace to praise
I'll offer Christ to God in prayer, I'll read the Word, His light to know, For all His grace I'll sing His praise, The Spirit then may flow
Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help'
We must keep in mind that when we use the word 'priesthood,' it does not only mean the office of the priests, but also the body of priests
The army of God in the Old Testament was a priestly army, and even the Apostle Paul preached the gospel as a priestly evangelist
We know that we must have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact the Lord by the blood through a new and living way
When a priest is going to enter into the Holy of Holies, he not only has to pass through the altar and the laver, but also through the veil
Many kinds of offerings, such as the trespass offering and the sin offering, must be offered to the Lord there
It is not just to deal with the evil, wrong, and bad things; even the right, humble, and good self has to be dealt with
The genuine church life comes out of the expression of Christ, and the expression of Christ comes out of these dealings
Unless we are willing to deal with all our sin and sins, our worldliness, and our fleshly self, we can never be in the Holy of Holies
Many times we are kept away from the throne of grace and the mercy seat simply because we are vindicating ourselves
On the contrary, the more we repudiate, renounce, and deny ourselves, the more we have the deep sense that we are touching the mercy seat
When we argue, quarrel, or fight with others, the Dove is gone, the mercy seat is gone, and the presence of the Lord is gone
We are with the Lord in the Holy of Holies, where nothing as a veil or covering can keep us from being thoroughly saturated with Him
The building up of the Body is in the expression of Christ, and the expression of Christ comes from the inner enjoyment of Christ
When we have passed through all these dealings, we are spontaneously in the Holy of Holies, and we are at the mercy seat
In Hebrews the mercy and grace flow out of the throne of grace, and in Revelation the water of life flows out of the throne of the Lamb
When the self is gone, we are in the heavenlies, and the real expression of Christ will be our genuine church life
The church is in the Holy of Holies under the mercy seat, enjoying the bountiful riches of Christ and His resurrection power
We must all keep ourselves in the Holy of Holies at the mercy seat, enjoying the hidden manna and the budding rod all the time
Spontaneously, we will be in the Holy of Holies at the mercy seat enjoying Christ as the hidden manna and resurrection power
Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help'
Sometimes they are excited, sometimes sorrowful, and sometimes they are just wondering whether to do this or that
Some say that there might be something wrong in the manuscript, and they insist that 'altar' must be translated 'censer'
That is, at the time of the New Testament, the altar of incense must be behind the veil, because to burn the incense is to pray
According to the Greek manuscript of Hebrews 9, the altar of incense is now behind the veil in the Holy of Holies
We must believe in the authority of the Holy Spirit who composed the New Testament with the incense altar inside the veil
The Old Testament had only the law within the ark, but Hebrews 9 has the law plus the hidden manna and the budding rod within the ark
It also tells us that the ark, which typifies Christ, and the incense altar, which signifies our prayer, are both within the Holy of Holies
We have been talking about considering, thinking, being excited, and being decisive or indecisive as the real proofs that we are in the soul
The only way for us to get into the spirit is to pray, but not to pray according to our thinking, opinions, concepts, or understanding
Because we are so used to thinking in our mind, even while we are praying we leave the spirit and get into the mind again
On the contrary, after being regenerated we are still in the soul, exercising our mind, our wisdom, our knowledge, our understanding, etc
Every sister who is so clever, highly educated, and adequately cultured has a hard-dealing husband, plus some troublesome little children
If we are too clever and too much in the mind, the Lord's sovereign hand will prepare a proper husband or wife for us
Let us suppose that among us there is such a clever sister who loves the Lord, yet she is so capable and so much in her mind
She could never be a precious stone set into the gold on the breastplate of the priest to be built up together with others
When we pray, it is not to get into the spirit to contact the Lord, but to ask the Lord to do something for us
We are in the priesthood only when we are outside the soul and in the spirit contacting the Lord to be filled with Him
Whenever things come to us, we do not exercise our minds to consider or think, but we exercise our spirits to contact the Lord
If we do not exercise our spirits in this way, we can never be in the real priesthood and we will be out of the church life
Where is the real building, the real relatedness, the real coordination, the real unity, and the real oneness?
When we are outside the spirit, we are outside the oneness; consequently, there can be no realization of the priesthood
Only with such a group of priests can there possibly be the real church life, the real building, the real oneness, and the real unity
The urgent need today is not to try to solve problems by talking, teaching, or certain kinds of understandings
All the quarrels will vanish, and we will have the unity, the oneness, and the priesthood-the real church life
Revelation 8 also says that the rich sweetness and preciousness of Christ are ready to be added to the prayers of the saints
Whenever we have some trouble with others, we must turn that trouble into prayer, because that trouble will keep us in the soul
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life
By the life with this nature man will be transformed into pearl and precious stones which are good for the building of God's house
As we have seen, the wooden nature signifies the human nature, and the golden nature signifies the divine nature
Even the onyx stones by themselves are separated, but after being set into the gold, they are built up together
Now we must read 1 Corinthians 3:11-12: 'For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ
We are the living stones built up together as a spiritual house-a house in the spirit and filled with the Spirit
God looks like jasper, and the wall of the city is built up with jasper, so the appearance of the city must be like the image of God
When we all get into the spirit, live in the spirit, move in the spirit, and function with one another in the spirit, we are all one
The verses that we have read from the first book to the last book of the Bible show us the full vision of the Scriptures
There is only one thing we must learn, that is, to realize that the Lord is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit
It is easy for us to tell these brothers that they must pray, but sometimes the more they pray, the more dissenting they are
Would we be willing to forget our mentality and our understanding and take care of the deepest part of our being, the spirit?
The habitation of God is something in the spirit, so we must be filled with the Spirit, baptized in the Spirit, and drink of the Spirit
If we would just forget about all these things and turn to the spirit, immediately we would sense that everything is so simple
Spontaneously we will not only be built up together but blended together under the authority of the divine order expressing the image of God
Negatively, we must forget about all the things of our background; and positively, we must constantly pay our attention to the spirit
All the things that happen to us are simply to force us to forget about our ability, our energy, our wisdom, and our knowledge
All these things are to force us to turn ourselves to the spirit to pray that we might be filled with the Lord
Since we have had a review of the whole vision of the Scriptures, it is unnecessary for us to try to remember all the points of the message
Our concepts will be cast down, our decisions will be overthrown, and our whole being will be radically changed
The poor and pitiful situation today is that many dear ones in the church are dull in the spirit, but keen in gossiping
The building up of the Body, the spiritual house, is a holy priesthood, which is something wholly, thoroughly, and absolutely in the spirit
In the spirit we will be blended with one another to have the priesthood, the church life, and the building up of the Body
And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it
When Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations'
The tabernacle was composed of the Holy Place, the Holy of Holies, and the outer court which was outside the tent itself
The incense altar was in the Holy Place before the ark, but in the Old Testament, it was separated from the ark by the veil
The brazen altar was for the priests to offer all the sacrifices to God, and the blood of those offerings was shed upon this altar
The sin offering was slain upon the outer altar and some of the blood was brought to the inner altar to be put on its four corners
Not only the righteousness and holiness of God demand and require something of man, but the glory of God does, also
If man is to enter the Holy of Holies to meet God at the mercy seat, he must first pass through the process of redemption
Without the redeeming blood of Christ, we can never fellowship with God, and our prayers will never be acceptable to Him
The incense offered at the golden altar is something coming forth and going back, and this something is Christ
When they bring the blood into the Holy Place, within them is the offering, and without is the blood of the offering
The answer is this: Christ on the offering altar is quite coarse, but Christ on the incense altar is very fine
It is this same fire which consumes the offerings on the brass altar that must burn the incense on the incense altar
It is in this sweet odor, this sweet fragrance of the incense, that the priest can commune and fellowship with God
When we pray to God, we must apply Christ as our sin offering, as our trespass offering, and as so many other offerings
We will utter something from within-not from our mind or mentality, but something of Christ from deep within our spirit
To pray means to apply Christ as all the offerings, to enjoy Christ as nourishment, and then to utter something of Christ from deep within
Although they always say that they ought to pray, it is regrettable that very few Christians know the proper meaning of prayer
They can never get into the spirit, which is the Holy of Holies, because they do not apply Christ as all the different offerings
It really takes time to burn the incense, but my deep feeling is that Christians today do not need anything else
What we need is the priesthood with the priestly function, that is, to burn the incense through all the offerings
It means, first of all, that before we spend time in the presence of God to burn the incense, we must always apply the blood
Strange fire is our natural emotion, our natural enthusiasm, our natural energy, or our natural effort in prayer
Today, the church's urgent need is for all believers to practice the priestly office of burning the incense in the presence of God
We will express something of Christ from within to God, which will bring us into the presence of God and bring back the glory of God
By such spiritual fellowship we will become one with God and be fully saturated with Him to have the real expression of Christ
In this expression of Christ, we will commune and converse with God so as to bring us into God and God into us
Something very sweet ascending to God and something very glorious descending into us will saturate us and make us the real priesthood
We must forget about all the talking and discussion and simply spend time in the presence of God to burn the incense
And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always
Let us read Exodus 30710 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning when he dresseth the lamps he shall burn incense upon it
When Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations
Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon
In these verses, to dress the lamps means the same as to arrange or to order the lamps in chapter twenty-seven
Finally, we must read John 15:7: 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you'
We need to be impressed that the burning of the incense is the central matter of everything in the tabernacle, God's dwelling place
In the Holy of Holies there is the ark, which is a type of Christ, and it is on this ark that God meets with His people
There is the lampstand, the showbread table, and there is also the golden incense altar for the priests to burn the incense
If we look at a chart of the tabernacle showing all these things, we see that the incense altar is the very center of the whole tabernacle
In the church there is the reality of Christ as the ark in which, on which, and by which God can meet man and man can meet God
The blood of the offering altar has to be brought into the tabernacle and sprinkled upon the four corners of the incense altar
Without the effectiveness of the redemption of Christ through the power of the blood, our prayer will never be acceptable
If we are not satisfied and filled with Christ as our enjoyment, how can we offer Christ to God as His enjoyment?
Before reading the Word she intends to pray in this way: 'Lord, You know my husband has a bad temper, and it is so easy for him to lose it
Many intended prayers are simply canceled by reading the Word, and so many right prayers come out of the reading of the Word
If we exercise our spirit to contact the Word, immediately we sense something enlightening and rising up within our spirit
The Spirit will come out and the Word will be lightened; the lamp will be lit for us to be under its enlightening
The Lord Jesus said, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you'
We must learn how to exercise our spirit so that the Holy Spirit may have a free way to enlighten the Word of God that we may get the light
Under this enlightening, we will have the utterance to express something which issues out of Christ as the sweet incense to God
May the Lord be merciful to us that we may meet God and fellowship with Him day by day, morning and evening, in this way
Thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about
Thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof
Thou shalt make the dishes thereof and spoons thereof and covers thereof and bowls thereof to cover withal of pure gold shalt thou make them
Thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it
Thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD
Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant
According to the record of the Old Testament, there are at least two other things in the Holy Place: the showbread table and the lampstand
They are two aspects of one thing just as the children of Israel had the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire
It is in this enlightenment that we know how to pray and how to utter something of Christ unto God as the sweet incense
Some people receive light when they read the Bible, but this receiving of light depends to a certain extent on the enjoyment of life
In order for us to burn the incense in a proper way, we need the light, but to get the light, we need the life
From the offering altar we must go to the showbread table, and from the showbread table we make a curve to the lampstand
To say that we can pray solely on the basis of being saved and sprinkled with the blood is not altogether true
Our prayer will be something issuing out of Christ-something so sweet-just as the sweet, fragrant incense to God
In other words, we must come to the offering altar to confess all our shortcomings, our sins, and our filthiness
Whenever we are going into the Holy Place, we need not only to touch the offering altar, but also to stay there
When we get up early in the morning, we must stay at the offering altar for some time, realizing that we are sinful
You will have the sense that you simply do not know where you are-you cannot say whether you are in the heavenlies or on the earth
A wick is a bundle of loosely twisted, soft spun cotton used to draw up the oil of the lamp or the melted wax of a candle to be burnt
When we contact the Lord, to begin with, we must stay at the altar of offering to confess our failures and to apply the blood
We must stay at the offering altar, then make a curve to the showbread table to enjoy the Lord as our food for a while
And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it'
There are two rows of the showbread, but here there are four rows of stones, each row with three precious stones
In addition to the four rows of twelve pieces of precious stones, two other things are put on the breastplate: the Urim and the Thummim
We have seen in past chapters that this breastplate is made of two kinds of materials: gold and twelve pieces of precious stones
The twelve layers of the foundation are twelve pieces of precious stones, and upon the foundation the wall is built with jasper
From the table he turns to the lampstand, and from the lampstand he goes to the incense altar to burn the incense
The high priest enters into the Holy of Holies with a plate upon his breast which is a building of gold and precious stones
In order to help us get into the full meaning of the breastplate, we must know why there are twelve cakes and seven lamps
When we look at the showbread table, with twelve cakes arrayed in two rows, we are given the sense of a kind of dispensational arrangement
At the lampstand there is the divine administration, and at the showbread table there is the divine dispensation with and in life
At the showbread table there is the dispensation, at the lampstand there is the administration, and at the altar there is redemption
When we get into the enjoyment of Christ, we are in the divine dispensing of God Himself in Christ through the Spirit as life to us
The twelve pieces of stones with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel represent the transformation of the people of God
Regardless of how spiritual we are and how much we have been transformed, just by ourselves we do not have perfection
Even if we have attained to the highest spirituality, we still need Christ to be added as light and perfection
The Hebrew alphabet has twenty-two letters, but only eighteen of those letters are used in composing the names of the twelve tribes
The four missing letters are engraved on this piece of stone and put into the breastplate to make the complete alphabet
Whenever there was a problem within the nation of Israel, they brought this problem to the Lord by means of the breastplate
The children of Israel had to move and take action, not by their own opinion or judgment, but by the divine will and judgment
The building of the breastplate is a picture of the building up of all the people of God, that is, the Body of Christ
After we are in God's presence, there must be the fresh light for us to read the letters to determine God's will
Romans 12 says that we should be transformed by the renewing of the mind; then we will prove the will of the Lord
In order to know the Lord's judgment, they must have the breastplate, which is the building up of the Lord's people
We must know how to read the church, the brothers and sisters, with Christ as the light and perfection in the presence of God
