   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having the Faculties Exercised</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After one has a renewed understanding, he must still have his faculties exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He must be able to touch the spirit's feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews 5 says that the faculties must be exercised for discriminating between both good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be exercised means to learn to follow the feeling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 12 speaks of the renewing of the understanding, while Hebrews 5 speaks of the exercising of the faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means to learn to respond to the sense of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is analogous to the growth of a child.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the process of his growth, he learns different things, and he develops different sets of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he is young, he has one set of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he grows up, he has another set of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A brother or sister starts his or her learning from the time he or she is regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A young man of twenty years old must be very careful about how he develops his emotion and mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has to grow in the right direction.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By forty years old, he can be considered a grown up and mature person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same can be said of our spiritual consciousness; we have to exercise ourselves to develop it as early as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to know what is the restraining of the Spirit, what is the urging of the Spirit, the leading of the Spirit, and the forbidding of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do not know these things, you are still a child as far as being a Christian is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You are like a forty-year-old man with a sensitivity of a ten-year-old boy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Christian is different from a person in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You cannot live by the set of feelings you acquired in your physical growth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to acquire a new set of feelings, the spiritual feelings you received at the time of your regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let me repeat this word again and again to the elders: If the leading ones are not quick and sharp enough in spiritual consciousness, the whole church will be led astray; there will not be the manifestation of the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not know the activities of the Holy Spirit within you individually, there is no way for the Holy Spirit to get through in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A blind man has one set of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, once his eyes are opened, he will have another set of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The set of feelings a Christian acquires after regeneration is very special.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not learn to exercise them, you will not be able to help the brothers and sisters develop a spiritual consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are many feelings which are hard to explain; you can only acquire them through practice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you do not practice, you will not be conscious of anything even when your feelings go astray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is like a blind man whose consciousness of everything is black.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to pray to the Lord that He would maintain our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a lesson that goes on for the rest of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one can say that he has graduated in the matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot make any mistake in our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to maintain its freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After this we have to learn to exercise our spirit and acquire spiritual feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not try to touch things with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A blind man is very exercised in his auditory faculty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He exercises his ears not only to listen to the radio but to everything around him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But once his eyes are open, he will try to see everything; he will exercise his seeing faculty.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He will even try to examine the radio receiver with his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before a person is saved, he pays much attention to his mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He uses these faculties a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But after he is saved, he can no longer be carried away by the vain mind, the old emotion, and the weak will in discerning the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, he has to exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A FEW POINTS OF FELLOWSHIP REGARDING SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The responsible brothers in a district should only bear responsibility for spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They should step forward only when the other brothers and sisters cannot fulfill their functions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even then they should not monopolize everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The meetings should be under the control of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether they act or not, they have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this reason the elders must have spiritual feelings and must be able to direct the meetings in the right direction.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the other brothers and sisters should be trained and taught how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the meetings the sisters cannot teach, but they can call hymns and testify.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the prayer meetings and bread-breaking meetings, the sisters should pray in the middle of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They should not initiate or conclude the meetings with their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They should also avoid calling hymns as much as possible, unless they are clear they have the prompting of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If anyone makes a mistake in the meeting, there is no need to correct him immediately unless, of course, the mistake is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After the meeting those who made the mistakes should be given some fellowship in love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If a brother does something wrong in the meeting, it is improper for others to keep silent in the meeting yet speak behind his back after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should speak to the erring one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But it is not love when we speak behind his back, not to his face.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is inevitable for some to make mistakes in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The only way we can be sure that everything is right is if we call the hymns, pray, and do everything ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But then we will monopolize the entire meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the one hand, we have to allow the brothers and sisters to function.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the other hand, all of them need to be adjusted and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Otherwise, they will never learn.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All the responsible ones in all the "homes" i.e., districts should meet once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At other times there should be many love feasts in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The number in each group should not be too large.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The sixth "home" has too few saints because the brothers and sisters there were somewhat separated from the church in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the future we need many gospel meetings in this district.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The brothers and sisters must also bring new ones to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not ask people to sign in all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The districts in Chan's home and Shen's home should take care of the new immigrants as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They should arrange visits to these new arrivals within the shortest possible time.</S>
