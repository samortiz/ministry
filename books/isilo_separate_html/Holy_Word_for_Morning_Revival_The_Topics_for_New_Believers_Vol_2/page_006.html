<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>1 John 5:12 He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:5, 7 ...God is light....Walk in the light...</strong></p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Attributes</h2>
<p>When we speak of God&rsquo;s attributes, we refer to all that belongs to God.<sup>31</sup> God&rsquo;s attributes refer to His characteristics. God has many attributes, and God&rsquo;s inward being is the totality of His attributes.<sup>32</sup> An attribute denotes the very element or essence of something that has not yet been expressed. When an attribute is expressed, it becomes a virtue. Strictly speaking, as men, we do not have the attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The true attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness are of God and belong to God. But when God became a man to live on this earth, the attributes of God were expressed in human virtues. The attributes are of divinity, but the expressed virtues are through humanity. Thus, the expressed attributes are virtues, and the hidden essence and element of the virtues are the attributes.<sup>33</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">Life</h2>
<p>The divine life may be considered as the first and the basic attribute of God....Actually in the whole universe only the life of God can be counted as life. First John 5:12...indicates that unless we have the life of God, we do not have life. In the sight of God only His life is life.</p>
<p>The life of God is divine and eternal. The word &ldquo;divine&rdquo; means being of God, having the nature of God. The word &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; means being uncreated, without beginning or ending, existing by itself, and ever, unchangeably existing....[Therefore,] the life of God, being divine and eternal, is immortal and unchangeable; it remains the same and continues living even after passing through any kind of blow or destruction.<sup>34</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">Love</h2>
<p>The divine love...is the nature of God&rsquo;s essence. Thus, it is an essential attribute of God. John 3:16 tells us that &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,&rsquo;&rsquo; and 1 John 4:9 says, &ldquo;In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.&rdquo; As in 1 Timothy 1:15, the &ldquo;world&rsquo;&rsquo; refers to fallen mankind, whom God so loved that, by making them alive through His Son with His own life, they might become His children. In this the love of God has been manifested.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:4 says, &ldquo;God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us.&rdquo; The object of love should be in a lovable condition, but the object of mercy is always in a pitiful situation. Hence, God&rsquo;s mercy reaches further than His love. God loves us because we are the object of His selection. But we became pitiful by our fall, even dead in our offenses and sins; therefore, we need God&rsquo;s mercy. Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us from our wretched position to a condition that is suitable for His love. The nobler love of God as His essential attribute needs His attribute of mercy to reach us in the deep pit of our fallen life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Light</h2>
<p>The divine light...is the nature of God&rsquo;s expression.... [According to Revelation 22:5,] being illumined by the Lord God will be one of the blessings to God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity. We shall have no need of a lamp, the light made by man, nor of the sun, the light created by God. God Himself will shine upon us, and we shall live under His illumination. God Himself will be the light, and Christ will be the lamp, shining out God to enlighten the entire city [21:23].</p>
<p>Today the divine light as God&rsquo;s expressive attribute is applied to us in our Christian life. First John 1:5-7 tells us that God is light and that if we fellowship with Him we should walk in the divine light. This indicates that we can enjoy this expressive attribute of God even in this age before the New Jerusalem will come in the new heaven and the new earth.<sup>35</sup></p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
