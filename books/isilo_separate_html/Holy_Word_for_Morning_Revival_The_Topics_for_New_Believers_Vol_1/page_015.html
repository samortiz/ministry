It is a unique book. The sixteenth President of the United States of America, Abraham Lincoln, once said that &#8220;the Bible is the best gift God has ever given to man. All the good from the Savior of the world is communicated to us through this book.&#8221; It is the world&#8217;s most widely read book and has been translated into over one thousand languages, more than any other book in the world....The word Bible comes from the Greek word biblos, which means &#8220;the book.&#8221; This means that the Bible stands as the unique book among all other books in the world.<sup>63</sup></p><p>The Bible is inspiring because it is the Word of life, the living Word. It is living because it is the expression of the living God.<sup>64</sup></p><p>In the Godhead Christ is the Word of life....The phrase &#8220;the Word of life&#8221; in Greek indicates that the Word is life. In His person Christ is the divine life, the eternal life, which we can touch.<sup>65</sup> [Thus], the Word is living, a divine person, Christ the Son of the living God (Rev. 19:13). The eternal Word is our Lord Jesus Christ [John 1:1], and the living Word is also He [1 John 1:1]. Furthermore, Christ is the written Word, the holy writings, the Bible (Heb. 10:7; Luke 24:27, 44). Christ is also the spoken Word, the rhema, the instant word to be spirit and life to man (John 6:63). Therefore, Christ is the eternal Word, the living Word, the written Word, and the spoken Word.<sup>66</sup></p><p>God&#8217;s intention in His economy [plan] is to dispense Christ into us, and for this dispensing there must be some means. The Bible is the means that God uses to dispense Christ into us.</p><h2 class="head1">Two Ways to Touch the Bible</h2><p>There are two ways to touch the Bible: the outward way and the inward way. The outward way to touch the Bible is by exercising our mind merely to understand it, while the inward way is by using our spirit not mainly to understand it but to touch the spirit and get the life supply.</p><p>John 1:1 is a wonderful verse. Suppose two brothers come together to read this verse. After reading it, one brother may ask, &#8220;What does in the beginning mean?&#8221; The other brother may say, &#8220;God is the beginning.&#8221; The first brother may respond, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. How can you say that God is the beginning? I don&#8217;t understand what you are talking about. And what is the Word? This verse says that the Word was with God and the Word was God....&#8221; This is an illustration of touching the Bible in an outward way. Touching the Bible even for only a few minutes in this way is deadening.</p><p>There is another way to touch the Bible, the inward way, the way of exercising our spirit. Suppose these same two brothers come to the Word in the following way, saying, &#8220;O Lord, in the beginning. In the beginning was the Word. Amen! Hallelujah for the beginning. O Lord, the Word. Hallelujah, for the Word! And the Word was with God. O God! And the Word was God!&#8221; When we exercise our spirit to touch the Word in such a living way, we may not understand much, but we are filled with the Spirit, and we get the life supply....This is true of any verse or chapter, from the first verse of Genesis to the last verse of Revelation. Sometimes we may not understand what we read, and sometimes we may understand but not be able to utter what we see. We may even say, &#8220;Praise the Lord, I received something this morning, but I do not have the words to speak it!&#8221; This is the right way. The right way to touch the Bible is to touch the Lord Himself. We must never separate the Bible from the Lord. Whenever we open the Bible, we have to open our mouth and open our spirit to utter something to the Lord. We can say, &#8220;O Lord! O Lord Jesus!&#8221;<sup>67</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
