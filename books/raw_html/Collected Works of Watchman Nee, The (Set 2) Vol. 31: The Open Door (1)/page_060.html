<h2 class="head2">The Bible Study in Hong Kong</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>Did you receive the letter I sent from Macao on the eighteenth? (We have not received it because surface mail from Macao to Chungking takes a very long time&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Brother Nee returned to Hong Kong on the seventeenth. Yesterday evening (February 24) we began a Bible study in Kowloon, and Brother Nee is responsible for it. Peace in the Lord to you and to Sister Peace Wang, Sister Phoebe, and Brother Yu-zhi. Please greet Mrs. Yuan and Miss Chen.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip<br />February 25</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Faithful Luk<br />to Brother Weigh, Southeast Asia</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved brother in the Lord, Kwang-hsi:</p><p>Thank the Lord for leading you safely to Yunnan. Although you tasted much suffering and many difficulties, the Lord will not forget you, and your trip will not be in vain. I have been in Singapore for three or four weeks. I am ashamed to say that I am so mediocre that I cannot do much. The brothers and sisters in Singapore really hope that you and Brother Kaung can come and work here. The work on the southern islands has a great and desperate need. After meeting in this hall for two weeks, we have concluded nine evenings of meetings in the True Light Chapel of the Anglican denomination. Starting next Monday we will have four evenings of preaching on the rooftop to the Evangelistic Crusade. Greet Brother Chung Huang, Brother Kwang-tsao, the Chou brothers, and Sister Hwei-sian. May the Lord use you all very much! Peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Faithful Luk<br />January 10</p><h2 class="head2">Brother Lan Tsi-yi and the Orphanage</h2><p>Thank the Lord, my meeting with Mr. Lee with regard to the orphanage was satisfactory. He has promised to make up for the shortage in the budget, but he can only support us for one year. He has also agreed to move the orphanage, but he gave me the freedom to decide where we will move. I have been constantly praying for this matter, and I have clearly seen several things concerning this matter: (1) In order to answer to God and man, I cannot shrink back from my responsibility concerning the education of these children. (2) I cannot return to my old hired position in the orphanage. If I do, it will be completely against the leading I received when I quit. Therefore, I have decided to stand on God's side in receiving man's commission. The most marvelous thing is that Mr. Lee and Brother Yu's attitudes toward the commission are similar to mine. They say that they will do their best to supply the money needed to meet the financial needs. They will not interfere with the administration. On the one hand, I feel a great responsibility and cannot avoid being in fear and trembling; on the other hand, I am forced to take this way, so I must look to the Lord for the way ahead. May the Lord prove His faithful Word and precious promises (2 Cor. 12:9) in a weak and useless person like me. My problem now is the matter of moving. In the long run it seems better to move to a safer region, but in order to be close to the care of the brothers and sisters and in the center of the region of my personal work, it seems that I should not move from Wu-ch'ang. In my prayer I feel that it is best to settle ourselves in Wu-ch'ang. The other things that must be taken care of immediately include: (1) finding jobs for the older students, (2) hiring able brothers and sisters to be responsible for administrating and teaching, and (3) finding one or two productive means for income. Please pray for the future of this.</p><p>Your weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi<br />February 24, Hankow</p>
