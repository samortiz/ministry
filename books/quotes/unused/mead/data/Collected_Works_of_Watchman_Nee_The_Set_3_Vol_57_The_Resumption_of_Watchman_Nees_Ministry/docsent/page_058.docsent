   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Simple and Strong in Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Natural naivety and spiritual simplicity are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more a person knows the Lord, the simpler he is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But human methods always lend themselves to further complications.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A fleshly person does not have much within him, and what he has outwardly is more than what he has inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a person does not have anything inside him, but tries to assume something on the outside, he is deceiving himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither a capable mind nor a strong emotion is of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only kind of person who is of use is one with a weighty and strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A man's head occupies one-seventh of the length of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If his head took up one-third of his body, he would look ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people have a good mind, but if their mind is too strong, they look ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, if such a one matches his strong mind with a strong spirit, he will not look ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most outstanding part of a person is his nose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a man bumps into a wall or a door, the first thing that hits it is his nose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most outstanding part of our being should be our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need a large spirit, a strong spirit, a spirit that has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have this kind of spirit, when others meet us, they will meet our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If others touch only our knowledge or our disposition, we are completely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>COORDINATION AMONG THE CO-WORKERS By the Authority of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Witness Lee: Is the coordination among the co-workers just based on the ministers in the Body, or is it based on some other things?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee: Yes, there are other things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the coordination there is also the question of arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, coordination is based on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Acts of the Apostles can also be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason it can be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit is that the Spirit has the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit is like the nerves in the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is true that the Body is under the direction of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the Head rules the Body through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today the practical outworking of authority lies in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord is directing His Body through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Authority is not a thing; the Lord did not give Peter a bundle of authority and ask him to come back for more when he used up that bundle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Authority is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The authority that was manifested in Paul, John, and Peter was something given by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy Spirit coordinated these men together in different places.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Authority is a matter of being one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The principle underlying authority is oneness with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Scriptures clearly state that the work that went out from Antioch was initiated by the commissioning of the Holy Spirit Acts 13:2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only those chosen by the Holy Spirit have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The individual work of a worker before the Lord is based on his ministry in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the overall operation in the Lord's work is based on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Keeping the Principle of Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Working from the Center to the Circumference</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today we need to consider afresh the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's work began from Jerusalem Acts 1:4, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word of the Lord was that the gospel should spread from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Bible Jerusalem represents God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God set up Jerusalem as the center of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In God's eyes all the apostles were to remain in Jerusalem Acts 1:4; 8:1, 14, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will not take back a single word of what we have said in Hankow before.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No doubt the church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But in God's eyes there are centers in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What we spoke of in Hankow was the condition of the local churches when they are matured.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The failure of our work in these years is that we pass on the authority to the local churches before they are matured.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to God's order, there is first Jerusalem, and then the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our failure today lies in the fact that we have the local churches first without having a Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The order of the Lord's way is first Jerusalem, then Samaria, and then the uttermost part of the earth Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jerusalem came first, then came the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the past we did not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is why we did not learn coordination even though we had so many small churches, and why the local churches became little kingdoms under the hands of one worker with two or three responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The problem with the Lord's testimony in the past is that we did not begin from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today we have to learn first to stand on the position of oneness and begin from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not go back to the principle of Jerusalem, we will not have a proper way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some Bible expositors say that it was wrong for the apostles to remain in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They say that the apostles should not have remained in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But in the Bible, we do not see the Lord asking them to leave Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It was right for the apostles to remain in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When they went out, it was not because of persecution, but because there were those who called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Something happened in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, Jerusalem sent John and Peter out.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After they went out for a little while, they came back to Jerusalem Acts 8:14, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God needs a Jerusalem also in China.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The way of the work is that there must first be a Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In Jerusalem there were many co-workers, and there was the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There was much opportunity to learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>First there was Jerusalem, and then there was Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even Paul had to go first to Jerusalem to learn the lessons Acts 9:26-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is true that Jerusalem was a church, but it was different from an ordinary local church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In Jerusalem there were apostles and elders Acts 15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But in Philippi there were only elders and deacons Phil 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It seems that in Jerusalem the local church and the center of the work were at the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today, whether we are driven from our city by outward persecutions or whether some go out because they decide to migrate or spread out, we have to remember that there is the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord's word says that the gospel is to be preached from Jerusalem unto the uttermost part of the earth Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is a continuous principle; it continues until the uttermost part of the earth is reached.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we want a new start, we have to have a Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Unless we have a Jerusalem, there is no way to go on in the work.</S>
