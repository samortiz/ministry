[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE ONE INTRODUCTION, SUBJECT, AND CONTENTS
[2]  OF THE GOSPEL 1 Scripture Reading: Luke 1:1-4
[3]  Because Luke s Gospel is one of the synoptic Gospels concerning the Savior s humanity, its purpose is to present the Savior as a genuine, normal, and perfect Man, revealing God among men in His saving grace to fallen mankind.
[4]  The Lord s two essences were not merely added together; they were mingled together.
[5]  In the previous message we pointed out that the subject of the Gospel of Luke is the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality.
[6]  Today the very Christ who lives in us is still the One who possesses the human virtues strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes.
[7]  While He was on earth, He lived a life in the highest standard of morality.
[8]  THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF MORALITY Man Created in God s Image
[9]  At this juncture I would like to explain further what we mean by the highest standard of morality.
[10]  This means that the human essence of which the Lord Jesus partook was that created by God according to what He is the human essence with the appearance of God s love, light, holiness, and righteousness.
[11]  Although the man created by God failed to live such a life, the Lord Jesus, the Man-Savior, possessing the divine nature and the human nature, lived a life on earth with the attributes of God expressed in the virtues of man.
[12]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE THREE THE PREPARATION OF THE MAN-SAVIOR
[13]  In the two foregoing messages we covered the introduction to the Gospel of Luke 1:1-4 .
[14]  With this message we come to the second major section of this Gospel, the section concerned with the preparation of the Man-Savior in His humanity with His divinity 1:5 4:13 .
[15]  This section covers a number of matters: the conception of the forerunner of the Man-Savior 1:5-25 , the conception of the Man-Savior 1:26-56 , His forerunner s birth and youth 1:57-80 , the Man-Savior s birth 2:1-20 , His youth 2:21-52 , His inauguration 3:1-22 , His status 3:23-38 , and His test 4:1-13 .
[16]  The preparing of the way for the Savior s coming required that His forerunner be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother s womb, so that he could separate the people unto God from all things other than God, making them holy unto Him for His purpose.
[17]  THE CONCEPTION OF THE MAN-SAVIOR Conceived of the Holy Spirit in a Human Virgin
[18]  The Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence v. 35 in a human virgin with the human essence vv.
[19]  Verses 26 and 27 say, Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.
[20]  Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with both the divine and the human essences, constitutes a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, producing a God-man, one who is both the complete God and perfect Man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively, without a third nature being produced.
[21]  The conception of John the Baptist was God s miracle, accomplished with the overage human essence, merely by the divine power, without the divine essence being involved, thus bringing forth a mere man who was only filled with the Spirit of God 1:15 but lacked the nature of God.
[22]  Some who did not understand the matter of the mingling of the divine essence with the human essence in the Person of Jesus Christ taught the heresy that this mingling means that Christ was not quite God nor quite man but a third thing with a third nature, something neither God nor man.
[23]  In the previous message we began to consider the conception of John the Baptist, the Lord s forerunner, and the conception of the Man-Savior.
[24]  Elizabeth s blessing by the Holy Spirit v. 41 reveals the Savior s humanity as the fruit and His deity as the Lord v. 43 . Her blessing also confirms Mary s faith in the Lord s word v. 45 . Such a blessing indicates that Elizabeth was also a godly woman, fit for God s use in carrying out His purpose.
[25]  In 1:46-56 we have the praise of the Man-Savior s mother.
[26]  It also indicates that the Lord Jesus would grow up in a family which would be filled with the knowledge and love of God s holy Word.
[27]  In 1:48-50 Mary says, Because He has looked upon the low estate of His slave.
[28]  For behold, from now on all generations will count me blessed; because the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name; and His mercy is unto generations and generations to those who fear Him.
[29]  Both God s mercy and His grace are the expression of His love.
[30]  When we are in a pitiful condition, His mercy first reaches us and brings us into a situation where God is able to favor us with His grace.
[31]  After Zachariah wrote John s name on the tablet, his mouth was opened instantly, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke blessing God v. 64 . In 1:67-79 we have a record of Zachariah s prophecy.
[32]  According to verse 67, when Zachariah prophesied, he was filled with the Holy Spirit.
[33]  In verse 68 we have the beginning of Zachariah s prophecy: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and accomplished redemption for His people.
[34]  Here we see that Zachariah s prophecy is concerning God s redemptive move for His people unto their salvation.
[35]  God moved redemptively for the salvation of His people by raising Christ as a horn of salvation in the house of David in His humanity and as the rising sun from on high in His deity through God s rich mercy according to His holy covenant vv.
[36]  As the fruit in Elizabeth s blessing v. 42 , He is life to us John 14:6 ; as the sun in Zachariah s prophecy, He is the light to us John 9:5; Matt 4:16 . As such a One, He is the Accomplisher and the center of God s redemption for His people s salvation.
[37]  Zachariah s prophecy brings in more light concerning the divine-human Person and the saving work of the Man-Savior than is found in the blessing of Elizabeth or the praise of Mary.
[38]  If we compare Elizabeth s blessing, Mary s praise, and Zachariah s prophecy, we shall see that Zachariah s prophecy sheds more light concerning God s move on earth than is shed by either Elizabeth s blessing or Mary s praise.
[39]  In this prophecy we have a revelation of Christ in His divine-human Person and His saving work.
[40]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SIX THE PREPARATION OF THE MAN-SAVIOR IN HIS HUMANITY WITH HIS DIVINITY 4 Scripture Reading: Luke 2:1-52
[41]  In this message we shall consider the birth and youth of the Man-Savior.
[42]  His birth is described in 2:1-20, and His youth, in 2:21-52.
[43]  He gives an account of His physical circumcision according to the law of God s ordination 2:21-24 so that He might be the legal seed of Abraham Gen 17:9-14 , to be the One in whom the promise of God to Abraham in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed Gen 12:3 as the gospel preached to him Gal 3:8 , could be carried out for all the nations Gal 3:14 .
[44]  The birth of the Man-Savior was announced to the shepherds by an angel as the good news of great joy to all the people 2:8-10 .
[45]  Their work in shepherding the flock which provided not only food for man but also offerings to God and their diligence in keeping the nightwatches qualified them to be the first to receive the good news of the wonderful birth of the Savior announced by the angel.
[46]  In verses 10 and 11 the angel said to the shepherds, Do not fear, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which will be to all the people, because a Savior was born to you today in David s city, who is Christ the Lord.
[47]  Luke 2:21 speaks of the circumcising and naming of the Lord Jesus: And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise Him, His name was called Jesus, the name called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
[48]  Concerning the presenting of the Man-Savior, 2:22-24 says, And when the days were fulfilled for their purification according to the law of Moses, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord, even as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord, and to give a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves or two young doves.
[49]  In 2:36-39 we have Anna s adoration of the Child Jesus.
[50]  Anna was a widow up to the age of eighty-four, who did not depart from the temple, serving with fastings and petitions night and day v. 37 . Verse 38 says, At that very hour she came up and returned thanks to God, and spoke concerning Him to all those looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
[51]  Caring for God s Interest at the Age of Twelve
[52]  In 2:41-51 we see that the Lord Jesus cared for God s interest at the age of twelve and also subjected Himself to His parents.
[53]  Hence, twelve years old indicates that what the Lord did here was perfectly related to God s administration.
[54]  Behold, Your father and I are greatly distressed seeking You v. 48 . The Lord replied, Why is it that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father? v. 49 . This indicates that the boy Jesus was caring for the interests of God.
[55]  In 3:15-17 we have John the Baptist s recommendation of the Man-Savior.
[56]  Verse 15 says, Now while the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ.
[57]  In verses 16 and 17 John said, I indeed baptize you with water, but He who is stronger than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie; He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire; whose winnowing shovel is in His hand to thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into His barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
[58]  Here we see that although John preached a baptism of repentance, the goal of his ministry was a wonderful Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[59]  The Lord s being baptized to fulfill God s righteousness and to be put into death and resurrection brought Him three things: the open heaven, the descending of the Spirit of God, and the speaking of the Father.
[60]  In this message we shall continue to consider the inauguration of the Man-Savior 3:1-22 .
[61]  The highest standard of morality is actually the result of the God-created man Gen 1 with the human virtues created by God plus the tree of life Gen 2 , a tree that signifies God as life to us with all His divine attributes.
[62]  If we see this, we shall realize that not only does fallen man need to be set aside, but even the man created by God in His image needs to be set aside so that he may live a life that expresses God.
[63]  When the Lord Jesus came out to minister at the age of thirty, He was the representative of mankind in two aspects.
[64]  On the one hand, He represented the God-created man; on the other hand, in appearance He represented fallen man.
[65]  Have you ever realized that when the Lord Jesus came to be baptized by John, He represented the God-created man and, in outward appearance, the fallen man?
[66]  We would emphasize the fact that the Lord Jesus did not have the actual nature of fallen man, but He did have the appearance of fallen man.
[67]  Immediately after the Lord Jesus was baptized, He was anointed by God: The Holy Spirit descended in bodily form as a dove upon Him; and a voice came out of heaven, You are My beloved Son, in You I delight v. 22 . After John the Baptist had baptized the Lord Jesus, God the Father sent His Holy Spirit upon this baptized Man.
[68]  At this point I would like to say a further word concerning the Person of the Lord Jesus and His work.
[69]  The Lord s Person is His being, His existence, and His work is His ministry or His office.
[70]  Therefore, with the Lord Jesus there is the matter of His Person and the matter of His ministry.
[71]  In this message we shall consider the status and the test of the Man-Savior 3:23 4:13 .
[72]  The phrase son of God used with respect to Adam in Luke 3:38 does not mean that Adam was born of God and possessed the life of God, just as the son of Joseph does not mean that Jesus was born of Joseph, but that it was supposed that He was the son of Joseph v. 23 . Adam was created by God Gen 5:1-2 , and God was his origin.
[73]  From Jesus Luke 3:23 back to God are seventy-seven generations of the history of God s creation, man s fall, God s promise, and man s salvation: of God man was created v. 38; Gen 1:26-27; 2:7 ; in Adam man became fallen v. 38; Gen 3 ; through Abraham man received God s promise v. 34; Gen 12:1-3 ; and in Jesus who is Christ man is saved v. 23; 2:10-11 .
[74]  We need to be impressed with the fact that the genealogy of the Lord Jesus in Matthew begins with Abraham and comes down to Christ, whereas the genealogy in Luke traces backward from Jesus to God.
[75]  In Luke s genealogy four names are especially striking: God, Adam, Abraham, and Jesus.
[76]  According to Luke 4:3, the Devil said to the Lord Jesus, If You are the Son of God, speak to this stone that it may become bread.
[77]  Jesus replied, It is written, Man shall not live on bread alone.
[78]  For the Lord Jesus to accomplish His ministry, He had to defeat God s enemy, the Devil, Satan.
[79]  In Luke 4:8 we have the Lord s answer to the Devil s temptation: It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him alone you shall serve.
[80]  In Luke 4:9-11 we have the Devil s third temptation of the Man-Savior: And he led Him into Jerusalem and set Him on the wing of the temple, and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here; for it is written, To His angels He will give a charge concerning You to protect You, and, On their hands they will lift You up, lest at any time You strike Your foot against a stone.
[81]  In 1:30-35 we have the prophecy of the archangel Gabriel, who came to Mary and told her that God intended that she conceive the Man-Savior.
[82]  Third, Gabriel said, The Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father v. 32 . Here we see that in His humanity the coming Savior was to be a descendant of David.
[83]  Fourth, the archangel Gabriel refers to the coming Savior as the holy thing which is to be born and who will be called Son of God v. 35 . Therefore, according to Gabriel s word, the Man-Savior is Jesus, the Son of the Most High, a descendant of David, and the holy thing.
[84]  In the word spoken by the archangel Gabriel, Elizabeth, Zachariah, the angel who announced the Lord s birth, Simeon, and Anna we have seventeen matters related to the Man-Savior: Jesus, the Son of the Most High, the descendant of David, the holy thing, the fruit of the womb, the Lord, the horn of salvation, the rising sun, the Savior, Christ, the consolation of Israel, God s salvation, a light for the Gentiles, the glory of Israel, a test to Israel, a sign spoken against, and the redemption of God s people.
[85]  If we read carefully the first three and a half chapters of the Gospel of Luke, we shall see that the preparation of the Man-Savior involved two angels and at least five human beings.
[86]  In Genesis 1 and 2 we have a God-created man, a man who was not able to withstand the temptation of God s enemy.
[87]  If we were Adam and if we knew what we know today, it may be that we would have partaken of the tree of life immediately in order to equip ourselves with the Triune God.
[88]  Once we become equipped with the Triune God by partaking of the tree of life, we become a God-man.
[89]  As the God-man, the Lord Jesus did not wait for the tempter to come to Him.
[90]  The Lord s divine attributes are seen in the Samaritan s bringing the wounded one to an inn.
[91]  In the Lord s word to the thief we see not merely the human virtues, but also the divine attributes manifested in the Lord s human virtues.
[92]  In Luke 4:19 we see that the Man-Savior was anointed to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
[93]  This acceptable year is the New Testament age typified by the year of jubilee Lev 25:8-17 , the time when God would accept the returned captives of sin Isa 49:8; 2 Cor 6:2 and when the oppressed under the bondage of sin would enjoy the release of God s salvation.
[94]  We have emphasized the fact that the Gospel of Luke presents the Man-Savior in the highest standard of morality.
[95]  The cases recorded in Luke show different aspects of the highest standard of morality.
[96]  In the remainder of this message we shall consider 5:1-11, a case of the Man-Savior s attracting the occupied ones.
[97]  Luke 5:1 says, Now it came about as the crowd pressed upon Him and listened to the word of God, that He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
[98]  His divine attributes were expressed in the cleansing of the leper.
[99]  In the Lord s sympathy we see His human virtue, and in the cleansing of the leper we see His divine attribute.
[100]  As man He was filled with the human virtues, and as God He had the divine attributes that enabled Him to cleanse the man s leprosy.
[101]  Luke 5:29 says, And Levi made a great reception for Him in his house; and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining at the table with them.
[102]  Rather, He fulfilled His ministry according to God s will and pleasure by being one with God to fulfill His purpose.
[103]  The first principle in these verses is that we who believe in Christ and who have been born of God should be a people blessed by God.
[104]  But in the jubilee of grace the Lord Jesus has rescued us from the curse and has brought us into God s blessing.
[105]  In verses 24 through 26 the Lord speaks to the multitude of unbelievers present.
[106]  In verse 24 He says, But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.
[107]  In this message we shall continue to consider 6:17-49, where the Lord Jesus teaches His disciples the highest morality.
[108]  In 6:40 the Lord continues, A disciple is not above his teacher; but everyone who has been perfected will be as his teacher.
[109]  In order to practice the principles described in 6:17-49, we need the divine life.
[110]  If we do not have a certain kind of life, we cannot have that kind of being; neither can we have a certain behavior or accomplish a certain work.
[111]  In 7:11-17 we see the Man-Savior showing pity to the weeping mother by raising up her dead son.
[112]  Verses 11 and 12 say, And it came about soon afterwards that He went into a city called Nain, and His disciples went with Him and a large crowd.
[113]  Luke 7:18 says, And John s disciples reported to him concerning all these things.
[114]  John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, was in prison.
[115]  In 7:22 and 23 we have the Lord s answer to John the Baptist s question: Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind are receiving sight, the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed, and the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised, and the good news is being brought to the poor; and blessed is he who is not stumbled in Me. In verse 22 the Lord first speaks of the blind receiving sight.
[116]  In verses 41 and 42 the Man-Savior said to the Pharisee, A certain moneylender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
[117]  In this case we need to pay attention to the three matters of faith, love, and peace.
[118]  When as a young Christian I read this chapter, I thought that the woman s love for the Savior was the cause of the forgiveness of her sins.
[119]  In 8:4-18 we have the Man-Savior s teaching with parables.
[120]  Here the Lord gives two parables, the first in verses 4 through 15 on the growth in life and the second in verses 16 through 18 on the shining of the lamp.
[121]  However, Luke s purpose is to show us that as those who are living in peace, following the Lord, and ministering to Him, we should grow in life.
[122]  When the disciples questioned the Lord concerning this parable v. 9 , He said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand v. 10 . This verse indicates that God s economy concerning His kingdom was a hidden mystery, a mystery which has been unveiled to the Man-Savior s disciples.
[123]  Because the nature and character of the kingdom of God are wholly divine and because the elements through which it is brought forth are the divine life and divine light, the kingdom of God, especially in its reality as the genuine church in this age Rom 14:17 , is still all a mystery to the natural man.
[124]  In today s world we face many perils perils of immorality, perils of anxiety, and perils of pleasure.
[125]  The more you desire to have pleasure, the more anxiety you will have, and the more you will suffer.
[126]  Through His ministry the Man-Savior was making the believing sinners His spiritual relatives who became His many brothers Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11 in the house of God Heb 3:5-6 and His many members for the building up of His mystical Body Eph 5:30; 1 Cor 12:12 to do the will of God.
[127]  According to the New Testament, faith is always based on the word of the Lord.
[128]  If we did not have a word from the Lord, we would not have any basis for our faith.
[129]  In 8:40-56 we have an account of the Lord s healing a woman with a flow of blood and His raising up a dead girl.
[130]  In 8:41-42 Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, asked the Lord Jesus to heal his daughter, who was about twelve years old, and she was dying.
[131]  While the Lord was on the way to heal the girl, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who could not be healed by anyone, approached Him from behind and touched the fringe of His garment; and instantly her flow of blood stopped vv.
[132]  The kingdom of God is the Savior 17:21 as the seed of life, sown into His believers, God s chosen people Mark 4:3, 26 , and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life.
[133]  Luke 9:6 says, And going out, they passed through from village to village, bringing the good news and healing everywhere.
[134]  The Lord s speaking concerning the kingdom of God was the positive aspect of the jubilee the recovery of the right to enjoy God and His curing the sick was the negative aspect of the jubilee the release of the captives.
[135]  We have seen that the Lord Jesus began His ministry in chapter four by proclaiming the acceptable year of the Lord, by proclaiming the jubilee.
[136]  Immediately after the account of the feeding of the five thousand, we are told that the Lord was praying and then asked the disciples a question: And it came about that as He was praying alone the disciples were with Him; and He questioned them, saying, Who do the crowds say that I am? v. 18 . The disciples answered, John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and others that one of the ancient prophets has risen v. 19 . Here we see that most people can realize only that Christ is a prophet.
[137]  Based upon His word concerning His death, the Lord went on in 9:23-26 to teach the disciples to take up their cross and follow Him by denying their soul life.
[138]  It is necessary for us to do this in order to participate in the jubilee.
[139]  In order that we may enjoy the jubilee, our spirit has been regenerated.
[140]  God has regenerated our spirit as the beginning of our participation in the enjoyment of the jubilee.
[141]  Although the Lord had told the disciples to put these words into their ears, they did not have the ability to hear what He was saying.
[142]  Luke 9:47-48 says, And Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their heart, took hold of a little child and stood it beside Himself, and said to them, Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for he who is littler among you all, this one is great.
[143]  As soon as the Lord spoke these words, John answered and said, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us v. 49 . John s word indicates that the disciples could not receive the Lord s word.
[144]  This section concludes with the Lord s unveiling His death the second time and with a word that exposes the naturalness of His disciples.
[145]  As the Lamb of God John 1:29 , it was necessary for the Lord to be offered to God at Mount Moriah, which is Mount Zion, where Abraham offered Isaac and enjoyed God s provision of a ram as a substitute for his son Gen 22:2, 9-14 and where the temple was built in Jerusalem 2 Chron 3:1 .
[146]  In 9:57-62 the Man-Savior instructs people how to follow Him.
[147]  Verse 57 says, And as they went along the road, someone said to Him, I will follow You wherever you go.
[148]  The Lord Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have roosting places, but the Son of Man has nowhere that He may lay His head.
[149]  Then God began to execute His sentence on him on different occasions in different degrees, such as through the seventy disciples in Luke 10, through Christ on the cross Heb 2:14; John 12:31 , through the manchild and Michael before the great tribulation when he was cast down to the earth Rev 12:5, 7-10, 13 , and through the angel before the millennium when he was cast into the abyss, the bottomless pit Rev 20:1-2 , until finally he will be cast into the lake of fire after the millennium Rev 20:10 for eternity.
[150]  Luke 10:21 and 22 say, In the same hour He exulted in the Holy Spirit and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to babes.
[151]  All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
[152]  This parable refers to Judaism, the Old Testament, the law, the priests, the Levites, Christ, the Spirit, the divine life, the church, the way to bring people to the church, the blessing the Lord gives to the church, the Lord s coming back, and the Lord s reward to the church.
[153]  Luke 10:29 goes on to say, But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
[154]  Here we see that the Lord prefers His saved ones who love Him to listen to Him v. 39 that they may know His desire, rather than do things for Him without knowing His will see 1 Sam 15:22; Eccl.
[155]  When the Lord came to Bethany, Martha received Him and served Him.
[156]  Do you know what was on the Lord s heart while He sat in Martha s home in Bethany?
[157]  While the disciples were on the way to Jerusalem with the Lord, they were busy in such matters as arguing who was greater and in forbidding others to do things for the Lord.
[158]  If we read this section carefully again and again, we shall see that prayer means that we pray ourselves into God.
[159]  When some hear this, they may say, We cannot find such a point in the pattern of prayer set up by the Lord Jesus in His teaching.
[160]  Luke 11:1 says, And it came about that when He was praying in a certain place, as He ceased, a certain one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.
[161]  After giving His disciples a brief word of instruction concerning prayer, the Lord went on to give an illustration of praying persistently.
[162]  He said to them, Who among you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves, since a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him; and that one, from inside, shall answer and say, Do not trouble me; the door has already been shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise up and give you anything? vv.
[163]  In 11:24 to 26 the Lord says, When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, he passes through waterless places seeking rest; and not finding any, he says, I will return to my house, from which I came out; and when he comes, he finds it swept and put in order.
[164]  Then he goes and takes along other spirits more evil than himself, seven of them, and he enters and makes his home there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.
[165]  In other words, inwardly we are not occupied by God and with God.
[166]  If we consider these verses in the context of the entire chapter, we shall see that we need to be those who are always praying to be brought into God and who then remain in Him to receive the riches of the Holy Spirit.
[167]  When we are filled with these riches, there will be no room in us for anything else to come in. When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, who brings us the riches of the Triune God, there will be no space in us for anything else to enter in and occupy us.
[168]  In 11:37-54 we have a record of the Man-Savior rebuking the Pharisees and the lawyers.
[169]  Verse 37 says, Now as He spoke, a Pharisee asked Him if He would have a meal with him; and He went in and reclined at the table.
[170]  In the messages on chapter eleven we saw that when we pray ourselves into God and receive His rich supply, which is the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit, we are filled with this supply and occupied by it so that there is no room in us for demons, evil spirits.
[171]  According to chapter eleven, we need to pray ourselves into God so that we may remain in Him and be filled with His riches, filled with the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, that we may live a life in the highest standard of morality for the enjoyment and participation in the New Testament jubilee.
[172]  At that time, Jerusalem was a center of the Jewish religion and of a high culture with material possessions.
[173]  Those living in Jerusalem cared for religion and for earthly possessions in order to enjoy a better life.
[174]  In chapters eleven through fourteen the Lord Jesus was training His followers to live a life of the highest standard of morality so that they might be brought into the full participation of the New Testament jubilee.
[175]  As the Lord and His disciples were on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem, His heart was set on one thing, and the heart of His disciples was set on another thing.
[176]  In 12:13-34 the Lord gives His disciples another kind of warning, the warning concerning covetousness.
[177]  First the Lord said to the one who requested that He tell the brother to divide the inheritance with him, Man, who appointed Me a judge or a divider over you? v. 14 . Then He went on to say to His disciples, Take heed and guard yourself from all covetousness; for no one s life is in the abundance of his possessions v. 15 . Then the Lord told them the parable recorded in verses 16 through 21.
[178]  If we would live a life of the highest standard of morality to participate in the New Testament jubilee and enjoy God to the uttermost, we need to be warned concerning hypocrisy, covetousness, and anxiety.
[179]  In 12:50 the Lord goes on to say, But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!
[180]  The word baptism here reminds us of the Lord s word to James and John in Mark 10:38: Are you able to drink the cup which I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?
[181]  The cup signified that His death was the God-given portion for Him to take for the sinners whom He would redeem for God.
[182]  Baptism denoted that His death was the God-ordained way for Him to pass through for the accomplishment of God s redemption for sinners.
[183]  In 12:54-59 we have the Lord s teaching about the discernment of time.
[184]  The Lord s words recorded in verses 49 through 53 were delivered to His disciples.
[185]  In 12:54-56 the Lord said to the crowds, When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say that a rainstorm is coming, and so it happens; and when a south wind is blowing, you say that there will be heat, and it happens.
[186]  The word for at the beginning of verse 58 indicates that verses 58 and 59 are a continuation of verse 57, in which the Man-Savior charged the Jews that, while they were still on the way going , under the law their opponent John 5:45 to meet God the magistrate and be judged by Christ the judge John 5:22; Acts 17:31 , they should endeavor to be released from the law so that they might not be judged by Christ and thrown into the lake of fire prison Rev 20:11-15 by the angel the officer see Matt 13:41 .
[187]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR
[188]  In 13:10-17 we have the case of the Man-Savior healing and releasing a bent-double and Satan-bound woman on the Sabbath.
[189]  In 13:18-21, probably much to the disciples surprise, the Lord again spoke concerning the kingdom of God.
[190]  Up until now, the Lord s word concerning the kingdom in Luke has been positive.
[191]  After a number of aspects related to the jubilee have been covered, there is the need for us to know the way to enter into the jubilee, the way to enter into the kingdom of God.
[192]  Although this question is rather foolish or ambiguous, the Man-Savior answered it in a very clear way: Struggle to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able v. 24 . This is not merely to be saved; this is to enter into the full jubilee, to enter into the full enjoyment of the kingdom of God, not only in this age but also in the age to come.
[193]  The Lord pointed out that if we take the place of honor, the one who invited us may come and say, Give this one that place, and then you will begin with shame to occupy the last place v. 9 . The Lord went on to say that if we sit in the last place, the one who invited us will say, Friend, come up higher, and then we shall have glory before all those reclining at the table with us v. 10 . The Lord concludes this parable by saying, Because everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted v. 11 . The Lord s teaching here is like that of a parent teaching his children how to behave.
[194]  Those mentioned in verse 13 the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind are the people whom God invited to His salvation v. 21 . The resurrection of the righteous spoken of in verse 14 is the resurrection of life John 5:29; Rev 20:4-6 , when God will reward the saints Rev 11:18 at the Lord s return 1 Cor 4:5 .
[195]  One of those reclining at the table with Him, hearing these things, said to Him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God! v. 15 . Then the Lord said to him, A certain man was making a great dinner and invited many; and he sent his slave at the dinner hour to say to those who had been invited, Come, for it is now ready vv.
[196]  Today everyone who accepts God s invitation and receives the offer of what He has prepared for us has the ground to participate in the New Testament jubilee and enjoy Christ in this age.
[197]  But in order to receive the reward of the jubilee in the coming age, we need to enjoy Christ faithfully in this age.
[198]  Here we see that in His wisdom God has made the enjoyment of Christ in the coming age a reward for the faithful ones, the ones who enjoy Christ faithfully in this age.
[199]  This reward in the coming age has been set up by God as an incentive to encourage all the Lord s believers to enjoy Him and follow Him faithfully in this age.
[200]  Luke 14 shows us God s salvation, which brings us the enjoyment of the jubilee in this age.
[201]  POURING OUT WHAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LORD
[202]  In verses 28 through 30 the Lord continues, For which of you, wanting to build a tower, will not first sit down and calculate the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?
[203]  Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all those looking on will begin to mock him, saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish.
[204]  This word and that in verse 31 indicate that to follow the Lord as a career requires us to give all we have and all we can do to it.
[205]  According to His word in verse 26, we need to hate anything or anyone that would frustrate us or distract us from the proper enjoyment of Christ.
[206]  The Lord was going to Jerusalem in order to die so that through His death and resurrection He might bring in the jubilee.
[207]  In 15:11-32 we have the parable of a loving father.
[208]  Verses 11 and 12 say, A certain man had two sons: and the younger of them said to the father, Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.
[209]  A fallen sinner having once repented always thinks of working for God or serving God to obtain His favor, not knowing that this thought is against God s love and grace and is an insult to His heart and intent.
[210]  As indicated by the parable of the seeking woman, the Spirit s work is to enlighten us inwardly.
[211]  As this seeking woman, the Spirit enlightens our inner being little by little in a fine careful way.
[212]  In 15:25-32 we have a sad picture, a picture of those in religion.
[213]  In 15:3 we see that the Lord spoke these parables to the Pharisees and scribes in the presence of the tax collectors and sinners.
[214]  While the Lord Jesus was on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem, He had a suitable environment and an excellent opportunity to present a picture of God s salvation so that repentant sinners may know how blessed they are and that the religious ones may see how foolish they are.
[215]  Then after a full presentation of God s full salvation in chapter fifteen, the Lord gives us a parable in chapter sixteen showing us that after we have been saved we need to serve God in His house as stewards.
[216]  In verse 9 the Lord goes on to say, And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.
[217]  To make friends by means of mammon is to help others by the use of money to do things according to God s leading.
[218]  While the Lord Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem, certain of the Pharisees came out to encounter Him.
[219]  I mention this to point out that we need to take the opportunity to use our money prudently to benefit others.
[220]  Try to use your money to benefit others so that when it is out of use, others will do something for you.
[221]  This conveys the meaning of furthermore and indicates that the Lord had more to say to the Pharisees.
[222]  In verses 7 through 9 He says, Now which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at the table?
[223]  Therefore, the Lord concludes, So also you, when you do all the things which you are directed, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done v. 10 . I appreciate the point the Lord makes in 17:7-10, for it strengthens us in our service.
[224]  In 17:11-19 we have the record of the Man-Savior s cleansing ten lepers in Samaria.
[225]  I believe that this was narrated by Luke in order to show the highest standard of morality in the Lord s saving grace.
[226]  Luke 17:11-13 says, And it came about as He was going to Jerusalem, that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
[227]  THE RAPTURE OF THE OVERCOMING BELIEVERS Being Filled with Christ
[228]  In 17:31-36 the Lord indicates that the kingdom of God is related to Him and the rapture of His overcoming believers.
[229]  This means that even the rapture of the believers is part of the kingdom of God.
[230]  After reminding us of Lot s wife, the Lord Jesus goes on to say, Whoever seeks to preserve his soul life shall lose it, and whoever shall lose it, shall preserve it alive v. 33 . To preserve the soul life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and not to suffer.
[231]  If they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the sake of the Man-Savior, they will cause their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age, that is, to share the Lord s joy in ruling over the earth Matt 25:21, 23 .
[232]  In His answer the Lord indicates that the kingdom of God is actually He Himself in His first coming, in His suffering, in His second coming, and in His overcomers rapture.
[233]  The kingdom came in the Lord s first coming and in His suffering, and it will come in His second coming, in His overcoming saints rapture, and, as we shall now see, in His destroying of the Antichrist.
[234]  Luke 18:1-3 says, And He told them a parable with the purpose that they ought always to pray and not lose heart, saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city who did not fear God and did not respect man.
[235]  And there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, Avenge me of my opponent.
[236]  Following this, the Lord went on to say, Hear what the unrighteous judge says; and God, shall He not by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night; and yet He is longsuffering over them?
[237]  While our opposer is persecuting us, it seems that our God is not righteous, for He allows His children to be unrighteously persecuted.
[238]  For example, John the Baptist was beheaded, Peter was martyred, Paul was imprisoned, and John was exiled.
[239]  Here the Lord mentions three steps: first, to humble oneself before God as a sinner, realizing the need of God s propitiation vv.
[240]  After humbling ourselves, we need to become like a little child vv.
[241]  In verses 16 and 17 the Lord Jesus says, Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.
[242]  Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall by no means enter into it.
[243]  For this God exalted Him to the heavens, seated Him at His right hand Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33-35 , gave Him the name which is above every name Phil 2:9-10 , made Him both Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 , and crowned Him with glory and honor Heb 2:9 .
[244]  The Lord s unveiling of His death and resurrection the third time is related to the healing of the blind man near Jericho.
[245]  Actually, the Lord s disciples were blind and in need of healing.
[246]  They could not understand what the Lord was saying about His death and resurrection, because they were lacking in perception and insight.
[247]  I am concerned about the situation of today s believers, including our situation.
[248]  Although Zaccheus climbed up in the tree to see the Lord Jesus, we are told not that he saw the Lord but that the Lord saw him: And as He came to the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry and come down; for today I must stay in your house v. 5 . The seeing was not on Zaccheus side; it was on the Savior s side.
[249]  In verses 1 through 7 we are not told that the Lord said much to Zaccheus.
[250]  And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor v. 8 . Zaccheus could utter such a word even though he had not heard the Man-Savior s teaching concerning material possessions.
[251]  In chapter seventeen He spoke about material possessions in relation to the rapture of the overcomers: In that day, he who shall be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind v. 31 . Following this, in 18:22 He said to the rich ruler, All things, whatever you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me. From all these instances we see that the Man-Savior spoke repeatedly concerning material possessions.
[252]  Luke 19:11 says, Now as they heard these things, He spoke further a parable, because He was near to Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was about to instantly appear.
[253]  This parable depicts how the saved ones should serve the Lord so that they may inherit the coming kingdom.
[254]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR THE MAN-SAVIOR S PRESENTATION OF HIMSELF
[255]  TO DEATH FOR REDEMPTION 1 Scripture Reading: Luke 19:28-48
[256]  Now we come to the fourth section of this Gospel the Man-Savior s presentation of Himself to death for redemption 19:28 22:46 .
[257]  After the Savior finished His ministry in 19:27, the time came for Him to go up to Jerusalem to present Himself to the death ordained by God for the accomplishment of eternal redemption.
[258]  On the way from Galilee to Jerusalem, He repeatedly taught His disciples and followers how to take God s salvation, that is, how to receive the kingdom of God, which is actually the Man-Savior Himself, in order to enter into the enjoyment of the jubilee today.
[259]  The Gospel of Luke may be divided into seven sections: the introduction 1:1-4 , the preparation of the Man-Savior in His humanity with His divinity 1:5 4:13 , the ministry of the Man-Savior in His human virtues with His divine attributes 4:14 19:27 , the Man-Savior s presentation of Himself to death for redemption 19:28 22:46 , the death of the Man-Savior 22:47 23:56 , the resurrection of the Man-Savior 24:1-49 , and the ascension of the Man-Savior 24:50-53 .
[260]  In this message we shall begin to consider the fourth section of this book the Man-Savior s presentation of Himself to death for redemption.
[261]  The Lord Jesus made the long journey from Galilee to Jerusalem for the purpose of being put to death.
[262]  As the Lord Jesus drew near to Jerusalem, He was not joyful.
[263]  In 20:1 we see that as the Lord was teaching in the temple and preaching the good news, the chief priests, scribes, and the elders came to Him.
[264]  Of course, in all the foregoing chapters we have seen the Lord s high standard of morality produced by His divine essence with the divine attributes and His human essence with the human virtues.
[265]  In 20:27-38 the Man-Savior was examined by the Sadducees.
[266]  Verse 27 says, And some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him.
[267]  They went on to present to the Lord a case of a man who died leaving his wife childless: Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If anyone s brother dies having a wife, and this one is childless, that his brother should take the wife and raise up seed to his brother.
[268]  In 20:46-47 the Lord warns His disciples concerning the scribes: Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and best seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at the dinners, who devour widows houses, and for a pretense pray long prayers.
[269]  After muzzling the mouths of all His opposers, the Savior warned His disciples of the hypocrisy and evils of the scribes.
[270]  We have seen that the Lord Jesus unveiled His death and resurrection to His disciples three times 9:22; 9:44-45; 18:31-34 .
[271]  Why did the Savior reveal His death and resurrection to His disciples?
[272]  In 21:12-19 the Lord speaks about the persecution of His disciples in the church age.
[273]  In verse 12 the Lord says, But before all these things they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, leading you away before kings and governors for the sake of My name.
[274]  In 21:5 22:46 the Man-Savior prepares the disciples for His death.
[275]  In verses 34 and 35 the Lord says, And take heed to yourselves lest at some time your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare; for it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth.
[276]  Before the great tribulation, the Savior will probably still be on the throne.
[277]  This parousia will continue with His coming to the air and will end with His coming to the earth.
[278]  While the Lord was preparing both Himself and His disciples for His death, the opposers the leaders in the Jewish community were busy looking for an opportunity to arrest Him and put Him to death.
[279]  The Lord s sovereignty was exercised here, for this was the year in which Messiah had to be cut off, that is, the year in which the preordained Savior had to die.
[280]  In verse 16 the Lord goes on to say, For I tell you that I shall by no means eat it anymore until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
[281]  The pronoun it refers to the Passover in verse 15, which will be fully fulfilled in the coming kingdom of God, when the Savior will feast with the overcoming saints v. 30; 13:28-29 .
[282]  God has a complete plan to redeem His people into His jubilee.
[283]  The feast of the Passover is a sign of God s full redemption, and this full redemption is the bringing of God s chosen people into the full enjoyment of Himself.
[284]  THE LOAF AND CUP OF THE LORD S TABLE
[285]  Luke 22:19 says, And having taken a loaf, when He had given thanks, He broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you; do this unto the remembrance of Me. The loaf in verse 19 is not the loaf of the Passover; it is the loaf of the Lord s table.
[286]  Furthermore, in this verse the Lord said, Do this unto the remembrance of Me. Thus, it was not a remembrance of what took place in Exodus 12.
[287]  Taking the bread of the Lord s table is done in remembrance of the Man-Savior.
[288]  The Man-Savior came to accomplish God s eternal redemption for God s chosen people by His death, according to God s will Heb 10:7, 9-10 , and with His blood instituted a new covenant, a better covenant Heb 8:6-13 , which became the new testament after His resurrection Heb 9:16-17 , as a base for God to be one with His redeemed and regenerated people in the dispensation of grace.
[289]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that in 22:7-20 we have both the Passover and the Lord s supper.
[290]  In verses 7 through 18 there is a record concerning the eating of the Passover, and in verses 19 and 20, a record concerning the Lord s instituting His supper so that the disciples may participate in His death.
[291]  It is not likely that Peter, James, John, and the other disciples understood the significance of the Lord s supper when it was instituted.
[292]  Peter might have said to himself, The Lord speaks of a loaf and then of His body?
[293]  In Luke 22:24-38 the Man-Savior teaches the disciples about humility and foretells their stumbling.
[294]  In this message we come to the fifth main section of Luke the death of the Man-Savior 22:47 23:56 .
[295]  In this section we see that the Lord was arrested 22:47-65 , judged 22:66 23:25 , crucified 23:26-49 , and buried 23:50-56 .
[296]  While He was still speaking to His disciples, Judas drew near to Him to kiss Him v. 47 . But Jesus said to him, Judas, are you delivering up the Son of Man with a kiss? v. 48 . After pointing out to Judas that he was delivering up the Son of Man by kissing Him in a false way, the Lord said to the chief priests, officers of the temple, and elders who had come up against Him, Have you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber? While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against Me; but this is your hour and the authority of darkness vv.
[297]  In 22:66 23:25 the Man-Savior was judged by the Jewish Sanhedrin 22:66-71 and by the Roman rulers 23:1-25 .
[298]  When day came, the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and they led Him away to their Sanhedrin, saying, If you are the Christ, tell us 22:66-67a .
[299]  The Lord s answer indicates that He not only was the Son of Man on earth before His crucifixion, but also indicates that He will be the Son of Man in the heavens on the right hand of God after His resurrection Acts 7:56 and also at His coming back on the clouds.
[300]  His answer also indicates that He is God s Christ, His anointed.
[301]  When the ones judging the Lord heard His answer, they said, What further need do we have of testimony, for we have heard it ourselves from his mouth? v. 71 . They were excited and, thinking that He was blaspheming God in saying that He was the Son of God, they condemned Him.
[302]  In 22:47 23:25 we need to be impressed with four pictures.
[303]  The first picture is the portrait of the Man-Savior, the portrait of the God-man.
[304]  In this portrait we see the God-man, the One who is perfect, dignified, and full of divine splendor and of human virtues.
[305]  As we consider the picture presented by Luke of the Man-Savior from the time He was arrested until He was sentenced to death by Pilate, we see the portrait of the Lord Jesus as the perfect and complete God-man.
[306]  Often we have pointed out that as the God-man the Lord Jesus is the complete God and a perfect man.
[307]  Throughout the last nineteen centuries there have been many studies of the Lord s death.
[308]  For what purpose did the Lord Jesus die, and who actually put Him to death?
[309]  Even genuine and faithful Christians, those who truly believe in the Lord Jesus, may not have a full knowledge of the purpose of His death and of who killed Him.
[310]  The Veil of the Temple Torn down the Middle
[311]  This tearing of the veil signifies that the separation between God and man was abolished, because the flesh signified by the veil of sin, of which Christ had taken on the likeness Rom 8:3 had been crucified Heb 10:20 .
[312]  When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross under God s judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being.
[313]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE THE DEATH OF THE MAN-SAVIOR 3 Scripture Reading: Luke 23:26-56 THE MAN-SAVIOR S ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH
[314]  We have seen in the foregoing message that the Man-Savior was put to death as our Substitute, as our Redeemer, by God.
[315]  When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He died as the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 .
[316]  With respect to His humanity, Christ was the first item of God s creation.
[317]  In Ephesians 2:14 and 15 we see that Christ died as the Peacemaker, as the One who makes peace: For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.
[318]  Luke 23:50-56 speaks of the burial of the Man-Savior.
[319]  Verses 50 through 52 say, And behold, a man named Joseph, being a member of the Council, a good and righteous man This man had not agreed with their counsel and action , from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was expecting the kingdom of God; this man came to Pilate and requested the body of Jesus.
[320]  After the Lord accomplished His all-inclusive death, His situation of suffering immediately changed into an honorable one.
[321]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR THE RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION
[322]  OF THE MAN-SAVIOR 1 Scripture Reading: Luke 24:1-53
[323]  Christ s resurrection was also a sign of the success of His achievement.
[324]  Suppose Christ had remained in the tomb after He died.
[325]  But the Man-Savior s resurrection from the dead is a strong sign of His great success in His universal achievement.
[326]  Resurrection was God s vindication of the Lord s life and work, resurrection was the Lord s great success in His universal achievement, resurrection was His victory over all enemies, resurrection was His glorification, resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit essentially, resurrection was the germination of the new creation, and resurrection produced the church, the Body, as Christ s reproduction.
[327]  In chapter twenty-four of his Gospel Luke gives us a record of Christ s resurrection and, in particular, of His action in resurrection.
[328]  This signifies His resurrection brought a new start with a new age for God s kingdom.
[329]  In 24:13-35 the Man-Savior opened the Scriptures and also the eyes of the disciples.
[330]  OF THE MAN-SAVIOR 2 Scripture Reading: Luke 24:1-53
[331]  We have seen that the case of the Lord s appearing to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus vv.
[332]  The Man-Savior s meeting with the disciples in Luke 24 was the right time for Him to commission them to preach the forgiveness of sins.
[333]  After pointing out to them that it was written that Christ should suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day, He told them that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
[334]  Luke 24:50 and 51 say, And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.
[335]  And it came about that while He blessed them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven.
[336]  His death was by the God-man to accomplish God s redemption for man 23:42-43 and to release Himself into man as the fire of life to burn on the earth 12:49-50 .
[337]  His resurrection was God s vindication of Him and of His work, His success in all His achievements, and His victory over the universal enemy of God.
[338]  In ascension He was made the Christ of God and the Lord of all Acts 2:36 to carry out His heavenly ministry on earth as the all-inclusive Spirit poured out from the heavens upon His Body composed of His believers Acts 2:4, 17-18 , as recorded by Luke in his further writing, the Acts.
[339]  In His ascension the Man-Savior was crowned, enthroned, and made the Lord of all and the Christ of God, the Head over all things to the church, and the High Priest in the heavens ministering the heavenly life and life supply of the divine riches into all His believers.
[340]  First we shall consider Christ s humanity, His living as the God-man.
[341]  As we shall see, God s purpose in the creation of man in His image and after His likeness was that man would receive Him as life and express Him in all His attributes.
[342]  In the Scriptures the word image is used to refer to God s being.
[343]  Second Corinthians 4:4 says that Christ is the image of God, Colossians 1:15 tells us that Christ is the image of the invisible God, and Hebrews 1:3 reveals that Christ is the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance.
[344]  Since God created man for the purpose of man s becoming His duplication, and since this purpose is indicated by the use of the word image, we may go on to say that the word image implies the capacity to contain God.
[345]  In Genesis 1:26 and 27 we have the container but not the content.
[346]  According to the record in Genesis 2, after God created man, He prepared a garden and placed man in it.
[347]  God s intention was that the man created by Him would take of the tree of life and live.
[348]  In this message we shall continue to consider the Man-Savior s incarnation fulfilling the purpose of God s creation of man.
[349]  Because God designed man this way, He created man in His image and after His likeness.
[350]  Because the Man-Savior s divine nature with the divine attributes was expressed in His human nature with the human virtues, it is difficult to say when He was living on earth whether it was God loving others or a man loving.
[351]  In the life of the Man-Savior we see a love that is the love of a God-man, the love of the One who lived a human life filled with the divine life.
[352]  Certain cases recorded in the Gospel of Luke illustrate the fact that the Man-Savior s love was a love in which the attribute of divine love is expressed in the virtue of human love.
[353]  We see this love in the case of the good Samaritan Luke 10:25-37 , in the case of the sinful woman in the house of Simon the Pharisee 7:36-50 , and in the case of the thief on the cross who asked the Lord Jesus to remember him 23:39-43 .
[354]  God made Adam in His own image and after His own likeness, but Adam became fallen.
[355]  In the age of innocence, before sin had come in, Adam was clean and innocent.
[356]  His virtues, however, might not have been strong and rich.
[357]  But in the Lord Jesus, the second man, the human virtues are strong and rich.
[358]  In the previous message we saw that the Man-Savior was conceived of the divine essence with the divine attributes for the content and reality of His human virtues Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 .
[359]  The Lord Jesus was conceived in this way so that the divine attributes might fill the empty human virtues, strengthen, enrich, and sanctify the human virtues, and express God in the human virtues.
[360]  Furthermore, the Man-Savior was incarnated in order to uplift the human virtues to the highest standard, to the standard that matches God s attributes for the expression of God.
[361]  Because our virtues were damaged and deformed, they could not match God s attributes.
[362]  The Man-Savior was born of the human essence with the human virtues in order to uplift these virtues to such a standard that they can match God s attributes for His expression.
[363]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SIXTY THE MAN-SAVIOR S GOD-MAN LIVING 1 Scripture Reading: Heb 2:14a, 16-17a; Phil 2:6-8; John 1:1, 14; 5:30; 6:38
[364]  The title of this message is The Man-Savior s God-man Living.
[365]  Have you ever realized that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, His living was a God-man living?
[366]  His living was not merely that of a man; rather, His living was the living of a God-man.
[367]  At the beginning of my Christian life, I wondered why God did not save us in a fast way, in a way like His work in creation.
[368]  When I asked my pastor about this, he told me that because we are human beings it was necessary for our Savior to become a man.
[369]  In creation, of course, there was no need for God to become a man.
[370]  As I considered God s incarnation for our salvation, I realized that it was logical for God to become a man in order to save us.
[371]  The Man-Savior went through a long process not to save us by snatching us out of hell, but to carry out His dynamic salvation.
[372]  The term dynamic salvation means that God became a man and lived a man s life to express God.
[373]  Although He lived a man s life, He did not express man He expressed God.
[374]  As the Man-Savior lived such a life on earth, the angels and demons could testify that He was man living a human life for the expression of God.
[375]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE THE MAN-SAVIOR S GOD-MAN LIVING 2 Scripture Reading: Heb 2:14a, 16-17a; Phil 2:6-8; John 1:1, 14; 5:30; 6:38
[376]  In this message we shall continue to consider the Man-Savior s God-man living.
[377]  THE GOD-MAN Having the Human Nature with Its Virtues
[378]  He has the human nature with its virtues to contain God and express Him.
[379]  But the God-man did not need to exert Himself to display His ability to contain and express God.
[380]  In John 5:30 the Lord Jesus says, I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me. In John 6:38 He goes on to say, I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me. In these verses we see that the Lord Jesus did not do or seek His own will.
[381]  A Genuine Man s Living by God s Life
[382]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO THE REPRODUCTION OF THE GOD-MAN 1 Scripture Reading: John 3:6b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Phil 1:19b, 20b, 21a; 2:5-8; 3:9-10; 4:8, 13
[383]  As we shall see, the reproduction of the God-man requires that we be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit, that we be transformed by the pneumatic Christ in our soul, and that we live Christ as the God-man.
[384]  For thirty-three and a half years He lived the life of a God-man; that is, He lived a human life by the divine life for the expression of God.
[385]  The first step of the reproduction of the God-man by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is regeneration.
[386]  In order for the Lord Jesus to come into us as the life-giving Spirit, it was necessary for Him to go through a lengthy process.
[387]  In the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive extract of Christ, there is not only the essence of what Christ is, but also the element of the process through which He has passed.
[388]  We have seen that for the reproduction of the God-man we need to be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit with His divine life and nature.
[389]  Christ lived on earth as a God-man for thirty-three and a half years.
[390]  Today we, His reproduction, should live Him as the God-man.
[391]  We have seen that the Spirit of Jesus Christ is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord s incarnation, but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord s resurrection, compounded with His incarnation, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[392]  As we live Christ as the God-man, we should shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life Phil 2:15b-16a .
[393]  This is to shine as luminaries reflecting the brightness of Jesus Christ, the God-man.
[394]  When we cooperate with the operating God within us by obeying Him, the God-man as the pneumatic Christ with His bountiful supply will enable us to shine the word of life as luminaries.
[395]  When we are found in Christ living Him as the God-man, He will be expressed in our human virtues.
[396]  Paul s word in Philippians 4:8 indicates this: For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.
[397]  In 4:14-30 we see that the Man-Savior began His ministry by proclaiming the jubilee of grace.
[398]  On the Sabbath day in the synagogue at Nazareth, He read from the book of Isaiah and proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord 4:16-21 .
[399]  This acceptable year is the New Testament age of grace typified by the year of jubilee Lev 25:8-17 , the fiftieth year in which all the slaves were liberated and every man s inheritance was restored to him.
[400]  In the jubilee portrayed in Leviticus 25 the main thought is how to take care of people s living.
[401]  In other words, the basic concern is man s enjoyment.
[402]  We have seen that with every human being the most important matters are the person himself and his possession.
[403]  From Leviticus 25 we see that it was possible for an Israelite to sell his possession and thereby lose his portion of the land.
[404]  Now we need to see that some became so poor that they even sold themselves: And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: but as a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee: and then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return vv.
[405]  In the foregoing message we began to consider the definition of the jubilee.
[406]  We saw that the word jubilee is an anglicized form of the Hebrew word yobel.
[407]  We have seen that, according to Leviticus 25:9, the proclamation of the jubilee was on the tenth day of the seventh month, on the day of atonement.
[408]  This indicates that the jubilee is based on God s full redemption in Christ.
[409]  In this message we shall go on from the definition of the jubilee covered in the two previous messages to the blessings of the jubilee.
[410]  For our understanding, it is good to have the definition of the jubilee.
[411]  Man s true possession is God, and man was created as a vessel to contain God.
[412]  Adam lived for a while in the garden, but he did not go on to enjoy the tree of life.
[413]  Instead of eating of the tree of life, Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thereby became fallen.
[414]  Instead of taking God in as his life, Adam left God.
[415]  In this message we shall continue to consider the blessings of the jubilee.
[416]  We pointed out in the foregoing message that the first of the two main blessings of the jubilee is that those who have lost their inheritance may be returned to their possession Lev 25:9-13 .
[417]  However, God s jubilee brings man back to God as his inheritance Acts 26:18; Eph 1:14; Col 1:12; Luke 15:12-23 .
[418]  Let us now apply this to our experience of salvation.
[419]  Just as the year of jubilee came after seven complete courses of years, so many of us experienced salvation only after we had passed through several courses in our human life.
[420]  Now we shall begin to consider the living of the jubilee.
[421]  Certain types in the Old Testament show how God saves man from the issue of the fall.
[422]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE JUBILEE 6 Scripture Reading: Lev 25:10-12, 19-22; Matt 11:28; Phil 4:6-7, 9; Luke 15:23; 1 Cor 5:8; Eph 3:8; Phil 1:19; 2 Cor 12:9; 13:14
[423]  Let us continue to consider the living of the jubilee, that is, the kind of life that lives in the jubilee.
[424]  We pointed out in the foregoing message that this is a life of resting in the good land and of enjoying the riches of the good land.
[425]  This indicates that we should eat Christ as the fattened calf, drink the life-giving Spirit, and be merry in the enjoyment of the Triune God and in the riches of the Father s house.
[426]  The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment, the love of God is God Himself as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation.
[427]  If we read the Bible carefully, we shall see that there are three kinds of labor in human life, not including working at a job to earn a living.
[428]  The first kind of labor is the labor to be a good person, to have good behavior, and to improve one s character.
[429]  If we are living in the jubilee, we shall not have any anxiety.
[430]  Concerning anxiety, the Lord Jesus says, Do not be anxious about your life, what you should eat and what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on....Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?...Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.
[431]  In the foregoing messages we have considered in detail two very important matters: the incarnation of the Man-Savior and the jubilee.
[432]  Now in this Life-study we want to cover two more vital matters the Man-Savior s resurrection and His ascension.
[433]  By resurrection God vindicated and approved the Man-Savior; God also vindicated and approved the Lord s redemptive work.
[434]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SEVENTY-ONE THE MAN-SAVIOR S RESURRECTION 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:24; 3:15; Rom 4:25; Acts 10:41; John 10:15, 17-18; Heb 2:14; 1 Cor 15:52-54; John 13:31-32; 17:1; Luke 24:26; John 12:24
[435]  We have seen that the Lord s resurrection was God s vindication and approval of the Man-Savior and His all-inclusive redemptive work.
[436]  Now we need to see that Christ s resurrection was also the Man-Savior s success in all His achievements.
[437]  The Man-Savior s resurrection was also His victory over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave Acts 2:24 .
[438]  The Man-Savior was not only vindicated by God and was proved to be a success in His achievements, but He was victorious over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave, all of which are a great concern and trouble to us.
[439]  When the shell of the Lord s humanity was broken on the cross, the divine life within Him was released in resurrection.
[440]  The release of the divine life and nature from within the Lord as a grain of wheat was His glorification.
[441]  This means that no longer was He merely God, for through incarnation He had become the God-man, having both divinity and humanity.
[442]  In the two preceding messages we covered the objective aspect of the Man-Savior s resurrection.
[443]  With this message we come to the subjective aspect of His resurrection.
[444]  If we put together all these verses concerning the Son, the Father, and the Spirit, we see that when Jesus Christ was on earth He was the Triune God.
[445]  Not only was the Son there, but the Father and the Spirit were there as well.
[446]  This message is the continuation of the foregoing message in which we began to consider the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior s resurrection.
[447]  The first matter we saw relating to this subjective aspect is that the Man-Savior s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into His believers 1 Cor 15:45b; John 14:16-20 .
[448]  For the thirty-three and a half years of the Lord s human living on earth, He experienced death death to Himself and to all things other than God.
[449]  Now that we have the principle that the process of the Man-Savior s resurrection began while He was dying, we need to ask when the Lord Jesus died.
[450]  In order to understand the Man-Savior s resurrection as His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit, we need to read John 14:10-20 carefully again and again.
[451]  In John 14 we see that when the Son came, the Father was in Him.
[452]  Concerning this, Peter says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead 1 Pet 1:3 .
[453]  The Man-Savior s resurrection was also His propagation to produce the church as His reproduction.
[454]  LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SEVENTY-FIVE THE MAN-SAVIOR S RESURRECTION 6 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; John 14:16-20, 26; 12:24b; 1 Pet 1:3; 2 Cor 5:17
[455]  In the foregoing messages we have covered both the objective and the subjective aspects of the Man-Savior s resurrection.
[456]  Concerning the subjective aspect, we have seen that Christ s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers, His germination of the new creation to impart the divine life into His believers for their regeneration, and His propagation to produce the church as His reproduction.
[457]  John 14:16-20 reveals that the Christ in resurrection now lives in us.
[458]  In verses 16 and 17 the Lord Jesus says, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
[459]  According to verse 16, the Lord Jesus will ask the Father to give the disciples another Comforter.
[460]  OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN RESURRECTION The Christ Who Is Resurrection
[461]  Regarding our experience of Christ in resurrection, we may use the term the pneumatic Christ.
[462]  Although we do not like to speak of the spiritual Christ, we like the expression the pneumatic Christ.
[463]  With this message we begin a series on the Man-Savior s ascension.
[464]  As the One who passed through the process of creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Man-Savior with His wonderful status has been inaugurated into His heavenly office to execute God s administration and to carry out God s New Testament economy.
[465]  His administrating is related to the universe, but His carrying out of God s New Testament economy is to propagate Himself for His reproduction to build up the church, His Body, which will issue in the New Jerusalem.
[466]  In the previous message we saw that the Man-Savior s ascension was His inauguration into His heavenly office through the process of creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[467]  Considering the objective aspect of Christ s ascension, we saw that in His ascension He was crowned with glory and honor Heb 2:9 , enthroned for God s administration Heb 12:2 , and made the Lord to possess all and the Christ to carry out God s commission Acts 2:36 .
[468]  When some hear about the objective aspect of Christ s ascension, they may say, Yes, in His ascension the Man-Savior has been inaugurated into His heavenly office.
[469]  If His relationship with us ceased with His breathing Himself into us, it would be difficult for Him to work out anything for the accomplishment of God s New Testament economy.
[470]  If we have this realization of the Man-Savior as we contact Him, our contact with Him will be different.
[471]  Our realization of the Lord makes a great difference in our contact with Him.
[472]  Furthermore, in His ascension He was made the Lord of all and the Christ to carry out God s eternal plan to propagate Himself on earth to produce a Body to match Him for His expression.
[473]  It is not as easy to speak of the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior s ascension as it is to speak of the objective aspect.
[474]  Concerning the Lord s ascension being subjective to us, I feel that I lack the utterance to express what the Lord has shown us.
[475]  Through His ascension Christ was also inaugurated to be the Lord to possess all and to be the Christ to carry out God s commission.
[476]  From this verse through verse 22 we see that God wrought this power in Christ by four steps: first, raising Him from among the dead; second, seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies; third, subjecting all things under His feet; and fourth, giving Him to be Head over all things to the church.
[477]  A second way of translating Ephesians 1:22 does not use the words to be.
[478]  According to this way of rendering the verse, it would read, gave Him, head over all things, to the church.
[479]  The verse would then mean that God has given something to the church.
[480]  This second way of translating this verse would indicate after God raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him in the heavens, and subjected all things under His feet, He then gave Him to the church as the Head over all things.
[481]  Through the divine transmission from the ascended Christ to the church, the Man-Savior s ascension is definitely related to us.
[482]  There can be no doubt that we are connected to Him in His ascension.
[483]  THE HEADING UP OF ALL THINGS IN CHRIST God s Eternal Administration
[484]  The divine transmission revealed in Ephesians 1 has a great goal the heading up of all things in Christ.
[485]  Concerning this, Ephesians 1:10 says, Unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.
[486]  In this message we shall give a concluding word on the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior s ascension.
[487]  We have seen that in His ascension Christ was given to be the Head over all things to the church so that all things might be headed up in Him Eph 1:22, 10 .
[488]  In His ascension Christ was made the Head of the church, His Body, to express God in His fullness.
[489]  In His ascension Christ was also made the High Priest in the heavens.
[490]  Hebrews 4:14 says that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.
[491]  The Lord came from God to us through incarnation, and then He went back from us to God through resurrection and ascension to be our High Priest to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs Heb 2:17-18; 4:15 .
[492]  Then in chapter eight Christ is revealed as the Priest offering the incense at the golden altar: And another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him that He should add it to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne v. 3 . Therefore, in chapter one Christ is revealed as the Priest taking care of the lampstands, and in chapter eight He is unveiled as the Priest offering incense to God.
[493]  The ascended Christ cares not only for us and our welfare: He cares for God s desires.
[494]  Therefore, the Lord establishes lampstands and trims the lamps for the expression of God Rev 1:13; 2:1 .
