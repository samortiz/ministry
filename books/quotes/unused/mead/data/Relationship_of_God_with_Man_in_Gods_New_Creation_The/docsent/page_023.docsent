   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT HAVING BOTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DIVINE NATURE AND THE HUMAN NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have pointed out that the very God whom we serve today is not only God Himself but also a man, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have also seen that His Spirit is not only the Spirit of the divine life but also the Spirit of the human nature interwoven with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today in the Holy Spirit of the wonderful God-man there is not only divinity but also humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, in the Holy Spirit there are the divine nature and the human nature as well.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 7:38-39 says, He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord spoke the word concerning the rivers of living water, He was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The glorification of Jesus was His resurrection Luke 24:26, 46 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After He died, He was resurrected from the dead, and this was His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After His glorification the Holy Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost not merely as the Spirit of God but also as the Spirit of God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament time the Spirit of God came down upon man only as God in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At a certain time God in Christ was incarnated to be a man and was mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This God-man died and resurrected and came down as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now the Holy Spirit is a Spirit who includes not only God but also man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to John 7:39, before Jesus was glorified, such a Holy Spirit who has both the divine nature and the human nature was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only after Jesus was glorified through His resurrection could this Holy Spirit of God, with both the divine nature and the human nature, come down to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Testament time the Holy Spirit who works upon us and dwells within us is a Spirit who has both the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Timothy 2:5 says, For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse indicates that even today Christ Jesus, the one Mediator of God and men, is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is significant that, on the one hand, the enemy Satan would not allow people to believe that Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many modernists believe that Christ is only a man and is not God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, after we Christians believe that Christ is God, we may consider Him to be no longer a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians truly do not realize that today our Savior, the Lord Jesus, is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Philippians 1:19 says, For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word this refers to Paul s suffering in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this verse Paul does not speak of the Spirit of the almighty God but of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus Christ is a man, and although the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God, Paul s emphasis is that this Spirit is the Spirit of a man, One who has suffered and been persecuted by people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems that Paul was saying, Today the Spirit of a suffering, persecuted One is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, supplies me and supports me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally, Acts 16:6-7 says, And they passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And when they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 6 speaks of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, and in verse 7 the same Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, this Spirit is the Spirit of God, and on the other hand, He is the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE LORD BEING MINGLED WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>FOR US TO LIVE BY HIM</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have seen clearly that after the Lord s resurrection and ascension, the Holy Spirit is in us as a Spirit who possesses both the divine life and nature and the human life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before He came into us, He was God mingled with man already.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not think that He begins to be mingled with man only when He comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When He comes into us as the eternal life with the divine nature, the human nature is included.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Christ comes into us as life, He is the eternal life with both the divine life and nature and the human life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may wonder why the eternal life that we have received is a life of the divine nature and the human nature as well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is so that this life can work in us not only in a quiet, normal way but also in a human way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The wonderful Savior works, moves, lives, and acts as life within us in a quiet, normal, ordinary way and also in a very human way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This matter is something that most believers have neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many times I had a little feeling deep within me to visit a certain brother and to speak with him concerning a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time there was always some doubt as to whether this feeling was something of the Lord, because it was quiet, normal, and ordinary and also very human.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I thought it might be only my desire and not something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet while I was doubting, the little feeling within, though not very strong, was constant, steady, and lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, I had no choice but to go.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After I went, the feeling was confirmed to be of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although this was a leading from the Lord, there was nothing extraordinary about it; instead, it was very ordinary, normal, and human.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The way Christ works in us as life is very ordinary, for He as the indwelling Spirit has not only the divine nature but also the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many times before ministering to the Lord s children, I have no special sense concerning what I should speak, but only a little feeling or registration.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Though I always doubt this, wondering if it is just something of myself, after I minister, I realize it is genuinely something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Holy Spirit who dwells within us is a Spirit not only of the life and nature of God but also of the life and nature of a proper man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Him there is not only the full element of divinity but also the element of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, He works within us not in a miraculous way but in a very normal and human way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This can be fully confirmed by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The primary reason that the Lord needed to become a man and mingle Himself with man before coming into us is that we may live by Him not in an extraordinary way but in a very ordinary and human way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The four Gospels are a record of a man who took God as His life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In that record we see that the life of this man on earth was absolutely human.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is true that sometimes He performed miracles to prove that He was the almighty God, yet His living as a man, with God as His life, was always very human and ordinary and not at all special.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once He was thirsty and asked a certain woman for water to drink John 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Another time He wept with tears 11:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was very human in a most ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In contrast, many Christians consider that if we take Christ as life and live by Him, we need to be like angels, not like human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, the more we take Christ as our life, the more we will be properly human in a very ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There was once a servant of the Lord who was invited to minister in a certain city where the people considered him to be very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At the time he was due to arrive, many went to meet him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Interestingly, before he reached the town, he turned aside into a children s garden.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Those who were waiting for his arrival began to discuss where he might be.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Eventually, they found him in the garden playing with the children.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many of his admirers were disappointed because they thought that a spiritual person should be like an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, a spiritual person is not a special person but an ordinary person, one who is very human and normal.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The more spiritual we are, the more normal and human we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>THE WAY THE LORD WORKS WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to be impressed that the Savior we have received into us as our life has both the divine nature and the human nature; He is not only divine but also human.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today He works within us not in a miraculous way but in a very human way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Many times it is difficult for us to believe that it is His working.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>One morning when you rise up, read the Scriptures, and pray, you may have just a little feeling or sense within to give up certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You may doubt whether this is something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do not doubt but believe, for this is the way the Lord works within us today, not in a miraculous way but in a very human way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In China there was a young girl with a strong will and a peculiar character.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>She was from a rich family and wanted a share in the family s inheritance, but in China the inheritance passes only to sons, not to daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Therefore, she purposely went to school to study law in order to file a lawsuit against her brothers over the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>During one winter vacation her mother, who was a genuine believer and had been recently revived by the Lord, brought her to a church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Although there were several hundred people there, I noticed her immediately because of her peculiar hairstyle.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Two or three weeks later she came to the meeting, and I noticed something had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Her hairstyle had changed somewhat.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>After two or three more days she came again, and something more had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>From then on, each time she came to the meeting, something had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Eventually, after several more weeks she came dressed in a very simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Many things related to her appearance had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we asked her mother about this, she told us that she had not dared to touch this matter with her daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Later, we discovered that the daughter had believed in the Lord, and subsequently nearly every day there had been a sense within her to give up certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Many times she had thought that this might be herself and not the Lord, but the more she doubted, the more constant the sense was.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It was present with her not in a peculiar or miraculous way but in a very ordinary and normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>As a newborn Christian, this sister grew rapidly.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In time she testified that the secret of experiencing Christ as life and of taking Him as our life is to take care of the little inner feeling and sense.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>That feeling, though it may be small, comes from the wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He is all-inclusive and unlimited, yet He works in a way that is small, quiet, normal, ordinary, and human.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If we go along with Him, He will be real, rich, and available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We will enjoy many items of what He is and will gradually grow.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Day by day, little by little, we will be saturated and permeated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Although our spiritual progress may seem very slow, it will be very steady.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is the way to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We should not expect the Lord to give us marvelous, miraculous, supernatural, or extraordinary experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Even though some may occasionally have such experiences, the ordinary way to experience Christ is in a normal, quiet, and human way.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>By being honest and faithful to this wonderful One who lives and works within us in such a small but normal and human way, we will be saturated and permeated with Him, transformed from glory unto glory, and become a living witness to Him in this age.</S>
