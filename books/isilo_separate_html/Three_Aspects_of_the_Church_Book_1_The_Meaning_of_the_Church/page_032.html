<h2 class="head2">The Shulammite&mdash;<br />
Typifying the Church&rsquo;s Experience<br />
of the Resurrected Christ<br />
and Her Enjoyment of Rest with Him</h2>
<h2 class="head3">David and Solomon Typifying<br />
Christ in His Two Aspects</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament the seventh and last woman to typify the church is the Shulammite (S. S. 6:13). The Shulammite was Solomon&rsquo;s queen. Solomon typifies the resurrected and glorified Christ; hence, the Shulammite typifies the church in resurrection and glorification.</p>
<p>Some people think that Christ&rsquo;s glorification will begin with His second coming; however, the Bible clearly reveals that Christ entered into glory after His death and resurrection. In Luke 24:26 the Lord said to two of His disciples on the road to Emmaus, &ldquo;Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?&rdquo; This indicates that the Lord entered into glory as soon as He resurrected. In principle, Christ&rsquo;s being in the heavens now, His coming back to the earth in the future, and His living in us and being with us today are all in glory. Solomon is a type of Christ in glory.</p>
<p>Before Christ was glorified, He experienced on the earth all kinds of sufferings and eventually death. David typifies the Christ who passed through all kinds of sufferings, and David&rsquo;s wife, Abigail, typifies the church in the midst of sufferings. Solomon typifies the glorification of Christ, and the Shulammite, the queen of Solomon, typifies the church reigning in glory and enjoying the resurrected Christ. The entire book of Song of Songs portrays how the Shulammite experienced and enjoyed Solomon, typifying the church&rsquo;s experience and enjoyment of the resurrected Christ. The Christ in Song of Songs is the resurrected Christ who passed through death, came out of death, and entered into resurrection.</p>
<p>Today the Christ in us is the resurrected Christ. The Christ whom we experience every day is the One who passed through all kinds of sufferings, death, and resurrection. This means that the Christ whom we contact and with whom we fellowship is the Christ in Song of Songs, the resurrected Christ. When we walk on the earth by relying on the resurrected Christ, we live out Christ in suffering. Only by the power of resurrection can we take the way of the cross.</p>
<p>David and Solomon, as types of Christ, are related. Solomon, as a type, did not come into being after the death of David but rather while David was still living. David and Solomon typify two aspects of a shared experience. David typifies the lowly aspect of Jesus, that is, His footsteps in His living; Solomon typifies the glorious aspect of Christ, that is, His power in His ascension. The Lord was first Jesus and then Christ, first David and then Solomon. However, in our experience He is first Christ and then Jesus, first Solomon and then David.</p>
<p>In the beginning the One whom we contacted was not Jesus but Christ. The expression <em>believing into Jesus</em> is not according to the truth. In the New Testament we cannot find such an expression. Jesus was a man into whom we have no way to believe. The One into whom we believe is the Christ in resurrection. He overcame the constraints of man, resurrected, and is in the Holy Spirit. He came out of death and entered into glory. This glory is resurrection and also the Spirit. The three&mdash;the Spirit, resurrection, and glory&mdash;cannot be separated; they are one.</p>
<p>Once the Lord entered into resurrection, He entered into glory; that is, He entered into the Holy Spirit. At that time, strictly speaking, He was not merely Jesus but the Christ; He was Jesus Christ. He was Jesus becoming the Christ in glory. Actually, the One into whom we believe is the Christ. In the Scriptures there are the expressions <em>believed into Christ Jesus</em> and <em>faith in Christ Jesus</em> (Gal. 2:16; 3:26; Phil. 3:9; 2 Tim. 3:15), but there is no such expression as <em>believing into Jesus.</em> Thus, the One whom we first contacted is the resurrected Christ. He is in resurrection, that is, in the Spirit. Through our believing, He touched our inner being, and our inner being touched Him. This may be likened to the radio waves in the air coming into contact with a radio transmitter, which corresponds to the radio waves. Similarly, the faith in us corresponds to the law of the Spirit. When the Spirit touches our inner being, our inner being touches the Spirit. The Spirit is resurrection, and He is the Christ into whom we believe and whom we contact.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
