   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO KNOW GOD'S WILL THE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RATHER THAN TECHNIQUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's children can and should know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The knowledge of God's will has to do with the person; it has nothing to do with techniques.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord draws men to Himself, He draws some through their mind, others through their emotion, and still others through their will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Generally speaking, the least likely means for the Lord to draw men is the will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people love the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They want to know more about these truths, and they hope that others will be edified by these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They study the Bible a great deal and know many things about Bible exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they cannot interpret a passage, they feel frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they think they can interpret a passage, they feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>People like these are touching the Bible with their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are not necessarily living a proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, it is difficult to live a proper Christian life without a mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But those who only have a mental understanding of doctrines are not necessarily those who live a proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is another group of Christians who are not very smart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not know much, but they are very zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They laugh and cry easily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are rich in emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they touch the Bible, they are easily moved to tears or laughter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They work only when they feel a burning within.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In their zeal, they preach to whomever they see and do not stop even when their voices become hoarse.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wherever they go they carry an air of excitement, but when their zeal fades away, even ten persons could not move them an inch.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These people have a strong soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They can be stirred up quickly, and they can stir up many people when their hearts are burning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They can cry with others or laugh with others, but when the tide of excitement subsides, they cannot bring anyone to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They touch others with their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they are stirred up, they think highly of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when they become cold, they will not move at all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such Christians cannot be of much use to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose a man has a clear mind before the Lord, a proper emotion, good knowledge of the Bible, and zealousness in serving others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All of these things are wonderful, but if he has never been touched by the Lord, he cannot serve God in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He needs to be touched in his will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a man's spirit is dead before God, he is totally useless in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The spirit must be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thank the Lord that our spirit today is a new spirit, a regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This regenerated spirit is our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every Christian has received the same life from God in his spirit; there is no difference between him and others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The same Spirit who dwells in a weak brother also dwelt in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as we are the Lord's, the new creation in our spirit is the same as in others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is not a respecter of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, when the inner man lives out the life of the Lord, there can be a big difference in the degree of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This difference has much to do with man's natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The mind, emotion, and will are the original and natural faculties of man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Holy Spirit is within him, and his regenerated spirit has become the new man, the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet he still has an outward man, the old man, the original man outside of him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This outward man belongs to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The old man has been dealt with on the cross, but the life of the old creation still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since the inner new man can only be expressed through the outer man, the expressions and manifestations are different in different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The inner life is frustrated by the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the outer man must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, there will always be obstacles that obstruct a man from serving the Lord.</S>
