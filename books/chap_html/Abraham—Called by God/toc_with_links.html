The messages in this volume are devoted primarily to the experience of Abraham, the one called by God to become the father of the called race. Having been called by God, Abraham was trained to live by faith in God as the unique source. Living the life of an altar and a tent, Abraham eventually came to know grace for the fulfillment of God’s purpose and to live in fellowship with God. Because the experience of Isaac is, to a great extent, interwoven with that of Abraham and because many of the aspects of Isaac’s life are covered in the messages on Abraham, this volume includes messages that concentrate on the spiritual significance of Isaac, who rested in and enjoyed the riches bestowed on him by Abraham. May all the children of God, all the called ones, walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham (Rom. 4:12).</p></td></tr></table></div>
