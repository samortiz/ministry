If someone takes the way of one man speaking and the rest listening for more than ten years, the ones under his speaking, who received much help, will be annulled in their function and their capacity of speaking for the Lord. Now that we are practicing the God-ordained way, many new ones among us are being raised up in a proper way to be functioning members of the Body of Christ.</P><P>For conferences or trainings, it is all right to have the ministry of the word. But for a brother to speak and the rest listen every Lord's Day in the church meetings annuls the functioning of the saints. Furthermore, everyone enjoys hearing the new ones speak. We like to hear them say something about Christ in their fresh way. If only a few brothers speak all the time, the riches in all the members of the Body of Christ cannot be released. In the God-ordained way, all the riches of Christ come out through His members. Then the church meetings are like a love feast with many different portions of food.</P><P>We need to drop the system of one man speaking and the rest listening and take the God-ordained way of having the church meetings in mutuality. The age has changed, and the tide of the Lord's move is here among us. If some try to maintain the old way, they will cause trouble, and eventually, they will be sifted. All the churches are endeavoring to fully enter into the God-ordained way. We do not want to see anyone go back to the old way. This will create trouble. I hope that we can all have a real turn to the new way, the God-ordained way. This is the tide of the Lord's move today, and we have no choice except to follow Him according to His way.</P><P>After passing through many experiences throughout the years, I feel that today is the most golden time. The entire world, especially eastern Europe and Russia, is open to the truths which have been released in the Lord's recovery. We need to learn the lessons from our past history so that we do not repeat the negative things. We have seen from the training on Zechariah that when the Lord comes back, the remnant of Israel will have learned the lessons. They will be empty and ready to take Christ as everything. We should learn to take care of Christ, His Body, and the truth. If we take care of these three things properly, there will be no problems. We should not let anything frustrate us from these three things. We should not take in anything or care for anything but Christ, His Body&#151;the church, and the truth.</P><P>As we take the Lord's new way to build up the church, we will be greatly blessed. We will enjoy the Lord as our rain much more than we did in the past (Zech. 10:1; Hosea 6:3). I hope that we will rise up to drop everything other than Christ and to carry Christ as our ark, to carry the Body of Christ as our tabernacle, and to follow the truth as our pillar of fire in the night and our pillar of cloud in the day. The past turmoils should be warnings and lessons to us. We do not want to repeat these things or be influenced by them. We have Christ, we have the church, and we have the truth. Let us go on in this way.</P><P>We need to maintain a good order in the Body by being subject to one another. Then we will keep the one accord without criticizing, without despising, and without opposing. We should respect one another, help one another, perfect one another in life, and complete one another in work. We should never despise or criticize others. Instead, we should always receive the help from others and return help to them. We want to be perfected and to perfect others. We should not think that our work is complete or consummate. We should want to be completed and helped by others. Then we can help others to complete their work. If we take this way, we will be greatly blessed by the Lord's dear, sweet presence. Then at His coming back we will be rewarded, and we will be His bride to match Him and to fight the war against Antichrist.</P><P>After the recent training on Daniel and Zechariah, the view in the Bible, the divine revelation, is so clear to us. Nothing counts and everything is vanity except God's economy with Christ as the center, the hub, and as the circumference, the rim, making us His members to constitute His Body and preparing us to be His bride so that we can return with Him to defeat Antichrist and his followers to bring in the kingdom of God as the great mountain which will fill the whole earth. This is the ultimate end of the divine revelation in the Bible. Since we have seen this, we should spontaneously forget everything in the past. We should go on with our Christ, who is God's centrality and universality, so that we can fulfill His heart's desire.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_080.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
