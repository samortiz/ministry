When He was on the earth, the multitudes were attracted to Him because He exhibited a divinely human life among them
Not only did the works of His divine power appeal to the masses, but also His human compassion and sympathy touched them
What is so appealing about this Jesus can now become our very life, for He is available to us through the Spirit of the glorified Jesus
Our lives are spent in dissatisfied longing that drives us to feats of greatest accomplishment and acts of deepest depravity
In these verses, the apostle John says that 'the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified'
What is referred to here is not simply the Spirit of God, who as the divine Person possesses the divine nature
The designations are not insignificant, for they indicate various aspects of the glorified Jesus coming to man as the Spirit
In Acts 16:7 we read that the Spirit of Jesus prevented the apostles from traveling to certain parts in their gospel work
In this context the Spirit is called the Spirit of Jesus because He bears the humanity, human living, and death of Jesus to His believers
The Spirit is called the Spirit of Christ because the divinity and resurrection of Christ are made real to us by Him
In Philippians 1:19 He is called the Spirit of Jesus Christ, indicating that He is the source of the bountiful supply to the believers
All that the Lord Jesus Christ is, is now available for us and for our situation because the Lord is now the Spirit
The Spirit of the glorified Jesus is also called the Spirit of life because He bears to us the Lord's divine and human life
In the Bible death is called the last enemy , because beyond all enemies that we struggle with, death is the ultimate enemy
He is not only the eternal life but also the resurrection life , the life that has not only passed through death but even conquered it
He does not merely possess the resurrection life but gives the resurrection life to His believers that they also may be conquerors of death
We who believe in Christ receive the Spirit in these two aspects: inwardly He is our life, and outwardly He is our power and authority
The aspects of the Spirit that Jesus enjoyed in His earthly life have been made available to us through the Spirit of the glorified Jesus
Jesus Christ is certainly the most wonderful person in the universe, and all that He is, is available to us through His Spirit
When we repent of our sins and believe in Christ, we receive the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, who bears to us all that Christ is
