   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One God and Father, Overshadowing Us,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Taking Care of Us, and Being with Us</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The seventh factor of our Christian faith is the one God and Father, who is overshadowing us, taking care of us, and is always with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With the Body of Christ, the Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The one God and Father is over all to overshadow us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is also through all to take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Finally, He is in us all to be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father is our source.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As those who are in Him, we are under His overshadowing, under His care, and under His presence to enjoy the Son as our element with the Spirit as our essence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we have the Father, we have the Son and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These Three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The essence is one with the element, and the element is one with the source.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we can see that our Christian faith is not of minor doctrines such as foot-washing or head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our Christian faith is of seven factors: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These seven factors of our Christian faith are the first base of the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. The Oneness of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second base of the oneness of the church is the oneness of the Spirit Eph 4:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"The oneness of the Spirit" simply means that the oneness is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit Himself, who is the essence of the Body, is the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we Christians should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we divide the indwelling Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can we divide the inner essence of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>C. The Oneness of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The third base of the oneness of the church is the oneness of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 17:21 the Lord said, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The oneness the Lord is speaking of here is the oneness among the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord prayed that we would be one just as the Triune God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Three of the Triune God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Father, and both the Father and the Son are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we are in the Triune God, in the divine "Us."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, we all are in this One.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This does not make us God, but we must declare the fact that we are one with our God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, we must have the boldness and the full assurance to say that we are one with God because we are in God and God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In John 17:22 the Lord prayed, "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We Christians, we believers, should be one just as the three persons of the Godhead are one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The glory which was given to the Son by the Father was given by the Son to us so that we might be one in this glory to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God wants all of His believers to be one in the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The oneness of the divine Trinity is the base of our oneness today.</S>
