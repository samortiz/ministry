   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INDWELT BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND DRINKING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After believing and being baptized, we are indwelt by the Spirit Rom 8:9, 11; 1 Cor 6:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As He indwells us, we are drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The drinking fountain is right in our spirit John 4:14, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must turn to our spirit and drink by calling on the name of the Lord 1 Cor 12:3, 13b .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have the Spirit as the aggregate of the Triune God indwelling us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1936 when I saw that God was living in me, I was beside myself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I wanted to go outside, get up on the roof or run into the street, and shout to people, "Do not touch me; I have God in me!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Triune God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He indwells us, and we are drinking of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is our drinking fountain; this fountain is not in the heavens but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>LIVING AND WALKING IN THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we must live and walk in the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 8:4 and Galatians 5:16 and 25 refer to this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>J. N. Darby points out the difficulty of putting a large or small S on spirit in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Though he does not use the word mingled, he surely conveys the thought that these two spirits are considered as one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Galatians 5:16 the Greek word for walk is to have our being, to move, and to act.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here is the consummate charge of the New Testament: to live, to have our being, to walk, to move, and to act according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All we do must be according to our spirit indwelt and mingled with the compound Spirit, not according to ethical teachings or moral regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To walk according to the Spirit is much higher than to walk according to ethical teachings or moral regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The moving of the Spirit is called the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1 John 2:20 and 27 we see that we all have received an anointing from the Holy One.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This anointing within us is true; it teaches us to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The anointing which John talks about in 1 John 2 refers to the ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The tabernacle and all its utensils were anointed with that compound ointment Exo 30:26-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today the compound ointment, the Spirit, is within our spirit anointing us, moving within us, all day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even when we are arguing or when we are about to argue, the anointing within moves in us not to continue, but to go to our bedroom and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day a sister went shopping, but whenever she picked up an item to consider buying it, the anointing within told her to put it down.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything she picked up she had to put back.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Finally she decided she had better go home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As she obeyed the inner anointing and went back to her car to drive home, she felt excited and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not take heed to the inner anointing, we offend the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must live and walk according to this Spirit who is mingled with our spirit.</S>
