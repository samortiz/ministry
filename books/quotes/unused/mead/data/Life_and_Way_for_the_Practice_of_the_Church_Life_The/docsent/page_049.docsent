   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE GROUND OF ONENESS Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5-8, 11-15, 17-18, 20-22, 26-27; 14:22-23; 15:19-20; 16:16-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will go on to see something in more detail concerning the way for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Deuteronomy is a book which shows the proper way for the children of Israel as God's people, after their entrance into the land of Canaan, to have a life, a walk, or a living according to God's mind which would be well pleasing to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The holy living mentioned in the book of Deuteronomy is a living of worship, or service, to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our life must be a life that is absolutely dedicated to the worship, the service, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE GOOD LAND AS A TYPE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The things which the people of Israel experienced in the Old Testament are pictures, types, figures, and shadows, pointing us to the reality of the things in the New Testament time 1 Cor 10:6, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The land of Canaan into which the children of Israel entered is a type of the all-inclusive Christ Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt and transferred them into the land of Canaan to worship and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This typifies that God has delivered us out of the world, out of the authority of the darkness of Satan, and transferred us into Christ v. 13 . Now we are walking, living, working, and worshipping and serving God in Christ 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they had the lamb of the Passover, which is a type of Christ as the initiation of our experience of Him 1 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our experience of Christ begins with the experience of Him as the redeeming Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then after the children of Israel came out of Egypt, while they were wandering and traveling in the wilderness, they had the daily manna and the rock out of which flowed the living water 1 Cor 10:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are further types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After we experience Christ as the redeeming Lamb, we enjoy Him day by day as the daily manna and the living rock.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later on there was the tabernacle with all its furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All these are types of the different aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we enjoy and experience Christ in the different aspects typified by the tabernacle and its different furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This, however, is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the children of Israel entered into Canaan, the manna stopped, and they had to eat the produce of the land Josh 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the children of Israel entered into Canaan, everything they needed for their living was taken from the land.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They ate the things produced by this land, they drank something from this land, and they even had a building as their house from this land and on this land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everything necessary for their living came out of this land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the good land is the all-inclusive type of Christ, that is, Christ as everything to us in an all-inclusive way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TWO WAYS TO ENJOY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE PRODUCE OF THE GOOD LAND</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The enjoyment of the produce of the good land was definitely regulated and ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There were two ways for the children of Israel to enjoy the produce of the good land the personal way and the corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to consider the passages from the book of Deuteronomy listed at the beginning of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, the children of Israel had the full liberty to enjoy the produce in a personal way at any time and in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There was, however, another aspect, a corporate aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they enjoyed the produce of the land of Canaan for their worship to God and for their fellowship with the people of God, they had to be regulated, ruled, and governed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They had no freedom to choose any place according to their desire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They had to go to the one place appointed, chosen, and ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In these verses which we quoted from Deuteronomy, the phrase the place which Jehovah will choose occurs repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, the children of Israel had the full liberty to enjoy the produce according to their desire, but that applied to only ninety percent of the produce.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, they had no right to enjoy the top one-tenth of their produce at any place of their choice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They had to bring all these things to the very place which the Lord chose or appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The appointed place of God's choice is a type, the significance of which we must see.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are fair, we must apply all the types to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, we know that the good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the produce of Canaan is a type of the experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God gave the good land to the children of Israel, but they had to labor on it they had to till the ground, sow the seed, reap the harvest, and take care of the herds and flocks.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This typifies that since we have been transferred into Christ, who is the allotted portion of the saints in the light Col 1:12-13 , we have to work, to labor, on Christ day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the morning, we have to pray to Him and fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By laboring on Christ, we will have something produced out of Christ for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many Christians, although they have Christ and are in Christ, are lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They do not labor on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Day by day they neither pray nor have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They do not have something out of Christ as their spiritual food to nourish their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Due to their laziness, they have become poor.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since we are in Christ and Christ is our portion, we have to cooperate with God by laboring on Christ, just as the children of Israel did.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God gave the children of Israel the good land, and He also gave them the air, the rain, and the sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They, however, had to cooperate with God by working on the land that they might have something produced from the land.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All of the produce is a type of the experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we labor on Christ and work together with Christ, we will have many things produced out of Christ as food to us for our enjoyment, and we will have a surplus of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As we mentioned earlier, there are two ways ordained by God for His people to enjoy the produce of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One way is that in our personal enjoyment of Christ we have the full liberty to enjoy anything of Christ at any time and in any place as our food for our own nourishment and spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The second way to enjoy Christ is related to our corporate enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The children of Israel had no right, no freedom, to choose any place for them to bring their tithes, their burnt offerings, their heave offerings, and their vows to God as their worship to God in fellowship with God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They had to go to the place chosen by God.</S>
