 <h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH OUR DISPOSITION<br />
FOR THE SAKE OF FRUITFULNESS</h2>
<p>Our disposition is the cause for our not bearing fruit and using our talent to care for people. We are still too natural. Some persons are always slow, regardless of the situation they are in or the persons they are with. It is as if they would not even pour water on a house fire before they carefully checked what kind of water they should use. This kind of person will try to justify himself from the Bible, claiming that God is always patient and never does anything in a hurry. Brother Watchman Nee pointed out to us how the Lord once ran to do something. When the prodigal son returned home, the father ran to meet him (Luke 15:20). The Lord may be patient in every other matter, but He is quick to receive sinners. Some, though are too quick. They bear fruit quickly, but then because they offend the fruit with their quickness, eventually they have no remaining fruit. I do not care to rebuke or expose anyone. We simply must go to the Lord and let Him shine on us. Then we will see how natural we are. By His mercy, we must have a change. If we are slow, we should speed up, and if we are quick, we should slow down.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago I gave a training on thirty points of character. Character is different from disposition; it is thirty percent disposition by birth and seventy percent habit by our living. In order to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand for fruit-bearing, we must deal with our disposition. In my ministry I have seen many kinds of disposition. Some people are peculiar in their way of speaking. They can make people laugh, but it is difficult for them to minister life to others. These dear ones need to be dealt with in their disposition. Some of the dear saints are too loose and light. They are never accurate in speaking or in doing things. That is also according to their natural disposition. The more our disposition is touched, the more useful we are in the ministry of speaking for the Lord. Some were born with a disposition for speaking, but they are not genuinely useful. In order to speak for the Lord, we must be reconstituted in our being, that is, changed in our disposition. Many times I have gone to the Lord and condemned myself, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I exercise my old, natural, dispositional way in speaking.&rdquo; Because of this, the Lord has had the ground to change my way of speaking over the years.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:1 says, &ldquo;If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work,&rdquo; but to be an overseer requires that our disposition be dealt with in many directions. Otherwise, we are not qualified. We cannot be too slow or too quick, too strong or too soft. When there is the need to be strong, we must be strong, and when there is the need to be soft, we must be soft. Different situations require our disposition to be adjusted in different ways. An elder must truly be flexible. A good elder can speak a strong word of adjustment to a brother and then speak with him in a very pleasant way. However, this is not to play politics. We must be genuine. Even a small child knows whether or not someone is genuine. If someone loves a child genuinely, he knows it, but if that love is not genuine, he knows this also. People are able to discern. Therefore, we must not play politics; we must be what we are. The only way to be able to adjust a brother and then be pleasant with him is by having our disposition dealt with. The best way to be dealt with is to hate our disposition. Our disposition is the depth of our self, which must be denied. If we are not useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand for taking care of people, it is due to our raw, natural disposition.</p>
<p>It is easier to deal with our disposition when we are young. Brother Nee once told us that by the time someone is fifty years old, it is difficult for his disposition and natural life to be touched by the Lord. We must not wait until we are too old to have our disposition dealt with. The earlier we deal with it, the better. Dealing with outward wrongdoings is not as important as this. The most important thing that must be dealt with in our life with the Lord is our disposition. We must learn to have our disposition dealt with by the Lord. If we pay adequate attention to the Lord and pray much about this, it will be easy for us to care for others, bear fruit, and make a profit by using our talent. Then our entire situation will be radically changed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FRUIT BEING THE OVERFLOW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Many in today&rsquo;s Christianity teach that the reason we do not bear fruit is that we are short of power from on high. They say we should pray and fast for a certain number of days until the power comes as the baptism in the Holy Spirit. I observed this kind of practice for many years, but I still did not see much remaining fruit. For the branches of the vine tree to bear remaining fruit is not a matter of this kind of revival; it is a matter of growth. When branches receive a sufficient supply of life-juice, they bear fruit as the overflow of the inner life supply. This, not revival, is what the Lord needs. In the Gospel of John there is no hint of revival. Rather, what is revealed in this book is the genuine, growing life out of which comes fruit as the overflow. Fruit is the overflow of life. If we do not bear fruit, it is because we do not have the overflow of life; we are short and undersupplied by the inner life. For many years the Lord has restrained us from emphasizing revival. Even when we did have a revival, it was in a restricted way. What the Lord requires in His economy is the genuine growth of life. Then out of this growth, we have an overflow of life, which is fruit that remains. Brother Nee once told us that if every one-talented person in the church would use his talent, we will have a true remaining revival. What the Lord needs is not the kind of revival that comes and goes but the exercise of our talent with the growth in life. In order to have this, the basic condition is to deal with our disposition.</p>
