<h1 class="title">SOME MATTERS RELATED<br />
TO FULL-TIME SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GIVING ALL THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS<br />
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE</h2>
<p>We should not consider that the full-time serving ones are a special group of people. Moreover, we should not take the presence of the full-time serving ones as a reason to lessen the responsibility of or reduce the opportunity for other brothers and sisters to serve. Currently, there is such a trend in some local churches. Some saints have told the leading ones, &ldquo;Since there are full-time serving ones, why do you want us to serve?&rdquo; If the saints have such a concept, we should immediately reduce the number of full-time serving ones so that those who say such things will come and serve.</p>
<p>This kind of speaking has several possible implications. First, it indicates that the saints have the heart to serve but have not been given the opportunity. Second, it shows that although they desired to serve, they no longer have such a desire because they see that the full-timers are serving. Third, they may think that they are not needed because there are full-time serving ones. The thought behind the third implication is negative and unintentionally causes the full-time serving ones to become a special group within the church. Such a thought makes serving the Lord the business of the full-time serving ones and allows the saints who are not serving full time to rest. To counteract this, the responsible brothers in all the churches should endeavor and try their best to give the working saints opportunities to serve and be perfected. In this way, we can avoid the possibility of the full-time serving ones becoming a special class.</p>
<p>In every locality we should help the brothers and sisters see that serving the Lord is for everyone, regardless of whether they are serving full time or holding a job. It is an erroneous concept to think that only those who drop their jobs can minister the word in a ministry meeting. It is true that some&mdash;according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading, commission, and arrangement&mdash;drop their jobs to serve full time in the ministry of the word. This is good. However, it would be even better if some who hold jobs would also minister the word. Hence, we should not say that only those who drop their jobs can minister the word in a ministry meeting.</p>
<p>Likewise, some elders are very capable and have continued to hold their jobs. Others do not have the capacity to do both and have dropped their jobs in order to serve full time. There should not be the thought that only certain things can be done by full-time serving ones. In regard to serving in the church, no distinction should be made between those who serve full time and those who serve while holding a job. The only difference is how they maintain their livelihood. Some maintain a livelihood by holding a job to support themselves, others do so by looking to God for provision, and still others draw on their savings or inheritance. Thus, the difference is not in regard to how they function, or serve, but in regard to how they maintain their livelihood.</p>
<p>We should never regard the full-time serving ones as clergy. We should not even say that they are the &ldquo;called ones.&rdquo; In the church everyone is a serving one. We simply have different ways of providing for our livelihood. The responsible brothers in all the churches need to make this matter clear to the saints. In the church there is no clergy; moreover, the full-time serving ones are not clergy. A capable co-worker may function much and yet continue to hold a job. Nevertheless, another co-worker, who has less capacity, may drop his job because he has received the Lord&rsquo;s commission and his daily necessities have been taken care of through an arrangement in the environment. This has nothing to do with either brother&rsquo;s competence in the service. The only difference between them is how they take care of their livelihood.</p>
<p>On my part, I do not know if one day the Lord will want me to take a job. However, if I take a job, it does not mean that I will stop serving the Lord. We should never think that if a person has a job, he does not need to serve anymore. Having a job or not having a job is not related to service but only to providing for one&rsquo;s living. In regard to serving the Lord we should not make a distinction between those who serve full time and those who hold a job. The full-time serving ones should not have the attitude that they need to do everything because they serve full time. Likewise, the working saints should not have the attitude that they do not need to do anything because others are serving full time. Both concepts are wrong.</p>
<p>Moreover, the full-timers should not be given special or favorable treatment in the church. It seems that in some of the churches the full-timers are given a special position; this is not right. They should not have any priority or special position in the church. In the church we may have different ways of taking care of our livelihood. Being a doctor, working as a clerk, and engaging in business are all for the purpose of providing a livelihood. Likewise, trusting in God&rsquo;s provision is also a means of caring for one&rsquo;s livelihood. Although there is a difference in the way saints earn a living, there is no difference between the saints in serving the Lord. In terms of service, all the saints should have an equal opportunity to serve. In this regard, we are all the same. All the brothers and sisters should be clear about this.</p>
