   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GIVING NO OCCASION OF STUMBLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 32 says, Give no occasion of stumbling both to Jews and to Greeks and to the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek words rendered, Give no occasion of stumbling, may also be translated, Do not become a stumbling block.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word aproskopos is derived from the same root as proskomma for stumbling block in 8:9.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is different from skandalizo, the Greek word for stumble in 8:13.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 32 Paul speaks of Jews, Greeks, and the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In New Testament times people were of three classes: the Jews God s chosen people; the Greeks the unbelieving Gentiles; and the church a composition of the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not be an offense, a stumbling block, to any of these three, that they might be saved v. 33 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>PLEASING ALL MEN IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 33 Paul declares, Even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own advantage, but that of the many, that they may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What a marvelous example the apostle has set for us!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is possible to apply incorrectly Paul s word about pleasing all men in all things and about seeking the advantage of the many that they may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of those who misapply this verse say that in order to bring people to the Lord, we must come down to their level.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is to say that we must go back to the world in order to bring people to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, history has proved that this does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, those who apply Paul s words in this way are more likely to be brought back to the world themselves than they are to bring others to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In preaching the gospel we should not lower our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead of coming down from the mountain, we should remain on the mountain and call others to come up to where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must be very careful of misusing this verse and forming it into a principle contrary to Paul s meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>IMITATING ONE WHO IMITATES CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 11:1, a verse which actually belongs to the conclusion of chapter ten, Paul says, Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because Paul was a follower of Christ, it was right for the Corinthian believers, and all others, to follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If anyone is an imitator of Christ, we should be imitators of him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This makes us also imitators of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, we should be imitators of no man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, in following anyone who is an imitator of Christ, we do not follow that person, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>FOCUSED ON THE CENTRAL VISION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not have any burden to speak on the four basic principles regulating the conduct of New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many years ago, I gave messages on each of these principles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today my burden is that the Lord s people would be brought back to the central vision of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, we need to apply these verses and these principles to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would be unhappy to see the saints applying them as proverbs to humanity in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In considering these principles and this section of 1 Corinthians, we need to be focused on the central vision of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all need to pay our attention to this vision and pray more concerning it.</S>
