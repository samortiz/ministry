   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE DANCE OF TWO ARMIES Scripture Reading: S. S. 5:4-6, 8-9, 16; 6:1-6, 10, 13 FOUR ATTAINMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have seen in the past chapters, the seeking one in the Song of Songs reached at least four attainments.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter two, she reached the first attainment, after which she became contented.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Due to this, a discrepancy arose between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second attainment was reached when she became a crown to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet at that time she herself realized that there were still some shadows and that her day had not yet broken.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, she progressed by going to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By this she was transferred to the top of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was her third attainment, at which she again became contented.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord then came to call her from what she had attained.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She answered the Lord's call to reach the fourth attainment by becoming a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a much further, higher, and deeper attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Formerly, she was enjoying the Lord, but now she is producing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She was a partaker, but now she has become a producer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The poetry here reveals that she now becomes very contented, even more contented than she was in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore she says, "I sleep, but my heart waketh."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At this juncture the Lord calls her again to leave her attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, we see four attainments in chapters two through five, with at least one in each chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The last attainment was reached when she became a producing garden, growing out what she had enjoyed of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But still the Lord's purpose had not been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The garden is not the consummation of the Bible; it is only the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TWO MAIN DISCREPANCIES</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In these four attainments, we see two main discrepancies between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first is in chapter two, and the second is in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two discrepancies really speak something to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I must say again, this is not a book of teaching, but a map for our spiritual driving.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It reveals all the turns we must make in order to fulfill God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the discrepancy of chapter two, she heard the voice of the Lord, and she saw the Lord's countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in the discrepancy of chapter five, the Lord showed her His hand: "My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for him" 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord showed her His countenance, He attracted her by His loveliness and His beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His face signifies His beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in the second discrepancy, the Lord did not show her His face, but rather His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Bible, the hand signifies working and doing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE LORD'S WAY OF WORKING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What was the Lord showing her by this vision?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He had already shown her that He was the one under the dew in the night, suffering for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now He continued by showing her that whatever He did on this earth was not according to His own taste, opinion, or feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was absolutely according to the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He worked for the Father, not according to His own desire, but according to His Father's desire and to fulfill His Father's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now it is not a matter of the Lord's beauty or attractiveness, but a matter of the Lord's working.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By this vision the Lord taught her to take His way of working.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If she is to work with Him on this earth, she must learn to work according to the Lord's way.</S>
