Christians generally say that God's administration in the Old Testament was first the priests, then the kings, and finally the prophets
Just as in the New Testament, God's administration in the Old Testament involved apostles, prophets, and elders
The word apostle is an anglicized Greek word referring to one who is sent with a commission and implies that the sending one has authority
In Exodus 3 and 4 God called Moses and sent him to deal with Pharaoh and to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt
Moses somewhat shrank back, saying that he was not a good speaker, which compelled God to use Aaron to speak for Moses
We know this because Moses and Aaron were always together when they went to see Pharaoh and when they spoke to the children of Israel
Ephesians 3:5 says that God's New Testament economy 'has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit'
In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the divine concept is that the apostle and the prophet are one
The apostles stand mainly for God's authority, or administration, and the prophets stand mainly for God's speaking
Apostles also speak, but the term apostle primarily refers to the administrative aspect, and prophet refers to the speaking aspect
Those who are directly involved in God's administration are of only three categories-apostles, prophets, and elders
Now therefore listen to their voice, but you shall solemnly warn them and declare to them the practice of the king who will reign over them
The thought to have a king to 'judge us and go out before us and fight our battles' has existed among God's people for many centuries
God does not want to have a human king among His people, because once a king comes in, the headship of God is usurped
The elders of the children of Israel did not want to be bothered with their responsibilities of judging and fighting
If she does not prepare the food well, her family can still eat it, and she will learn from her mistakes so that her cooking will improve
The elders of Israel became lazy and idle, preferring the convenience of the kingship according to the custom of the nations
For the sake of convenience, the members of a denomination donate money to hire a pastor as a king to do everything for them
Peter exhorts the elders, 'Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God;
We must see that in God's economy for His administration, He desires to keep the kingship uniquely for Himself
In order to receive God's blessing, we must not open the door for a king to come in, nor should we desire to be a king
God sends His apostles and establishes His prophets and the elders among His people, but He has no desire for there to be a king
If there is one apostle, prophet, or elder above the others, that one is a king, which is an insult to Christ's headship and the kingship
The desire of the children of Israel for a king was according to the custom of the nations, which are abominable in the eyes of God
For every need they should pray, fellowship, and wait on the Lord to receive direction, guidance, and leading directly from Him
No matter how weak certain persons may be, when they are married and have a family, they find a way to take care of their family
They should not always look to others for help but must be diligent and faithful and must open directly to the Lord in prayer
Every elder must exercise discernment and pray to seek the Lord's leading while respecting the Lord's leading in the other elders
The elders must be diligent active and faithful to the Lord not expecting someone else to do everything for them for the sake of convenience
The term elder which simply means an older person or a person of advanced age implies one who is produced by the growth and maturity of life
To appoint elders is simply to point out or indicate to the saints who the elders are in order to avoid confusion or complication
In 1 Corinthians 7, which was written in Paul's early ministry, Paul's opinion was that it was better for widows to remain single
We should not decide whether a brother is an elder at an early stage of his growth in life, when he is immature
The migrations in the past few years have allowed a subtle practice to creep in, which we may call the transfer of elders
The elders in Judah belonged to the tribe of Judah; they could not transfer to the tribe of Dan to be elders of that tribe
Because some misunderstood what happened in these migrations, the practice of transferring elders subtly crept in
The elders in some local churches may feel that they are weak and need to be helped by the addition of an elder from another locality
We need to keep the principle that the parents of a family are not rearranged or replaced, no matter how weak they may be
Those who complain that they are weak are only admitting that they are slothful in seeking the Lord by praying and getting into the Word
When a need arises, we should not immediately ask for help from others; instead, we should first go to the Lord over and over again
If we still are not clear regarding a certain matter after we have sought the Lord many times, we can ask others for help
The parents in a family may be well educated and intelligent, and the parents in another family may be uneducated and ignorant
On the other hand, it is also wrong to be improperly humble, saying that we know nothing and need others' help in everything
Those who have learned the necessary spiritual lessons of the Lord will not quickly agree to go to help another local church when invited
Local churches have been damaged in the past because the elders did not exercise discernment in opening to others for help
The elders must be desperate in seeking the Lord; they need to pray, fellowship, and wait on the Lord, spending much time in His presence
The elders' capacity to help the saints in their locality does not depend on eloquence, gift, or natural ability
A certain American surgeon who taught at a renowned university in northern China was not saved when he came to China
Many were saved through him because he prayed much and lived a life of loving and following the Lord and loving sinners
In the past false ones have been able to come in and damage the local churches mainly because of their eloquence and outward ability
The elders must learn the lesson to not trust in such outward things or to rely entirely on help from outsiders
It has been made clear in our history that the eldership in a newly established church cannot and should not be determined right away
We should not be concerned about who will bear the responsibilities-some will spontaneously rise up to meet the needs
Why are you now testing God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the synagogues, he being read every Sabbath
When they had been sent away, they went down to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they handed them the letter
Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, exhorted the brothers through much speaking and confirmed them
When they had spent some time there, they were sent away with peace from the brothers to those who had sent them
Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and announcing the word of the Lord as the gospel with many others also
Many Christians believe that Jerusalem was the early headquarters of the church, controlling and giving orders to the other churches
The third principle revealed in Acts 15 is that not only the apostles but also the elders represented the churches
Verse 12b says, 'They listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them'
When Paul and Barnabas are mentioned in chapter 15, sometimes Paul is listed first, but other times Barnabas is listed first
After much discussion and a few testimonies, James, a brother who knew the Scriptures, quoted from God's Word to confirm the testimonies
The account in Acts 15 is quite valuable because it allows us to see that there was discussion among the early apostles and elders
The judgment he spoke was according to the holy Word and corresponded with the testimonies of the experienced ones
Verse 28 says, 'It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things'
Just as the apostles and elders made the decision with the church, so also the Holy Spirit made the decision with the apostles and elders
The elders in a local church should present the major problems they are facing to the elders of the other churches to seek their feeling
We cannot say that a particular local church can make a decision affecting the other churches without fellowship
There should be much discussion, testimonies regarding the historical facts, and confirmation from the holy Word
As a result, whatever the eventual decision may be, we will have the full assurance that it seems good to the Holy Spirit and to us
The record in Acts 15 is beautiful because it shows that among the saints and among the churches, there was only one Head
In this way we honor the headship of Christ and can have the full assurance that the blessing will be transmitted from the Head to the Body
The decision was apparently made by the apostles and elders, but it was actually made by the Holy Spirit with them
Because they discussed without insisting they were able to accept the final decision even if the decision went against their initial opinion
Similarly, in order to participate in the fellowship of the co-workers and elders, we must be qualified and purified
Because the early apostles and elders had adequately learned the lessons of the cross, they were qualified to have such a discussion
He also must have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil
The writings of Paul and Peter concerning the eldership were certainly based on their experiences and observations over many years
We must note that in the writings of both Paul and Peter very little is said concerning the abilities of the elders
Parents may not have much ability in teaching, but they should nevertheless be apt to teach their children at home
According to Paul's word in 1 Timothy 3:1-7, eldership is not a matter of gift or ability but a matter of life
In Paul's later ministry he did not appoint elders immediately after establishing a church but left this matter to his co-workers
It takes more than a few months to truly know a person because it takes time for a person's real condition in life to be exposed
Someone may pretend to be patient, humble, and not ambitious for a few months, but it is difficult to pretend for more than a year
If within a year there has not been a situation that tempts a brother's ambition, it may remain hidden until such a situation arises
Humanly speaking, to be such an overseer requires some ability, but Paul instead emphasizes character, disposition, conduct, and being
In order to be an overseer in the church, a brother must be the right kind of person, not in what he can do but in what he is
The condition of people's family life is not determined by their ability as much as by their character, disposition, conduct, and being
In 1 Timothy 3:1 Paul writes, 'Faithful is the word: If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work'
If an elder is afraid of others' aspiration, this may indicate that he is trying to hold on to his personal kingdom
To be without reproach does not mean to be perfect or blameless in the eyes of God; rather, it means to be irreproachable in the eyes of man
Few Christians today are able to receive light from the Bible because their minds are not sober and are quite complicated
In order to receive light from the Word of God, a mind must be pure, clean, and straight, without any peculiar thinking
The elders need to realize that serving the saints as overseers and shepherds requires much time because human life is full of turmoil
If we can give them an hour or two so that they can release all that is on their heart, that will be a rest to them
We may not be able to solve their problems, but we can give them rest because they trust and respect us as elders
Just as an on-call physician must be available to provide medical care at any time, an elder must always be available to help the saints
It tests whether we love the members of the church and are compassionate, patient, and willing to be a sacrifice
After the elder gives him directions, the brother may confess that he does not have a car or the money to hire a taxi
If the elder does not know how to find the place where a brother needs to go, he should still drive the brother to look for the place
To be hospitable is to be willing to give and be troubled, bothered, and exhausted in order to take care of others
Although this will exhaust us and test us, it should not be something that we merely tolerate but something that we are inclined to do
With the phrase apt to teach the apostle Paul indicates that an overseer must have the concern, the willingness, and the habit to teach
The elders cannot contend or fight with other saints but must be lenient and flexible with everyone in every situation
These qualifications are not a kind of law or commandment; instead, they show us what the Lord can do within us
We should be encouraged that because the Word includes these qualifications, the resurrection life will produce them in us
1 Timothy 3:1-7 is actually a revelation of how much the resurrection life of the indwelling Christ can do in us
In 1 Timothy 3:1-7 the apostle Paul writes concerning the requirements of the overseers, which are the qualifications of the elders
Verses 2 and 3 concern mostly virtues and proper conduct, or the manifestation and expression of what the elders are in life
Managing one's house is a matter of taking the lead, but Paul's concept here is not mainly related to authority
As a husband and father, an overseer should take the lead in his family not merely by ruling but by establishing a good example and pattern
In our home we should not try to exercise our authority as a king, law officer, administrator, or school principal
One may have a good character and become a seeking believer, while the other may have a poor character and not even be saved
We should be a good example to our children, but whether or not they will eventually be saved depends on God's predestination
Similarly, we should not assume that our children will behave well if we are a good example, nor should we neglect our duty
The best and most proper way to be a parent is to live as an example to our children and pray for the Lord's mercy
In 1 Peter 5:3 he wrote to the elders, 'Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock'
According to the New Testament, to be an elder is not a matter of position or authority but altogether a matter of life
In order to be a good example, we must love the Lord and His Word, deal with sins, hate the self, and learn the lessons of the cross
When childish or fleshly brothers rebuke the elders, the elders should not defend themselves but continue to express love to those brothers
Timothy 3:6 says, 'Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment suffered by the devil'
When a person is appointed to a special position in a group, the larger the group is, the easier it is for the person to become proud
Although we may not be a new convert, we must see the principle that we must be careful not to become proud when we first become an elder
In the New Testament there is no indication that there is the need of an apprenticeship for someone to become an elder
Based on this principle, when a brother is first appointed as an elder, he should consider himself to be only an apprentice who is learning
Lucifer was placed in a high position, but he became proud of his position and earned God's condemnation and judgment
If an elder is proud, he will follow Satan as a rebel against God's government and authority and will suffer the same judgment
Those who are taking the lead in the churches must be in fear and trembling, praying that the Lord will preserve them from any kind of pride
Especially the younger brothers must learn to be humble in the church, in the meetings, and in contacting others
Timothy 3:7 says, 'He also must have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil'
The apostle Paul indicates that Satan uses the pride of youth and the reproach from the outsiders to damage us
If we do not have a good testimony before the outsiders, Satan will use this reproach as a snare to entangle us
Paul's concept is that we must establish a good example for our family and be careful in our walk before the outsiders
If we lose our temper in front of a relative, that one will be utilized by Satan to tell others of our failure
His word clearly indicates that Satan does not damage us in our work or our ability but in our life, living, and conduct
We must be careful because Satan will continually seek opportunity to damage us as those who care for God's house, the church
Paul's word reveals that there is a battle regarding the eldership because the devil seeks to ruin every elder
The older ones do not have much physical strength or energy, but their experiences are valuable and greatly needed
When brothers are first brought into the meetings of the elders as apprentices, they should only observe to learn
The older elders should bear the responsibility to pray, 'Lord, raise up more proper, useful brothers to bear the burden of the church'
Question: In considering a brother for the eldership, should we take into account his reputation before he was saved?
If a man steals before he is saved, once he becomes a believer, he must make restitution to those from whom he stole
Slander is when we are falsely accused or ill spoken of simply because we have become a believer or come into the church
Even if others revile us when we make restitution to them for past offenses, their conscience will bear testimony to them that we are right
Question: How can an elder who is a father care for his family and also be always available to help the saints?
To sit with them, observe what they are doing, and instruct them is the best encouragement to them and prevents them from being idle
Those who aspire to the eldership need to learn mainly not how to do things but the way to live a life of a high standard
For this, the faith of God's chosen ones, the truth according to godliness, and eternal life are indispensable
According to 1 Timothy 3:15-16, godliness is God manifested in the flesh, the divine life expressed in humanity
We have much to hope for in the eternal life, the life of God, because it is able to do many things that we are unable to do in ourselves
Without the eternal life, we are wretched, hopeless people, but because we have the divine life, we are full of hope
God manifested the word of His promise by Christs incarnation human living crucifixion resurrection ascension and descension as the Spirit
Historically, many Christians have treasured Genesis 3:15, which says that the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent
Confucius taught that the highest learning of ethics is to cultivate or develop ones inner bright virtue which is actually the conscience
Humanly speaking, this is very good, but as Christians, we hope not in the bright virtue but in the eternal life
We cannot meet the requirements of the elders described in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:6-9 simply by cultivating our conscience
The truth of godliness, the hope of eternal life, and the manifestation of God's word all denote God becoming our life
The elders' holding to the faithful word is both to 'exhort by the healthy teaching' and to deal with the opposers
When deceivers are spreading lies, the elders in a local church should not need to call someone from another locality to come and help them
All the elders have to study the Bible and the ministry books in order to be fully educated in the crucial aspects of the truth
These books include all the positive Christian teachings throughout the centuries and sift out the wrong things
When we are educated in the teaching of the apostles, we will be able to safeguard and protect the local church
If we know and experience the truth, our speaking will have impact, not because of eloquence but because of reality
We will be able to refute the lies of those who oppose just as the overseers stopped the mouths of the Judaizers in ancient times
It is also a great enjoyment to help the others in the church, especially to minister Christ to the young ones and the weak ones
Paul was the top apostle, but many of the churches under his ministry were in a poor condition because the elders were inadequate
If the elders function as they should, the local churches will not become an improper hierarchical organization under someone's control
Every local church should be administrated locally, and no local church is higher than the other local churches
When every member of the Body of Christ functions properly, the headship and kingship are kept for the unique Lord
We all must learn these things and hold fast to them in order to stop the mouths of the vain talkers and deceivers
Timothy 517 says Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in word and teaching
The young ones should spend much time studying the Word in order to be built up in the full knowledge of the truth
If the young saints grow in a balanced way in life and truth, they will be well prepared to take care of the churches
Word here denotes the general speaking of doctrines, and teaching denotes special instruction concerning particular things
The elders should be able to teach the saints concerning the practical family life, daily life, and church life
To take care of other things, such as the business affairs in the church, is necessary but not as important as laboring in word and teaching
An elder may be invited to visit the home of some saints to speak to them concerning some point of the truth or a practical matter
For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped'
The devil's goal is to destroy what the Lord loves, but the Bible shows that whatever the devil does eventually helps the Lord
Like the qualifications of the elders, the qualifications of the deacons given by Paul are mainly matters of life and truth
For those who have ministered well obtain for themselves a good standing and much boldness in faith, which is in Christ Jesus
In certain situations in the church life it is wise to say nothing, but whenever we speak, we must speak with one tongue
The faith in 1 Timothy 3:9 is the objective faith, referring not to our believing action but to the things in which we believe
After Christ passed through these processes, the church was produced, and the church is spreading this mystery
Like the elders, the deacons must study the Bible and the ministry books in order to learn the mystery of the faith
If the elders and the deacons meet the high requirements mentioned in these Epistles, the church will certainly be strong
Because we are often polluted by our old man, our fallen nature, and our flesh, we need Your cleansing and Your forgiveness
He exhorts the elders as a fellow elder, a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker of the glory to be revealed
If we are martyrs, those who share in the sufferings of Christ, we will be partakers of the glory in the coming age
The qualifications of the elders are not matters of ability but altogether matters of their life, living, and person
The main thought here is that the eldership depends not on what we can do but on what we are and the kind of life we live
Because the Lord laid down His life for His sheep, He was the first martyr-He lived a life of suffering for His flock
To be an elder requires us not only to be humble, temperate, and sober but also to be ready to suffer as a martyr for the church
The wolves in the Lord's time and the apostles' time were mainly the Judaizers, who were the Jewish religionists
When we consider 1 Peter 5 together with John 10 and 21 and Acts 20, we can see that to be an elder requires a spirit of martyrdom
Peter 5:2b says, 'Overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God; not by seeking gain through base means but eagerly'
To oversee the church is not to rule it but to safeguard, preserve, and protect it as a shepherd oversees a flock
Brother Watchman Nee purposely avoided having special contact with wealthy saints, because he was not seeking base gain
We must earnestly love the saints and be willing to give our life for them without any thought of material gain
The elders, who are His fellow shepherds, must also suffer for the flock with the view that some day they will be with Him in glory
Verse 5a says, 'In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another'
The other temptation for the elders is to think that because they are elders, they have a special rank and are higher than others
In his exhortation Peter does not rank the elders above the other saints but puts all the believers on the same level
As elders, we should not be anxious for our possessions or family, but we must be concerned for the church and the saints
At such times, we need to learn to cast all our anxiety for the church on the Lord because He cares for the church and the elders
Question When the saints come to the elders for advice concerning a practical situation how should we help them without lording it over them
Answer: For an elder to rule or lord it over others is easy, spontaneous, and natural; for an elder not to rule is quite difficult
Peter uses strong words and expressions concerning the elders not lording it over their allotments and girding themselves with humility
We must drop all the natural concepts, practices, and tendencies and see the light that there is no rank in the church
They love and care for the church with an anxious concern for the church's condition and the saints' growth in life
They also need to cast this anxiety on the Lord, trusting in Him because He cares for the church and the elders
The elders in the churches today should spend time to fellowship and pray together concerning their view of the eldership
The New Testament mentions the elders and deacons but does not give detailed instructions concerning the administration of such ones
We will not cover all the details of the vision but will focus on our need to have our vision refreshed and made clear
Because of the great number of Christians on the earth today, some may think that being a Christian is a common thing
We also need a clear view of Christs crucifixion resurrection and ascension including their meaning accomplishment and application to us
Christ is the mystery of God, and as His corporate increase, the church is also a mystery-the mystery of Christ
These experiences are for our participation in the processes of Christ and the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
It would take many messages to cover all these matters, yet all the elders should have a clear and fresh view of them
The elders must get into all these things and know them thoroughly so that they can hold the mystery of the faith
The elders must know these items just as all people must know basic mathematics in order to carry out crucial tasks in their daily lives
When we begin to shepherd a brother, we may quickly discern that his need is basic knowledge of some item of the truth
The elders need to know the items of the mystery of the faith to the extent that they can teach them to others
Our teaching should not be doctrinal theology or simple Bible stories but the items of the mystery of the faith that we have covered
Sometimes the best way to teach a brother concerning a certain point is not in a meeting but by repeated personal contact over several weeks
They also need to pray for an understanding of why He came again as the life-giving Spirit and how and why the church was produced
Finally, they need to ask the Lord for a realization of why we are regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified
We need to pray about these things, learn them, and repeat them in the presence of the Lord until they are wrought into us
The Lord's recovery is absolutely different; it is something from deep in the heart of God and revealed in His Word
Our vision, which is the mystery of the faith, comprises Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
The truths that we have seen in the Lord's recovery, especially regarding the church, will be rejected and opposed by organized Christianity
For this we need to study the Bible concerning the mystery of the faith, and we need to receive help from the ministry books
In order to have an adequate vision of the Lord's recovery, we have to know the recovery in the Triune God and through the Bible
Many Christian workers have not seen life; they carry out their particular works without a realization of life
When they teach the Bible, they teach only doctrines and do not seek to minister life to others through their teaching
Although in the local churches we have seen something concerning life, there have been periods in our history when we deviated from life
Sometimes even the so-called release of the spirit has not been on the line of life-it was not the genuine release of the spirit
Brother Watchman Nee was a pattern of one who never deviated from life in spite of many seemingly positive attractions
They stayed because they felt that the local churches were the best place to hear good doctrines from the Bible
They came to the meetings and were genuine and moral Christians who cared for proper doctrines, but they lacked life
John 22324 says When He was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did
In chapter 3 the Lord opened Himself to this seeking one regarding regeneration, which is altogether a matter of life
Miracles are what God can do with His power but life is God Himself coming into us so that we may live experience enjoy and be one with Him
In past turmoils many saints in the local churches were deceived because their vision concerning life was inadequate
According to the human mentality, the Bible appears to be a book of many doctrines concerning matters such as God, man's fall, and salvation
Christ becomes living to us, and His death becomes real to us as an event that took place specifically for the forgiveness of our sins
The power of the Holy Spirit makes preached doctrines real to the listeners-it gives them the reality, the fact
Eventually, some of the Chinese who heard this doctrine realized and received the truth that Jesus was their Savior
Perhaps through our prayer and hunger for the truth, the Lord will enlighten us, giving us the shining of light
We first learn the doctrine by reading then we see the truth then the light shines then light becomes life and we receive the riches of life
The Lord's recovery is not an activity, movement, or ordinary Christian work but a matter of life and truth in light
Christians who are not genuinely seeking the Lord will not understand what we are doing and teaching in the Lord's recovery
We cannot avoid this, but there are always a few like Nicodemus, who are sincere, hungry, and seeking after the Lord's heart
When Matthew speaks of life it concerns the blessing of eternal life in the coming age but the life spoken of in John is present in Christ
Christ being life may sound simple, but John's twenty-one chapters reveal many aspects of this wonderful person
John 3 concerns regeneration, which is to receive the divine life by being born of God, but this is a mystery to most Christians
These verses clearly reveal that whoever receives the Lord and believes into His name becomes a child of God by being born of Him
The Gospel of John is not a record of stories and miracles but a description a detailed portrait of various aspects of Christ as life to us
Martin Luther was used by the Lord to recover the truth of justification by faith, but Luther did not see life
Kaspar Schwenckfeld, a contemporary of Luther, saw something of life, but Luther called him a fool possessed by the devil
In the same principle, an ordinary electrician today knows more about electricity than the great inventor Thomas Edison
We do not boast, but we thank and worship the Lord that He has shown us more than what the great teachers of the past have seen
Life-study of Romans points out that Romans has four stations-justification, sanctification, the Body, and the churches
We may compare the first station to elementary school and the next three stations to high school, college, and graduate school, respectively
Many in the local churches are still quite natural in their concepts concerning the spiritual things and their understanding of the Bible
John 22324 says When He was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did
Because we have received Him, we have been regenerated, are being transformed, and will be conformed to His image and glorified
The Christian life is not an exchanged life but a grafted, mingled, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified life
It is easy to understand an exchanged life-because our life is bad, and Jesus' life is wonderful, we trade our life for a better one
Apart from this process, there is no way for the church to be a golden lampstand, a shining testimony of God's nature
The churches are seen as golden lampstands in Revelation because in God's eyes, in His eternal view, the church is altogether divine
When we are manifested with Him in glory, we will be exactly the same as He is in life, nature, and expression
It is not any kind of work, movement, activity, teaching, or practice but a living of the life that is the Triune God
The churches in the Lord's recovery are the lampstands in Revelation, which are the testimony of Jesus and the embodiment of the Triune God
Perhaps no other Christian in history has been in prison for the Lord's sake for so long without changing his belief
If we have the vision of the Lord's recovery in life, no matter what happens, we will be kept in the Lord's recovery without any change
If a man possesses costly gold and realizes what he has, no one will be able to convince him to exchange it for something less valuable
We need to see the Lord's recovery in life-the Triune God in Christ realized as the indwelling Spirit to be our life
Verses 3 through 4 say I rejoiced greatly at the brothers coming and testifying to your steadfastness in the truth even as you walk in truth
The same word appears in John 4:24, which says, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
The sun, the air, the water, and food are types and shadows of Christ, who is the real sun, air, water, and food
All human virtues, such as love, holiness, kindness, patience, and humility, are shadows, the reality of which is Christ
Accordingly in John 8 the truth and the Son are used synonymously John 832 says You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free
The truth is conveyed in doctrines, yet the truth in the doctrines can be realized only by the enlightening of the Spirit
In order to know the Lord's recovery in truth, we need to know the Bible not only in the way of doctrine but also in the way of truth
An ignorant believer, even if he loves the Lord to the uttermost, cannot have the abundance of life, because he is lacking in truth
For this we need to deal with the Lord and be dealt with by Him and we need to have a clear conscience and a purified mind will and emotion
There will be no shadows veils or coverings to frustrate the Spirits enlightening which causes the doctrines we know to become truth to us
Because of the situation of Christianity today, there is the urgent need of truth as the shining of light, which will bring in life
If we are this kind of person, the doctrines in the Bible will become truth to us one by one, which will bring us light and life
Believers who read the Bible only when they feel inspired are spiritually starving; such ones cannot have the abundance of life
For this reason, the New Testament encourages us not mainly to know doctrines but to fully know and walk in the truth
It is possible to love others in darkness, but when we know the truth and walk in the truth, we love in the truth and in light
The main point we need to see is the way to turn doctrines to life, or put in other words, the way to have the abundance of life
John 7:38 says, 'He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water'
We cannot speak concerning Christ as love or patience if we have no knowledge of the truth concerning the riches of Christ
In order for the riches of Christ to flow out of us as rivers of living water, we must have and speak the truth
In order to minister life to others, we must speak, and in order to speak, we must read the Bible and study the truth to learn the doctrines
God's speaking is first conveyed to us in the form of doctrines, which become the truth to us through the Spirit's enlightening
An elder does not need to be a gifted teacher but should be apt to teach the saints as parents should be apt to teach their children at home
Not every elder needs to give messages, but every elder must learn to speak in order to teach in small groups and larger meetings
Because the truths are the riches of the Triune God as life to us, we will have the abundance of life and be part of the Lord's recovery
These two verses use the truth and the Son interchangeably, revealing that the truth is actually a person, Christ the Son
The first Comforter is the Son, and the second Comforter is the Spirit of reality, which is also mentioned in 15:26 and 16:13
In 8:12 the Lord said, 'I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life'
The Word life grace reality the Spirit of reality and lightalong with the Son and the Fatherare the basic factors in the Gospel of John
In other words, John is composed with the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-the Word, life, light, grace, and reality, or truth
As we have seen in previous chapters, when we have the truth, we have light, for truth is the shining of light
Grace is God Himself-the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the Spirit enjoyed by us-and God is the Word
We have seen that truth is the real content of doctrines, but we must also see that truth is nothing less than God Himself
We sometimes speak of certain truths, such as the truth of the church, the truth of the kingdom, or the truth of baptism
Ephesians 4:24 says, 'Put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality'
Some Christians argue a great deal about matters such as whether to use wine or grape juice at the Lord's table
Truth is God revealed and realized in His many aspects, such as the basic factors we have seen in the Gospel of John
Whether a teacher ministers truth to us or merely doctrine depends on whether his teaching ministers God to us
Although he may be an eloquent and knowledgeable scholar, if his speaking does not minister God, it is not truth but mere doctrine
The 'holiness' people, such as the Amish, teach that Christians should wear only certain colors and styles of clothing
They have some scriptural basis because 1 Timothy 29 says that women should adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety
Even in teaching the sisters to wear modest apparel, we must minister God in Christ as life, light, and grace for their enjoyment
As long as we baptize them in the power of the Spirit to transfer them into Christ, the way they enter the water does not matter
The Brethren were divided mainly by disagreements over so-called truths related to matters such as the timing of the rapture
We do not care for doctrinal arguments about matters such as the timing of the rapture, because they do not convey the reality of God
Doctrines that convey Christ as reality are like grain, but doctrines that do not minister Christ and only lead to division are like chaff
If we reject a particular teaching from the Bible, we are rejecting God in that aspect and cannot experience Him as such
God is life to us through His steps of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and indwelling
We may not have fully experienced what we minister, but whatever we minister should be the truth, which conveys God
According to this definition, some consider grace to be material blessings, such as wealth and success in business and family life
If grace were merely material blessings, when a believer is imprisoned for his faith, as Brother Watchmen Nee was, he would lose grace
The Bible is the revelation of God as reality, but when we first read it, it is not such a revelation but only doctrine to us
The word that Peter spoke in Matthew 16:16, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,' was a revelation to him
Question: Ephesians 4:25 says, 'Having put off the lie, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another'
According to the Lords word in John 146 in Ephesians truth indicates Christ along with all that He is such as God light life and grace
Accordingly, the purpose of the Lord's recovery is to bring us back to God so that we may experience and participate in Him
In previous chapters we saw that in order to know the Lord's recovery, we need to know God as life and the content of the Bible as the truth
The self and the old, natural being include the soul-life, the old man, the practices of the body, the flesh, the old 'I,' and the outer man
Matthew 162426 says Jesus said to His disciples If anyone wants to come after Me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it
He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life'
Verse 16 says, 'We do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day'
The speaking of the Lord Jesus and the writings of the apostle Paul show that in God's economy nothing of our old being should remain
Although there is no place for our old being in the Lord's recovery, in the sense of the new creation there is a place for us in the church
These verses indicate that the natural man cannot enter into the church, because we must be regenerated to enter into the church
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
The context in Romans 14 concerns the practical church life in the present age, and Romans 12 deals with the Body life
Since regeneration is the way to enter the kingdom of God, which is the church today, there is no place for the natural man in the church
Romans reveals that in order to enter into the practical Body life, which is the real practice of the church life, we need to be transformed
Regeneration is our entry into the church, and transformation is for our remaining and going on in the church life
In order to see the Lord's recovery in life and truth, we must know that there is no place for our self or natural man
When we realize that our natural being must be put aside, and we deny our self, we see much light in the Scriptures
Opinions are a matter of our mind; likes and dislikes, or preferences, are a matter of our emotion; and choices are a matter of our will
When the Lord told His disciples that He would be crucified, Peter rebuked Him, saying, 'God be merciful to You, Lord!
Contrary to the understanding of most Christians, taking up the cross does not primarily mean suffering; instead, it means killing
He was crucified from the very beginning of His ministry, when His baptism, which signifies death and burial, took place
The Lord indicated that Peter's preferences would be terminated, and He prophesied that Peter would be martyred
We need to see that in the Lord's recovery we must crucify, reject, and deny the self with its opinions, preferences, and choices
Christianity has lost the genuine church life through centuries of promoting the self with its opinions, preferences, and choices
In order to remain in the Lord's recovery, we need the light and the vision to see what the self is and that in the recovery it has no place
The Lord said, 'Whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
According to this concept if a man is naturally timid he does not need to change his behavior because he already has a pleasant natural man
Whether we are naturally slow or quick, bold or timid, pleasant or short-tempered, we need to be transformed and live Christ
The Lord's recovery is a matter of taking up the cross, denying the self, losing the soul-life, and living Christ
If a man who is naturally capable but not ethical is saved and comes into the church, he may become ethical but remain natural
The outer man is the old being, the natural man, and includes any natural ability, strength, eloquence, and talent
If the cross has dealt with our own natural ability, we will be able to discern whether others' functioning is natural or spiritual
The churches in the Lord's recovery, as parts of the living Body of Christ, will spontaneously reject anything that is natural
If a local church does not discern what is natural from what is spiritual we should not be bothered because such a church is simply immature
Regrettably, if a church is so immature that it cannot discern what is natural from what is spiritual, that church will suffer for a time
We must see that there is no place for the self, the soul-life, the old man, the practices of the body, or the old 'I' in the church life
Similarly, there is no place in the church life for our natural man with any of its strength, ability, or talent
If we truly see the Lord's recovery, we will realize that there is no place for whatever we are, have, or can do in our old being
Such a vision will control and direct the church life, governing us in shepherding, fellowshipping, and contacting the saints
Sometimes we may not participate in discussions with other serving ones because we cannot do so without being in the flesh
If this is our case, we are not being spiritual by not discussing, for we are still in the old creation; we are only hiding it
Remaining silent during a time of fellowship may be an indication of spirituality, but it is a weak indication
To use our ability not in a natural way but in resurrection is not easy; it is a stronger indication of spirituality
What this means experientially is that our new person still bears the appearance of our old person, but our new person is in resurrection
Before regeneration our slowness or quickness is natural, and after regeneration and transformation our slowness or quickness is spiritual
If we have truly seen the vision that in the church life the natural being must be terminated, we will lose any inclination for pretense
When we see the vision that there is no place in the church life for our natural life, we will not seek our own interest
If we have seen that there is no place in the church life for our natural being, we will not try to place blame on others in such situations
When we see that there is no place in the church life for the natural being, we will lose interest in selfish gain and honor
If we feel that someone is a suffering to us, this indicates that our natural man is still living and needs to be terminated on the cross
Answer: Brother Watchman Nee taught that the release of the spirit is an issue of the breaking of the outer man
We do not need to perform, for the vision will terminate us and cause us to lose any taste or interest for the old, natural things
In the New Testament the Lord raised up apostles from among His believers and then commissioned them with the ministry
Some apostles may also be elders in a church in the center of their region to strengthen the testimony in that church
Once we see the sphere and service of the ministry and the churches, we can address the relationship among the churches
All the churches are part of this one testimony, the testimony of Jesus, which is the Lord's recovery in life and truth
No local church should interfere with other local churches, just as families should not interfere with other families
All the saints should blend among the churches, but they should not compare, judge, or express opinions about the churches
The third and perhaps greatest mistake in recent years was the organizational transfer of saints and elders between localities
There was a subtle, hidden, evil intention behind these transfers, and they greatly damaged the local churches
Even if the parents in a family are poor, they cannot be fired or transferred away, nor can new parents be hired
In recent years the churches that did not participate in such transfers received much more blessing than those that did
We must beware of these three mistakes: so-called flows, interference among churches, and transfers between churches
We must respect God's economy and His ordination of the ground of locality for the churches regardless of the churches' conditions
We must leave the churches as they are and not try to organize them hierarchically in order to make them the same
When we have dealt with these mistakes and are in a normal condition, the local churches need to learn to receive the other churches
We should be willing to learn from other churches, just as families learn from other families to try to improve their own condition
The brothers who are now bearing the ministry need to pray to seek the Lord's leading concerning which region to care for
Answer: The leading brothers first need to make it clear to the saints that there are no conditions or terms for coming into the church life
All those who are saved are members of the church, and as long as they are not living in sin, they can meet with the church
To make an arrangement with other churches in order to guarantee financial assistance is somewhat organizational
Some came and told us that because the 'flow' of the churches was in English, we had to do everything in English
After those who insisted on English left, the Lord gave us the burden to begin using Spanish, and the church has been growing greatly
We may practice pray-reading and benefit from it, but if we visit a church that does not practice pray-reading, we should not talk about it
If we visit another locality and learn from them, we should not insist on anything new when we return to our locality
Of course, we cannot tolerate idolatry or immorality, but we do not need to condemn things that are not sinful in the eyes of the Lord
Among the churches there should not be an improper coordination that brings in hierarchical organization and human headship
For the churches to have fellowship is normal, but to coordinate in the way of organizing nearby churches is an improper activity
Fellowship among the churches and fellowship among the saints are the healthy flow of life, like the flow of the blood in our body
For such elders to coordinate may be a snare that causes the churches to fall into organization, which we must avoid
One locality is larger than the others, and the others join the larger locality for certain meetings to receive the ministry
We should make it clear to all the saints that such a meeting is not for organization but only for the ministry of the word
We should not be legal about the autonomy of the local churches, but we should try to avoid organization and human headship
The normal relationship among the churches is one of fellowship in which all the churches are autonomous and respect one another
