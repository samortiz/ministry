   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 1-12 give a record of John's preaching of repentance; verses 13-17, of Jesus' being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we come to Matthew 3, a problem arises because of different views concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In studying the Word of God, first we must reject our preconceived ideas; second, we must have the Lord's view.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, in Ephesians 4:14 Paul said that we should not be "carried about by every wind of teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not view the Word of God according to man's preconceived ideas, nor should we follow men by simply repeating what they say.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord promised that it will be revealed to infants Matt 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 1, the work of John the Baptist began.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Was the beginning of his work the beginning of the dispensation of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When did the dispensation of the gospel begin?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to know the beginning of the dispensation of the gospel, we first need to know who ended the dispensation of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the dispensation of the gospel began with the work of John, then what he preached does concern us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Otherwise, it has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people say that the dispensation of the law ended at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If so, the dispensation of the gospel is after the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 10:4 says, "Christ is the end of the law."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse cannot be quoted as a basis to say that the dispensation of the law ended at the cross, because it refers to the requirement, not the dispensation, of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John's work is the beginning of the dispensation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is based on:</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1 Matthew 11:13 and Luke 16:16: According to these two verses, we can see that the law and the prophets ended at the appearing of John, that is, at the beginning of his work, not at his death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John belonged to the dispensation of the law, but what he preached was grace and not doctrines of the dispensation of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2 Acts 10:36-37: The announcing of the Lord's gospel of peace began "after the baptism which John proclaimed."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3 Acts 13:23-27: The repentance proclaimed by John v. 24 is "the word of this salvation" v. 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>4 Mark 1:1: "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By reading through verse 10 we know that the " beginning" began with the preaching of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>5 Luke 4:17-21: Verses 18-19 show that the gospel is referred to.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Today" in verse 21 indicates that the dispensation of the gospel had begun.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord spoke this word, the dispensation of the gospel had already begun.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>6 John 4:23: "An hour is coming, and it is now."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that the dispensation of the gospel had begun when the Lord spoke this word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>7 John 5:25: "An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear...."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What the dead hear are things of the dispensation of the gospel, which the Lord said "is now."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Mr. Pember, the Greek word rendered hour in John 4:23 and 5:25 is used for age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"An age is coming" indicates that after the dispensation of the law, another dispensation is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The views of different schools concerning the beginning of the dispensation of the gospel are as follows: 1 The gospel began with John's work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>2 The gospel began at the time of the Lord's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>3 The gospel began with the descending of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>4 The gospel began with Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Acts 3:21 the Lord waited for Israel to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 7:56 the Lord stood up, but Israel rejected Him, so the preaching of the gospel was turned to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the argument of those who take this view.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>5 The gospel completely went to the Gentiles after Acts 28.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>6 The gospel began from the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The argument of this school is that it was at this time that the mystery was made known to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, baptism and bread breaking are not necessary because they belong to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who take this view think that everything is predestinated and is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They care only for three books: Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What kind of work was John's work?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John was there doing the work of preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although the dispensation of the gospel had already begun, John was doing the work of preparation Matt 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He proclaimed, "Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" v. 2 . What does the kingdom of the heavens refer to? Does it refer to the kingdom of the Messiah, prophesied by Daniel and Ezekiel, which the Jews are expecting? Scofield defined the kingdom of the heavens as the Messiah's rule over the earth and the time of the restoration of David's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is this scriptural?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Did John and the Lord say at the beginning that Christ comes to establish the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Scofield also said that when the Lord came to the earth, had He not been rejected by the children of Israel, He would have established the kingdom on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" this was preached by John, by the Lord Jesus, and by the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Matthew chapters five through seven are concerned with the law of the kingdom of the heavens; chapters eight and nine are on the Lord's healing; chapters eleven and twelve cover the Lord's being rejected; and chapter thirteen is concerned with the mysteries of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some say that because of Israel's rejection, the Messianic kingdom has been moved to the millennium and has therefore become a kingdom of mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Between chapters twelve and thirteen there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if the Lord came to establish the kingdom of Messiah, why would the Jews reject Him?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Does not John 6:15 record that they intended to come and take Him by force to make Him King?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If at that time the Lord came to establish the kingdom of Messiah, then the Lord would have come to rule and not to suffer death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of Messiah, then the cross would have been merely an expedient way to take care of certain unexpected changes, for it seems that the Lord had to put aside the kingdom and set up the way of salvation through the cross because of the Jews' unwillingness to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, the death of Christ was foreordained by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Peter said that Christ first suffered and then received the glory 1 Pet 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord Himself also said the same thing Luke 24:26 .</S>
