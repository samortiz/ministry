<h2 class=head2>The Completed Son</h2><p>We have seen that before Christ’s resurrection the Spirit was not completed. Now we need to see that the Son also was not completed before resurrection. Do you think that the Son was completed before incarnation? The Son could not have been completed before incarnation because it was necessary for the completed Son to have not only divinity but also humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Therefore, in order to be completed, the Son had to pass through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.<p>As a result of going through this process, the only begotten Son (John 3:16) became the firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29). Before incarnation, there was not the element of humanity in the only begotten Son. Of course, neither were the elements of human living, crucifixion, and resurrection in the only begotten Son before His incarnation. Instead, there was only the element of divinity in Him. But now that the only begotten Son has become the firstborn Son of God, the firstborn Son includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. This is the completed Son.<p>Because it was necessary for both the Son and the Spirit to be completed, before His resurrection the Lord Jesus did not speak a clear word to His disciples concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. But after His resurrection, He could tell His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. After the Lord’s resurrection the Father is complete and both the Son and the Spirit have been completed.<p>In chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John, the Son still had not been completed. At that time He was in the flesh; He had not yet been crucified and entered into resurrection. Furthermore, the Spirit had not yet been completed. But in Matthew 28:19, after Christ’s resurrection, the Son and the Spirit are not only complete but also completed.<p>Although the Son and the Spirit have been completed, the Father did not need any completion. The Father remains the same because He is the source, and the source does not need completion. The Son, however, needed completion. In the first stage He was God’s only begotten Son. In the last stage He has become the firstborn Son of God. For the only begotten Son to become the firstborn Son there was the need of completion, the need of a process. This process includes incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. After passing through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, He entered into resurrection. Now in resurrection He is not merely the only begotten Son; He is the Firstborn among many sons. As we have pointed out, this firstborn Son of God includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now He is not only complete—He is completed. Hallelujah for the complete and completed Son of God!<h2 class=head2>The Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>Through the process by which He was completed, the only begotten Son not only became the firstborn Son of God, but also became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). To God, He became the Firstborn; to us, He became the life-giving Spirit. This firstborn Son of God, who is the life-giving Spirit, is now our way to the Father. He is the “jumbo jet” that brings us to the Father. When we contact the life-giving Spirit, we are in the Son as the way, and immediately we are in the Father. The life-giving Spirit is the firstborn Son of God, and the Son is one with the Father. Therefore, when we contact the life-giving Spirit, we are in the Son, and by being in the Son we are in the Father.
