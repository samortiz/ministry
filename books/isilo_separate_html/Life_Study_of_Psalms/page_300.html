The Word of God, Signifying Christ<br>as the Living Word of God Breathed Out by Him</H2><P>Christ is the reality of the law not only as the testimony of God but also as the word of God, signifying Christ as the living word of God breathed out by Him (Rev. 19:13b; 2 Tim. 3:16-17). John 1:1 says that in the beginning was the Word (Christ), that the Word was with God, and that the Word was God. According to Revelation 19:13b, when Christ comes back to judge, His name will be called "the Word of God." The Ten Commandments, with all their statutes, ordinances, and judgments, are also called the word of God. A literal rendering of the Hebrew translated "ten commandments" in Exodus 34:28 would be "ten words." The Ten Commandments are thus God's words, breathed out by Him.</P><P>The word "law" is used twenty-five times in Psalm 119 (vv. 1, 18, etc.). A number of different synonyms for "law" are also used in this psalm, including "testimony" (once, in v. 88), "testimonies" (twenty-two times, in vv. 2, 14, etc.), "word" (thirty-six times, in vv. 9, 11, etc.), "words" (six times, in vv. 57, 103, etc.), "commandment" (once, in v. 96), "commandments" (twenty-one times, in vv. 6, 10, etc.), "statutes" (twenty-two times, in vv. 5, 8, etc.), "ordinances" (seventeen times, in vv. 7, 13, etc.), "judgments" (three times, in vv. 75, 120, 137), and "precepts" (twenty-one times, in vv. 4, 15, etc.). All these terms from "law" to "precepts" consummate in the "way" (four times, in vv. 14, 27, 32, 33) or "ways" (three times, in vv. 3, 15, 37), signifying Christ as the way of God to His people.</P><P>Psalm 119 is a psalm of one hundred seventy-six verses describing Christ, who is the reality of the law, the commandments, the ordinances, the statutes, the precepts, and the judgments. In total, He is the Word of God. The words of Psalm 119 are the written words of God, but Christ is the living Word of God. The written words are the letters, but the living Word is the Spirit, who is the reality of the letters.</P><P>Now we can see not only what the law is but also who the law is. Who is the law? The law is the person of Christ, and the person of Christ is the Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of whatever God is. Hence, as the Spirit Christ is the reality of the law. Eventually, this law, this person, consummates in the way (John 14:6). When we have Him, we have not only love and light but also the way. This is Christ being the reality of the law as the testimony and the word of God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_299.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_301.html">Next</a> </body></html>
