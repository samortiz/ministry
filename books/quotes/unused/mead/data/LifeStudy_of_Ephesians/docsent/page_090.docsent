   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>G. As Animals</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is typified not only by trees and plants, but also by animals.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The lamb, the cow, the eagle, the lion, and the dove are all types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>H. As Minerals</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible, a number of minerals also show forth the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Gold, silver, brass, and precious stones, for example, typify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. As Persons</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have pointed out that a number of persons in the Bible typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All these depict different aspects of Christ s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We see certain riches of Christ in Adam, others in Abel, and others in Joseph.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>J. As All the Positive Things in the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the positive things in the universe point to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, Christ is the real gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without Him, we would drift away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Christ did not hold us in place, we would not be able to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the One with the true holding power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Hebrews 1:3, He upholds the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because all the positive things in the universe signify Christ, Christ could use so many things as illustrations of Himself when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For instance, He could use the door as a picture of Himself and say, I am the door.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the reality of every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is not only the gravity, but also the air, the light, and every positive thing.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The riches of Christ also include both human virtues and divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is the real love, patience, and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Apart from Christ, we cannot love, be patient, or forgive, not even in relation to our wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when we have Christ, we have all the human virtues and divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>of Christ into the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the riches of Christ are for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This takes place through the divine dispensation of Christ into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is produced not by teaching, nor by organizing, but by the dispensation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more Christ is dispensed into us, the more life we have, the stronger life we have, the richer life we have, and the more uplifted the church life becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I love the ministry that dispenses the riches of Christ into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By means of such a ministry, we have a proper, strong, uplifted church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>B. By the Believers Experience</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>and Enjoyment of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The riches of Christ produce the church through the believers experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On Christ s side, it is a matter of dispensation, but on our side, it is a matter of experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we experience and enjoy the very Christ who is dispensed into us, we become part of the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>TO EXPRESS GOD S MULTIFARIOUS WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The riches of Christ also express God s multifarious wisdom 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God s wisdom is manifold; it has many aspects in many directions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This wisdom is expressed before the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies, mainly before the evil powers of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God desires to demonstrate to the powers of Satan how wise He is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, the riches of Christ display His wisdom in a multifarious way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is according to God s eternal purpose 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>RESULTING IN THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The experience of the riches of Christ results in the fullness of Christ, the Body as Christ s expression 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The book of Ephesians speaks both of the riches of Christ and of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A tall, husky man is the fullness of America because he has enjoyed the riches of American foodstuffs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Throughout the years of his growth and development, he has consumed a great deal of meat, poultry, vegetables, and fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, as a full-grown man, he becomes the fullness of America.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The riches of American foodstuffs did not make him this fullness until he ate them, digested them, and assimilated them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By absorbing the riches in this way, the riches became part of him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Likewise all the aspects of the riches of Christ do not become the fullness of Christ until they are eaten, enjoyed, digested, and assimilated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By absorbing these riches in such a way, we become the Body of Christ as His fullness to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thus, the Body of Christ is constituted of the riches of Christ that have been enjoyed and assimilated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, the Body is the result, the issue, of the experience and enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
