   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISPENSING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 15:45b shows us the life-giving Spirit for the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The consummated Triune God is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Life-giving means life-imparting, and life-imparting means dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The consummated Spirit of the Triune God is dispensing the divine life into us all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit gives life 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead gives life to our mortal bodies Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The life-giving Spirit first gives life to our spirit v. 10 . Then from our spirit He spreads the divine life into our soul to transform us v. 6 . Eventually, He gives life to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not need to wait for this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even today when we are sick, we can exercise our faith to say, "Lord, send Your Spirit from my spirit into my body to enliven it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My body is now weak and sick.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It may even be dying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But Lord, I ask You to dispense Your life through the life-giving Spirit into my mortal and dying body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I need Your divine life."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to exercise our faith to live not by ourselves but by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We live by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have a dying life, but He is not dying.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead gives life to our dying body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The bountiful supply of the Spirit is for us to live and magnify Christ Phil 1:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has prepared such a bountiful supply for dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, the Spirit is the flow of the life supply as the river of water of life that we might drink Him Rev 22:1; 1 Cor 12:13; 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eating and drinking are for dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1965 we had a conference with a training on eating and drinking Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This truth is seen throughout the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Genesis 2 is the eating of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Exodus is the eating of the lamb in Egypt and the eating of manna and drinking of the water that flowed out of the cleft rock in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the people of Israel entered into the good land, they ate the produce of that land.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The offerings in Leviticus are for God's eating and our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is all the eating of Jesus in typology.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then in the New Testament, Jesus Himself tells us that He is the heavenly bread and that we need to eat Him John 6:51, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Matthew 15 there is a story of the Lord's encounter with a Canaanite woman.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When she asked the Lord to help her, He replied, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs" v. 26 . Then she said, "Yes, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table" v. 27 . The Canaanite woman, not offended by the Lord's word, but rather admitting that she was a heathen dog, considered that at that time Christ, after being rejected by the children, the Jews, became crumbs under the table as a portion to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, came as a portion to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But they threw Him off the table to the ground, the Gentile country, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows us again that God is for our eating so that He can dispense Himself into us and mingle Himself with us that He and we may become one.</S>
