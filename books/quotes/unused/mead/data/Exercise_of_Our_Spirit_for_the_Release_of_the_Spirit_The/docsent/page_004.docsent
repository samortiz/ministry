   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Should we use our mind to think before we begin to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Answer: Many times when we go to the Lord, we are thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, there is no need to think before we go to the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we go to the Lord, we must forget about everything and simply go to Him to contact and deal with Him in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must learn to know nothing except that we are contacting the Lord in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then when we come to the meetings, we must be active, positive, and living, and our spirit must be released.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When our spirit is released, the Holy Spirit within us will automatically be released, and there will be a current flowing in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This will be a great help to all those in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what a Christian meeting must be like.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Question: How is the filling of the Holy Spirit that you are speaking of different from what people experience in the Pentecostal movement?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Answer: This matter is absolutely different from the experience in the Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>People in the Pentecostal movement do not actually care about the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, they are concerned with manufacturing and creating a certain kind of atmosphere in their meetings, which is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, we should not justify the Pentecostal way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, neither should we justify the so-called fundamental meetings, which are utterly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not be like those who criticize the Pentecostal movement yet do not say anything to condemn the condition of the fundamental meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Pentecostal meetings are too much to one extreme, and the fundamental meetings are too much to the other extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many fundamental meetings are dead; there is hardly anything in them but death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not follow that way of meeting, nor should we pick up the Pentecostal way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In God s eyes, death is much more defiling than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are many types in the Old Testament that prove this Lev 11:39; 17:15; Num 19:11, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever someone in the Old Testament touched something that was dead, he had to be kept away from the sanctuary of the Lord for a certain number of days.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, although death is more defiling than sin, we are more sensitive to sin than to death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we commit a sin, we immediately sense that we are wrong, but when we bring death into the meetings, we do not have the same sense.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must realize that God hates death and that death is the last enemy that the Lord must conquer 1 Cor 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not agree with the Pentecostal way of maneuvering, manufacturing, and creating an atmosphere in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, we must condemn even more the deadness of the fundamental way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not want to go along with either of these ways.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, we want to go along with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Holy Spirit is living, moving, and acting all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, when we come to the meeting, we must exercise our spirit to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those in the Pentecostal movement do not take care of others feelings when they meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They simply act according to what they like and do not consider what others may think.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This spoils the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we meet together, we must forget about everything and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, when we exercise our spirit and take care of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit will automatically guide us to be considerate of others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean that we must be silent in the meetings; rather, we must be even more exercised in being considerate of others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to be flexible in order to have a proper Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the fundamental way of meeting, when we come to the meeting, we must wait for a certain time until we can begin the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is too formal and traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I believe that when the Christians met in the early days of the apostles, they also designated a certain time to meet together, but their meetings were not so formal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I believe that they met in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not need to wait until the exact time to begin the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should simply come and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we arrive early, we should not sit and wait for the meeting to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we should exercise our spirit, and then the meeting will start in a spontaneous way, not a formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a meeting is scheduled for eight o clock, we should arrive fifteen minutes early so that we can exercise our spirit and help others to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the meeting will be living and not so formal and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Question: Should we exercise our spirit by praying audibly, or should we exercise our spirit inwardly?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Answer: In the meetings it is better to pray audibly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, this is not something legal.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may feel that you should pray quietly or silently, or you may feel that you should pray audibly so that others can hear.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There should be nothing legal about the way we exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For many years I have considered and studied the way in which Christians should meet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Several years ago I came to the conclusion that the so-called fundamental way of meeting is absolutely traditional and that the Pentecostal way is absolutely extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thirty years ago I spent much time with those in the Pentecostal movement in order to study their way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I discovered that they were too extreme and that this hurts and damages the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This way of meeting does not build up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the early days of the apostles the Christians did not meet together in the Pentecostal way or the fundamental way but in a flexible way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There were no forms or regulations, yet the meetings were very proper, orderly, living, and free.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There was no program, formality, or bondage, and nothing was enforced, such as performing emotional activities.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, the believers came together and exercised their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The meetings were very living; everyone had the freedom and liberty to release his or her spirit by singing a hymn, praying, reading a verse, or giving a short testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I believe that this is the way the early Christians met and that this is the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we would practice to meet in this way, our meetings would be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The next time we go to a meeting, we should go with the sole purpose of exercising our spirit to worship and exhibit the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should forget about what time the meeting is supposed to begin and simply exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we have the sense to pray silently, we should pray silently.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If others have the sense to pray audibly, even loudly, we should exercise not to be bothered by that.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the proper way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should even be familiar with many of the hymns so that there would be no need for someone to formally announce a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If everyone knows a chorus, someone can lead everyone to sing it at the proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This breaks down the barriers and paves the way for the Holy Spirit to go on and have a free way to move.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In such a situation everyone is very orderly and well-behaved and yet very living.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must have a fire burning in our meetings so that when people come, they will be burned and will burn others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should not have a meeting in which people come together, sit, and look at or listen to something.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is not the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must have a meeting in which the Holy Spirit is released and in which we can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This kind of meeting will refresh, renew, release, and satisfy both others and ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is what the Lord needs, and this is what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When I go to the meetings today, I do not focus on teachings because what I need is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When you invite me to a meal, what I care about is not the menu that you give me but the food and drink that you serve.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What we should care about is giving others something to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Whenever we come together to meet, our meeting should be living, a meeting in which the Holy Spirit moves and is released.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This kind of meeting will bring others to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The unbelievers will be saved, the believers will be edified, nourished, strengthened, delivered, and enlightened, and the Spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Spirit is so rich; He will meet every need, even if there is no formal teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must believe more in what the Holy Spirit can do than in what doctrinal teachings can do.</S>
