<h2 class="head1">COMING BOLDLY TO GOD</h2><p>Whether or not a person can be a proper Christian depends on whether he understands God's righteousness. Many people cannot live a proper Christian life because they think that their forgiveness is the result of God's mercy. They think that God forgives them because He sees that they are hopeless. They do not realize that God's righteousness brought about their forgiveness. Consequently, sometimes they feel that God has forgiven them, and at other times, they feel that God has not forgiven them. But we have to remember that God has given us His Son, who has borne the punishment of sin for us. Therefore, the Bible says that we can come boldly to God (Heb. 10:19). We thank and praise God that He has given us His Son. Before God gave us Jesus of Nazareth, He was free to forgive us or not forgive us. But now that He has given us Jesus of Nazareth, God cannot refuse us when we come to Him through Jesus Christ; He has to forgive us. God has to forgive those who come to Him through Christ Jesus. Hallelujah! God cannot refuse to forgive those who come to Him through Christ Jesus. Since He has given us Christ Jesus, when we come to Him through Christ, God has to forgive us whether or not He likes it. Hallelujah! We can come to God today not just because of His love, but also because of His righteousness.</p><p>We must realize the importance of righteousness. Righteousness gives us the boldness before God. We are not trusting in God's pleasure for forgiveness. We are not depending on our feeling for forgiveness. We are trusting in God's unchanging righteousness. God has given Christ Jesus to us. Now when we come to God through Christ Jesus, He must forgive us. Before Jesus of Nazareth died, it was possible for men to think, "God can forgive if He wants to, and God does not have to forgive if He does not want to." But Jesus of Nazareth has died for us. God cannot refuse to forgive those who come to Him through Christ Jesus. God has to forgive them. When we come to God according to righteousness, God has to forgive us.</p><p>Let me give you another story. There was a Sunday school teacher who once asked two young sisters how they were saved. The older one stood up and answered, "Thank God, I am saved by God's grace." Following this, the younger one stood up and said, "Thank God, I am saved by God's righteousness." The older one jabbed the arm of the younger one and said, "No, you should say that we are saved by God's grace." The younger one knew the Bible very well and quoted 1 John 1:9: "He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." God's Word tells us that our sins are forgiven and our unrighteousness is cleansed according to God's righteousness. The younger sister was very bold in her testimony.</p><p>We have to say that no one who knows the Lord comes to God in trembling. Did Noah tremble inside the ark? Did he have to worry that the ark would sink under the water? Did the firstborn in Israel need to tremble inside the blood-covered houses? Did they have to worry that the angels would kill them by mistake? We have to remember that God never forgives us in a loose way; He forgives us in a very righteous way. This forgiveness matches His nature; it is an absolutely righteous forgiveness. This forgiveness, when presented to men, shuts up men's mouths and, when presented before the devil, shuts up the devil's mouth. When this forgiveness is presented before God, even He has nothing more to say. Therefore, we can rejoice before the Lord; we can have the assurance and do not need to be afraid. Everyone who comes to God through the cross is free from condemnation and judgment. Both a young believer as well as those who have believed for a long time can offer their praise spontaneously when they think of salvation and righteousness. We have to praise Him because He has saved us righteously!</p><p>Thank the Lord that we are saved by God's righteousness. We are forgiven according to His righteousness. When we come to God through the Lord Jesus, we are not afraid. We have to remember that God's righteousness has saved us. God's righteousness makes it impossible for God to refuse us. We have to say, "God, I thank and praise You. Because of the Lord Jesus, You have to accept me. Had You not given the Lord Jesus to me, I could only beg outside the door, but now that You have given the Lord Jesus to me, no one can stop me from entering in."</p><p>God has given us the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah! The Lord Jesus Christ is ours already! Therefore, the Bible says that we have to enter the Holy of Holies boldly. Any kind of doubt is wrong. All those who have received the Lord Jesus Christ can say to God, "God, I thank and praise You because You are righteous. Your righteousness has secured my forgiveness." Whether or not we can live a proper Christian life depends on our understanding of righteousness. We have to be thoroughly clear that God's forgiveness is not based on grace, but on righteousness. We have to thank and praise God.</p><p class="hbody">When I was in sin and filled with pain,<br />Righteousness demanded that I be judged.<br />But when the Lord shed His blood for my redemption,<br />Righteousness demanded that I have peace.</p><p class="hbody">God, Your righteousness has brought my Savior<br />To the cross to suffer judgment,<br />So that righteousness can give the sinners<br />Forgiveness, justification, and peace.</p><p class="hbody">Righteousness requires that debts be paid,<br />And after the debts are paid,<br />Righteousness requires that the cleared debt<br />Not be once more repaid or recompensed.</p><p class="hbody">Since my Savior has shed His blood,<br />You can no longer crucify Him.<br />Nor can You demand that I take up my case;<br />You can only forgive and cleanse me.</p><p class="hbody">When I heard that You are righteous,<br />I could only fear and flee.<br />But when Your righteousness is mentioned now,<br />It feels precious and pleasant to me.</p><p class="hbody">Since I have come to know Your righteousness,<br />I understand more of Your grace;<br />The former gives me peace unspeakable,<br />The latter fills me with comfort.</p>
