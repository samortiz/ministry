<h2 class="head3">Paul and Barnabas Spoke</h2><p>After Peter finished, all the attendants were silent. At that juncture Paul and Barnabas related &ldquo;all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them&rdquo; (15:12).</p><h2 class="head3">Finally James Made the Decision</h2><p>Finally James stood up and spoke. &ldquo;And when they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me&rdquo; (v. 13). In verse 19, James gave the conference a final verdict. In this conference, the first group&rsquo;s speaking was a kind of preparation. These were the Jewish brothers. Then Peter spoke, followed by Paul and Barnabas. Lastly, James made the final decision.</p><h2 class="head2">The Application of Acts 15</h2><p>We can apply this pattern to ourselves. A decision is not made according to the opinion of the majority. Instead, when the church comes together, all the brothers and sisters can speak and debate. At the end, the elders make a decision. Before the final decision is made, all the brothers can speak. Peter could speak. Paul and Barnabas could also speak. When James spoke, a final decision was reached.</p><h2 class="head2">The Question Facing Us Today: Who Is James?</h2><p>Our question today is: Who is James? In other words, who today has the qualification to stand in the leading position to make the final decision? First, we must consider how James became the leader. We will then know how spiritual leaders are produced in general.</p><p>In the Bible, six Jameses are mentioned. The James in the conference in Acts 15 was the brother in the flesh of the Lord Jesus. He spoke a few times in the New Testament. The New Testament mentions his name ten times. At the beginning of the church life, the leading one was Peter. He took the lead to preach the gospel. Later, Peter and John went down to Samaria (8:14). Peter also went to the house of Cornelius. After the house of Cornelius, seemingly Peter gradually lost his leading position in the church. In Acts 12 the church experienced great persecution. One of the twelve apostles, another James, was killed. Peter was imprisoned. It was at that juncture that James rose up, and Peter lost his leading position. Here we see that spiritual leadership is not a matter of experience. It is not like political elections in the world where a president may be elected for a term of six years. Rather, it is a matter of learning. Whoever learns more before the Lord and advances more takes the lead.</p><p>In 1 Corinthians 15:5-7 Paul spoke of many persons. But he only mentioned the names of James and Peter. For the others, he only said &ldquo;five hundred brothers,&rdquo; &ldquo;the twelve,&rdquo; and &ldquo;all the apostles.&rdquo; Even the name of John was not mentioned. This means there must have been something special about James. This is the only reason Paul could have mentioned him. This is not all. In Galatians 1:18-19, Paul only mentioned the names of two apostles: Peter and James the brother of the Lord. In 2:9 Paul said again that James, Peter, and John were three pillars in the church in Jerusalem. He placed James before Peter. In 2:12 Paul said, &ldquo;Some came from James&rdquo; to Antioch. He did not say some came from Jerusalem or from Peter. In Acts 12:17 Peter also told the others to inform James of what had happened. At this time there were a few dozen co-workers in Jerusalem and tens of thousands of brothers and sisters. But Peter emphatically said to inform James.</p><p>From the above verses we can see that at the beginning of the church life in Jerusalem, Peter was the first leader. But after Peter was imprisoned, James rose up, even to the point of replacing Peter. This shows us the reason James was the last one to speak in Acts 15. The one who made the final decision in this conference was James, because at that time he was the spiritual leader.</p><h2 class="head2">The Decision of the Spiritual Leader<br />Being the Decision of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>In verse 19 James made the decision: &ldquo;Therefore I judge that...&rdquo; Then in verse 28 he said, &ldquo;For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us.&rdquo; This opinion was actually James&rsquo;s decision. In the end it became the decision of the Holy Spirit in conjunction with the entire church. Therefore, we see that the decision of the spiritual leader is the decision of the Holy Spirit.</p>
