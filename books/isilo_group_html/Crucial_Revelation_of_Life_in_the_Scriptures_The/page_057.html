The promises in 2 Peter 1:4 are mainly related to our spiritual life. These are promises for the inner life and the outward expression of life. One such promise is in Ephesians 3:20, which says, &#8220;But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us.&#8221; This promise to do above all that we ask or think is not concerning the material things of the present life, but concerning the spiritual things for the church life. The Lord is going to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think for the church life, according to the inner working power that operates in us. Other precious and exceedingly great promises are in Matthew 28:20; John 6:57; 7:38-39; 10:28-29; 14:19-20, 23; 15:5; and 16:13-15.<h2 class=head1>FIVE GROUPS OF THINGS FOR THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h2><p>After the basic categories of faith, the divine power, and the precious promises, there are also five groups of things for the experience of life in 2 Peter. First, we have all things that relate to life and godliness. Life is within, while godliness is without. Life is the inward substance, and godliness is the outward expression. Godliness, according to its New Testament usage, refers to our Christian living, our Christian daily walk. It is the outward expression of the inward life. It is a living that is the expression of God (1 Tim. 2:2). Godliness is God-likeness. The Christian life should be a life which expresses God and bears God&#8217;s likeness in all things. The divine power has given to us all things relating to our inward life and our outward living.<p>Second, through the promises we become the partakers, or enjoyers, of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Third, there are the spiritual virtues (vv. 5-7), which are the issue of the development of the divine life. These divine virtues are virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, brotherly love, and love. Fourth, God has called us not merely by His gospel, His grace, or His mercy, but He has called us to His own glory and virtue (v. 3). Fifth, there is the entrance into the eternal kingdom of Jesus Christ. Second Peter 1:11 says, &#8220;For so shall be richly and bountifully supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&#8221; The entrance is conditional; it will be supplied based upon certain terms and conditions.<h2 class=head1>ADDING ALL DILIGENCE</h2><p>In 2 Peter 1:5, Peter says, &#8220;And for this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith....&#8221; The word &#8220;supply&#8221; in this verse can also mean &#8220;develop.&#8221; Develop is a better word because it implies growth. When a seed grows, it first develops the stem, then the branches, the blossom, and ultimately the fruit. We must develop seven items: in faith develop virtue, in virtue develop knowledge, in knowledge develop self-control, in self-control develop endurance, in endurance develop godliness, in godliness develop brotherly love, and in brotherly love develop love.<p>We have faith within us as the seed, we have the divine power, and we have the holy Word with its promises. Now based upon what God has given, Peter says that we must add all diligence. The manna in the wilderness is a good illustration of our need to cooperate with God&#8217;s giving (Exo. 16:4-5, 14-15, 21). Manna came each morning and had to be gathered early because it melted when the sun became hot. The manna was sent by God, but the children of Israel had to exercise themselves diligently to rise up early to go out and gather the manna. God could send the manna to the earth, but He would not put the manna directly into the mouths of the children of Israel. The children of Israel had to do their part. God is gracious, yet regardless of how gracious He is and how sufficient His grace is, we still need to exercise ourselves. The children of Israel not only had to gather the manna, but they also had to take it home and cook it (Num. 11:8; Exo. 16:23). God sent the manna, but He would not cook it for them.<p>God has given, but we must cooperate with His giving. Second Corinthians 9:10 says, &#8220;Now He who bountifully supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and cause the fruits of righteousness to grow.&#8221; God gives the seed and the fruit, and in between the seed and the fruit is much development. The development between the seed and the fruit is our responsibility. God gives the seed, but He would not sow the seed or till the ground. To sow the seed and till the ground is our part. Thus, Peter charges us to develop something out of the seed that we already have. On His part God has given us many exceedingly great things. Now we must do our part by adding all diligence. In Genesis 2:5 God did not send the rain because there was not a man to till the ground. God&#8217;s part needs our part. God has done His part, and now we must do our part to cooperate with Him.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Crucial Revelation of Life in the Scriptures &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
