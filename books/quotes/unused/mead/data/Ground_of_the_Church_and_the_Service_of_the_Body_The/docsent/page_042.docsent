   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR MOVE NEEDING TO HAVE A DIRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND BE MULTIDIRECTIONAL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are two basic principles for our move: one is that our move must have a direction, and the other is that our move must be multidirectional.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The four living creatures go straightforward in four directions without turning Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are not without a definite direction; rather, they go straight ahead, yet they are able to move in every direction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that when we move, we must have a goal, a direction, without preference and without turning according to our will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we should not move in more than one direction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot say, I only care about one matter; I do not care about any other matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, we cannot say, I am taking care of visitation, so I cannot give a message or preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If this is the case, we are not like the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are one-directional ; that is, if we can go east, we cannot go west.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every serving one should learn to have an aim, a direction, and to be multidirectional.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even though our particular direction may be to preach the gospel, we may discover that when we are speaking in a meeting the attendants need edification, not the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When this occurs, we should change the meeting to take care of the matter of edification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what it means to have an aim but to also be multidirectional.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It may be that we are responsible for giving messages, but we should also be able to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps we work with young people and students; nevertheless, we should also be able to speak with older saints and render help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our focus may be to work with young people, but we should also be able to work in other areas.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must be able to cover multiple directions and be flexible in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should be able to give a message as well as visit someone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should be able to preach the gospel as well as edify others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are persons who pay attention to the inner life, we should also be able to encourage others to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is what it means to be multidirectional instead of one-directional.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to their disposition, some brothers do not like to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If such brothers desire to serve the Lord, they need to allow themselves to be broken in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Other brothers like to talk when they meet people; however, this too is natural and fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should follow the sense of the spirit to either keep quiet or speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Often, however, we are quiet because we are afraid that we will not supply others or we feel that we cannot speak well, not because in our spirit we feel to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, in order to train ourselves to be able to supply others, we cannot have an indifferent attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should let the responsibility that we bear press us, just as Paul was pressed: Who is stumbled, and I myself do not burn?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2 Cor 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many brothers and sisters are coming to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not supply them, who will?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must do our best to make up the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God will open up our stuttering mouth and give us the gift of speaking, and the Spirit will grant us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not turn on the faucet, the water company cannot supply us with water.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Similarly, we are often unable to supply others, because we are accustomed to not opening our mouth, we adhere to our routines, and we are set in our ways.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wherever the Spirit goes, the wheels follow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not make a rule that we will not open our mouth in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we should have a direction for our service and should not turn at will, we must also be multidirectional.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The requirement of being multidirectional is a difficult lesson for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, to adhere to a routine is to be presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After our presumptuousness has been broken, we will receive a great deal of perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there is a need to give a gospel message, even if we have never learned to give a gospel message, we have no choice but to give a gospel message.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we pick up certain matters, we will learn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same way, if we always give gospel messages, yet there is a need for edification, will we be willing to meet the need?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are not willing, who will do it?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Surely this is our responsibility, and we must learn to pick it up.</S>
