   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Declaring to My Parents</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My Desire to Live by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have pointed out in a previous testimony that after I was saved I continued to study in school and at the same time work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One evening I spoke with my father concerning the matter of receiving financial assistance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I said, "After praying for several days, I feel that I must tell you that I will no longer spend your money.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I appreciate that you have spent so much on me in accord with your sense of fatherly responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But you will expect me to earn money in the future and support you in return, and I must tell you beforehand that since I am going to be a preacher, I will not be able to repay you in the future nor pay you interest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though I have not completed my studies, I wish to learn to depend solely upon God."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I said this, my father thought I was joking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, from then on, when my mother would occasionally give me five or ten dollars, she would write on the envelope: "To Brother Nee To-sheng."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She was not giving me money as a mother.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After I had expressed myself thus to my father, the devil came to tempt me by saying, "Such an act is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose one day you are unable to maintain your living and you again approach your father for money.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Won't that be disgraceful?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have spoken to your father too soon; you should have waited until there was more progress in your work, until many people had been saved and you had many friends, before you began to live a life of faith."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But thank the Lord, ever since I expressed my decision to discontinue receiving my father's support, I have never asked him for money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Looking to God for</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sustenance while Working</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To the best of my knowledge, Sister Dora Yu was the only preacher at that time who did not receive a salary and who depended wholly upon God for her living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She was my spiritual elder sister, and we knew each other very well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She had many friends, Chinese and foreign, and the field of her work was very wide since she preached everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But my condition was just the opposite; few cared for me, so I found it rather difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet when I looked to the Lord, He said to me, "If you cannot live by faith, you cannot work for Me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I knew that I needed living work and living faith to serve a living God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When once I found that there was only about ten dollars in my wallet, which before long would be fully spent, I suddenly recalled the widow of Zarephath, who had only a handful of meal in the barrel and a little oil in the cruse 1 Kings 17:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There were not two handfuls of meal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I did not know by what means God sustained her, but I knew He had the means.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1921 two co-workers and I went to a place in Fukien province to preach, intending to go from there to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In my pocket were only four dollars, an insufficient amount for three bus tickets.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But, thank the Lord, a brother gave us three tickets.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Again, at Kulangsu, in the south of Fukien province, my money was stolen from my pocket, so that I had no traveling expenses to return home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We were then staying in someone's house and preached once a day in a small chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We finished and were ready to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My two co-workers had money to return home, but mine had been stolen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time each of us was spending his own money.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They made the decision to leave on the following day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I heard this I was embarrassed, but I was not willing to borrow money from them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That evening I prayed to God, beseeching Him to provide the needed money for traveling expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nobody knew this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That afternoon some people had come to speak with me about the Word, but I was in no mood to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time the devil came to tempt me and shake my faith, but I was firm in believing that God would not let me down.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was then merely a youth, just embarking on serving the Lord by faith; I had not yet learned the lesson of living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I continued praying to God that evening, thinking that perhaps I had done something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The devil said, "You could ask the co-workers to buy your ticket, then repay them when you reach the provincial capital."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I did not accept this suggestion and continued looking to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the time came for us to leave, there was still no money in hand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I packed my luggage as usual and hired a rickshaw.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that moment, I recalled the story of a brother who had no train ticket when the train was about to leave, but at that very instant, God ordered someone to give him a ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We were all ready and boarded the rickshaws, of which there were three.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I took the last one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the rickshaw had been pulled about forty yards, an old man in a long gown came from behind shouting, "Mr. Nee, please stop!" I ordered the rickshaw boy to halt.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After handing me a parcel of food as well as an envelope, the old man departed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I was then so grateful for God's arrangement that my eyes were filled with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I opened the envelope, I found four dollars inside, just sufficient for a bus ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The devil kept speaking to me, "Don't you see how dangerous it is?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I replied, "I was indeed a little anxious about it, but it is by no means dangerous, for God has supplied my need in time."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After arriving in Amoy, another brother gave me a return ticket.</S>
