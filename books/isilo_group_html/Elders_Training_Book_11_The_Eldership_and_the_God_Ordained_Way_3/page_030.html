We may think that a certain brother is marvelous. Eventually, he may not turn out the way that we think he will. We may feel that he is good material to be an elder, but after five years he may no longer be attending the meetings. We may not think much of another brother, but five years later this brother may become very promising and useful in the Lord's hands. Those of us who have been elders for a while have experienced this. Who is the best material to be an elder? Even after many years of serving the Lord, I would say that I do not know. I am saying all of this to show us that we should not trust our own evaluation of people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ELDERS, ON THE ONE HAND,<br>HAVING THE CLEAR SIGHT OVER THE PEOPLE<br>WITH MUCH DISCERNMENT, AND<br>ON THE OTHER HAND,<br>BEING BLIND SPIRITUALLY</H2><P>The elders, on the one hand, should have the clear sight over the people with much discernment, and on the other hand, they should be blind spiritually. Isaiah 11 tells us how Christ carries out God's administration in this way: "He will neither judge by what His eyes see,/Nor decide by what His ears hear./But He will judge the poor in righteousness, / And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land" (vv. 3b-4a). He does not judge by what He sees or hears. With the poor ones, He exercises His righteousness, and with the suffering, afflicted ones, He decides with equity.</P><P>This shows us that regardless of what we see or hear about others, we should not forget what our responsibility is. Our responsibility is to minister Christ to them just as Christ only ministers righteousness to the poor and equity to the afflicted. We should not care much for others' position and condition. Regardless of their condition, we should still minister Christ to them with Christ's salvation. For this we must be persons who are thoroughly dealt with by God. We must be persons who are thoroughly transfused and permeated with God, persons full of the Spirit as Christ was.</P><P>When we contact people, we should not care for what we see about them or hear about them. We must take care of our business to minister Christ with His salvation. Whether someone is a "Zaccheus" or an "immoral woman of Samaria," we should do the same thing. The only difference is the way we would take with each case. The goal of ministering Christ is still the same. Often because of what we see and hear, we become frustrated. We forget to minister Christ with His salvation to people. We pay too much attention to what they are. Suppose a backslidden brother comes to us. If we still remember and are deeply impressed with his backsliding, this remembrance will reduce our usefulness in the hand of the Lord. We should forget about his backsliding. He is still a brother, and our duty, our business, in our eldership is to minister Christ to him.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 11: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (3) &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
