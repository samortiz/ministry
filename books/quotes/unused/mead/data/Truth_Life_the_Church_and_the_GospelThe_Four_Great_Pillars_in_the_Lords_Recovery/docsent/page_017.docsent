   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROPER KNOWLEDGE ISSUING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Merely having the truth without experience is vanity; hence, we all need to have experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the truth?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The truth is God, and God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, concerning the truth, we cannot have just the doctrinal knowledge; we must also have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, we must experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For instance, you may tell people that Christ possessed humanity, in which were human virtues, including the virtues of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may also tell them that Christ also possessed divinity, in which were the divine attributes, including the attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, and that since Christ had the divine attributes, the human virtues that He expressed were excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, they might ask you, What does that have to do with me?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If they ask this, you can tell them, Man was created in God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since you are a man, you were created in God s image, but you do not have God in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is a God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, so you also have the virtues of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet these virtues are like the five fingers of a glove, which are soft and limp.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is because you do not have God inside of you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, God was within the Lord Jesus as the rich content of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You need to receive this Jesus into you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He died for you, was resurrected, and has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Spirit is Jesus Christ, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, this Spirit will enter into you, that is, God will enter into you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then His real love, light, holiness, and righteousness will fully enrich your love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This kind of speaking will stir up their inward need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To make it easier for people to experience and apply these truths subjectively, we may use the following illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose a person loves his wife very much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This love was created by God, but his human love cannot last long.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once his wife becomes angry and gives him a long face, his human love falls short.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This proves that man s love is like the soft, limp fingers of a glove; it is not enriched and is without the strengthening and supply of God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if a person receives Jesus Christ as the life-giving Spirit, he will have God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s love will be in his love, and as a result, he will be able to love his wife, regardless of how she treats him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, as an empty glove, he will be filled with God as the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With the real fingers inside, the glove s fingers are enriched and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the same way, now he will be able to express an excellent love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just like the person in this illustration, we have patience, which was created by God, that is like the fingers of an empty glove.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We also need to receive God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once we do, He will become the patience in us to enrich and strengthen our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the end our patience will be strengthened just as the empty fingers of the glove are made firm when they are filled with the fingers of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God s patience will be put into our patience, and the patience that we express will be an excellent virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, in order to have excellent virtues, we must have the divine attributes within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE URGENT NEED TO LEARN THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that all the saints, especially the young people, would learn the truth in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul said that God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth 1 Tim 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should no longer be like the elderly church members in Christianity who have been saved for decades but are still ignorant of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, many Christians have been saved for years yet are not clear about the meaning of the name Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some may think that Jesus is the same as Christ and that Christ is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you ask them what the difference is between the terms Redeemer and Savior, they probably think that the two terms are nearly the same in meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even many of the saints among us may not know their intrinsic significance and hidden mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I do not mean to expose other people s weaknesses, but I want to show you that we are too much under the influence of the old Christian traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we have spoken many high truths in the past, we have never precisely defined the meaning of the name Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The result is that we probably know something about the meaning but are not altogether sure about it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the general situation of Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In brief, Jesus means Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In detail, the Hebrew word for Jesus is composed of two words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first word means Jehovah and the second word means Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, Jesus means Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the clear definition of the name Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The word Christ means God s Anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, Jesus Christ means that Jehovah the Savior is God s Anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The advantage of a school education is that every thing and every matter are given precise definitions, so that we can learn the proper definitions for things that we know only in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a person does not quite understand the definitions of various things, his speaking concerning them will not be so definite and accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When people listen to him, they will know that he has not received much education.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today Christians go to church every week, worshipping God fifty-two times a year, yet after ten or twenty years they still may not be certain about biblical truths.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Almost none of them can explain the meanings of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is why Christians today are so weak and so poor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is because they have not been properly educated.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The churches in the Lord s recovery must learn from this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every saint in every church should be educated in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is a hymn which says that the church is not a school or a factory but an organic garden of God for growing Christ Hymns, #1237 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What we do in this garden is the work of planting and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, we should not open a school to teach the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, Bible education should be carried out in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The parents, the older generation, should teach the children, the younger generation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In ancient times the Jews did not have schools.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Their education was conducted in their homes with the parents bearing the responsibility of teaching their children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although the church is not a school but a family, it still needs to carry out the function of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should receive education in the church, not in the way of school education but in the way of home education parents teaching the older brothers and sisters, and the older brothers and sisters teaching the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Eventually, everyone will know how to speak and teach.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this way the church will be filled with the atmosphere of mutual learning and mutual teaching, and all the saints will make much progress in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>These days I am very happy because while traveling through Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines, I have observed that the young people in the churches are pursuing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They can teach one another and even teach the elderly saints.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They are able to tell people definitely that Jesus is Jehovah the Savior and that Christ is God s Anointed, because they have learned these things from the life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the past the old doctrines we preached were like clouds and fog floating in the air nothing was definite.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But now the life-study messages present the truth in a clear and precise way, so that people can readily understand the truth after reading them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>So from now on, we have to change our family tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must not be influenced by confused Christianity any longer; instead, we should completely renounce all the old practices.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This does not mean that we should discard the Bible but that we should come out of the clouds and fog.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We desire to have a clear sky with every truth having a clear definition.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have to learn until we thoroughly understand and are able to speak to others what justification is, what sanctification is, what renewing is, and what transformation is.</S>
