   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Recovering the Dormant Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The condition of the church in Taipei shows that the greatest need in the work in encouraging the small groups is to recover the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The business office has gone through the name lists and made a list of the dormant brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will give this list to the small groups according to their addresses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, there are some dormant saints who live close to group #2.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are neighbors, so the members of group #2 should go to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Other dormant brothers and sisters live near group #9, so the brothers and sisters of that group should take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first responsibility of every group is to recover the dormant brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot rely merely on the brothers and sisters in the groups to take care of this; we must also depend on the full-time co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the co-workers are encouraging the small groups, they should give the brothers and sisters in the groups a list of the dormant saints who are in their neighborhood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The co-workers should encourage the brothers and sisters to find the time and the way to recover the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The full-timers should help the groups and encourage them to contact the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The saints can call the dormant ones and invite them to a meal for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not speak to the dormant saints about the meetings; we should first think of ways to warm them up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Recovering the dormant brothers and sisters is a tremendous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have a list with eleven thousand names but only five thousand saints meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are six thousand saints who stay at home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we can work on recovering the ones at home, we will be able to recover at least three thousand saints by next summer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the number of saints in our meetings will increase from five thousand to eight thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We might not be able to recover one hundred percent of the dormant ones, but we should be able to recover two-thirds of them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we can recover four thousand out of the six thousand dormant saints, our work will have been effective.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Encouraging the Preaching of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>in All the Households</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must also encourage all the households to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must especially encourage gospel meetings in the homes of dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some may think that this is hard to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can we preach the gospel in the homes of dormant saints?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The full-time co-workers should help the saints to encourage the dormant ones to open their homes for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to my experience and observation, the best way to recover a dormant saint is to preach the gospel in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For a dormant saint to be recovered into the church life, we should not only hold a gospel meeting in his home; rather, we should ask him to preach the gospel message.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He might say that he has no way to give a message, because he has not been in the meetings for five years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though he has not been in the meetings for five years, he has been saved for more than five years, he has some experiences of salvation, and he loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He can give a gospel testimony and tell others about his experience of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He might insist that he does not have anything to say, but we should encourage him to speak concerning how he was saved and about his present love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once he starts to speak, he might become more fervent, and he may even shed tears as he speaks of the Lord s grace to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After he speaks such a word, he will not be able to sleep at night, and the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum will come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the wind and the cloud come, he will become a man of wind and cloud, and his home will become a home of wind and cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a result, he and his family will be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we will be earnest in having the dormant saints preach the gospel, at least seventy percent of them will be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the best and quickest method.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, when we go to recover the dormant households, we should not speak to the brothers, because they have their dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They may be embarrassed because they have not been in the meetings for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should, therefore, begin with the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that first the sisters should visit the households, not the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The co-workers must encourage the sisters to visit the households.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is easier for a sister to soften the hearts of the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once we gain the sisters, it will not be difficult to gain their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Almost every husband follows his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, we should not be afraid; as long as we have faith and boldly go through the door of the sisters, we will be able to gain the dormant household.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The co-workers must exercise wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes a sister is hard, and it is not easy to contact her.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In such a situation, we can go through their children and lay a foundation with the children.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then the children become a net to catch their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In most families, the husbands follow the wives, and the parents follow the children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The parents will not follow the children to do evil things, but when the children do something positive, the parents will follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the children are recovered, the father will consider the effect that his not being in the meetings has had on his children.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He will be encouraged to meet with the saints since his children have been blessed and God has shown mercy on his household.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In such circumstances, it will be almost impossible for the father not to be recovered.</S>
