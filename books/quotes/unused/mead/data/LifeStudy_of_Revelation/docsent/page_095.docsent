   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S JUDGMENT FOR HIS BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The accomplishment of God s building requires His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s judgment is carried out by Christ s being the One with seven flaming eyes to burn, enlighten, search, purify, and refine us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, these flaming eyes infuse us with all that He is, metabolically transforming us into His being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The whole city of New Jerusalem will have the same essence and appearance as God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we have pointed out several times, the appearance of God sitting on the throne in chapter four is of jasper 4:3 , and the appearance of the New Jerusalem, especially its wall, in chapter twenty-one is also of jasper 21:11, 18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the essence and appearance of God and of the city are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only by having the very God wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The essence of God is wrought into us by means of transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not ignore the seven eyes, the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Revelation is not a book of one Spirit; it is a book of the seven Spirits, the seven eyes of Christ, whereby the redeeming, overcoming, and building Christ transfuses Himself into all His members.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While He is transfusing Himself into us, He is searching, enlightening, judging, purifying, and refining us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way He transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How we need to see this vision!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE GOVERNING VISION IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the Bible cannot be improved, the truth in the Bible is progressive, and the recovery of the divine truths in the Bible is even more progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Four hundred years ago, very few of the truths in God s Word had been recovered, but this is not so today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The recovery of the truths is richer now than it was just twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This does not mean that the Bible changes or that we change the Bible, for no one has the right to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It means that the Lord is moving on in the recovery of His truths.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s recovery of the truths in the Bible is absolutely for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first year I was opposed was 1958, the very year that I was first burdened to minister on God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was the cause of all the opposition and criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, I only care for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I thank the Lord that He has vindicated the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man s word means nothing; only what God says counts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has said that He is for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The entire Bible is for this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the very beginning, in the book of Genesis, we have the tree of life and the flowing river producing gold, bdellium pearl , and precious stones Gen 2:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the end of the Bible, in Revelation, we have a city built with these precious materials, with gold, pearl, and precious stones Rev 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the whole Bible is for God s eternal purpose of securing His eternal dwelling place by dispensing Himself as life into His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the governing vision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>GOD S DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have any other view, it means that we are shortsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is not seeking holiness or spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is seeking the building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1958 I said that our spirituality must be tested by God s building, that is, by the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I said that God does not care for our spirituality, the opposers took this sentence out of context and condemned me, saying, Listen!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Lee says that God does not care for spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Isn t this heretical?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you keep this statement in its context, it is not at all heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God does not care for our spirituality; He cares for how much we have been built into His church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Individualistic spirituality is cancerous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Any individualistic member of the church is a cancer in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may say that you are spiritual or holy, but your spirituality and holiness must be tested by the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps your holiness is individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If it is, then it is not healthy, for true holiness is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God does not want a group of individualistic spiritual persons; He wants the building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He does not desire a heap of precious stones for exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God, of course, needs individuals, but He needs them as the material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the individual stones must be put into the building.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not a mere doctrine but a serious fact.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Have you been built into God s building?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Or are you one who is saved, who fears God, who loves the Lord, and who prays, but who says, I don t care about the church ?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do you say, It is not good to talk so much about the church; it is better to be alone with the Lord and read the Bible ?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You may enjoy this, but God is not as fond of it as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He wants you to lose yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You must be enlightened, searched, purified, refined, and then infused with all that He is that you may be transformed into a precious stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is God s desire today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why did God call the Israelites out of Egypt?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was for the building up of His dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, the tabernacle as God s dwelling place on earth became the center of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whenever they were wrong with the tabernacle, they lost all their wars.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But whenever they were right with the tabernacle, they were victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After the Israelites entered into the good land, they built the temple as the center of their life as God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When they were right with the temple, they were right with God, and when they were wrong with the temple, they were wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a brief abstract of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What do we have in the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have the church today and the New Jerusalem in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, a brief abstract of the whole Bible is God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>THE NEED FOR AN INTENSIFIED INFUSION</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because of the darkness and degradation of this age, God has been forced to exercise Himself as the sevenfold intensified Spirit to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need the searching and enlightening of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Perhaps you have been clinging to doctrines for years.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What good have they done for you?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The degraded recovered church has so much doctrine, but what did the Lord say of them?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He said that they were neither hot nor cold, but rather that they were lukewarm and therefore qualified for being vomited out of His mouth 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the condition of the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We thank the Lord that the light concerning His building is brighter today than it has ever been.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The light is shining over us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is not a matter of being an individualistic overcomer in some minor things, but of being an overcomer in the major things for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Many Christians do not understand the meaning of overcoming in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To overcome in this book means to overcome degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must overcome the degraded situation of the so-called church for the sake of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Read the book of Revelation again and again and you will see that its governing view is the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must keep this before us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Everything is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The revelation of Christ in chapter one is for the building; the seven epistles to the seven churches in chapters two and three are for God s building; and the scene in heaven after Christ s ascension and the vision of Christ as the Lion-Lamb in chapter five are also for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Christ s having the seven eyes which are the seven lamps and the seven Spirits of God is not that we might be individualistically holy, but is absolutely for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In this age, we are in a dark night and we need the intensified sevenfold Spirit as the seven shining lamps to enlighten, search, purge, and refine us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Ultimately, what we need is the Lord s intensified infusion.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We need to be infused with all that He is so that we might become transformed stones for God s building.</S>
