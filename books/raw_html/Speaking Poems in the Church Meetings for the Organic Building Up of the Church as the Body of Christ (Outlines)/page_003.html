 <h1 class="msg">OUTLINE TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">SPEAKING POEMS<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:23a, 26; Heb. 10:24-25</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="7">
<li>The characteristics of proper poems:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>They are written according to the divine revelation.</li>
	<li>They are written to express genuine spiritual experiences.</li>
	<li>Through our speaking they dispense the divine life and illuminate with the divine light.</li>
	<li>They are the cream of a person&rsquo;s:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Spiritual experience.</li>
		<li>Learning.</li>
		<li>Thought.</li>
		<li>Utterance.</li>
		<li>Writing.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To speak the composed, poetic writings is more accurate, concise, and powerful than ordinary speaking.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When we speak the hymns one to another with the exercise of our spirit,
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Every sentence uttered by us touches the being of others.</li>
	<li>Every sentence we speak ministers Christ into others&rsquo; being.</li>
	<li>It does not build up a congregation, but it builds up the organic Body of Christ.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The issue of speaking psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs in mutuality, one to another, in the church meetings.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word of Christ is ministered&mdash;Col. 3:16.</li>
	<li>The Spirit is dispensed&mdash;Eph. 5:18-19.</li>
	<li>The Body of Christ is built up&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26.</li>
	<li>Teaching and admonishing are realized&mdash;Col. 3:16.</li>
	<li>Exhortation results&mdash;Heb. 10:25.</li>
	<li>Truths for enlightenment are revealed.</li>
	<li>Life for supply is imparted.</li>
	<li>Experiences of the Triune God are unveiled.</li>
	<li>God is manifested.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>By speaking poems in the church meetings, the meetings will be uplifted, strengthened, supplied, enriched, enlivened, and refreshed.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The speaking of the hymns works best in the group meetings with a smaller number&mdash;Heb. 10:24-25.</li>
	<li>However, we should learn and practice speaking the hymns in the larger meetings of the church for the mutual edification of the saints and the building up of the church&mdash;1 Cor. 14:23a, 26.</li>
	<li>In every church meeting it is good and profitable to use a proper hymn in a living way.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Necessary points to care for in speaking psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Exercise to have your whole being in full harmony with the Lord:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A sober, clear mind.</li>
		<li>A calm emotion.</li>
		<li>An exercised spirit.</li>
		<li>A heart free from all condemnation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Overcome the two things that damage the meetings and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our face.</li>
		<li>Our pride.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Speak out of the enjoyment of Christ.</li>
	<li>Speak to dispense God into people.</li>
	<li>Release your spirit&mdash;our spirit must be open, strong, real, genuine, and released, not weak, timid, false, or closed.</li>
	<li>Be living and impressive in your speaking.</li>
	<li>Speak to impress people with the points of the hymn.</li>
	<li>Digest the portion spoken thoroughly.</li>
	<li>Speak without anything religious or natural.</li>
	<li>Speak without any routine, without anything traditional, and without any oldness.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Speak in a living and flowing manner with flexibility.</li>
		<li>A river flows straight and crooked, fast and slow, gentle and rough, and quiet and loud.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In developing our exercise in speaking to one another in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must be poor in spirit.</li>
	<li>We must have a learning attitude.</li>
	<li>We must be sincere in our exercise.</li>
	<li>We will spontaneously adjust our practice as we corporately exercise ourselves in the speaking of the poems.</li>
	</ol></li>
