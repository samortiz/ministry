Today, because of the turmoil, many times we hear corrupt words, that is, words that bring death to us. When we hear these words, we should not consider whether they are right or wrong. Rather, we should check whether they enliven us or kill us. As long as a word kills us, it is a corrupt word. We should not allow this kind of word to proceed out of our mouth. Instead, we should speak only words that are good for needful building up. If we do this, we will give grace, another form of what God is, in the dispensing of the divine life, to the hearers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Not Grieving the Holy Spirit,<br>in Whom We Were Sealed,<br>for the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity,<br>unto (or, for) the Day of the<br>Redemption of our Body</H2><P>The fifth point is that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit (v. 30). If the Holy Spirit is grieved, we will not be happy. If we are not happy, that is a sign that the Holy Spirit within us is not happy. This Holy Spirit is sealing us. This sealing is the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, and it is unto the day of the redemption of our body. In Greek the word unto can also mean for. We are not sealed merely unto the day of redemption, but also for the day of redemption. This means that through the soaking and saturating of the sealing, we will be qualified to be redeemed on that day. The sealing is for that day. If we are not sealed and permeated by the sealing ink of the Holy Spirit today, we cannot expect to be redeemed on that day. Our daily sealing today is to qualify us for the redemption on that day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Abstaining, in the Divine Dispensing,<br>from All Bitterness, Anger, Wrath, Clamor,<br>and Evil Speaking, with All Malice</H2><P>The sixth point is that we must abstain from all bitterness, anger, wrath, clamor, and evil speaking, with all malice (v. 31). The word all modifies all the succeeding items. This means that we should abstain not only from all bitterness, but also from all anger, all wrath, all clamor, all evil speaking, and all malice. In other words, we need to keep ourselves pure from all these dirty things.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Economy and Dispensing of God &nbsp; pg 65</div><br></body></html>
