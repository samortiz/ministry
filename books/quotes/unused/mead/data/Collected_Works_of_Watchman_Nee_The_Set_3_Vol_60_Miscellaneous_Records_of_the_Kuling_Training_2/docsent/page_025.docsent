   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KEY TO PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must realize that man's entire heart is darkened with respect to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His heart is hardened, wicked, satanic, fleshly, and worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is impossible for such a heart to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before the Holy Spirit operates on our gospel friends, it is impossible for them to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we must trust in the Holy Spirit for our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to use God's word to open the sinner's heart and to create something in it that was not there before.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The goal of the gospel is to gain a beachhead in man's heart and to expand such a beachhead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the key to preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no desire for God within the heart of a fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is filled with evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order for a sinner to receive salvation, the first thing we have to do is to create a place for God within his heart with the words of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only then will a person accept the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When our words go out, they first lodge in the mind of the listener.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the mind becomes the gateway for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Next God gains the desire of the heart, and finally He gains the will of the man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, it is not enough to merely gain the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When God's word enters a sinner, the first thing that happens to him is the forming of some new thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These new thoughts create a new desire for salvation in him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Next he resolves within himself to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once he makes this resolution, the gospel breaks through in him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the goal of the gospel is to create a desire in man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are three objectives in the process of preaching: 1 The initial objective is to put certain ideas in man about salvation so that he begins to understand a little about God and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 The chief objective of preaching is to make men seek after God, to create a desire for Him and an inclination for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3 The ultimate goal of preaching is to cause men to choose God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The gospel does not conquer man through his understanding but through his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Creating such a desire within man is the main goal of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In preaching the gospel, the first thing we have to do is to undergird man's thoughts with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The final step, however, is always to lead him to a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, we have to lodge God's word, the sure word, into man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we follow this first word with a second word to pry him open, to create in him a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally, we should lead him to a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first word is a "straight hook," while the second word is a "curved hook."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first word provides a support in the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second word is a tool to pry open the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The result is a deliberate decision in the will to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE CRUCIAL FACTOR BEING DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All good gospel preachers first deposit a few words in the sinners' mind and then pry open and stir up their desire with more words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lastly, they invite and urge the sinners to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is how they turn the sinners around.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew 13:15 contains three words: lest, understand, and turn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word understand relates to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word lest implies a possibility of stirring up of one's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word turn relates to one's decision.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A man does not understand because he does not have the desire to understand, and he does not see light because his heart has no desire for such light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Most of the time the problem is not with man's mind or thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The problem is with the motivation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order for a man's mind to understand, we must make him willing to understand; he must want to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a matter of motive and motivation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a man is not saved, it is because he has no motivation to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a man hears and understands the gospel but has no motivation to receive it, it will be useless even if he is forced to make a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The greatest problem facing a gospel preacher is the desire in man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once a man's heart is inclined toward the Lord, the major part of the job of preaching is done.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Proverbs 21:1 says, "The king's heart is like streams of water in the hand of Jehovah;/He turns it wherever He wishes."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The most important point in preaching the gospel is to gain man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once a gospel preacher gains a man's heart, the rest is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to spend time to study and learn.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must also look to the Holy Spirit to provide us with the suitable words, that is, words with "hooks" in them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our words have to be like hooks that draw out man's desire and gain his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we can do this, our gospel preaching will be a success.</S>
