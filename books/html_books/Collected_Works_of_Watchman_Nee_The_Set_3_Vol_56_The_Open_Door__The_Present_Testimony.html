The church must have both the authority of the Spirit and the ground of locality. The ground of locality, however, is not a simple matter, because a church still needs content. Without content, it still cannot be regarded as a local church. Being correct in name is a very important matter, but being correct in name does not necessarily mean that there is no problem. This is the reason I would like to see from the Bible, together with you, several requirements of a church in a locality. Just saying that we are standing on the ground of locality is not enough. In order to say that a church is standing on the ground of locality, it should fulfill certain requirements and conditions and should have a certain content. If none of these requirements and conditions are met, we are still not standing on the ground of locality.</p><h2 class="head2">Receptive</h2><p>First, if a church is really standing on the ground of locality as set forth in the Bible, she must receive all whom the Lord has received. Romans 15:7 says, "Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received you to the glory of God." Here we see one thing: The receiving of a Christian is based upon the receiving of Christ&mdash;that is, we should receive one another as Christ has received us. In other words, we cannot refuse those whom Christ has received. If a sinner has been received by Christ, we must receive him as a brother. If we do not receive a man whom Christ has received, immediately we are a sect, not the church.</p><p>What is a church? A church receives all whom Christ has received in one locality. God is not as concerned with those who live in Shanghai receiving the brothers in Nanking or Chungking as He is about them receiving the brothers in their locality. We must receive all whom Christ has received. If we want to determine whether or not the church in Tientsin is a church, all we have to do is see whether or not it receives all those who are saved in Tientsin. Suppose the brothers in Tientsin want to be selective; they only want to receive a certain type of people who have been received by Christ and not another type of people who also have been received by Christ. Then that is not the church. We cannot say that we receive those who are the same as us, while we do not receive those who are not the same as us. We cannot fail to receive one whom the Lord has received for any reason; otherwise, we are not the church.</p><p>"Him who is weak in faith receive,..for God has received him" (Rom. 14:1, 3). Suppose someone is a vegetarian. We may consider that he is very weak. However, the basis for receiving is whether or not God has received him, not whether he is strong or weak. Perhaps he is a weak brother, but we still must receive him. God already has received him without regard for his strength or weakness; therefore, we must receive him as well. The fundamental fellowship of a church in a locality is based upon the fellowship of God. We must receive a brother whom God has received. We cannot have any reason to refuse him; otherwise, we are a sect, not a church. The church in a locality is based on a receiving that is as broad as God and also as strict as God: Whomever God receives, we receive; whomever God does not receive, we do not receive. The universal church receives all whom God has received in the whole world; a local church receives all whom God has received in a locality. No matter how different a brother is from us or how far short he is of our standard, there is only one requirement for us to receive him&mdash;that is, has God received him? If God has received him, we must receive him. Therefore, a local church&mdash;we must be very clear about this&mdash;must take the life of Christ and faith in God as the basis for receiving believers. Apart from this we do not have any other demands. If we make other demands as certain requirements, we are a sect just like any other sect. A sect is condemned and is therefore a very serious matter.</p><h2 class="head2">Exercising Discipline</h2><p>Does this mean that we must receive all believers in a locality without any reservations? No! A church in a locality must not only receive all whom Christ has received in that locality, but must also exercise church discipline. What is this discipline? When a brother who has been received by the Lord commits something that requires the Lord to exclude him from fellowship, we too must exercise discipline upon him. We should not say that we want all whom the Lord wants and all whom the Lord does not want. If the Lord puts a certain one into the world, yet we put him into the church, we open a door to the world in the church. As a result, there will be no boundary between the church and the world; the wall between them will be torn down by us.</p><p>We often use this illustration: When a boat is at sea, the boat and the sea cannot have fellowship. As soon as they begin to have fellowship, the boat will begin to sink into the sea. Likewise, if a hole is drilled in the church, the line of separation between the church and the world will disappear. Therefore, the local church must exercise discipline; it must have disciplinary action in order to be a local church.</p><p>What is disciplinary action? First Corinthians 5 speaks of six different kinds of persons who are saved and have God's life, but they have indulged themselves and become a fornicator, a covetous man, a reviler, a drunkard, an idolater, and an extortioner (v. 11). Paul told the church in Corinth to "remove the evil man from among yourselves" (v. 13). The command in 1 Corinthians 5 does not say that we must put a brother away from among us as soon as he has sinned. But it does say that we must put him away when he becomes such a one. It does not say one who commits fornication, but "a fornicator"; not a brother who reviles, but "a reviler." When a man becomes such a one, the church must put him away; it must excommunicate him. Whomever the Lord does not want in the church, we also must not want in the church. If we keep one whom the Lord does not want in our locality, this retention will cause trouble. The Lord said that such a one is like a little leaven which will leaven the whole lump (1 Cor. 5:6). Before long, the whole church will be moldy. The whole church will no longer be pure flour; it will have leaven. Therefore, the church must have discipline. Moreover, the church knows what kind of person a brother is. This is reflected in the words of Sister M. E. Barber: "The oneness of the church is the voice of the Holy Spirit." If all the brothers feel that a brother is such a person, then it is certain that he is such a person. We cannot say that all the brothers have misunderstood him. Therefore, a local church must execute God's discipline in its locality.</p><p>Furthermore, the Bible reveals that the church executes discipline in regard to not only moral issues but also doctrinal issues. However, the Lord does not want us to exercise discipline regarding ordinary doctrines. For example, some keep the Lord's Day while others keep the Sabbath. (This does not refer to the Seventh-day Adventists, who are recovering the law.) Some keep both days; we should not argue about this. Some brothers eat vegetables and some eat meat; we should not argue about this. However, there is a kind of doctrine which we must defend by all means, and that is the doctrine concerning the person of the Lord Jesus. This is mentioned in 2 John 7 through 11:</p><p>For many deceivers went out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist...Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God...If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice! For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works.</p><p>Here I think it is very clear that a church in a locality must uphold the person of the Lord Jesus. If the Lord Jesus is not God manifest in the flesh, that is, if He is only flesh, then He is not God, and the Lord Jesus could not have accomplished redemption for us. The church, therefore, would be basically annulled. Therefore, the church must be strict about anything that concerns the person of Christ. It must not be loose or lenient at all in this matter. If someone preaches a different teaching about the person of the Lord, do not receive him into your house and do not say to him, Rejoice. Otherwise, your church will lose its ground. As long as it has no discipline, it loses its qualification as a church. Moral confusion is wrong and not allowed by the church, and doctrinal confusion is also wrong and not allowed by the church. However, we should by no means identify differences over ordinary doctrines as being included in this category. If the church deals with ordinary doctrines as it deals with such confusion, the whole church will be cut up and divided into pieces. We should not argue about ordinary doctrines. We must only defend the doctrines regarding the person of Christ. Here the church must exercise discipline; otherwise, the church is finished.</p><p>Matthew 18:15-17 says, "Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone...But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more. ..And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile." Some churches are very lazy and do not care to handle troublesome matters. But the Lord said that the church must take care of disciplinary matters, if it is to be a church at all. The Lord's teaching in chapter eighteen is regarding the local church because it refers to a place in which we can "tell." The local church must take care of these matters. If a local church does not take care of these matters, she is neglecting her duty. If we are a church in a locality, we must bear all the responsibility in that locality.</p><h2 class="head2">Inclusive</h2><p>Furthermore, the most important matter for the church in a locality is that she must be inclusive, not exclusive. The church must be inclusive in two aspects of its behavior and its doctrine. First, we will consider the aspect of Christian behavior that the church should not exclude.</p><p>In Acts 20:27 Paul told the elders of Ephesus, "I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God," or "I did not shrink from declaring to you the perfect, complete will of God." If the church in a locality is standing in the position of the church, she must not shrink from declaring the perfect, complete will of God. We cannot expect that every brother will touch the perfect, complete will of God, but like Paul we must not shrink from or reject one truth concerning the perfect, complete will of God. As soon as we shy away from some aspect of the truth, we are a sect. If we exclude those who believe in the certain truths which we shrink from, then we are not able to include all of God's children.</p><p>"The church..is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all" (Eph. 1:22-23). The Lord fills the universal church; the Lord also fills the local church. If a local church only has a part of Christ, that is not the church. The church is the Body of Christ, which means the whole Christ. For example, if my waist is forty inches around and I am given a suit with a waistline measuring thirty inches, I will not be able to wear it. The clothing must be big enough for me to wear. The relationship of the church to Christ is like the body to life; it is not exactly like clothing to the body. Sometimes we can force our clothing a little to fit our body, but we can never force our body to contain life. The Body must be complete in order to fully contain the whole life of Christ. Only when the Lord's fullness is in the church in Shanghai can it be called the church in Shanghai. If the church allows a certain matter but disallows another matter, then the church has a shortage. If there is anything that we cannot accept, the portion of Christ within that very thing will be excluded from us. In such a case, we are not perfectly complete; the church is maimed. This is very important. The church is filled with the fullness of Christ. The church is the Body of Christ; Christ puts on such a church as His outward container. The church must be large enough to contain Christ. The church must have a large enough shell for Christ to fit into. If the church does not have all that His life has, the church cannot express the complete Christ and cannot be called the church.</p><p>Colossians 1:25 says, "Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God." Within the church, there must be the complete word of God. The word of God must be completed in the church. After reading these words, we may not understand the practical side. For example, what does it mean to have the word of God and all kinds of scriptural behavior fulfilled in the church? What does it mean that a local church should be inclusive and not exclusive?</p><p>(1) As an example, we have been talking about the matter of spiritual gifts in these days. We say that we are the church in Shanghai, but suppose that brothers in Shanghai do not believe in spiritual gifts. Is this all right? No! The church cannot say that it does not believe in spiritual gifts, because there are spiritual gifts in the Bible. As soon as we do not believe in spiritual gifts, we cannot be the church in Shanghai; we can only be called "a church in Shanghai that does not believe in spiritual gifts." Our refusal to believe in spiritual gifts causes us not to be inclusive and makes us exclusive to some brothers. Suppose there are twenty brothers in Shanghai who believe in spiritual gifts. Once we refuse to believe in spiritual gifts, we cannot include them; we keep them out. Since they are members of the Body of Christ, our excluding of them may not be like cutting off our hand, but at least it is like cutting off a finger. Therefore, we cannot say that this church is filled with the fullness of Christ. We have not fulfilled the word of God; we have cut off a portion of Christ.</p><p>(2) Consider a greater matter, such as selling all to follow the Lord. Suppose the brothers in Shanghai do not believe in selling everything, but instead believe in working diligently to earn money and taking out a certain percentage of it for distribution to the poor. If one hundred brothers in Shanghai are moved by the Spirit of the Lord to sell everything and follow the Lord, they will feel that there is no place for them in this church. If we have no way to include them, we are exclusive to them. But selling all to follow the Lord is a part of the life of Christ. If we cannot include the brothers who have this portion of life, if we ostracize them, we can see that our church is both too small and it is maimed. This is like amputating a hand or foot. How can the church not have all that Christ has? If the church does not have all that Christ has, this church cannot stand in the position of the church. It is a sect, not a church. A church must include the fullness of Christ. If it does not, these one hundred brothers will eventually form a church that sells all to follow the Lord, bringing forth one more sect. We will not be complete and neither will they. Our doctrine is not broad enough to include them, and theirs is also not the perfect, complete will of God. We cut them off, and they also cut us off.</p><p>Therefore, a local church must include all kinds of God's children who seek the Lord. It must include the brothers who sell everything as well as the brothers who do not sell everything. We cannot include what is not in the Bible; otherwise, we will include the world. But we must include what is in the Bible; otherwise, we will separate and exclude some of God's children.</p><p>Acts 5:4 says, "While it [the property] remained, was it not your own?" It is evident that before the property was sold, it could remain the owners'. The Bible shows us that there were believers who did not sell everything; they all could still be Christians. If a certain group is unwilling to admit those who do not sell all, it is a "family" (as practiced by some Christians in China), not the church. Ordinary denominations do not require everyone to sell all, but the "family" does require this; therefore, they also are not the church. Anything that bars a part of God's children is exclusive and sectarian. It is best for all the brothers to take the path of completeness. If we are not able to climb up this way, we should not hinder others from doing so. This is the only way for us to be inclusive and to be called the church. It is best for all God's servants to come up to this standard. If we are not able, we must reserve the path for others to take. What the Bible permits, we must permit; what the Bible does not permit, we also must not permit. We must have the aspiration to climb higher; we must take this road no matter how difficult. But even if we cannot make it, we must still allow other brothers the liberty to take this way. The church should never include only what we can do and exclude what we cannot do. We are not large enough to be the standard; we cannot be the basis for forming any kind of judgment.</p><p>Andrew Murray once said, "We who are the Lord's servants sooner or later will have to preach words which we are unable to fulfill." We should never hinder others from going on because we cannot go on. The church in a locality must have this kind of broad-mindedness in order to stand in the position of the church. This may seem strange, but this is a fact. Paul's walk was in accord with everything he preached, but people like us still have to preach even if we are not able to go on accordingly.</p><p>(3) Another example involves taking medicine when one is sick. There is a scriptural basis for this because Luke continued to work as a physician after he was saved. During times of sickness, it is all right to take something to help the body. Some brothers, however, only look to the Lord when they are sick; they take no medicine at all. The proper attitude of the church should include both. If brothers are able to believe in divine healing without the help of a doctor or medicine, this is best. If some brothers are short in faith and consult a doctor and take some medicine, this is also all right. If a group of brothers believe in science and think it is too much for others to refuse medicine and reject those who do, this group of brothers immediately will exclude some brothers and drive them out. However, we must not go to the other extreme, insisting on not seeing a doctor or not taking medicine like the former "Mount Zion Church." If we do, those who are short in faith may be put to death by us.</p><p>On the west side of Egypt, along the Sudan, malaria was very prevalent. Many brothers who believed in divine healing went there and said, "Quinine is medicine; we will not take it." As a result, every year scores out of a hundred died. But another group of brothers said, "In this place quinine is food, not medicine." As a result, only a few in a hundred died yearly. Evidently, the proposal of the first group was wrong.</p><p>Basically, our attitude should be to not bring in what is not permitted in the Bible, but to include whatever is permitted in the Bible. This is the way to be inclusive, not exclusive. We should not say that we must depend on medicine. If we do, those who believe in divine healing will go away. We also should not insist on avoiding medicine; otherwise, those who are weak in faith will go away. A church must be inclusive, not exclusive. All sects are the result of failure in this matter. We must give our attention to this.</p><p>(4) Regarding the matter of holiness, many of God's children believe that once they believe in the Lord they are perfect. Other children of God believe that they still need the second blessing in order to be perfect. In the Bible some were made perfect once they were blessed, but some also were blessed a second or third time before they touched perfection. Because the Brethren believe in perfection by being blessed once, the Holiness brothers leave because they absolutely believe that perfection is gained in the second blessing. But since they absolutely believe in the second blessing for perfection, the Brethren brothers leave because they believe in perfection by being blessed once. If a church picks only the Scriptures it believes in, it is not standing in the position of the church but, in fact, in the position of a denomination. We preach both the doctrine of perfection by being blessed once and the doctrine of perfection by receiving a second blessing. We can lead people to be made perfect by being blessed once, and we also can lead people to be liberated by receiving a second blessing. Whether or not we will bring forth more sects in the future depends upon whether or not we have reserved a place for all of God's children. If we have not reserved a place for all of God's children, we are a sect.</p><p>(5) Now I will mention several outward matters. For example, head covering is definitely in the Bible. Today the church must be absolutely in favor of head covering. But if some brothers have not seen it, we have to take the attitude of Romans 14 and wait for them to see it, because we must receive those whom the Lord receives. Although they do not see it, we hope they will see it in the future. The church can only stand on the positive side of what is in the Bible, not on the negative side. If some have not seen the matter of head covering, the church can only say that they will be received in spite of their weak faith. If a sister covers her head and the church does not receive her, she will feel that the church is not hers and she will leave. Then we will force a head-covering sect to be brought forth. If we stand in the position of not favoring head covering and do not allow the sisters to cover their heads, we are not a church. Receiving the saints is not based on whether or not sisters cover their heads. If the brothers' receiving is based upon head covering rather than Christ's receiving, the sisters who cover their heads will think that this church is not theirs. Therefore, we clearly must see that we have to stand on the side of what is in the Bible. If there are some who are unable to come up to this, we must also forbear them.</p><p>(6) The matter of laying on of hands is also found in the Bible. Some brothers are not able to go on with this matter, and we should not insist that they do. However, if we do not practice what is in the Bible, some brothers will leave us. Those who oppose the laying on of hands are a sect, a sect of "the non-laying on of hands." If we want to stand in the position of the church, we must accept whatever is in the Word of God.</p><p>(7) Baptism is argued about the most. Why has there been so much argument about this matter over the last several hundred years? This is because some have brought things from Roman Catholicism into Protestantism. Since Roman Catholicism sprinkled water on people's heads, many Protestant churches did the same. Originally, both sides probably exercised some forebearance and went through much discussion. But in the end each went its own way. With any command of the Bible, whenever the church does not stand on the positive side to maintain what is in the Bible, a sect is created.</p><p>(8) Concerning the matter of breaking of bread, the Bible speaks of remembering the Lord on the first day of every week. If certain churches do not practice this according to the Bible, those who want to remember the Lord this way can only leave.</p><p>(9) Foot-washing is also in the Bible. Some radically oppose this matter and bring it to nothing by their teaching. Consequently, those who want to obey the Lord's command in foot-washing leave.</p><p>(10) Among the God's children, some stress teaching, others stress deeper life, and still others stress gospel preaching. Brothers who are zealous in preaching the gospel often look down upon those who stress the deeper life, and brothers who stress the deeper life often look down upon those who preach the gospel. When you look down upon me and I look down upon you, divisions immediately appear.</p><p>(11) I will give another example. Some brothers emphasize preaching by inspiration. Of course, this is very rare. They preach by the inspiration that comes from spiritual gifts. This is very good. This is the kind of prophesying spoken of in 1 Corinthians 14. These brothers are not in favor of expounding the Bible. But is this not in the Bible? In the Bible there are those who preach the gospel and those who teach. If some brothers disapprove of expounding the Bible, those who study the Bible will find it unbearable. Those who are teachers will leave. But if the church only believes in teaching by expounding the Scriptures, those who believe in inspiration will not be able to tolerate it. Then divisions will result.</p><p>The entire difficulty is that we are too small! Our heart is not broad enough before the Lord, and our person is not big enough. "I want this, and I do not want that; the church must be managed according to my idea." Please remember, the church is managed according to the Lord's will, not according to our ideas, because we are too small. There are always some brothers better than us in certain aspects; we cannot say that we are superior to all the brothers. There are always some brothers and sisters who are above us in certain points. We cannot run ahead of them all. We must learn to receive the good points of all the brothers because only the Lord is equivalent to a church. Only when the whole church is added up will it equal one Lord. Even if we have received special mercy of the Lord, we can only equal a portion; we cannot equal all the brothers. If we equal two or twenty brothers, that is the Lord's mercy. But if we think we equal the whole church, what kind of pride is this? How can we make every brother like us? If every brother and sister is like us, the church has no future. Surely, many brothers and sisters are ahead of us in many areas. The church is one-sided when it pays attention only to one thing. When we emphasize one thing, another brother emphasizes another thing, and someone else emphasizes yet another&mdash;this means development for the whole church. But as soon as we place ourselves before the church, the church is finished. I can acknowledge that you are better than many brothers, but you can never equal all the brothers. It is the Lord Himself who equals the whole church, not us. Even the youngest brother may notice what we fail to notice. The good point of some brothers is love, but this is not true of all the brothers. If we see this, the church can grow in a balanced way.</p><p>(12) If a certain church wants to observe "Christmas," those who serve God faithfully have to go another way; there is absolutely no "Christmas" or "Easter" in the Bible. If the church wants to observe these occasions, we can immediately conclude that the church is not going on properly. There are many other things that are not found in the Bible such as the idols of Roman Catholicism. If we yield to these, trouble will definitely come.</p><h2 class="head2">Several Basic Principles</h2><p>In summarizing the above points, there are several basic principles. First, the church must stand on the positive side of whatever is in the Bible and forbear the negative side. If some are weak and unable to come up to what is in the Bible, the church needs to forbear.</p><p>Second, certain truths in the Bible have two sides, as we have already spoken of concerning the doctrine of holiness. Thus, the church must also have both sides. Having only one side will bring forth a sect.</p><p>Third, by all means the church must reject what is not in the Bible. Otherwise, those who follow the Lord faithfully will leave when they see the church practicing what is not in the Bible.</p><p>At any rate, we must stand on the positive side of what is in the Bible. Whenever the Bible allows both sides, we must stand on both sides. However, we must reject whatever is not in the Bible.</p><p>Fourth, we should allow people the freedom for whatever the Bible allows people freedom for, such as observing the Lord's Day or the Sabbath day. This does not mean that the Bible does not believe in the Lord's Day, but that the weak ones still believe in the Sabbath day. They are still Jews. The Bible absolutely approves of eating meat. But if some are in favor of being vegetarian, the church must allow them to be vegetarian. This keeping of the Sabbath day does not refer to the Seventh-day Adventists. Seventh-day Adventism involves the matter of the law; it is a whole system. This is entirely contrary to the book of Galatians, and it is a heresy not found in the Bible.</p><p>The church that includes all of God's children can be counted as the true church. If we have some special doctrine or some special emphasis, if we accept certain kinds of teaching at the expense of the rest of the children of God, we cannot be considered as the church. We cannot be the church without inclusiveness. With inclusiveness we will begin to see that we can be brothers and sisters to all of the children of God. We can be with anyone who loves the Lord. The leading brothers, therefore, must grow before the Lord. They must touch the highest and the most perfect. Let me repeat: If we have not attained to the highest, our heart should be big enough so that we do not hinder our brothers under any circumstance. If we cannot attain or climb up and do not allow others to go on, we are a sect, not a church.</p><p>We do not become a church just by putting up the name of the local church. We become a church only when there is spiritual inclusiveness that includes all of the children of God. If the church includes rather than excludes God's children, the church will not be responsible for brothers who desire to go another way, because it is they who are creating the division, not the church. Therefore, we must be broken to pieces! We must be dug deeply! We cannot consider ourselves the measuring stick of the church; we are too short. God has a work for every brother and sister, and He has committed something to each one of them. When everyone can be placed, there is the church. The church, therefore, must be inclusive, not exclusive.</p><h2 class="head2">Everyone Serving</h2><p>Whether or not a church can stand in the position of the church also depends upon whether she gives all the brothers and sisters the opportunity to work, that is, whether she gives all the brothers and sisters the opportunity to serve God. We must heed one thing: When a believer receives the life of God, he has the disposition to serve God; his nature wants to serve God. If we do not give him the opportunity to serve God, there will be a breakdown, and he will become sectarian. His new nature wants to serve, but if he cannot serve among us, he will find another place to serve. Many sects originate from the desire to work. Many people want to serve God, but because they have no way to get through, they seek another way and become a sect.</p><p>The teachings in the Bible are very clear on this matter. There are three portions in the Scripture that show us that the Body of Christ has a special relationship with service.</p><p>Romans 12:4-5 says, "For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another." These two verses say that we are one body and individually we are members. Verses 6 through 8 say, "And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy,..or service,..or he who teaches,..or he who exhorts..." In other words, the church is the Body of Christ. The church, like a body, includes many members. In fact, it includes every member. As a member, we must give each one work to do; we must give each one the opportunity to develop his functions. Paul showed us that no matter what kind of gift we have, we should only function to the extent that our gift allows. We should never do over and above the degree of our faith; we must leave room for other brothers to function. If we do all the work, other brothers will have nothing to do. If we take over all the tasks, other brothers will have no tasks to tackle. If we preach all the messages, other brothers will have nothing to preach. Therefore, it is better for one person to take one portion in the church, not for one person to take two, and even more. It is better not to do everything. A portion must be assigned to every brother. Every brother and sister must be given the opportunity to serve God just as we have the opportunity to serve God.</p><p>First Corinthians 12:27 says, "Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually." Following this it says, "And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues" (v. 28). It is wonderful that Paul asks in the next verse, "Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all have works of power?" (v. 29). Are all apostles? God is asking here. Is it true that all are apostles? Because there are prophets who want to occupy God's whole church, teachers who want to occupy God's whole church, and workers of miracles who want to occupy God's whole church, the Lord asks, "Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all have works of power?" Even if everyone in the whole church does works of power, that is still not the church. Even if everyone in the church is a prophet or a teacher, that is still not the church. Do all receive the gift of healing? Indeed, there are groups who specialize only in healing. But even if every one of us can heal, we are still not the church. Do all speak in tongues and interpret? Even if every one of us speaks in tongues and interprets, it is still not the church. "Are all..?" means in the Lord's mind "not all," for there should be apostles, teachers, those who help others, those who administrate, etc. When all these various types of functions are put together, then there is the church.</p><p>We are perplexed that there are many brothers who prefer only one kind of work. Some brothers simply think that the work they have is the most important. If every brother is a healing brother (and there are such so-called "churches" in America), then the apostles, prophets, and teachers are all useless. Therefore, the places that bear the responsibility of the church must let those who are prophets have the opportunity to prophesy, those who are teachers the opportunity to teach, those who have the gift of healing the opportunity to heal, those who speak in tongues the opportunity to speak in tongues, and those who administrate the opportunity to administrate. As far as the work is concerned, the church should not restrict any brother or sister. This is the church. Otherwise, it is a sect, not the church. If we do not give the brothers and sisters an opportunity to serve, they will seek another way.</p><p>If the young brothers have a mixture of the flesh, we can only exercise authority to deal with them. The Lord has absolutely no intention that those with one talent should bury their talent. In the Lord's sight, the greatest gift is but five talents and the least is one talent. If the church would put all the one talents into use, it would make up for several of the five talents. If only a few of us are working, the church cannot be strong. This does not mean that the one-talented members who have just recently believed in the Lord will not have some fleshly acts. In many respects we must make them listen and obey; nevertheless, we still have to use them. In dealing with the flesh, we should never deal with the gift. All the brothers who are workers, those who are leaders in the churches, must let every brother have the opportunity to serve. The gifts recorded in Romans 12 are more complicated than those in 1 Corinthians. Prophesying, serving, teaching, exhorting, and giving are all included. When all those of one talent have the opportunity to manifest their gifts, sects cannot appear.</p><p>Ephesians 4 has similar words. Verses 11 and 12 say, "And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ." These verses also show us that the gifts are not the same. Verse 16 says, "Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love." God's thought here is that the Body of Christ can be built up only when all the members function. If all the brothers and sisters are not serving, the Body of Christ cannot be built up. The leading brothers in every place must remember that if they are busy while the brothers and sisters are not, then they are failing greatly. We should never think that because we are doing so much that this is good enough. If we can lead other brothers and sisters to work, let me tell you, this will please the Lord. It will please the Lord more if we lead the other brothers and sisters to work more than us.</p><p>This is really a matter of how you view yourself. If you think that you can build up the Body of Christ by doing well on your own, then you will simply go on as before. But if you have the vision, you will see that the affairs of the church cannot be managed by yourself alone. At the most, you are but one member of the church. Every member in the Body of Christ has his own work. If you bring each one into the work, then you have touched what is called the Body of Christ. You must see that you cannot replace the brothers and sisters. You absolutely cannot work in their place. No matter how perfect you are, how good you are in your work, or how great are your gifts, you are still not the church if you cannot bring the brothers and sisters into the work. Are all hands? A thousand hands or a hundred hands are a monster, not the body.</p><p>I would also go one step further and ask, Is there only one hand? We cannot say that only we can do a certain type of work. We must see that the Body of Christ includes much more than us alone. Everyone can receive grace directly from the Head, not necessarily through us. The Lord's grace always amazes me. How great is His grace! Since the Lord is gracious, He can cause others to receive grace apart from me; He can cause them to receive the blessing of God without passing through me. In the church the Lord can raise up all kinds of workers. We have to bring all the brothers and sisters into the work. We must not make them be the same as us. If only a few brothers are serving in a certain place and the rest of the brothers and sisters cannot work, this is just about the same as the one-man service of the denominations. As one-man service is abominable before God, so is the service of only a few people. The service of the whole Body is what pleases God. God says that everyone must serve. When we bring everyone into the work, we will see that this is the church. This is the content of the church.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Having the Thought of a System</h2><p>Finally, we absolutely must not cherish any thought of having a system. We should not think for any reason that the truth and gospel of God only issue forth from our midst. Our intention is only to meet the people that God uses in every locality. We do not necessarily go to many places to lead others, because God has His own leading in every place. We just go to seek fellowship. We should never take the attitude that we are going to a certain locality to be a pastor. We should not form ourselves into a system. When I go to many places, I am going to seek fellowship. In addition to Elijah, there were also many prophets. There could be several thousand Elijahs in the same place standing on the same ground. They are our brothers, and they also see that we are their brothers.</p><p>Suppose a group of brothers has been communicating with each other in a certain locality and we begin in the same place and do not communicate with them. This clearly proves that we do not know the church. Suppose fifty brothers are standing on the ground of the church in a certain locality, and later, another fifty brothers in the same place become enlightened and clearly see the ground of the church. It is certain that these brothers will be together with the first group of brothers. By keeping the ground of locality, the problem of forming a system will not arise. When we are in a locality, we are not there for the establishment of a church of "our" system. Rather, we are for the establishment of the church in that locality. When we are in Chungking, we are the church in Chungking; when we are in Tsingtao, we are the church in Tsingtao. We are not the church of a certain system. We make a great mistake once we become the church of a certain system. Once we have the thought of forming a system, we immediately become a sect.</p><p>I would like to use Sian as an example. This is not a matter of name or of an organization. When the two meetings in Sian were combined, there was difficulty over who would become the leading ones, who would take the responsibility. In group A there were three leading brothers, and in group B there were also three leading brothers. Who would be the leading brothers? Leading ones are not determined by the length of time in the work of God, but by the measure of spiritual experience. The meeting of group A had a history of twenty years, and the meeting of group B had a history of only five months. But the experience of the leading brothers in group A was limited before the Lord, while the experience of the leading brothers in group B was of many years before the Lord. According to the world, when two groups blend together with one having met for twenty years and the other having met for only five months, the ones who take the lead should be those in the more established group. But God's Word does not say this. The leading ones must be those who have a longer history before the Lord, not those who have a longer history of meetings. Therefore, when the two meetings were combined, the leading brothers in group A should have let the leading brothers in group B take the lead. Being a leading brother is not determined by the qualification of a longer history of meetings. The position of the church is based upon time, but the standing of the leading brothers is not determined by the church in which they have been taking the lead. It all depends upon the amount of spiritual experience they have before the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Seeking the Brothers</h2><p>Today in Shanghai we must pay considerable attention to this matter. Certain brothers and sisters want to leave the denominations. If they have really seen that locality is the ground fixed by the Bible, they should not establish another meeting under any circumstances. For example, when I left the denominations, I did not think of myself as being the first who left the denominations. In my heart I hoped to meet others who had similarly left the denominations. If I were to leave the denominations in Shanghai, I definitely would go around to seek and inquire whether or not other brothers had also left the denominations. When I was about to leave the denominations thirty years ago in Foochow, I went around Foochow looking for brothers who had already left the denominations. Leaving the denominations did not make me the most wonderful Christian in the whole world. My first thought when I left was to seek brothers. Loving the brothers is part of our nature, and seeking the brothers is also part of our nature. We should be very happy to be together with those who seek the Lord with a pure heart.</p><p>Some brothers say that they have left the denominations, but they have more of an intention to set up a church than to leave the denominations. Therefore, they do not seek those who have already left the denominations. The aim of many is to establish their own church. Therefore, they do not feel the preciousness of other brothers who have also left the denominations. Those who truly have left will consider all the brothers who have also left as being lovable and precious. Thus, there are two kinds of people leaving the denominations: The first are those who truly leave the denominations; they seek to be with those who serve the Lord with a pure heart. The others are those who leave the denominations because they want to set up their own church. We can say this about those in Shanghai and also in Tsingtao, Peking, and even in the Northwest. In Shanghai it seems that we have been earlier than others. Today they do not seek us, but we have to seek them. They may have the problem of being in a system, but we should not have this problem. If we go today to Pingliang, Tiensui, or Dihua, we must be careful. The first thing we should do is not to set up a church but to seek the brothers.</p><p>If the first thing we do when we arrive at a new place is set up a church, we are committing the same mistake as some of the brothers whom we just mentioned in Shanghai. There is probably a group of brothers whose ground is not wrong and who are going in the right direction. We should not say that they are unfamiliar with the Bible. They are brothers whose ground is not wrong. At any rate, we have to seek the brothers until we are certain there is no one before we may have a new start. Often we can only join others; we cannot have a new start. Under no circumstances should we feel that joining others is shameful, but that setting up a church is glorious. If this is our thought, we can only blame ourselves that we were not born before the apostles. Many people like to set up churches. This is not a sign that they are spiritual but that they are fleshly.</p><p>Some young brothers who have just come out of the denominations may be able to lead others. Perhaps a brother was received last Saturday. He may have experienced much discipline in the Lord's hand. Once we have received him, we may have to listen to him on many matters because his personal maturity is not related to his denomination. Anyone who has real spiritual experience must be put in the right place. I hope that the Lord will set His way more and more clearly before the brothers and sisters so that all who truly love the Lord may walk therein.</p><p>Watchman<br />December 4, 1950</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS</h2><h2 class="head2">Practicing Having All Things<br />in Common (Peking)&mdash;<br />The First Step: Going Bankrupt Again</h2><p>After I returned to Peking, I fasted and prayed for one day with Brother Fang, Brother Xing, and Brother Sun. We wept loudly and felt very ashamed that we had not attained to the will of the Father.</p><p>Before the Lord, we carefully considered having all things in common. We all felt that we would not be able to get through inwardly if we did not practice this. Therefore, a few of us brothers began to practice having all things in common. Before we began this practice, our first step was to go bankrupt again. We pulled everything out and piled it together. From this time onward, nothing was our own. On their lists the brothers did not just write down their clothes; they also wrote down the words "willing to be poor." The brothers all felt very joyful and released.</p><p>At the end of 1950, the entire church had a time of fellowship. Almost ninety percent of the entire group attended, and there were eleven hundred people. (There will be a baptism meeting soon.) There were so many people sitting in the meeting hall on Kuan Street that no one could pass through, and the yard was also filled with people. If the Lord grants us to double or triple our number again in 1951, we do not know where we will meet. These days we are expending all our energy to find a larger meeting place, but we have still not been successful. We are really worried about the numbers increasing and not having a place to meet.</p><p>There are now eight separate halls for meetings. All are full of people. The houses are too small and do not have enough seats. If more people come, we will not be able to contain them in the present halls. By the Lord's mercy, we are quickly preparing to add up to seven more halls to resolve our present problem.</p><p>Two weeks ago the brothers from Shijiazhuang, Changjiakou, Datong, Taiyuan, Taigu, Suiyuan, Baotou, and Shanba came to stay in Peking. The Lord's presence was really in our meetings. We particularly mentioned the matter of migrating for the gospel, and everyone felt the same sense of urgency. We are making arrangements for such important matters, so we sent one brother to Changjiakou with the brothers who came from there. This brother returned to Peking a day ago and made a detailed report of everything.</p><p>Brother Chao Xu-dong said that Shanba could send a score or more in migration to Ningsia. Peking is also preparing to send some out to migrate. It is 720 miles from Shanba to Baotou on the east. It is 620 miles from Shanba to Ningsia, but the tickets from Shanba to Ningsia are more expensive. The capital of Ningsia is Yinchuan City with a population of over a hundred thousand.</p><p>In the past we have emphasized the importance of the brothers and sisters having skills, so some of the brothers and sisters have been learning them. Since my return to Peking, we have started to encourage every brother and sister to learn a skill whether or not they stay in Peking or migrate.</p><p>We have recently sent Brother Fang to visit the brothers in Fengtai. Brother Xing and Brother Chiao went to Lungchuanwu. Brother Sun went to Changxingdien. Brother Chao Xu-dang went to Shijiazhuang. In the future, Brother Sun will go to Baoding with Brother Chao. If it pleases the Lord, this year we will start churches in Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Chengde of Reho province, and Tungxian, east of Peking. Our desire and prayer is that 1951 would be our year of blessing.</p><p>May the Lord gain brothers with a heart to seek Him in this way. We are heavily burdened for this. Therefore, we want to do our best to gain all those with a heart for this way who live in the provinces of this region. We often seek fellowship with these people in Peking. Thank the Lord that Brother Wang Jian-xiao of Shansi (who has believed in the Lord for thirteen years and has been imprisoned eighteen times) and Brother Yi have come to Peking to have formal fellowship with us. Moreover, they stayed with us. There are more than five hundred brothers and sisters in the two areas from which they came. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would not fall behind by even one step.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Caleb Yen<br />January 12, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Six Villages (Rongho)</h2><p>We had a conference in Peizhuang of Rongho for seven days beginning on December 28, 1950. We invited a total of fourteen brothers and sisters from Yitang of Linjin to come preach His gospel in one accord with us. The nature and general information concerning the meetings were as follows: There was a prayer meeting in the early morning, an edification meeting in the late morning, and preaching the gospel in the neighboring towns in the afternoon. We went to six villages in seven evenings. Four hundred forty people repented and believed in the Lord. This was the power of God. We hope that you will praise the Lord with us when you read this letter. We had a three-day conference in Rongho immediately following the seven-day conference. God was very merciful and heard our pleas. He established His testimony (table) with forty-one brothers and sisters who break bread together. We hope you also will offer up thanks and praise for this matter.</p><p>Pei Fu-min, Sun Wen-yuan, Hsueh Shao-yi, and Lin De-ching<br />January 8, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Back from Sian (In a Fellowship Meeting)</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Jeremiah 10:23 says, "I know, O Jehovah,/That a man's way is not in himself;/It is not in the man who walks/To direct his step." We experienced this verse when we went out this time. According to ourselves, we never planned to make this trip. However, a man's way is not in himself; it is not in the man who walks to direct his steps. We cannot direct anything; everything is God's arrangement.</p><p>We went out because the church in Sian had a need and invited us to help them solve a problem. Before the Lord, we felt that this was very serious, and we earnestly prayed, "Lord, how do we handle this great matter? Lord, go with us, and may we bring Your blessing." We prayed, but we did not have the assurance. Brother Yu also said this. We went without the assurance.</p><p>We left on June 29 and arrived in Hsuchow on the 30th. We stayed there for three days and had a few meetings. We went to Chengchow on July 3. We arrived in Sian on the 5th, which was a Thursday. There was an edification meeting for new believers, and they wanted us to speak. Brother Yu spoke something.</p><p>There was a fellowship meeting on Saturday. We wanted to see their condition and had not planned to speak anything. Therefore, at the meeting time we were waiting for them, and they were waiting for us. Then I was moved inwardly and felt that I should speak something about the attitude of the meeting. Just as I was about to stand up, Brother Yu stood up and spoke about "the attitude of the meeting." I marveled in my heart, for I had never had such a clear experience in my entire life. Brother Yu spoke on the inward aspect, and after he had finished speaking, I continued to speak something about the outward aspect. The condition of the meeting that evening was very good. Some of the brothers from Sian were able to testify. From that evening, we began to believe that the Lord Himself would work.</p><p>After two weeks of meeting, the difficulties had almost been resolved. When the conference was almost over, Lanchow sent us a letter inviting us to come. We did not make any decision. We prayed before God that we would go if He would make the arrangements (namely a car). Just as the conference was over, some brothers from Lanchow drove two cars to fill with cargo, and they wanted us to ride back with them. We felt that it was God's arrangement, so we did not refuse. We left on August 4 and arrived in Pingliang on the fifth. There were meetings for two days. We left Pingliang on the ninth and arrived in Lanchow on the tenth.</p><p>There was a two-week conference in Lanchow. After the conference, we were preparing to return to Pingliang. At the same time, the church in Pingliang sent a brother and sister to bring us back, but we did not have the inward peace to return to Pingliang. Although many things would have been convenient if we returned to Pingliang, there was an inward forbidding. After a few days, a telegram from Tiensui came inviting us to go there. Brother Yu asked me how I felt. I said that outwardly I was not willing to go, but inwardly I felt that I would not have the peace if I did not go. Brother Yu said, "I have the same feeling." Therefore, we could only set Pingliang aside and go to Tiensui.</p><p>We arrived in Tiensui on August 13. There was a week-long conference here, and the Lord did a marvelous work.</p><p>On September 10, we arrived in Mei County. We had a one-week conference in Mei County, during which we met in a cave. Those brothers are very good and pure. After going to Mei County, the brothers in Pingyuan province earnestly invited us to go there.</p><p>We left Mei County to return to Sian on September 18. On the train Brother Yu told me that he knew something was going to happen that day. This is what happened. As we were crossing a river, the donkeys we were riding fell and we fell off. Fortunately, we fell on to the sand.</p><p>When we arrived at the train station, we inwardly felt that it was not right to go to Pingyuan province because we had not thoroughly sought the Lord. We could only tell them that we could not go to Pingyuan. It seemed as though we had dumped a pan of cold water on them. But because we were forbidden inwardly, we could only return to Sian.</p><p>On September 25 we left Sian and arrived in Linjin on the twenty-eighth. There we had a one-week conference. The meetings were very good.</p><p>We arrived in Zhenzhou on October 4. We had not said that there would be a conference when we returned to Zhenzhou, but more than eighty brothers and sisters came from Pingyuan and Honan provinces. The meeting hall could only accommodate about ten people, so we really could not handle them. Since we could not have a conference in Zhenzhou, we had to ask them to go back. We said that if anyone wanted to come to Hsuchow, they could go with us. We said that we could take twenty people at the most, because the meeting hall in Hsuchow was also small, and there was a problem with hospitality. But to our surprise, the brothers in Hsuchow did a good job with the hospitality. There was a one-week conference in Hsuchow. Then a telegram from Nanking invited us there, and some brothers from Tsinan came to invite us. Since Brother Yu had promised the brothers in Tsinan earlier that we would go there if we had the opportunity, we could not refuse, and we were not forbidden inwardly. Therefore, we left Hsuchow on October 13 and arrived in Tsinan that afternoon. While we were in Tsinan, the church in Tsingtao also sent brothers to invite us. Outwardly, we were exhausted. Then we were dealt with before the Lord. If the Lord really wanted to go, we were willing to go. When we put everything aside, we saw clearly that we were right in not going. As a result, the brothers who had come for us were willing to put everything aside as we had.</p><p>We left Tsinan on October 20 and arrived in Shanghai the next day. On this trip we really saw that a man's way is not in himself and it is not in the man who walks to direct his steps.&mdash;Chu Chen</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>When we went out this time, we felt that we learned something on the way and in each assembly. I will now tell you about it briefly. As Brother Chu mentioned, we did not have any assurance when we left. In the few days before we left, we prayed before the Lord that if He would not work, we had no way. We were preparing to go to Sian to fail.</p><p>But once we arrived in Sian, we began to inwardly feel and gradually see clearly that the Lord had already worked there. Because the Lord already had worked, matters were easily taken care of.</p><p>We arrived in Sian on Thursday. The scheduled meeting for Saturday was a fellowship meeting. We originally did not prepare to speak anything, but wanted to let the brothers from Sian meet according to their usual custom. We waited for a long time, and it seemed that the brothers were waiting for us to speak. At that time I felt that I had something to say. After I spoke, Brother Chu had the same word to give. This proved that the Lord had given us the same leading and that we clearly had the Lord's presence.</p><p>We formally began the conference on the following Monday. We had originally prepared to answer the brothers' questions, but that evening I had something inside me so I did not do what I had promised. I spoke on a special topic: "The Spirit of Goodness." The Lord clearly taught me something concerning this matter; that is, before God can require one of His servants to preach a message, He must first cause him to pay attention to this matter or learn this lesson. During this past year, there is something that has occupied me, that I have felt is important, heavy, and weighty. This matter is called "the Spirit of Goodness." This Spirit is nothing less than what the Lord expressed while He was being crucified, when He said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34). Do you see? Those people wanted to take the Lord's life, they wanted to crucify Him, and He wanted to save them. This is such a Spirit! You may say that the Lord was "not righteous" in doing this. Yes, this is the other extreme of "unrighteousness." It is the "unrighteousness" that wrongs oneself. This is really the "all-surpassing" righteousness. It only cares for loving and saving others, but does not care for itself. There is only love and goodness in the Lord. It did not matter how the other parties treated Him; His reaction was completely loving and completely good. There was absolutely no evil thought or desire for revenge. One cannot find anything in Him that was harmful to the other parties. He was completely good from the inside to the outside. I say that this is the Spirit of Goodness. Whatever comes out of it is all good.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one pays much attention to this matter today. Among Christians, when problems arise between us, we deal with each other and confess our sins to each other. After we have confessed our sins and everything seems peaceful, our conscience does not bother us; we are comfortable within. On the one hand, I would say that it is good to be like this. Confessing our sins to one another certainly is good Christian behavior, but I am afraid that in doing this we are merely "bribing our conscience" and are not truly forgiving and loving one another from the deepest part of our spirit. This is not spiritual enough; it is not genuine enough. It only touches our conscience but does not get into our spirit. You can test yourself to see. If something bad happens to the other party, do you immediately rejoice in his misfortune in your thoughts? This is because inwardly you do not have love for the brother who offended you. You have only dealt with him in your conscience, but you have not done anything out of the Spirit of Goodness, so it does not work.</p><p>Among the brothers in Sian there were problems and barriers, but outwardly it appeared that there was nothing wrong. Inwardly, however, they all really had problems. When I saw what was wrong, I felt that if the brothers were to deal with these matters, they needed to deal with them to the extent of the Spirit. Just dealing with them in the conscience would not be sufficient.</p><p>Therefore, I spoke this message among them that evening, then I had some private fellowship with the individual brothers later. The fellowship proved that I needed to speak that message that evening because that was exactly their need. (So I said that before God can require His servant to do something, He must first cause His servant to learn the lesson. Then His servant will be able to supply others.)</p><p>Thank the Lord. In the beginning, the Lord caused us to seek two ways to deal with the problem in Sian. The first was the spiritual way (which was the Spirit of Goodness), and the second was practical.</p><p>We decisively told them that, practically, the table which had been established first had the position of being the table of the church in Sian. We questioned the brothers from both sides to discover their histories. We also took detailed notes and proceeded according to this principle. We told them that it would be best if they were willing to submit because the brothers would all be blessed. If the brothers were not willing to submit, matters would still be dealt with in this way. The principle would not be changed. Thank God for the result. The brothers all submitted before God. We can say that the matter was resolved without difficulty. We were really surprised that this situation was resolved in just two weeks time. This was all done by God Himself. We were only harvesting the fruits that God had already gained. Glory to the Lord's name.</p><p>With regard to the matter of being led, we were very much in one accord. We both put ourselves aside. In the matter of going to Tiensui, we both wanted to go back to Pingliang, but inwardly we felt that it was right to go to Tiensui. Brother Chu's condition was the same as mine. Once we arrived in Tiensui, we heard them say that they had prayed with assurance and knew that we would come to Tiensui. I told them that we were there through their prayer.</p><p>Two of us went together on this trip. In the past co-workers went out alone, but the Lord's ordination is to go two by two. This trip really confirmed that the Lord's ordination is the best, because two people can discuss matters and receive the leading together. When one person is tired, the other can speak for him. They can help each other, look after one another, and since each has learned his own lessons, the churches can be helped in several areas. I believe that going out two by two is better than going out as isolated individuals.</p><p>The meetings in the villages like Mei County and Linjin have really learned the lessons and are in a good condition before the Lord, despite the fact that though many among them can read, few are very knowledgeable. They deal with matters appropriately and are very practical and genuine in their dealings with others. They gave us a very good impression. Unfortunately, the co-workers do not visit them often, so they must rely on the supply of the written publications. They keep each and every one of the books we publish.</p><p>Along the way, we encountered dangers crossing rivers and traveling the roads, which gave us some understanding of Paul's experience.&mdash;Yu Cheng-hua</p><p>November 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Hoping for the Opportunity of the Third Session (Lanchow)</h2><p>Since receiving the material for the edification of new believers which you sent me, not only have the brothers and sisters who are new believers been edified greatly, but the brothers and sisters who believed long ago feel as if they have been well-fed and satisfied as well. I personally am overjoyed every time I read these materials. It is as if the ointment on Aaron's head already has flowed down to such a worthless member as myself. I want to sing, "Hallelujah." I want to seize the opportunity of the third session. May the Lord have mercy on me that the day would come soon when I would be able to follow at your heels and receive the word you receive from God directly from your mouth. May I touch God's heart and be completely edified, until this weak, old, useless member coordinates in the Body in his few remaining days. May we strive together that the spread of the gospel in the northwestern wilderness might be completed soon.</p><p>If the Lord wills, Brother Yin-hsin and I may take a trip west to visit the churches because Shiahe and Dihua have called several times asking us. Please pray for us.</p><p>Your brother,<br />John Lee<br />November 14, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Supplying One Another (Zhengzhow)</h2><p>For these many years (I have been saved for seven years now), I have been groping in the darkness, unable to find the way and suffering greatly. In God's light I have seen that I am not a person with a stable foundation. If I had met with great temptation, I would have fallen long ago. My life is not only immature, but my knowledge of the truth for the edification of new believers is fragmented as well. I have not touched the central matters, and there are many things that I simply do not know. I am not the only one in this condition; all the brothers and sisters in Zhengzhow are like this.</p><p>The brothers and sisters in Zhengzhow began serving the Lord in 1948. At that time, the brothers and sisters who came from Anyang and Tangyin met together. Brother Pu, who had learned something more in the Lord, was helping them a little. In 1949 Brother Pu returned home, and I began to visit them frequently so that we could supply one another.</p><p>Finally, I beg the Lord to give you a burden to pray for us much and to send us letters frequently according to the Lord's leading. We hope even more that you could come here once to help us.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Lee Xi-chen<br />October 11, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">May the Lord Give Us More Tears (Changsha)</h2><p>The church here clearly sees the Lord's leading. There are fruits of the gospel. There was a baptism meeting on the tenth of this month in which seven brothers and sisters testified concerning the Lord. One of the sisters was clearly saved a few days before the meeting, and one of the brothers was my father. The number of people breaking bread has already increased to more than thirty. In the fellowship meetings, the testimonies of the brothers supplied us. The Spirit of the Lord is clearly working in each meeting. After passing through loneliness and desolation in the past, we finally see the Lord working here today. We thank the Lord. "Those who sow in tears/Will reap with a ringing shout." May the Lord give us more tears.</p><p>There are more than ten fellowship groups in the schools in Changsha. Their condition is very good. There are zealous brothers and sisters among them who hope to receive some supply. Sometimes they invite us to speak to them. They are seeking to know the truth and the Lord's straight way. They took the initiative to come fellowship with us. When we saw their situation, we could only ask the Lord to give them the same grace. "O Lord! Remember us who have Your way in this generation!"</p><p>Because the church has been raised up somewhat, the work has become a little heavier, and my own poverty and pitifulness have been exposed. "O Lord! How do I lead Your recently saved children? What do I use to feed those who are hungry and thirsty for you? O Lord! Grace Your own church and remember the desire of Your children. Break my pitiful self. May Your life come out to heal the wounds of others!" O brothers! Remember us often so that in our groping we would find the proper way.</p><p>We have already started a meeting to edify the new believers (Thursday evenings); Brother Chin and I are temporarily taking turns bearing the responsibility. We have already spoken about "Selling All." Some of the word left us in fear and trembling! O Lord! May we not touch Your word loosely.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chang Fang-zheng<br />October 23, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Past Nine Months (Hsugou)</h2><p>The Lord has especially led us to leave the denominations. Over the past nine months we have seen something of the Lord's goal and plan as well as His requirements for us. We really cannot keep up; we can only prostrate ourselves in worship to Him and rely on Him to walk in the way set before us. We ask the brothers to pray much for us. The brothers and sisters here desperately need the edification for new believers. Because we have not had sufficient learning and spiritual pursuit, we really have no way. We hope you will lead us.</p><p>Du Chung-sheng, Kuo Ling-run, Dong Chun-mao,<br />Chang Peng-ze<br />December 12, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Beginning to Learn to Take the Lord's Way (Chingyuan)</h2><p>After hearing the truth concerning the church and the sin of denominations in 1948, we went to Taiyuan to fellowship with the brothers. After a period of study, we began to meet in the Lord's name at Brother Kuo's house in 1949. Although we are immature, the Lord has had mercy on us. In His good time He led our dear brothers, Kuo Jun-bao and Chiu Ai-lu, to come into our midst this spring. After a three-day conference, our standing was strengthened and some brothers turned from the denominations. Since then, our meetings have been stronger, and we have begun to preach the gospel. In September the Lord led these two brothers here for another three-day conference. Even more brothers and sisters turned from the denominations. On the morning of October 1 (the Lord's Day), we baptized thirteen brothers and sisters. That afternoon we began to meet to break bread in the Lord's name. There were seven brothers and twenty-nine sisters for a total of thirty-six. There were also six other brothers from other localities who had come to visit. Oh, we can only prostrate ourselves in worship! We are beginning to learn to take the Lord's way, and we need your supply and prayers very much so that the Lord would have more of a way among us.</p><p>Kuo Ying-nan, Cao Ling<br />October 2, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Produced by the Skylight in the Ark (Penglai)</h2><p>We recently received The Open Door, and after reading it our hearts began to leap, and our spirits were greatly stirred up. We really thank the Lord. The situation in Penglai has been smothered by two denominations for many years. In 1931 three brothers and I saw that the denominations were not according to God's desire, and we boldly withdrew from them. At that time we met and worshipped every day. Although we were taunted very much, the Lord was victorious. Thank Him. Over the past ten years or more, we have preached the gospel and edified others. We have increased from three or four to eighty-nine people. Some have turned this way from the denominations, but most are young brothers and sisters who were raised up by the Lord through sufferings in the last few years. (There are more sisters than brothers.) Thank the Lord, this was all produced by the skylight in the ark.</p><p>We earnestly desire to have the table meeting to remember the Lord in Penglai. We also hope that the churches in other localities would fellowship with us, but we do not know how to carry this out. Please remember us much in your prayers.</p><p>Your weak brother,<br />Liu Yen-zhou<br />October 26, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">It Was Given by Him (Shenyang)</h2><p>After a conference with Brother Fang Ai-guang from Peking, we established the Lord's table on January 29 of this year. There were more than forty brothers and sisters. We preached the gospel during the first month of the lunar calendar, and the Lord gradually has added the saved ones to the church. There were two baptism meetings in April and in June. We added fifty-four newly saved brothers and sisters. With the addition of the brothers and sisters who migrated to Shenyang from other localities, we now have one hundred twenty people. There was only one room in our old meeting hall on Minzhu Road in the Hoping District. We experienced great difficulties with every meeting and dared not expand the gospel work. Consequently, all the brothers and sisters cried constantly to the Lord and begged Him to meet the need. The church began to pray on December 13 of last year. We saw the Lord accomplish the matter of a meeting place on July 20 of this year. What He has given us is far greater than what we asked or thought. We moved into the new meeting hall and began the meetings there on the twenty-second of this month (the Lord's Day).</p><p>The brothers and sisters do not have much financial supply; many brothers are unemployed and have problems making a living. Because the Lord's gospel could not be preached and sinners could not be saved, we still earnestly beseeched the ever-living God. He heard the prayers of the church and finally showed us His glory. All the obstacles were broken through. When we remembered the Lord for the first time in the new meeting hall on the twenty-second (the Lord's Day), all the brothers and sisters were happy and rejoicing. We could not refrain from dancing, shouting thanks, weeping, and praising because we saw that the Lord has performed a miracle in Shenyang! We were all in an inexpressible, indescribable condition. There was a gospel meeting on the Lord's Day morning. The brothers and sisters all served in one accord. Those who brought new ones brought many; those who cared for people really cared. The place was nearly full. When we drew the net, forty-six people left their names. Since May we have recorded the names of more than two hundred people who are interested in the gospel.</p><p>In the matter of service, we have made some arrangements concerning visitation and making up the new believer edification lessons. We are seeing the Lord's blessing. Many of the brothers and sisters have given themselves to the Lord with tears. They have given their whole lives and do not want to go out free. They are willing and happy to serve. But the work ahead and the needs on all sides are too many and too great. We are immature and shallow in life; we cannot bear this burden. Since the Lord has made this arrangement, we can only prostrate ourselves, looking to Him for mercy so that He would lead us in the way before us. We hope that all the brothers and sisters would remember us before the Lord and pray for us.</p><p>From the brothers in Shenyang,<br />Ren Li-ping, Shan Jing-zhou, Shen Yu-shi, and Kuan Yu-nong<br />October 31, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord's Grace Was Greater than Our Capacity</h2><p>After arriving in Ch'ang-ch'un, we prayed for a period of time. We are in a wilderness area, and the Lord has placed us small and weak ones here. We have no other way but to kneel before Him. Recently, the Lord has shown us that He is the Lord of the work. He is the One who opens a highway in the wilderness. He is the One who brings the rivers to the deserts. He operates in the church to accomplish His work. Therefore, we did not look at our smallness but went to Dalian and Shenyang to prostrate ourselves before God with the brothers and sisters so that He would give us a new vision and leading. Through the fellowship of the Body, we communicated with the entire church what we had seen and touched in the Holy Spirit. We asked the Lord to give us more so that we could serve all God's children. We have no other way but to humbly look to God to take us on each step of the way. We hope to encounter God's power more in the work. The Lord is also leading us to live in faith by His faithfulness.</p><p>Concerning the conferences in Dalian and Shenyang, the Lord's grace was greater than our capacity. At Shenyang brothers and sisters came from more than ten other localities. Sister Kang gave the sisters some leading. After the meetings we helped them coordinate together; this built up the service of the entire Body. Once the church has been graced, it must continue with the proper service. Otherwise, it will appear as if it has run out of the proper vessels to contain the grace. May our arrangements all be according to the Lord's desire.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Hua Tien-min and Xing Zuo-hsin<br />December 8, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Meetings Are Looking Up (Mei County)</h2><p>Through eight fellowship meetings in Mei County concerning the church service and the way of the gospel, the brothers have gained the benefit and have been revived. We should give glory to the Lord. Last Lord's Day (November 5), we preached the gospel in two separate places, and it was especially good. The brothers were extremely zealous. This week there were two gospel times in which we recorded the names of twenty-six believers. We are now increasing our visiting. If the Lord gives us grace, we will soon have a baptism meeting. We have divided into three homes for the prayer meeting. By the Lord's mercy, the three home prayer meetings have been very living recently. The other meetings are looking up as well. The newly saved brothers and almost all of those who have fallen have turned back. We can only thank the Lord. We began work on the meeting hall yesterday. We have estimates of the costs. It should hold between three and five hundred people. It will cost around eight or nine million. We can only ask the Lord to prepare it.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Jia Xiu-gi, Lee Feng-xiang, Liu Chao-ren, and Hao Yung-en<br />November 15, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">I Have Circled in the Wilderness Long Enough<br />(Charhar Province)</h2><p>I am weak and useless; it has been ten years since I left you. As I look back over this portion of the way, I can say nothing. I am ashamed and embarrassed at forgetting the Lord's grace and going against righteousness. Although there have been a few times during this period when I have been stirred up to make a resolve, they were useless in the end. Although I have continued to pray and read the Bible, I have not had any new light or gain. In summary, I can only say that when one leaves the Lord, one can only sin; when one leaves the Body, one is even more impotent. I am a lonely, pitiful member who is not worthy to fellowship with you, but I have not forgotten you and the dear, estimable brothers and sisters in Shanghai, especially Brother Nee. I will never forget what I received from him and the help I got from all the brothers and sisters. Sometimes I have wanted to write you a letter to ask for your news, but I felt as if I had somehow offended you and I stopped myself from writing. Today I deeply feel that I have circled in the wilderness too long. I will not and dare not fall any further. I hope that this is not an activity of the flesh or an expression of the emotions, but that the Lord has had mercy on this worm that I am. I really am worse than a dead dog.</p><p>After leaving Shanghai and returning to Shacheng, I announced immediately that I was leaving the denominations. At that time there were a few brothers who met together to serve the Lord, but because the flesh had not been dealt with enough, the result was a house built on sand. Later, I moved back to my home town and used medicine to serve the sick in the village. I also did some farming and learned the skill of knitting to maintain my livelihood. I am now formally practicing medicine. In my family of seven, we see the Lord's grace everywhere. There used to be a few sisters who met with us, but they have now moved to other places, and we only worship as a family (on the Lord's Day). As I reach this point in my writing, I can only shed tears of deep-felt remorse that I have not done anything for the Lord! I have often thought that I am merely waiting for the wedding feast (perhaps I will not have a portion?). Oh, may the Lord have mercy! Brother, please remember the cries of this weak one in the poor, remote countryside.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Pei Han-zao<br />December 28, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Longing in Bangkok</h2><p>There are more than ten brothers and sisters in Bangkok, but we still do not have the Lord's table. We only have a prayer meeting every Lord's Day morning. We have now built a meeting hall that can seat two hundred to prepare for the Lord's work. The brothers and sisters are all burning and hoping that the Lord would send some here to work and lead us. We also hope that the brothers and sisters in other localities would pray for us.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lin Zong-hai<br />November 11, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Hoping That the Lord<br />Would First Gain Me and Us (Xiangcheng)</h2><p>In the twenty-first issue of The Open Door I read that the Lord had touched you about gaining several spiritual groups into the church. I feel that this is really right. I will briefly state my thoughts below.</p><p>I was baptized into the Lord by Brother Wu Chung-san in Lushan County of this province in 1941. I was also shepherded by Brother Hao Ping-ru for a period of time. In 1949 I returned to Xiangcheng from Nanking. (I studied for two years at Ling Xiu Seminary in Ningbo.)</p><p>I do not feel that I can trust myself in the light of the truth, and I am even more afraid of leading others astray. If the Lord allows, I hope "to grasp the opportunity," so that He would first gain myself and then us.</p><p>In August 1948 (I was not home), the brothers in Beiguan invited an evangelist from the China Inland Mission in Nanguan to come preach for a week. Another brother offered up his house, and the worship began. After the work of the China Inland Mission stopped, the assembly in Nanguan established itself independently and has become self-supporting. After the gospel work in the spring of this year, thirty-three people were baptized. There are now forty-five who attend the Lord's table meeting.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Kuo Shou-shan<br />September 24, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">He Had Mercy on Us (Yuyao)</h2><p>We have felt that we should begin to have prayer meetings in Yuyao for some time. In February 1949 Brother Huang Xun-min met together with us to pray in a sister's house. The work was not very prevailing because we did not have enough light and our flesh was weak. Brother Huang left Yuyao later, and we were even more isolated. We could only look to God to make a way for us and to give us brothers and sisters with the same heart. Thank God that last fall he gave us a brother, Pan Wen-jun, and a sister, Yen Wen-chin, who are in one accord. At the same time, we learned that churches had been started in Ningpo and the surrounding localities. This made us very happy. Therefore, we had a gospel meeting on the following Lord's Day afternoon. Although there were not many people, we saw that some were willing to receive the Lord. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings we have prayer, Bible study, and hymn-singing meetings. Praise God for having mercy on us despite our laziness and weakness. From now on we hope that God will lead us more in His will, and we also hope that the brothers and sisters everywhere will pray much for us so that we would be strong to work for the Lord.</p><p>Pan Wen-jun, Lou Shang-kuan, and Lu Cheng-hsien<br />January 9, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Going On in the Light of the Lord's Grace<br />(Kweilin)</h2><p>The church in Kweilin was led by the Lord to rent a meeting place on Sanhu Road. This was a piece of empty land in front of a brother's house. We built a hall there that can seat about a hundred twenty people. We finished it and moved in on May 8, 1949. The Lord gave us enough to pay for the labor, materials, and furniture. Thank the Lord.</p><p>Since the meeting hall was finished by grace, all of our service has been going on in the light of the Lord's grace.</p><p>The greatest lack in the church in Kweilin was leading ones. After the meeting hall was finished, the brothers and sisters prayed desperately that the Lord would send a useful person to lead us. Less than one month after the meeting hall was finished, the Lord sent His servant, our brother, Hou Sung-san, to Kweilin. He is mainly responsible for the work of giving messages. Thank the Lord.</p><p>There is a prayer meeting here every Thursday evening and a fellowship meeting every Saturday. We preach a message or the gospel every Lord's Day morning and have the Lord's table in the evening.</p><p>We had a seven-day conference in May 1950. The Lord released messages concerning being filled with the Holy Spirit through His servant Hou Sung-san. Many brothers and sisters received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and manifested the greatness of God. Glory to the Lord's name.</p><p>In 1949 we had three times of extensive gospel outreach. One time we passed out gospel tracts door-to-door to every house in the city of Kweilin. Thank God! The Holy Spirit did His work, and more than three hundred people repented and confessed the Lord's name. Fifty-nine were clearly saved and baptized into the Lord. This year we preached the gospel and nineteen people were baptized into the Lord. We baptized them in the river outside the Dingkweimen, and there were many spectators.</p><p>Some of the brothers and sisters have lost their jobs and are having difficulties making a living. We have organized a "Canaan Tofu Factory" that makes soybean milk each day and delivers it to government offices, schools, hospitals, and individual homes as they place orders. We also make tofu. Our pig-raising business is organized by Sister Chang Zhi-ping. She has accepted some of the unemployed brothers and sisters and given them a salary to live on. Although our factory is small, it does a good business.</p><p>We began the edification meetings for new believers this year. We divided them into Monday and Wednesday night groups because there were not enough to lead the meetings and many would have had to miss the meetings if there was only one meeting. One evening is for the younger ones who are able to take notes, and the other evening is for the older ones and those who do not read very well.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Lee Yuan-shan and<br />Hsieh Chang-san<br />January 9, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">God Did Not Treat Us Poorly (Dalian)</h2><p>Your brothers and sisters in Dalian prayed for over half a year crying out that God's servants would come help us. Thank God! When He led His believers to go positively in the way of the church, He did not treat us poorly. His servants Brother Hua Tien-min and Brother Xing Zuo-xin were sent from Ch'ang-ch'un to Dalian on October 23. They held a fifteen-day edification conference and showed us the light which the God of glory has given His church in this age.</p><p>Thanks and praise be to God! His move in the church came unexpectedly and spontaneously. Through this move we entered into the coordination of the whole Body. This is just like when God led the Israelites out of Egypt and the entire population boldly and enthusiastically served God.</p><p>It is truly marvelous! Once the service of the entire church is manifested, the gospel goes out. Immediately after the conference, there were five days of gospel meetings. As a result, a hundred fifty-four people confessed the Lord's name, and half of them were clearly saved. With the hundred and two brothers and sisters who broke bread with us originally, the total number of people in the meetings is now almost two hundred.</p><p>According to His rich mercy and love, God has granted us the grace of all the churches and has brought us into the way of the service of the entire Body. As we move forward to follow the footsteps of the flock, we would like to spread the news to all the churches. We ask you to place us in your prayers. May the fire of the love of the gospel burn more brightly here in Dalian!</p><p>Hung Fang-zhou, Yuan Zhu-wu, Fan Xin-sheng,<br />and Wang Xing-wu<br />December 24, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">A Deep Feeling of Shallowness (Yangzhou)</h2><p>Thank the Lord that He has remembered the supplications of the brothers and sisters everywhere and their care for Yangzhou. The Lord has heard and answered your prayers. On the morning of the Lord's Day, December 24, ten brothers and five sisters were baptized. The newly baptized brothers and sisters brought their opium pipes and gambling games and burned them with fire. The Lord was with us, and the brothers and sisters were filled with joy. On January 7, we established the Lord's table and began to break bread to remember the Lord. Forty-five brothers and sisters gathered around the Lord's feet. All were touched to the point of tears. We have touched the oneness and fellowship of the Lord's Body. The Lord is worthy of the glory.</p><p>As we begin to learn to serve the Lord, we have a deep feeling of shallowness. We would still ask all the brothers and sisters to continue praying for Yangzhou.</p><p>Hsu Tien-min, Lee Zhi-xuan, Liu Shi-an<br />January 12, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord Opened a Door for the Word (Shiwu)</h2><p>In March 1948, Brother Luh Zhong-xin came to Shiwu from Singapore, and the Lord opened a door for the word. We began to have meetings to break bread in my home in Shiwu. There were fewer than ten brothers and sisters. Over the last two years, the number of believers has increased daily. My house is too small to contain them all. Therefore, we began renting a one-story building for our meetings in April of this year. Presently, we have fifty to sixty people who meet regularly. On the twenty-eighth of last month, Brother Luh Zhong-xin came to Shiwu again, and the Lord used him greatly. He held two edification meetings a day for the believers, and he preached the gospel outdoors for ten days in a row in the afternoons. On October 10, Sister Huang Bi-gui came from Singapore to Shiwu and participated in the work. We were even more excited. Around fifty people were baptized. The conference was during the busiest time for the farmers, and many brothers and sisters were unable to attend. Last year the denominations in this locality attacked and fiercely opposed us. The Lord has done some work since, and most of them are clear about the truth. I am a teacher at the Zhonghua Elementary and Secondary School in this city. I am busy with my classes and cannot serve the church. I am indebted to the Lord; may He have mercy on me.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Yi-zhang<br />December 29, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Standing on the Ground of Locality (Pingyang)</h2><p>Through your labor, we have received six copies of The Open Door. They informed us of the situation of the work everywhere. We really thank the Lord unceasingly. Please delete the words Gaosha and Dong Keng from our mailing address. When we began subscribing to the paper, we had not yet left the denominations. We were meeting with the Gaosha China Inland Mission and the Dong Keng Independent Church. At that time we did not want to use the words China Inland Mission and Independent Church, so we only wrote Christian Meeting Hall. Please forgive us for this. In 1949 we began meeting on the local ground in Mabu. (Mabu is one or two miles from Gaosha and Dong Keng.)</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Yang Hua-yu<br />October 7, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Seeking Fellowship</h2><p>We have been meeting in the Lord's name for three years in Tingtou which is south of Foochow. We began to break bread to remember the Lord in March of this year. We are on the lower Min River, and we feel a lack of fellowship and supply. We hope the brothers in the Lord in other localities would provide us with the spiritual supply and pray for us.</p><p>Your brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen Fen-yu and Huang Jia-zou<br />September 26, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord Gave Grace (Zhengzhou)</h2><p>Thank God that He has given grace in Zhengzhou. Recently three brothers and sisters have seen the way to serve because of their humble and poor heart! We meet in Brother Lee Ren-pu's home. The Lord has begun working here, and our numbers are increasing gradually.</p><p>We are all immature, weak, and pitiful. We are little brothers who are unable to stand firmly. We need the prayers of all the churches. We also ask you to share with us the grace you have received from the Lord.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Lee Xi-chen and Lee Ren-pu<br />November 13, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">We Began Meeting in the Homes (Wenzhuang)</h2><p>We all live in villages. In 1941 there were meetings in Yangjiahe in this county. We remembered the Lord with the brothers there. In 1948 the brothers left for other places, so there have been no meetings to date. We are one or two miles from the city, and there are more than ten brothers and sisters here. We began meeting in the homes on November 16.</p><p>Wen Xu-jiu, Wen Yin-chiu, Chao Ching-wen<br />December 22, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Falling Down in the Light (Shanba)</h2><p>I was led by the Lord to leave Sian and return to Shanba on November 8. I stayed in Peking for more than ten days; then I spent six days in Guisui, thirteen days in Salachi, and seven days in Baotou. I have served a little in the churches in these localities. By the Lord's mercy, I understand a little of what it means to fall down in the light on the way to Damascus! In the past I have spoken, discussed, and prayed, but I did not know about this. I now understand something of the meaning of falling down. When we see the Lord, we fall, our views fall, our personality falls, our prejudice falls, our good judgment falls, our good criticism falls, our great zeal for the Lord falls, our work for the Lord falls, our thoughts fall, our spiritual haughtiness falls, our falseness falls, and our incorrectness falls; everything falls inwardly and outwardly! Only those who have fallen in this way can be used by the Lord and can coordinate in the Body to serve God. Only those who have fallen down in the light are in fear of their selves.</p><p>If the Lord allows, I will visit the brothers and sisters in the localities in western Suiyuan. I deeply feel that I am useless and unable to supply life to the brothers and sisters. Please remember me in your prayers.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chao Xu-dong<br />December 9, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Gospel Always Has a Way (Bangbu)</h2><p>The house we meet in has two rooms and can only contain about sixty people. They are now almost completely filled. We desperately need a larger meeting place. We are praying earnestly and hope to be able to get a place in a good location with quiet surroundings and room to seat more than two hundred fifty people. We also want a large yard to leave room for expansion. Great blessing cannot be brought in without a large vessel. But there are not many large houses in Bangbu. We look to God to give us the best arrangement according to the needs of the gospel.</p><p>Recently the brothers who are scattered throughout the northern regions of Anhwei (like Yinshang, Jieshou, Shouxian, Tienjiaan, and Zhengtang) have gradually begun to fellowship with us by letter. They really feel lonely. When they discovered that Bangbu had an assembly, they wanted to come here to meet. This is particularly true of the elderly brother, Yang Hua-cheng. After he returned to Yinshang, he testified of what he had received to the brothers in the China Inland Mission, and many were willing to fellowship with us. According to the geographical situation, it seems that God has measured the northern region of Anhwei province to us.</p><p>There have been three baptism meetings here, and with the original brothers there is now a total of more than sixty people. There are forty-five people who meet regularly. The Thursday night edification meeting is on what we have learned. We speak concerning basic matters, but we feel that our speaking is not focused enough, and we cannot grasp the central points.</p><p>Recently, we have clearly seen that the Lord has begun to work in Huaiyuan (especially in the Southeastern Medical College which moved from Shanghai). A few brothers and sisters from Bangbu and Shuxian passed their entrance examination, and now the college has twelve or thirteen brothers and sisters. They need a meeting, but they lack responsible ones and a place to meet. There are many saved people in the school's Christian fellowship group. A few have come to Bangbu to fellowship with us. They all have a heart to pursue the Lord and are suffering because they cannot find a spiritual supply. A sister is planning to move to Huaiyuan to start a soy milk factory. We have asked her to rent two more houses and begin prayer meetings. We are also willing to make some time to help them.</p><p>We have begun to apply the methods from the book Seen and Heard in the gospel meetings. We always ask a newly saved brother to give a testimony of his salvation. It is very effective. The Lord is constantly adding saved ones to us. Praise the Lord that His gospel has a way.</p><p>Han Zeng-wu, Shao Yi-ming, Shu Pei-zhi<br />October 13, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">From Changching to Tsinan</h2><p>The county seat of Changching is about seventy miles from Tsinan, and there are fifteen brothers and sisters who were baptized in Tsinan. Because transportation is inconvenient, we cannot often go to the meetings in Tsinan. Therefore, we have been meeting three times a week in our homes. (There are two prayer meetings and one fellowship meeting.) Every Lord's Day some of the brothers go to Tsinan for the Lord's table meeting. When there are conferences or some workers come to Tsinan, many of the brothers and sisters go there. This is our condition. We hope you will pray for us.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Han Lien-ru<br />December 30, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord Has Given Us Abundant Grace<br />(Tsinan)</h2><p>Thank the Lord for giving us abundant grace through Brother Yu and Brother Chu. The brothers and sisters all touched the way, and some of their difficulties were resolved. There was a baptism meeting on the eighth of this month, and a hundred seventeen brothers and sisters were baptized. Our hall was too small, and the Lord has prepared a large building that can seat eight hundred people. We have begun to fix it up, and we will move in when it is finished. The old address will still be a district meeting place. Please pray for the way ahead of us.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Liu-zhui<br />October 21, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">God's Mercy and Presence Every Time (Gaoduichun)</h2><p>Brother Yu Cheng-hua and Brother Chu-chen took a detour and spent five or six days here on their way back to Shanghai from the Northwest (Beiyangchun, Linjin). They preached the word twice on the Lord's Day in Yitang and had eight fellowship meetings in Beiyangchun. God's mercy and presence were there every time. They resolved the brothers' basic problems in life and removed the doubts and barriers along the way. The last message was on "The Spirit of Goodness." We saw how shallow we were, and were happy that through this message God had removed an abominable reef from the church's future.</p><p>We are in an extremely remote place, and we have very little fellowship with the other churches. It is even rarer for God's servants to come here. Therefore, these meetings were food to the hungry. They took care of our need and provided fellowship between younger brothers and elder brothers. "O Lord! We can only praise You." May the Lord bless the vessels He uses and bless His redeemed people here.</p><p>Please pray for us so that we could remain in the Lord's grace.</p><p>Wang Feng-zhang and Jiao Zhong-gong<br />October 15, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Up to the Present (Putien)</h2><p>The church moved out of the place in Taoxiang this spring, and we have been continuing the table, fellowship, and prayer meetings in the Lan's home at Ru-Nan village. Since we began this last month, the Lord has opened a door for the gospel. Although the brothers who speak for the Lord are very weak, He has given us a number of saved ones, and the numbers have not diminished from when we met in the hall in Taoxiang. This is something for which we should thank and worship.</p><p>Please pray for us in the church in Putien, Fukien, that we would continue going on in God's grace and light.</p><p>Chu Ai-zeng and Huang Guang-hua<br />November 30, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">May the Lord Not Forsake the Corner of Tientai</h2><p>In Tientai's cities and villages, there are nine localities meeting in the Lord's name; they are Chengzhong, Huangdanchiu, Huanao, Shantouwang, Jingtoutang, Shuangliu, Shiayangtien, Tantou, and Hexi. Every two months we have a fellowship meeting in which all the responsible brothers and the brothers and sisters who pursue the Lord meet together. Everyone is eager to attend the meeting, but we feel that we are sheep without a shepherd! May the merciful Lord not forsake the corner of Tientai.</p><p>Chou Liang-mei, Xi Xing-zhen, and Chen Dao-tan<br />December 3, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">All Is God's Mercy (Canton)</h2><p>Thanks and praise be to the Lord for putting us (Liao Bo-hui, Chen-chi, and me) in Canton with the brothers and sisters to learn to serve together. Although we are weak and immature, God has worked according to His rich love and mercy, beyond what we could ask or think. Between April of last year and October of this year, three hundred forty-eight people have been baptized into His name. The brothers and sisters are coordinating in one accord and learning to serve God together.</p><p>The Lord Himself has opened a door for the gospel. Whenever we preach the gospel in the meeting hall or in the homes of the brothers and sisters, people get saved. In September, Brother Chen Ze-xin came here for a ten-day conference, and we made some new arrangements for the affairs of the church. We are not worthy to participate in the Lord's work, nor are we worthy to receive His marvelous doings. We can only give thanks by saying, "He will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion." May all the glory be unto Him.</p><p>The least member,<br />De-er<br />November 6, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">They Actually Treat Us Well (Canton)</h2><p>Thank the Lord that the situation of the church here is very good. The brothers and sisters are all well taken care of. Please do not worry about us. The government somehow has become aware of us. Last month Sister Liu Mu-zhen came from Chingyuan. She said that the church there is able to stand firm. Before the Party Officials entered the county, the Farmers' Cooperative took the opportunity to damage our church. Later, after the Party Officials arrived, the Farmers' Cooperative made accusations concerning our sister to them. All their accusations proved to be false in the end. The Party Officials actually treat our church (in Chingyuan) well. They even called a meeting of all the population (including those who had accused our sister) to explain and prove that our sister was a good person. They also made a Peoples' order exhorting everyone to repair the damaged tiles on the roof of the sister's house (the meeting hall).</p><p>I am in the steamship business as my "Gospel Business." The Lord has really blessed it. I stand on the ground of a Christian in carrying out my business. I maintain the attitude in Philippians 3:7-8 to spend the rest of my days for the Lord. Thank the Lord that He has led us into the correct way. He told us and ordered us to do this long ago. By the Lord's grace, may we go on well in the way before us.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chien Yao-ji<br />January 27, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">In Need of the Supply of the Word (Hsuchang)</h2><p>The church in Hsuchang began to have the Lord's table in May 1945, but there were only seven brothers and sisters in the fellowship. We only had prayer, fellowship, and Lord's table meetings because we did not have a fixed meeting place. We have recently built two small huts for the meetings. Three sisters were baptized this spring. When we preached the gospel over the Chinese New Year, twenty men and women registered as believing in the Lord. Now more than thirty people come to the meetings. There are twelve brothers and sisters in the Lord's table meetings.</p><p>The meeting in Zhengzhou began last year. The meeting in Kaifeng began to stand on the ground of locality last month.</p><p>All the meetings in Honan province are very immature. We really need the leading brothers to come help us and lead us. If you do not, the brothers and sisters in the inland, or we should say, the churches in the inland, will never meet God's requirements for the church. The stature of the church is closely related to the supply of the word; therefore, we hope that someone can come help us. We hope that brothers with jobs would migrate to live among us. It would be best if they would come with their families.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Wu Chong-san, Kuo Tien-en<br />October 11, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Continually Making a Turn (Xiaoshan)</h2><p>On May 10, 1950 (the Lord's Day) scores of brothers and sisters here determined to leave the denominations because of the light of the truth, the testimony of the Body of Christ, and the leading of the Holy Spirit. We spent three days fasting and praying before beginning to meet in the Lord's name in Xiaoshan. Over the past few months, we have been enlightened by the Lord, and another score of people have continually made the turn. There are now around seventy or eighty people in the meetings on the Lord's Day. We really praise and thank the Lord. The Lord Himself has been steadily leading this group of weak, scrawny lambs. We still hope the brothers and sisters in the Lord would pray for us that we would see more light, understand more of the truth, and be able to start the Lord's table. We are all happy to offer up ourselves, and everyone is willing to speak for the Lord that His name would be glorified.</p><p>Lin Wang-ho, Kao De-chun,<br />and Lee Run-sheng<br />September 24, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Led by the Grace of the Lord<br />(Xinchang)</h2><p>All of our service used to be under the system of the denominations. In December 1949, we attended an edification conference in Ninghai and began to see the Lord's light. We were led by the Lord's grace to begin the Lord's table meetings in Fangkou in March of this year. But we are still spiritually immature and do not know how to begin to go the Lord's way. Thank God for giving us the book on the edification of the new believers that we could understand some of the truth and know the importance of serving God. We really praise the Lord and thank you.</p><p>There is also a meeting in Dasiju, twenty miles from us. One of their brothers attended the edification conference in Ninghai. Like us, they began to have the Lord's table in March of last year.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Wu Fa-gang<br />January 16, 1951</p><h2 class="head1">PLEASE HELP US IN THIS WAY</h2><p>Those who send letters that only concern the periodicals should address them to The Periodical Subscription Department, The Gospel Book Room.

Today we must see the way of unity and how to walk in unity.</p><p>According to my knowledge, there are four kinds of unity. From among these four different kinds of unity, we must seek one in which to walk as the children of God. We must be clear which one is in accordance with God's will, which one is scriptural, which one is the proper way for the church, and which one we must take. We must learn to reject the rest. When we see one that is of God, we must reject the ones that are not of God.</p><p>What are these four ways? First, there is the unity of Roman Catholicism; second, "spiritual" unity; third, the unity of the church in the locality; and fourth, the unity of the independent congregations. Let us consider these one by one.</p><h2 class="head2">The Unity of Roman Catholicism</h2><h2 class="head3">The Churches during<br />the Apostles' Time Being Local</h2><p>During the apostles' time, the churches were separated according to localities. I think this matter is very clear. The church in Rome, the church in Corinth, the church in Ephesus, the church in Philippi, the church in Laodicea, and the church in Colossae were all separated according to locality. The church in every locality had its own independent administration. Therefore, in the Bible, Acts 14:23 tells us "they had appointed elders for them in every church," and Titus 1:5 tells us that elders were appointed "in every city." The elders are for the church and the church is in a city. Thus, the elders are for the church in a city. The church takes the city as the unit; otherwise, elders in a city would take care of several churches or elders in a church would take care of several cities. The boundary of a city, therefore, equals the boundary of the church, and the boundary of the church equals the boundary of the elders' administration. This is very clear.</p><p>The churches in the early days were not formed into a larger, united church. During the apostles' time, the Scriptures acknowledge the existence of "churches" on this earth, but does not unite these churches into "one church." There were "churches," but not a uniting together as one church in the singular number. This is the reason Paul writes to the Corinthians: "Neither the churches of God" (1 Cor. 11:16). Today when God's children speak about the church, they always speak of the "church of God," not about the "churches of God." In our concept, we always consolidate the churches into one church; therefore, we speak of "the church" rather than "the churches." But in the minds of the apostles, there were individual churches; therefore, they spoke of "the churches of God." The apostles did not unite the churches on earth into one church; otherwise, this phrase "the churches of God" would not have existed. Remember that 1 Corinthians 11 and 14 always speak of "the churches," which means that the churches of God on earth are local. They did not combine all the churches of God on earth into one church. This was the situation during the time of the apostles.</p><h2 class="head3">The History of Change</h2><p>After the apostles, the church began to change. The churches in big cities spontaneously began to become powerful. A big city naturally had a greater population; thus, the churches in larger cities became more powerful than churches in small cities or villages. The churches in big cities were inclined to absorb churches in smaller cities and villages so that they became satellites. The big cities became centers, while the smaller cities became accessories around them. As a result, there were changes not only in the organization but also in the administration of the church. Originally, there were several elders in a church. The churches in villages or in small cities also had their own elders. After the apostles passed away, however, a group of people in the early church advocated the doctrine that the authority of the apostles had been committed to the elders or bishops who represented the apostles. This was done out of respect for the apostles. Because they honored the first group of apostles, they were reluctant to designate anyone else as an apostle. They dared not use the title apostle.</p><p>Later, they appointed one from among many elders in a big city to be the bishop. Originally, elders were all bishops (overseers); each one was a bishop. The term elder refers to the person himself, and bishop refers to his office. But gradually, among the many elders, one was chosen to be a bishop, who became not only the head of the elders in a locality but also the head of the elders in the satellite churches.</p><p>This is how the changes came about: First, the church in a big city made all the churches in the small cities and villages its satellites. Later, a head elder was designated out of the big church, who naturally became the head elder of the satellite churches. He was called the bishop. This is a title found in the Bible, but the function now associated with it was not the same as what is in the Bible. In the Bible the elders are bishops. Paul called the elders in Ephesus together and said, "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers [bishops]" (Acts 20:17, 28). The bishops in the Bible were plural; the elders were also plural. But today one is picked from among many elders to become the bishop. Only one is bishop while the rest are elders, not bishops. The elders no longer have the authority of a bishop. Smaller localities were united together and given over to the rule of this one bishop. One person was made to rule over many churches, and the matter of regions arose.</p><p>This development did not stop at just this level. During this same time the Roman Empire conquered the whole world. Among the many churches, the church in the city of Rome became very big. The city was not only large but also the capital. People throughout the whole world came to Rome to see Caesar. At first a bishop ruled over many places, which resulted in a regional church. As the city of Rome became prominent, it began to claim, "We are the capital, and Caesar lives in our midst." Consequently, the bishop in the church of Rome not only ruled over the elders of the church in Rome but also over the elders in the region surrounding Rome. He not only became the head of the elders within the entire empire but also, more particularly, the head of the bishops of the various regions. This was the pope, the product of an order of ascending rank in the form of a hierarchy. Today the meaning of bishop in various denominations is "overseer." The head of all such overseers is the pope. The reason everyone is ambitious to be the bishop of Rome is that once one becomes the bishop in Rome, he is spontaneously the bishop of the whole world and the head of all the elders in the world. Once one becomes the bishop in Rome, he immediately becomes the pope, and he represents Christ. This trend continued until its development became fully complete in the fourth century. By that time, "the churches" as recorded in the Bible no longer existed; they were now "one church." The churches in the whole world became one church. From that day on, "the churches of God" as mentioned in the Bible (1 Cor. 11:16) no longer existed and no longer were mentioned. "The churches of the saints," as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14:33, also no longer were heard of, no longer were mentioned, and no longer existed. They all became part of the one church of Rome, and all the churches throughout the world became branches of Rome. There were no longer churches associated with just localities.</p><p>Was there a scriptural basis for this development? Supposedly, the scriptural basis was the fact that the children of God should be one. Since the Lord has only one church on this earth, they thought that they should be united as "one church." However, they forgot that the Bible speaks of "the churches."</p><h2 class="head3">No One Daring to Break the "Unity"</h2><p>We must take notice of one condition that prevailed after the Roman Catholic Church came into being. We know how the Roman Church was filled with heresy, idols, filthiness, and sins. Why did no brothers or sisters in the church stand up to deal with the situation for eleven hundred years? Could it be that no brothers or sisters had seen the heresies? Could it be that they had not seen the idols? Could it be that they had not seen the filthy sins?</p><p>In the eleven hundred years following the fourth century, there were definitely some who saw the heresies, idols, and filthy sins, but not one dared to deal with them! They feared that once they dealt with these things, they would immediately break the "unity." "The church is one," they said. "If we begin to deal with the idols, the church will be divided." They felt that the sin of worshipping idols was great, but the sin of ruining the unity was even greater. Therefore, even though they rejected the worship of idols themselves, they did not speak out. They feared that speaking out might ruin the unity. They knew of the heresies and they knew of the idols; moreover, they hated the heresies and they hated the idols. But even more, they hated to destroy the unity. Therefore, they simply avoided the heresies and idols; they dared not evoke any word, message, or action that might ruin the unity. For a period of one thousand one hundred years no one made any move; they continued to keep the unity of the church.</p><p>At the time of the Reformation, Martin Luther had no thought of forming another church. He thought that doing such a thing would be a serious sin. Therefore, at the beginning his thought was to improve the Roman Catholic Church; the idea of forming another church was not in his mind. It was the inevitable force of history that brought about the formation of another church. Luther only wanted to improve the Roman Catholic Church; he had no intention of forming a new church.</p><p>Here we see one thing: The Roman Catholic Church believes in the unity of the church throughout the world. It believes that only one church should exist in the whole world. That is the reason, during the long history of Rome, that the children of God basically forgot that the "churches" were plural in the Bible. They only wanted the church in the singular. Even when Luther arose, he only saw a united church on the earth. He did not see that God has churches in the Bible. Thus, the unity that was upheld is something manifested in one church&mdash;the international, worldwide, universal church. Regardless of where this church stands, it is always the Church of Rome. In Shanghai it is the Church of Rome; in Moscow it is the Church of Rome; in London it is the Church of Rome; in Berlin it is also the Church of Rome. Wherever it is, it is always the Church of Rome. It does not call itself the Church of Rome; its proper title is the Catholic Church, the Universal Church. We call it the Church of Rome because we know it comes out of Rome. It calls itself the Catholic Church because it is unified and universal; it includes everyone. In China it is called the Catholic Church. The word catholic in Latin simply means universal and general, with no distinction in race or region. No matter where it is, it is always one&mdash;one in England, one in Japan, and one in Russia. As long as it comes out of Rome, it is called the Catholic Church. As a result, there is only "one church" on earth.</p><p>We must study the Scriptures carefully and accurately before God to ascertain whether or not the church on earth is one church. If it is only one church, we must say that the local church is wrong, and even the many denominations in Protestantism must also confess that they are wrong. If there is but one church, we all have to go back to Rome; if we do not, we are wrong. Therefore, we must study the Scriptures to see whether or not we are wrong.</p><p>I know there are some Protestant friends who have said that the church on earth is one and that our churches in different localities are wrong. According to them, the church is always one. Please note that their word condemns them. If the church is one, there is no reason for any of their denominations to exist. If the church is one, then regardless of where it is, it must be the Church of Rome. According to numbers, the Church of Rome is the largest, according to history, it is the oldest church, and according to organization, it is one. If there should be only one church, that is, if the church of God or the church of Christ should be singular, then this would be the scriptural way. We should all return to Rome. However, the Bible does not teach this.</p><p>In the last century, John H. Newman, a contemporary of J. N. Darby, was a famous English clergyman. He was not only pious, but he had an excellent mind and wrote many books. He was considered one of the most famous persons in the Anglican Church. The hymn "Lead, Kindly Light" was composed by him. He believed that there was only one church in the world, so he started a movement in the Anglican Church to return to Rome. Of course, he was unsuccessful, because Revelation 2 and 3 clearly show that Sardis cannot go back to Thyatira. He thought that it was logical to leave the Anglican Church and join the Roman Church since there was only one church. After being received as a member of the Roman Church, he was promoted to the position of cardinal over England. A cardinal is next in rank only to the pope. He was not only a bishop but a cardinal. There was only one cardinal in England; he was the archbishop of a large region. When a pope passes away, the new pope is chosen from among the scores of cardinals. Many people have expressed regret for Newman, but in reading his books, I feel that his beginning was consistent with his end. I do not say that he was right, but his behavior matched his doctrine. He believed in only one church; therefore, he went back to Rome. One should not believe in one church and yet remain in the denominations. One should not confess that the church is one and be a pastor in the Anglican Church or an elder in the Presbyterian Church. Newman was thoroughly consistent and uncontradicting. His end harmonized with his beginning. In this regard many people in the denominations cannot compare with him.</p><h2 class="head3">The Bible Saying, "the Churches of God"</h2><p>Does the Bible ever say that there is only one church on the earth? No! The Bible shows us that God establishes churches on the earth, that is, one church in each locality. Here is an important matter which we must notice before God: In the Bible, God has never united the churches in the many localities together as one church.</p><p>Do we have proof of this? Yes! We will look at this matter from three directions. First, after the Romans defeated the Jewish nation, Judea was changed from a nation into a province of Rome. Many churches, each in one locality, existed in the region, the province, of Judea. When the Bible speaks of the churches of Judea, it does not say the church in Judea, but "the churches" in Judea (1 Thes. 2:14). Have we ever seen the importance of the word churches? Although all the churches existed in one province, there was not a provincial church. If there was a provincial church, it would have been recorded as the church in Judea, not as the churches in Judea. Since the Bible speaks of them as the churches in Judea, it means that there were many individual churches, not the uniting together of many as the one church of Judea. There was no such thing as a united church.</p><p>Second, we can consider Galatia, which is not a city, but like Judea is a province. When the Bible speaks of Galatia, it never says "the church" in Galatia, but "the churches of Galatia" (1 Cor. 16:1), not church in the singular, but churches in the plural. This shows us that several churches were not joined together in Galatia to form one church. They were still churches.</p><p>Third, during that time the largest province was Asia. We can see that all the important churches were in Asia: Ephesus was in Asia, Colossae was in Asia, and Laodicea was in Asia. We should not consider that Laodicea was not so good because the Bible did not give it a good report in Revelation. In fact, Laodicea was very good in the beginning, and it was a very large place. Many churches existed in Asia (1 Cor. 16:19), but they were not united together as the church in Asia; rather, Revelation 1:4 speaks of "the seven churches which are in Asia." Therefore, there is not a united church in the Bible. The churches in a province did not unite, and the churches in the whole world did not unite. The Bible never indicates that the churches in a province should unite as one church, that the churches in a country should unite as one church, or that the churches on a continent should unite as one church. There is no such church in the Bible. There is no such indication that the churches in the whole world should unite as one church. Acts never speaks of such a thing.</p><p>Furthermore, what does Paul say when he speaks of the church in the Epistles? For example, in 1 Corinthians he speaks of "the churches of God" (11:16) and of "all the churches of the saints" (14:33), that is, he speaks of not one church, but many churches. The church composed of all the saints is not the church, but the churches of the saints. Three or four brothers and sisters become a church here, and three or four brothers become a church there. They are the churches of the saints. The Bible does not use the phrase the church of God when it refers to the churches on earth; it does not use the phrase the church of the saints. The Bible clearly speaks of the churches of God and the churches of the saints. It is evident that God has no thought of uniting all the churches into one church.</p><p>In order for God to do something, He must first accomplish two works: The doctrine must be preached, and the apostles must work it out. There is no doctrine of uniting the churches. I have studied the Bible many times, but I have never seen a doctrine in it that indicates that there is only one church on earth. Neither do the apostles work toward such a thing. The Lord wanted the apostles to be completely obedient; He would not let them have their own opinions and act by themselves. Everything done by the apostles was done in obedience to the Lord; therefore, they were qualified to be apostles. If they had acted by themselves and by their own opinions, God would not have acknowledged their work as His work because a distance would have existed between them. God demanded that they obey completely and be thoroughly consecrated. Then God acknowledged what they did as His own work. The apostles did not unite the churches on earth into one church. We do not have such an apostolic pattern, nor do we have such a scriptural teaching.</p><p>If God intended to unite all the churches on the earth into one big, grand church, why did He not do such a thing through the hands of such men as Peter, James, John, and Paul? Why did He wait three or four hundred years to accomplish this through the pope? I believe in the pattern of Peter and Paul, but not in the pattern of the pope. I believe in the things done by Peter and Paul, but not in the things done by the pope. I believe in the apostles who were absolute to the Lord, but not in the popes. We absolutely cannot follow them. This is the reason I do not believe in such a thing as the Church of Christ in China. The church is local. There are only "the churches" of Christ in China, not "the Church" of Christ in China. Brothers, do you see the difference? Only the churches in China, not the church in China, should exist. There should be one church in Shanghai, one church in Tientsin. There may well be 8,000 or 9,000 churches throughout the whole of China, but it is absolutely impossible to make them become one church in China.</p><p>We see one thing here: The Bible contains absolutely no pattern or commandment for combining all the churches on earth into one organized, formal church. On the contrary, all the patterns and all the teachings in the Bible show that the churches are local and plural in number.</p><p>If I am a seeker after God, I cannot join the Roman Catholic Church. It is a worldly organization, one in which all the churches in the whole world are combined into one church. In this one church, the pope acts like an emperor, and the cardinals act like princes in each nation. Since they are an organization of the world, we cannot join them. When we speak with the brothers and sisters in different localities about the unity of the church, we must tell them that our unity is not the unity of the Roman Catholic Church. Today on this earth, there is a unity which is the unity of the Roman Catholic Church. This will not do, because it is not of God. According to history, this is something worked out by man; it is not what God wants us to have.</p><h2 class="head2">"Spiritual" Unity</h2><p>There is a second kind of unity today which can be found throughout the world, and it is called "spiritual" unity. What is the definition of this spiritual unity, and from where does it originate?</p><h2 class="head3">State Religions</h2><p>Originally, Roman Catholicism was the state religion of the Roman Empire. The term state religion has a very interesting definition: It means the religion of a nation. The nation, the king, or the emperor ordains such a religion for its people. In other words, once a person is born as a subject of a nation, he becomes a member of the religion of that nation. If a person is a Roman citizen, he automatically joins the Roman religion. Either a person has no nationality and therefore has no membership in any nation's religion, or he is born a citizen of a nation and consequently is a member of the religion of that nation. Whether or not he is willing, he must take part in that religion. This is not a matter that is left up to him to decide; it has been decided by the emperor. If he depends upon the nation for his living, he must take part in the nation's religion.</p><p>After the Roman Empire accepted Roman Catholicism as the state religion, the membership of the Roman Catholic Church became the same as the population of the Roman Empire. Formerly, the members of the church only equaled the number of those who through repentance had been regenerated and baptized. Now, however, no one needed to join the church per se. As long as one was born in the country and his father was a Roman, he was qualified to become a member of the Roman religion. There was no need for him to experience regeneration. My father is Chinese, and I was born of my father. It is unnecessary for me to be naturalized in order for me to become a Chinese, because I am Chinese by birth. This was the situation in the Roman Catholic Church; once one was born a Roman, he was a member of the Roman Catholic Church. One who was born of the flesh could now become a "child" of God. This completely changed the word in John 1:12-13. It became unnecessary to be born of God or to receive the Lord Jesus. Instead, being born of blood, of the will of the flesh, and of the will of man was all that was necessary. As long as one was a Roman, he was a member of the Roman Catholic Church. This was the Roman Catholic Church.</p><h2 class="head3">Protestantism Originally Being<br />a State Religion Also</h2><p>At the beginning of the Protestant movement, Martin Luther only wanted to reform the Roman Catholic Church; he did not expect to form a new church. The formation of a new church was not due to religious reasons, but to political ones. Because the Roman pope ruled over the whole world, even the emperor was afraid of him. According to the pope, emperors ruled over the human body, while he ruled over the human soul. Even though the pope's body was ruled over by the emperor, the emperor's soul was ruled over by the pope. The Kaiser could have been the greatest imperialist, but he could do nothing against the pope; the pope ruled over him. If the pope closed the door to the heavenly kingdom, no one could enter in, not even a king. In effect, the pope ruled over the whole world. Thus, the kings of all the nations were very afraid of him. They were kings, yet someone ruled over them. They were kings, yet someone above them was their king. The pope was the supreme ruler of the whole world.</p><p>When Luther rose up to reform the church, these kings realized that there was a way for them to separate themselves from Rome. They did not want the pope to rule over their souls; they wanted to rule themselves. They wanted a different church, one not ruled over by the pope. In certain things the commandments they gave could be altered by the pope. The pope could just issue another commandment, and the people dared not disobey, because disobedience to the pope meant that their souls would go to hell. Luther rose up and took advantage of this opportunity. He preached justification by faith, that is, the right of every man to go to God. There were many kings and princes who waited for Luther to go ahead and who were willing to support him with force. The pope tried to quell the reformers by force. In response, the kings seized the opportunity to send out armies to battle, and the fighting was fierce. Afterwards, not only was there a separation of doctrine but also a separation from the Roman Catholic Church. What was the result? Those who followed Luther's teaching became part of the Church of Germany in Germany, the Church of Holland in Holland, and the Church of England in England. Originally, the Roman Empire encompassed the whole world. Germany, Holland, and England were smaller kingdoms within it. Now Germany had its own Lutheran Church, Holland had its own Dutch Reformed Church, and England had its own Anglican Church. These were also state churches, only they were smaller than the Roman Church.</p><p>Anyone born of British parents becomes a member of the Anglican Church. The moment one comes out of the womb of his mother, he is automatically a member of the Anglican Church. This is the reason behind infant baptism. It is necessary to have an infant registered in the church. Since he is British, he is automatically a member of the Anglican Church. It is unnecessary to believe. It is only a matter of registration. If he is registered, he is a member. One can be born an Englishman and a Christian at the same time. Later, when private churches were raised up, the members had to leave the Anglican Church. Members of these private churches were called "dissenters," which means that they dissented from the state church. They were originally in the state church, but when they wanted to come out they first had to leave the state church in order to join another. If a person wanted to join the Wesleyan Church, he first had to leave the Anglican Church. They were dissenters; otherwise, they would not have come out.</p><h2 class="head3">The Doctrine of the Visible<br />and the Invisible Church Produced</h2><p>At this point a problem arose. Since both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church were state churches, they naturally contained many unsaved people. A person cannot be saved by birth. If a person could be saved by birth, we would only have to make Christianity the state religion of China and then all the Chinese would be Christians. Becoming a Christian by regeneration would become unnecessary. However, this is impossible. Being born is one thing, but being born again is quite another. As a result of such a practice, all the state churches were filled with unsaved people. Thank God, there were also many saved ones. But the unsaved people, in spite of their education and background, were still unsaved.</p><p>There then is a problem: Is the Anglican Church the church? If it is the church, how could there be so many unsaved people in it? Surely this is quite strange! In this church there are quite a number of unbelievers. How could this be? Consequently, a certain doctrine of the church emerged. According to this doctrine, there are two kinds of churches: visible and invisible, that is, a church with a form and another church without a form. In this doctrine the church spoken of in the Scriptures was regarded as invisible and spiritual, but the church on the earth was regarded as visible and with a form. In the visible church there could be false Christians, but in the spiritual church everyone was genuine. Brothers, we must know that all doctrines have an origin. The doctrine of the spiritual church, that is, the doctrine of a visible and an invisible church, was brought in just as we have mentioned. Since man brought in so many false believers, the visible church, of course, became untrustworthy. Since all the British people fell into one net, there had to be both "good fish" and "bad fish." This is wrong. The Scriptures teach that the church is the Body of Christ and Christ is the Head of the church; thus, only believers can be the church. How can there be unbelievers in the church? Since so many unbelievers filled the church, what else could be done except to produce a doctrine about two kinds of churches, a visible one which is unreliable and an invisible one which is real? It was inevitable that this kind of doctrine would be produced. It was essential to justify their existence; otherwise, it was impossible for them to go on. Brothers, do you see the point? It is by necessity that this kind of doctrine was produced. The visible church became too loose; anything could be found in her. As a result, such a doctrine was compelled to be produced.</p><p>Supporters of this doctrine quoted the Scripture where it says that Satan sowed tares after the Lord sowed the seed. It says that we should not remove the tares, but "let both grow together" (Matt. 13:24, 30). These ones said that the invisible and spiritual church consists of those who are born again, among whom not one is false. But in the visible church there are tares, which should not be removed. Many brothers and sisters reading this passage thought that this was right, that there was a difference between the visible and the invisible church. They did not realize that such evil can never be covered up by the doctrine of the visible and invisible churches. These ones made the church too inclusive. The Lord Jesus was speaking about the wheat and the tares growing together in the world (Matt. 13:38), not in the church! Since the church was expanded to be as large as the world, naturally tares were included in the church. Consequently, the only way to explain the church was to say that there is a church with form and a church without form. It is true that these ones acknowledged that the Anglican Church is too big. But there is another church, the church in the Bible, which only consists of spiritual and regenerated persons.</p><p>What was the condition of the churches on earth in Revelation 2 and 3? They were the seven golden lampstands. What is a golden lampstand? It is a place where light shines forth. When He was on earth, the Lord Jesus said, "Let your light shine before men." What is the use if the light shines, but men cannot see it (Matt. 5:16)? Tonight, we can be here because there is visible light. What could we do if it were invisible? An invisible light is a joke, a big joke. How can there be an invisible light? Furthermore, if light is visible, it must have a form; it cannot be without form. A light without form is a lie. The church on the earth must be seen by men. The Bible has no thought of the church being an invisible light. But today, the church is spoken of not in relation to putting a lamp under a bushel, but of shining forth invisible light from a lampstand! The word that the Lord Jesus spoke to us is clear enough. He said, "You are the light of the world. It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden" (Matt. 5:14). This is visible, not invisible. The Lord wants us to be manifested on the earth and seen of men.</p><p>We must see, therefore, that what is called the visible church is actually the world. Because some insist on calling it a church, they explain that there is another church within this outward church. However, the church spoken of in God's Word is one that comes out of the world and is separated from the world. Since this is so, we only can acknowledge the existence of a spiritual church, not an outward church.</p><p>The problem today is that there are many brothers and sisters who think that the unity among Christians is a "spiritual" unity. According to this spiritual unity, there are some people in the church who are spiritual and some who are not. Thus, in every church there is an outward aspect and a spiritual aspect. With spiritual unity, a group of spiritual brothers can have fellowship with another group of spiritual brothers, and they can all be one with each other. I want to point out that the reason there is a need for this kind of spiritual unity is that there are some who are of the world. If everyone is brought forth by the word of God, the question of spiritual unity would never need to arise.</p><p>This matter is very important because it touches a basic problem. If you ask someone how many are unsaved in his denomination, he would probably say about half of them. Several denominations may tell you that they would be very happy if one in ten is saved. These denominations are not much different from the state church. They are like an onion which has many layers that can be peeled off. What they mean is that the nine outside layers mean nothing; only the center counts. Undoubtedly, the principle of the denominations is still the principle of the state church because many in their midst do not belong to the Lord. For this reason their fellowship must, by necessity, be limited to spiritual ones, not to the whole church. If the whole church were to fellowship together, many unbelievers would be involved. In order to have spiritual fellowship, the whole church cannot be included. But the Bible includes the whole church as the boundary of fellowship. Because the condition of the church is murky and the boundary of the church is ill-defined, there is the need of "spiritual" fellowship.</p><p>Today many kinds of peculiar churches exist in the world because many non-Christians were brought into them. Since many unbelievers and false Christians are in the "church," Christians in these churches have to maintain an invisible fellowship; all their fellowship is invisible. They say that they have fellowship of the heart, that their hearts are joined to each other. Let me say this: The very need for this kind of fellowship is a mistake. We must understand and see through this. This need for "spiritual" unity exists only because the position is wrong. If we stand in the right position, we are already one. If the church is proper, the invisible would become visible, and there would be no need for invisible fellowship. The Lord said that the church is a lampstand, but they say that the light it sheds is only an invisible light. This is strange. This kind of spiritual fellowship and spiritual unity was produced by mixing unbelievers in the church.</p><h2 class="head3">The Producing of Many Denominations</h2><p>This view creates two problems: we have just seen the problem from the viewpoint of the state church; now we must see it from the viewpoint of the dissenters, many of whom did not approve of the state church. They not only disapproved but also stood up to oppose the errors of the state church. Such were the Baptists, the Presbyterians, and the Wesleyans. The Wesleyans thought that preaching could be done everywhere. As dissenters, they rose up and formed churches to maintain the truth based upon their dissent. Thus, the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Wesleyan Church, the Quaker Church, and later several thousand groups, arose. In England they were called the dissenters. In the Russian Empire, the state church was called the Russian Orthodox Church, and the rest were called sects. All these brothers rose up for the truth. This is a good point! We thank God for this. Regrettably, however, they tried to maintain God's truth by setting up new churches, thus causing the church of God to be divided into several thousand parts.</p><p>Later, the situation gradually changed. In the first generation of their existence both sides argued considerably. For example, Wesley argued fiercely with the Church of England. In the third and fourth generations, however, the arguing subsided, and there was not much difference between them. Formerly, they would not greet one another and communicate with each other, but today they even pray together. For example, the United Christian Church, which was originally in the Wesleyan Church, demanded that Wesleyans accept the doctrine of divine healing. They argued so terribly over this matter that they later separated. Now in the third generation, they no longer argue. In the beginning the differences were great, but now they are not great. Some of the people in the United Christian Church, however, believed in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues. They left to establish the Pentecostal Church. At first, there were terrible arguments among them, but now it no longer matters.</p><p>Today all these churches have been formed. Some formed the Baptist Church because of baptism, some formed the Lutheran Church because of Luther, some formed the Methodist Church because of Wesley, and some formed the Christian and Missionary Alliance because of Simpson. In the Bible, however, no church was formed based on a certain doctrine. There is not one instance in the Bible where a special doctrine warrants the establishment of a church. According to the apostle Paul, the doctrines which men have argued most strongly about were not major problems. In Romans 14 Paul said it is all right for one man to observe this day while another observes another day. Some may be for one day, while others may be for another day, while still others may be for both days (vv. 5-6). These people are weak in the faith. But they should not be divided by doctrines. Some do not eat meat because they are weak in the faith, but they feel it is all right to eat vegetables (v. 2). Paul did not form a vegetarian church, nor did he form a meat-eating church. Some ate vegetables and some ate meat. Paul said none of these should pose any problem; we should receive those whom the Lord has received because God has received them (Rom. 14:3). If he eats vegetables, he is a brother; if he eats meat, he is still a brother. If he observes this  day, he is a brother; if he observes another day, he is still a brother. There is no example in the Bible of forming a church according to doctrine.</p><p>According to the Bible, how is the church formed? The only requirement is in Romans 14: "Receive..for God has received him" (vv. 1, 3). We must receive whomever God receives. We receive him because God has received him. He has the life of God. Formerly, he was a sinner, but now he has come to the Lord. The only question we need to ask is whether or not he has received the Lord. If he has, any further word is unnecessary. As to his behavior as a Christian, we should help him with the teachings of the Bible, but we cannot refuse him and put him outside the church. Some believe in baptism by sprinkling; they are better than those who do not baptize at all. The Salvation Army does not sprinkle and neither do the Quakers. Some baptize by rubbing drops of water; others baptize by immersion. Philip and the eunuch went down into the water (Acts 8:38), and the Lord Jesus came out of the water (Matt. 3:16). Going down and coming up must mean baptism by immersion. However, some people only immerse their hands in the water, not their bodies. According to the Scriptures, we must be immersed. Today some baptize by rubbing on water. We should not tell them that they belong to the "water-rubbing" church. We cannot establish a church according to doctrine. Regardless of whether baptism is by immersion or by rubbing on water, we can only ask, Have these brothers been received by God? Have these brothers been saved? If they are saved, despite whether or not they have been rubbed with water, they will stand before God. How can we not receive them? If we are going to spend eternity with them, how can we not receive them today? How can we each go our own way because we cannot accept others' shortcomings? This should not be! The Bible shows that the church includes all those whom the Lord has received.</p><p>Furthermore, in Romans 14 Paul said, "Now him who is weak in faith receive," not reject. We recognize that this brother is weak, but we must not reject him; rather, we must receive him. Often we err by considering that he can follow us only if his faith is as strong as ours. Instead, we need to see that we must receive those who are weak in the faith. If we reject them, at the most we can shut them out of the church for a few score of years. We cannot shut them out forever. We have no way to excommunicate them; they are our brothers forever. We must realize that to divide the church according to doctrines will not work. Suppose a brother in the church at Sian is a vegetarian. What should we say? We can only ask one question: Has this person been saved? If he has been saved and continues his diet of vegetables, we must allow him to do so. In other words, he has received the same life; therefore, regardless of his preference, we have to receive him. We must help those who are weak in the faith with the teachings of the Bible, not separate from them by forming another church.</p><p>Today, the so-called denominations have been brought forth as the result of division over doctrines. People take a doctrine from the Bible, preach it, and form a denomination around it. Consequently, there is the Pentecostal Church, the Lutheran Church, the Quakers, etc. The Quakers stress a gesture (quaking), the Lutherans a doctrine, the Presbyterians an organization, and the Congregationalists an independent congregation. These are not the work of the Lord but the result of man's ideas which have divided the children of God into so many denominations.</p><p>Many think it is good to have denominations because it is convenient. Brothers! if you asked me whether or not I like denominations according to the flesh, I would say, "Yes, I like them, because everything is clear-cut. Those who like to speak in tongues can go to the Tongues Church, those who like independent congregations can go to the Congregational Church, and those who do not like sprinkling can go to the Salvation Army." But the Bible teaches that there should be only one church in each locality. In Corinth there is only one church, in Ephesus there is only one church, and in Shanghai there should be only one church. This way is not convenient because everyone must love all of the brothers! Loving many brothers who are not like us causes much friction and many lessons. You have your proposals, and I have my proposals; you have your ideas, and I have my ideas. It is very convenient for you to have your church and for me to have my church. It is not so convenient for us today; to be together in one church means that we have to love one another. With many difficulties there are many lessons, but with more difficulties, there also is the need for more love for one another. Even though we are unhappy, we still cannot escape. Whether or not we like it, we still must be brothers together. We must overcome the carnal by the spiritual, conquer all differences by love, and cover all difficulties by grace. Otherwise, the church cannot succeed.</p><h2 class="head3">Holding Hands over the Fences Not Being Unity</h2><p>Since people already have the denominations today, what should we do? We have already testified that it is not good for God's children to have denominations and divisions.  God's children must not form divisions; rather, God's children must love one another and be together. We have been saying this for thirty years since 1921. Is this word effective? Yes. Although we have met much opposition from the beginning and are still meeting some today, the opposition is getting weaker and weaker. At the beginning they tried to defend the denominations. Today they have become much weaker. Now they have come up with another way, saying, "We want to have a spiritual fellowship." As we have seen, this spiritual fellowship is the result of two factors. The first factor is state churches, in which a small church was found within a large church, a true church within a false church, a church of reality within a church of externality. The second factor is divisions caused by the differences in doctrines. Now some seek a middle road, that is, having "spiritual" fellowship with one another. Let us see if this "spiritual" fellowship is right or wrong.</p><p>"Spiritual" fellowship is certainly an improvement upon no fellowship among the denominations. Thank God! The situation in China through these many years has certainly changed, but can "spiritual" fellowship replace the fellowship of the church as ordained in the Bible? What they call "spiritual" fellowship is not real fellowship; they only borrow the term. For example, here we have several cups. God's purpose is that all should be united as one cup, but they have made the mistake of dividing themselves into many cups. "Spiritual" fellowship is for the purpose of strengthening the fellowship in the denominations. In denominationalism I have my cup, you have your cup, and he has his cup. "Spiritual" fellowship is a stretching out of our hands over our cups to hold each others' hand "across the fence." Separation by fences is denominationalism. Holding hands over the fences is "spiritual" fellowship. There is still sectarianism despite a desire for fellowship. If we do not hold hands over the fences, however, we are sectarian and denominational. According to the teaching of the Bible, however, there should be no sects, no denominations. Yet today there are brothers who want to keep the denominations, even though their consciences bother them that there is no fellowship. Consequently, they stretch out their hands over the fence to hold hands on the other side. This is the doctrine of the so-called "spiritual" fellowship today.</p><p>Concerning this matter, I feel quite heavy within. Brothers, let me say one word: If denominations are scriptural, we must pay any price to maintain the denominations. If it is God's command, who can nullify it? We must learn to follow God, not man. However, if the denominations are wrong, we must abolish them to the root. We cannot confess that the denominations are wrong on the one hand and encourage them on the other hand. We cannot say that denominations have no standing on the one hand and maintain them on the other hand. Since the denominations have no standing, we have to break them down and abolish them. We cannot covet fellowship on the one hand and have fellowship over fences on the other hand. If we really desire fellowship, we must break down the fences and have fellowship. If we want to serve God and feel that all God's children should have fellowship, we must tear down all the fences to have fellowship. If the fences are right, then we must build fences, not only ten feet high, but ten thousand feet high. We must be thorough and absolute before God. If the denominations are right, we must exert one thousand times the effort. This is proper. If the denominations are wrong, then it is proper for us to tear them down. If we feel that the denominations are wrong, yet want to keep the fences and shake hands over the fences, this is not the principle for serving God. The basic principle for us to serve God is that if we feel the denominations are right, we must support them; if we feel they are wrong, we must break them down. If we want to support the denominations on the one hand and try to break them down on the other, what could we hope to accomplish?</p><p>You must come to the place of showing others that their actions are not according to God's will. Speak for yourself. If you feel the denominations are right, you should help them. If you feel the denominations are wrong, then please tear them down. Do not merely pull the fences lower; tear them down completely. If the denominations are right, you must build the fences higher, so that no one can cross over, and so that everyone is clearly divided. This matter must be thorough and absolute. Keeping the denominations on the one hand, and feeling that they are wrong while trying to repair them on the other hand is absolutely not God's way. You know God; you have read the Bible&mdash;have you ever seen God wanting men to repair something? This is what is done by those who lack the courage to answer God's demand and listen to God's Word. They are paying half or less than half the price; they are seeking some bargain. They hold out their hand of fellowship while keeping the fences of division. I would like you brothers to see this matter clearly. A basic principle of Christian behavior is that we must pursue every matter thoroughly and absolutely. Then we can solve the problem.</p><p>For a clearer understanding, I will give an illustration. The Bible shows that God accepted Abel's offering but not Cain's (Gen. 4:2-7). Cain was a farmer and cultivated the soil. This is what his father did when he was in the Garden of Eden. When his father tilled the soil in the Garden of Eden, he brought the produce of the land and offered it to God. Even though Cain was outside the Garden of Eden because of sin, he tilled the soil as before. He received produce from the land as before, and he offered it to God as before. God not only refused to accept him, but also was displeased with him. Some people ask, "Why?" This is very simple and has but one significance: What man did before he sinned was acceptable to God, but nothing can be worse before God than to do the same thing after man sinned. Suppose that at eight o'clock each evening a child wants his mother to prepare a snack for him before he goes to bed. But one day he causes some trouble, and his mother has to apologize and pay for damages. What would happen if he asked his mother to prepare a snack for him as usual as though nothing had occurred? What would you say? If the child had been crying and was upset over his actions, you might not feel too bad. But if he acts as if nothing has happened, you would feel very bad. If a child is not bothered after making trouble, when he grows up he may even kill people and not be bothered. Cain was just like this. What he had done before, he continued to do in the same way after having sinned. He continued to offer things to God as though nothing had happened. He considered committing sin a small matter; he did not think it was anything serious. Abel was accepted because he acknowledged that he was outside the Garden of Eden. His offering acknowledged that he had sinned and that his present situation was different from what it had been in the past.</p><p>We are afraid of frivolous people like Cain; this kind of people cannot serve God. This is a basic principle. They say, "We are in the denominations. The denominations were not formed by us; they were formed by our forefathers. We bear some responsibility in them. We cannot say, `Good! Let us be united tomorrow.' This is impossible. What about the denominations we are in?" God wants the church to be united, but denominations divide it! When one begins to be conscious that it is wrong to be divided in this way, he must confess that this is wrong before God; he must tear it down. He should say, "O God, although this denomination was not formed by me but by my forefathers, I am sinful as long as I am a part of it. This is not just a personal matter; it involves the whole church of God. This is sin. Today I would ask You to tear it down; today I would declare that there is something wrong in it." This is the right way to act. Suppose I form a denomination and afterwards realize that something is wrong and try to ameliorate it by saying, "Let us have fellowship." I am afraid of this kind of frivolous and light-minded behavior. This is Cain's behavior, not condemning sin after he had sinned but trying to repair the situation instead. This is very unchristian. Brothers, are you clear? Do not think it is all right to not condemn but only attempt to repair it after you have sinned. This is never the expression of God's life!</p><p>For example, suppose I offend a brother by speaking many things behind his back. What should I do when I am rebuked by God's light? First, I must go to him and confess my sin: "Brother, I have sinned against you by speaking many things to undermine you behind your back. Please accept my apology." Then it is right for me to express some love to him the next day. What if a man sins against you, steals many things from you, speaks against you, and then behaves as if nothing has happened? He does not confess his sin at all, but turns around to treat you well and to send gifts to you. How would you feel about him? We Christians do have a way of doing things. If we have done something wrong, we cannot change a little without confessing our mistake. It is not right to act this way. This is not the way before God to solve our problems. Such a person should come to you and confess, "Brother, I am wrong. I owe you money, and I owe you other things." He must first confess his sin before he can show his love. This is the principle by which a Christian may be restored.</p><p>The principle here is the same. Today it is not just a matter of whether or not the denominations are right. What matters is that if we feel they are right, we must support them, but if we feel they are wrong, we have to tear them down. We should not shake hands over the fence. If we say it is right to have the fence, then we must build it higher. If we feel the fence is wrong, we must tear it down. We should not have "spiritual" fellowship. What they call "spiritual" fellowship means a fellowship that is not thorough enough. Even though the denominations are wrong, some are reluctant to forsake them; they still want to preserve them while at the same time stretching their hand out for a little fellowship with others. If we fall into this category, it is definitely not of God. I do not know if we see this clearly. We must see this thoroughly before we can go out to deal with the situations in each locality. It is not enough for those who formerly closed themselves from others to merely open the window, shake hands over the fence, and think that this is all they need to do. If this fence should exist, I will build it stronger and higher, but if this fence should not exist, I will tear it down. Keeping different denominations and yet having fellowship is self-deception.</p><p>Today in China, there are probably three kinds of unity. The first kind is the unity of the Roman Catholic Church. The second kind is the "spiritual unity," which means that although the separating "cups" still  exist outwardly, one tells himself that such "cups" do not exist in his heart. This seems strange to me! If the denominations are not important, why should people allow them to exist? If the denominations are not important, why do people react when the denominations are touched? It is quite puzzling. If the denominations are important, we should support them; if they are not, we should tear them down. If fellowship is necessary, let us fellowship and not have the so-called "spiritual" fellowship. This is a really good term, but its usage has been spoiled. It is not really a "spiritual" fellowship but only a "half-way" fellowship! If this matter is made clear, I think the problem of unity can be solved easily.</p><p>With this kind of "spiritual" unity there is a great problem: Those who advocate "spiritual" unity give their attention to God's children while neglecting God's command. In other words, they pay attention to the feeling of God's children but forget the feeling of God Himself. A man who supports the denominations is one who knows God very little. But many people dare not support the denominations if they are asked. They feel that the denominations are sin. However, because they have a consideration for many of God's children in the denominations, they are not faithful enough to thoroughly unveil the truth of God to them. They do not show them how the divisions among God's children are against God's will. They are afraid that this will create some kind of partition between them and many of God's children who are in the denominations. If they are asked whether or not they advocate and support the denominations, they would be somewhat bothered because they have studied the Word and received some light. Denominations are condemned before God and rejected by God. Nevertheless, they want to have a "spiritual" unity. This kind of "spiritual" unity or this attitude of shaking hands over the fence is nothing but a method to accommodate, a method to reconcile, and a method of compromise. They dare not utterly uphold the denominations, but they are reluctant to utterly forsake the denominations. Consequently, they allow the denominations to exist and advocate a "spiritual" unity, a "spiritual" fellowship. The real significance of what they call "spiritual" unity is a reluctance to be absolute toward God or to follow His Word. They dare not be absolute toward God for fear of men. The fear of being absolute toward God is today's difficulty. In fact, many advocate "spiritual" fellowship and "spiritual" oneness because they cannot come up to the Lord's demand; they are not absolute toward the Lord. This method is not from the teaching of the Scriptures, but from man's wisdom and fear.</p><p>I believe that when we do not stand on the side of God's children to excuse their weaknesses and their failures, but stand on the Lord's side to look at His glory and His holiness, we will see that unity by accommodation is not of the Lord's will and is not scriptural. We must be very clear about this. If we are clear about this, we can solve the problems.</p><h2 class="head2">The Unity in the Scriptures</h2><p>Now we will look at the third kind of unity, that is, the unity in the Scriptures.</p><h2 class="head3">The Inherent Unity of the Body</h2><p>The Scriptures show us that the church is the Body of Christ and that there is only one Body. The Scriptures also show us that God through the Holy Spirit dwells in the church and that the Holy Spirit is one Spirit. Thus, the Scriptures give special attention to the "one Spirit" and the "one Body" (1 Cor. 12:12-13; Eph. 4:4). We also must give our special attention to this.</p><p>The church of Christ is the Body of Christ. If we only consider it as the church, we may not feel that it matters whether or not there is some division, thinking that little harm is done even though there is a little division here and a little division there. If we only consider it as God's people, again it may not matter whether or not there is some division here and there. If we only consider it as God's army, it may not matter whether or not there is some division. Finally, if we only consider it as the house of God, it may be all right if it is divided into several houses. But the Word of God also tells us that the church of Christ is the Body of Christ. With a body, division is absolutely impossible. We cannot separate three members here and five members there and another two over there. It is impossible. Everything else in the world can be divided, but not the body. Once the body is divided, it becomes a corpse. Once the church is divided, the world only has the corpse of Christ, not the Body of Christ. It is a serious matter to God when the church is divided. The children of God cannot be divided, just as the body cannot be divided. The church cannot be divided. Yet today, God's children have become insensitive to divisions; they do not consider them as a serious matter. Please remember, a body cannot be divided! The church is the Body of Christ. In nature it is the Body, and one Spirit dwells in it. Therefore, the unity of the church in the Scriptures is the unity of the nature of the Body, which is indivisible.</p><p>Today we want to ask one question: Since the Bible shows us that the unity of the church is the unity of the one Holy Spirit dwelling in the one Body, how can it be expressed?</p><h2 class="head3">Not One Church, but Seven Golden Lampstands</h2><p>The Roman Catholic Church tells us that since the Body of Christ is one, we should only organize one church on the earth. We have already seen that this is not the teaching of the Scriptures. The Scriptures do say that the Body of Christ is one, but they never require the church on the earth to become one like the Roman Catholic Church. Otherwise, the word churches would be a great mistake and the Scriptures should not contain such a term. We cannot say churches and also say one church. Since the Scriptures speak of "churches," we know that God has no intention of uniting all the churches on the earth into one church. Furthermore, the apostles in the Bible never organized one church. They established churches in many places, and they established one church in each city. The Holy Spirit did not lead them to establish just one church. One worldwide church is only the opinion of the Roman Catholic Church; the unity of Roman Catholicism is manmade, not scriptural.</p><p>Let us look at the Scriptures again. We see the outward appearance of the church on this earth, which might be wrong. By the outward appearance alone, it may not be easy to understand whether the church on the earth should be many churches or one church. The best way is to go before the Lord and see how the Lord looks at the churches on the earth. This cannot be wrong. Thank God! According to the Scriptures, the church in each locality has a representative before the Lord. This is the preciousness of Revelation 1&mdash;3, which shows us the "seven churches in Asia." This does not mean that only seven churches existed on this earth but that these seven were representative examples. Revelation 1&mdash;3 shows us how the seven churches in Asia were before the Lord in heaven. There were seven golden lampstands placed before Him. Do you see? The churches on earth may be wrong, entirely wrong, but the churches in heaven, the churches before the throne, the churches before the Lord, cannot be wrong. Saying these churches are wrong is blasphemous and terrible!</p><p>How were the seven churches in Asia before the Lord? They were seven golden lampstands. In other words, for every church on the earth, there is a golden lampstand in heaven. These seven churches were in seven different localities: Ephesus was a locality, Smyrna was a locality, Pergamos was a locality, etc.; there was a total of seven localities. There were seven lampstands in heaven because there were seven churches on earth. It is not God's will to unify the churches on earth into one church. If it were God's will to unify all the churches on earth into one church, then God in heaven would have only one lampstand, not seven. Brothers, this is very clear. We must think, and the Lord causes us to think. If we would just think a little, we would realize that if the Lord has only one church on earth, He would have only one lampstand in heaven. There are seven lampstands, however, and they are seven churches in seven localities. In each locality there is a lampstand. It is obvious to us that God's purpose is not to unify the churches into one church.</p><p>The term lampstand is very familiar to us; it is also found in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament one lampstand with seven branches was placed before God, signifying that all the Israelites were united as one nation. God did not want the nation of Israel to be divided into two nations. The division between the nations of Judah and Israel was not pleasing to God, because before God they were one. Dividing them into two was sin; therefore, Jeroboam sinned. But in the New Testament there is not one lampstand with seven branches, but seven different lampstands. In other words, God's original thought concerning the church is to have the respective churches standing before Him independently.</p><p>Do you see? There is not one lampstand with seven branches, but seven lampstands. The Lord was walking in the midst of these seven lampstands. They were placed there side by side, and the Lord walked in their midst (Rev. 2:1). If it were one lampstand with seven branches, the Lord could not walk in their midst. Therefore, in spiritual reality there are seven different lampstands before God, not seven lampstands united as one lampstand. This signifies that God has no intention of uniting the churches on the earth into one church. God never had such an intention.</p><p>In other words, God's ordained will concerning the nation of Israel is different from that concerning the church. God's ordained will concerning Israel is that it might be one nation on the earth, not two. God appointed only one place for the whole nation of Israel to worship, which was Jerusalem. The people of Israel were to go to Jerusalem every year, not to any other place. They set up Bethel, but this was not pleasing to God. It was a high place, not God's center. Today God does not desire that the churches on earth be unified and take Rome as a center like Jerusalem. Today, there are seven different churches. Therefore, the unity of the Body of Christ does not mean that the churches on earth must be formed into one church. The Bible does not contradict itself. The Bible shows us that there is only one Body of Christ. The Bible also shows us that God does not want the churches to be unified into one church on the earth. The unity that God desires is not that the churches should be combined into one big church and formed into one great unity.</p><p>We are studying this matter step by step. We have just seen how the Bible speaks concerning the Body and the church. The unity spoken of in the Bible does not refer to the unity of one big church. To what then does the unity of the Body, which the Lord desires, refer? It must refer to something else. The unity of Catholicism cannot be applied; it is not of God. This is the first point.</p><h2 class="head3">Once There Is a Denomination,<br />There Is a Division</h2><p>Now we will look at the second point. Our brothers say that we should have a "spiritual" fellowship, a "spiritual" unity. Does the unity of the Body of Christ refer to the "spiritual" unity as advocated by the brothers in the denominations today? It is half "yes" and half "no." The Bible clearly shows us that God's children should not be divided, but the denominations are obviously divisions. Once we have a denomination, we can see a division. As long as a division exists, do not talk about "spiritual" unity! This behavior lacks thoroughness, as we have already mentioned. We cannot advocate unity on the one hand, yet advocate denominations on the other hand. We cannot keep the divisions on the one hand and talk about unity on the other hand. Just as in the illustrations concerning the cups, the lower half of the picture&mdash;the many cups&mdash;is wrong, while the upper half of the picture&mdash;hands stretched out in fellowship&mdash;is right. I think it is clear enough that the Bible says denominations are wrong. Galatians 5:19-21 even lists denominations (sects) as a work of the flesh: "And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as..factions, divisions, sects..."</p><p>How does God want us to manifest the unity of the Body? The unity of the Body is not the unity of the whole earth, like the uniting of many churches into one united church; neither is it staying in the denominations and talking about a "spiritual" unity. What is the unity of the Body as spoken of in the Bible? I would like to spend some time to study this matter with you.</p><h2 class="head3">The Church Spoken of in Ephesians<br />and Colossians Being Universal<br />Both in Space and in Time</h2><p>Two Epistles in the Bible especially speak about the church: Ephesians and Colossians. Everyone who studies the Bible knows that the church spoken of in Ephesians and Colossians is the "one church," which is the unique church of God. This church not only refers to the church on the earth, because even though the church on the earth is broad enough to include everyone according to space, it can only include a section of the church according to time. Suppose five hundred million people are saved on the earth today. The church in the books of Ephesians and Colossians includes more than these five hundred million people. These five hundred million are only the believers in 1951. Before this, in 1950, there were believers who had died. Even in 1951, some believers died before the counting took place. There were also believers who died before 1950, say in 1051. The brothers and sisters in the apostle Paul's time no longer live on this earth today. In other words, the church of Christ in Ephesians and Colossians includes all the saved ones throughout the whole world, in every nation and at all times, both past and present. It covers time as well as space. This is called the Body of Christ. Today, even if all the Christians throughout the whole world are united together, they would still not be the Body of Christ. Although we are living, many have already died; although we are living, many more will be born. Many brothers and sisters will be saved tomorrow. They are in the Body of Christ; we cannot say that they should not be counted. Therefore, the church in any particular period of time on the earth is not the Body of Christ. Even if all the children of God who are on this earth were gathered together, they would not be sufficient to become the Body of Christ. Spacewise it would be sufficient, but timewise it would be wrong to say that it is the Body, because many generations have passed away. All the believers of past generations, all the believers of the present, and all the believers of the future are the Body of Christ.</p><p>Ephesians and Colossians speak of the church in this context. This unity is the right spiritual unity. It is impossible to maintain a church with Paul as an elder and Peter as a pastor, because they have passed away. Hence, this unity is spiritual, and this all-encompassing unity is correct. As long as a person is a brother in the Lord, we have fellowship with him. Even though some brothers have passed away, we are still one with them. We are one with any brother or sister. This is the genuine spiritual unity, which is universal both in time and space.</p><h2 class="head3">The Unity Spoken of<br />in 1 Corinthians and Philippians<br />Referring to the Unity of the Church<br />in One Locality</h2><p>Although we acknowledge the fellowship and unity of Ephesians and Colossians before the Lord, we must remember that this kind of fellowship and unity can easily become idealistic. It is quite possible that we can advocate the unity of the Body on the one hand, yet actually be for the second kind of unity, whereby both denominations and unity are advocated at the same time, on the other hand. Before the Lord, we need to see that the unity of Christians in the Bible is not spoken of in just the Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians but also in two other Epistles: 1 Corinthians and Philippians. The unity of Christians in these last two Epistles also refers to the unity of the Body.</p><p>The unity spoken of in 1 Corinthians clearly does not refer to unity that is universal both in space and in time but to unity of the church in Corinth. I think this word is clear enough. There were contentions among the brothers at Corinth, not the whole Body of Christ. It only concerned a few brothers who were in Corinth. So when Paul exhorted them to be one, he was merely exhorting them to be one with the brothers in their locality. It was as if he was saying, "All the brothers living in Corinth are the church in Corinth; you must express the oneness of the Body in the locality of Corinth. You must not be divided in Corinth."</p><h2 class="head3">"You" Referring to the Believers in Corinth</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:10 says: "Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same things.." To whom does you refer? It refers to the Christians at Corinth, the brothers at Corinth. "..and that there be no divisions among you.." Again, you refers to the Christians at Corinth. "..but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion." This also refers to the Christians in Corinth. Here we see one thing: If the unity of the Body spoken of in the Bible is not expressed in a locality, it is not practical. It is easy to say, "We love all the children of God, except the one next door! The children of God are one, including Paul and all those who are not yet born, except a few brothers here in Shanghai!" This is impractical as well as self-deceptive. We cannot talk about the unity of the Body and say that we are one with everyone except with the few brothers who live together with us in the same place! According to Paul, the minimum requirement for speaking of unity is in the context of the local church. If the Christians in Corinth want to talk about the unity of the Body, they should not talk about it in Rome or talk about it in Jerusalem, but talk about it in Corinth. If we do not talk about it in Corinth, it is useless. We are deceiving ourselves. Suppose I live in Shanghai, but I do not get along with the brothers in Shanghai. However, I get along quite well with the brothers in Nanking. This is useless, and I am deceiving myself. The unity of the Body required by the Scriptures has a minimum boundary requirement, which is the locality. The brothers in Corinth must be one with the brothers in Corinth. If they are not one in Corinth, all their words just deceive others.</p><p>"Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" (v. 12). Note the phrase each of you. Who is this? Of course, it is the Corinthians. It would not be right for Paul to speak these words about the brothers in Jerusalem, because the Jerusalem brothers would say that they had not said anything. Neither would it be right if Paul had applied these words to the brothers in Antioch, because they had not said them. Only the brothers in Corinth said them. Here the Lord gives us the light for the most basic form of unity; that is, the believers in Corinth must be one at least in Corinth. If unity in Corinth cannot be realized, they should not talk about unity with others. They must be one at least in one place. Perhaps a brother at Corinth can recite the whole book of Ephesians, saying that we must love one another. Of course, we all will love one another in the "heaven" in the future, but the problem is whether or not we love one another today. We all will have fellowship in the "heaven" in the future, but the problem is whether or not we have fellowship today. What we have today is practical. Today in His Word, God's minimum requirement for the unity of His children is the locality. If the minimum requirement cannot be met, everything else is false. The brothers who were divided at Corinth said, "You are of Paul, I am of Cephas, he is of Apollos," and someone stood up to say, "I am of Christ." While they were contending among themselves, Paul told them they must be one.</p><p>Let us see how Paul rebuked them: "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it [at the time when you were first saved]. But neither yet now [after being saved for a long time] are you able, for you are still fleshly. For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man?" (3:1-3). This refers to chapter one. The Corinthians were involved in envy, strife, and divisions; they were fleshly, having the same view of these things as they did when they were first saved. They did not improve at all. When they were first saved, they took milk, but they were still taking milk. If they continued in envy, strife, and divisions, they would be fleshly their whole lives. They would still be drinking milk in their sixties, seventies, and eighties.</p><p>The expression of spirituality is in the unity of the church, and the manifestation of the flesh is in the divisions of the church. We cannot call ourselves spiritual and still remain in the divisions. If we are, we are self-deceived. How clear is this word: "For you are still fleshly. For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man?"</p><p>Paul also repeated the words of chapter one in the following verse: "For when someone says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men of flesh?" (3:4). He was showing them that divisions are fleshly before God, no matter how good they are before man. The mark of spirituality is oneness; the mark of fleshliness is divisions, envy, and strife.</p><p>We must notice that Paul did not pay attention to any problem arising between the brothers at Corinth and the brothers at Ephesus, or between the brothers at Corinth and the brothers at Colossae. He did not point out any problems between the brothers at Corinth and the brothers at Laodicea, or between the brothers at Corinth and the brothers at Philippi. Paul only paid attention to the divisions between the brothers at Corinth. They said, "I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of Cephas, and I am of Christ," but in effect Paul said, "Brothers! You are brothers at Corinth; you must not have envy, strife, and divisions at Corinth." A boundary does exist. There should not be envy, strife, and divisions in the church at Corinth. To whom does you refer? It refers to the church at Corinth. Unity in the Scriptures involves the unity of the Holy Spirit and of the Body. However, the unity of the Holy Spirit and of the Body has a minimum boundary requirement; that is, this unity must be expressed within a local church.</p><h2 class="head3">The "Body" Referring to the Children of God<br />in a Certain Time and at a Certain Place</h2><p>We have just seen the negative view of division; now let us see the positive view of unity as is demanded in the Bible. "We who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread" (1 Cor. 10:17). Here Paul said, "We who are many..." This includes the children of God at Corinth. This "one bread" is the bread on the table at Corinth. During the breaking of bread at Corinth, a loaf was displayed before the children of God, indicating that though they were many, they were still one bread. In other words, the Body of Christ that the brothers at Corinth should express must at least be expressed at Corinth. Here we must recall the situation at that time. Let us take our mind back to the time at Corinth. When the brothers and sisters gathered together, a loaf was displayed before them, with all the saints gathered around it. Perhaps fifty were breaking bread together; Paul was saying that the fifty, being many, are one bread.</p><p>In other words, the Body of Christ has a universal expression: the church; this church is the Body of Christ. But the brothers in each locality also express the Body of Christ. It does not mean that the brothers at Corinth are the Body of Christ, while the brothers at Ephesus are not the Body of Christ. It means that the children of God at Corinth are the Body of Christ; so, both according to the spiritual principle and the spiritual fact, they should express themselves as the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is the universal church, the church which is in all places and throughout all generations both in space and in time. However, the brothers in a locality must at least stand in the same position, applying the same principle to express the same fact. In other words, the minimum boundary of unity is the boundary of locality. In the locality of Corinth, the unity of the Body, the unity of life, must be expressed. This is very wonderful. The Body spoken of in Ephesians refers to all the children of God, but the Body spoken of in Corinthians refers to the children of God in a certain time and at a certain place. The children of God there and then are also the Body of Christ.</p><p>As we continue reading 1 Corinthians 12, we see the matter of the Body again. The one Body with the one Holy Spirit is discussed: "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ" (v. 12). "If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body. And if the ear should say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body....And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you" (vv. 15-16, 21). First Corinthians 12 speaks of the Body of Christ in much detail. The Body of Christ spoken of in 1 Corinthians is different from that which is spoken of in Ephesians. As I have said, the Body of Christ in Ephesians refers to the universal church. This is not a problem to most Bible students. But the Body of Christ in 1 Corinthians 12 refers to the church at Corinth. This is because it is different from that which is spoken of in Ephesians. The Head in Ephesians refers to whom? Ephesians 5:23 says, "Christ is Head of the church." First Corinthians 12 also speaks of the head, but to whom does this refer? First Corinthians 12:21 says, "And the eye cannot say to the hand..." Here the eye is a member, and the hand is also a member. Verse 21 continues, "..nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you." The head spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12, therefore, is a member.</p><p>This statement cannot be used and applied as an illustration in Ephesians&mdash;that would be terrible. A parallel cannot be drawn here. If it were, the Head would be in a very low position. The head in 1 Corinthians 12 is but a member, the position of which is different from that of the Head in Ephesians. The Head in Ephesians is absolutely Christ, while the head in 1 Corinthians 12 is one among the brothers who acts as a head. He is but one of the members, not the unique Head. He is low, not high. Thus, for the expression of the unity of the Body, the Bible shows us that locality is the minimum boundary. I hope the brothers and sisters will see that the minimum requirement of unity in the Bible is the unity of locality. God's children must have spiritual unity in each locality. This is the basic demand of the Bible.</p><p>What then is the purpose of God? It is "that there would be no division in the body" (v. 25). Paul said this because of the divisions spoken of in chapters one and three. Paul showed them that having divisions in the locality of Corinth was the same as having divisions in the Body of Christ. Unity must have locality as its boundary. If I live at Corinth, at a minimum I must be one with the children of God in the locality of Corinth; at a minimum I must live out a life that is in oneness at Corinth. I cannot have divisions.</p><h2 class="head3">We Must Love the Brothers at Corinth</h2><p>In chapter thirteen Paul speaks about love. Paul speaks so seriously about love in chapter thirteen because only love is contrary to divisions. Love unites; love does not divide. In Corinth there were envy and strife; so Paul said that love does not envy, does not seek its own things or take account of evil, and does not divide or separate. Paul exhorted the believers in Corinth to at least love one another in the locality of Corinth.</p><p>Today a certain kind of condition prevails in the church: People preach the doctrine of loving one another, but they forget about locality. They feel that the locality is not important. Brothers, it is easy to be idealistic when we preach about loving one another but to forget the matter of locality. It is easy to say, "All the brothers and sisters are lovable except the few in Shanghai!" What should we do? The brothers in Shanghai feel this way; the brothers in Nanking also feel that the brothers are good except for the ones in Nanking. Let me tell you that God says to the brothers in Shanghai: Love the brothers in Shanghai first and the brothers in Nanking later. God also says to the brothers in Nanking: Love the brothers in Nanking first and the brothers in Shanghai later. The brothers in Corinth needed to love the brothers in Corinth first and then they could ascend into heaven to see the Body of Christ. First they needed to descend to see the Body of Christ in 1 Corinthians before they could ascend to see it in Ephesians. They needed to descend to see the Body of Christ in 1 Corinthians because it is much more practical.</p><p>If we cannot love the brothers whom we see, how can we love the brothers whom we cannot see? The apostle John said, "He who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen" (1 John 4:20). Today we need to add one more word: "If we cannot love the brothers whom we see, we cannot love the brothers whom we cannot see." Many do not love the brothers whom they see; they only love the unseen ones. This is what is called "spiritual" fellowship because everything that cannot be seen is "spiritual." If we stand in this position, great difficulties will befall the church. The fellowship among the children of God, the love for one another among the children of God, the care for one another among the children of God, and the oneness among the children of God must start from the locality. Locality is the minimum requirement.</p><h2 class="head3">The Demand to Be Like-minded in Philippians</h2><p>In the book of Philippians Paul also exhorted the brothers to be one: "For your fellowship [oneness] unto the furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now" (1:5). Later, Paul spoke of another aspect in verses 15 and 17: "Some preach Christ even because of envy and strife...others announce Christ out of selfish ambition." This was not a universal condition of the church but a local matter in Philippi. Some brothers preached Christ in oneness, while some preached Christ out of envy, saying, "If you can preach, I can too. If you can do it, why cannot I?" So they also preached.</p><p>In Philippians 2:2 Paul exhorted, "Think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing." I would like to point out the phrase that you think the same thing. This does not refer to the universal church. Although the universal church can learn from this instance, this word especially refers to the Philippians, since Paul wrote the letter to the Philippians. The Christians, the brothers, in Philippi needed to think the same thing. It is useless for them to think the same thing as the brothers in the church in Shanghai or the brothers in the church in Lanchow. They have to think the same thing as the brothers in Philippi. This is the commandment of the Bible. Thinking the same thing must have locality as its minimum requirement. If this is lacking, all doctrines are idealistic and imaginary. It is amazing that many brothers are very spiritual in the heavens, but fleshly on earth. Their idea is very spiritual but their practice is fleshly.</p><p>Following this, Paul said that if they thought the same thing, had the same love, were joined in soul, and thought the one thing, his joy would be made full.</p><p>"Doing nothing by way of selfish ambition" (v. 3a). This word was spoken to the Philippians. The Philippians should not have done anything by way of selfish ambition. Paul brought out the reason for doing things by selfish ambition: Some covet vainglory. These seekers of vainglory are easily separated from the brothers. Those who desire to have glory before man get into trouble with others. Some are proud and esteem themselves highly; they are unable to be one with others. "But in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves" (v. 3b). This will enable us to be one with others. Some care only for their own things and are very selfish; so it is also easy for them to cause trouble. Paul continued, "Not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also" (v. 4). This is the reason that many people cannot think the same thing, cannot have the same love, cannot be joined in soul, cannot be one with others. Some care only for themselves, some are proud, some seek glory and desire others to applaud them. These kinds of people can never be one with others. We must learn to be humble, not seeking glory from man, and we must learn to take care of others. Then we can be one with other children of God. This is the scriptural principle, and we need to follow it accordingly.</p><p>Paul praised the Philippians for their fellowship (oneness) in preaching the gospel, but in fact, they had contentions. This made the exhortation in chapter two necessary. There were contentions in Philippi not only among the brothers but also among the sisters. In chapter four Paul especially mentioned two sisters: "I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord" (v. 2). These two names are feminine. We do not know how much of a story lies behind this word; Paul did not reveal this to us. He only said, "I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord." This correction shows us on the one hand that there was strife in Philippi, and on the other hand that this strife was limited to this locality because of the names he mentioned. By now I think we should see at least one thing: The unity of the Body or the unity of the Holy Spirit in the Bible refers to the unity in locality. Unity apart from locality is entirely vain. We cannot say that we are able to be one everywhere except in our own locality.</p><h2 class="head3">The Church in the Bible Being Local</h2><p>Now we shall go on to see the reason we stress the expression of unity in locality. This is because the church in the Bible is local. We have spoken about this for many years and have mentioned it even now a number of times. The church in the Bible is local. A single exception cannot be seen in the whole New Testament. All the churches are local: the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, the church in Corinth, the church in Philippi, the church in Colossae, etc. All the examples in the Bible are local. For example, in the book of Revelation, the churches in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea are all local. God ordained one church in each locality. The localities and the churches are equal to each other. The countries on the earth are divided into cities; the church of God on the earth today is also divided into cities. In the world there is the locality of Shanghai; hence, there is a church in Shanghai before God. In the world there is a locality of Nanking; hence, there is the church in Nanking before God. In the world there are the localities of Sian and Lanchow; hence, there is the church in Sian and the church in Lanchow before God. As long as there is a place big enough to be a locality, there should be a church in that locality. If our place is not big enough to be a locality, we cannot be a church. Lanchow is big enough in the eyes of God to be a locality; therefore, there can be a church in Lanchow. Before God this matter is very clear.</p><p>The Bible determines a locality according to the limit of a city or a village. In 1 Corinthians for example, which we have just read, there is a very good word: "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church" (4:17). "Everywhere" is the locality; "every church" is the spiritual content. In every locality there is a church. "Everywhere" is divided in the Bible according to a city or a village. The Lord Jesus preached the gospel in every city and in every village (Matt. 9:35); therefore, the unit of locality is the city or village. Paul said to Titus, "Appoint elders in every city, as I directed you" (Titus 1:5). During that time Paul preached the gospel in the cities; he had not gone into the villages. Hence, he did not mention villages. All the churches in the Bible are local. This is the problem today: The unity of the children of God must have locality as its unit. In other words, the minimum unit for the unity of the children of God must be the unit of locality. All the children of God in the same locality must be one. This is the minimum requirement.</p><h2 class="head3">There Should Be Spiritual Fellowship<br />between the Churches</h2><p>Now I wish to discuss a problem which God's children face in connection with this matter. I have already spoken of the second kind of unity, part of which is right and part of which is wrong. What does this mean? Should there be the "spiritual fellowship" they talk about? Part of it should exist, and part of it should not. The way to fulfill the part that should exist is that there should be spiritual fellowship between one local church and another local church. The Bible shows us that the church is local, so there must be the unity of the church in a locality. Therefore, I have said that if there is no unity in a locality, all other words are vain and self-deceptive. Fellowship among the churches does not mean that a locality neglects its own affairs and takes care of the affairs of another locality. It does not mean that the brothers in Tiensui take care of the affairs of Pingliang but not the affairs in Tiensui. Rather, it means that Tiensui and Pingliang should have fellowship in spiritual matters.</p><p>The unity of the church, the unity of the Body, has locality as its unit. But we also must have spiritual unity with brothers in other localities. This spiritual unity is not a unity between one denomination and another denomination, but a unity between one church and another church. This spiritual unity is not a unity between divisions, but the unity between members of the Body. Here are two local churches. Between these two local churches, we should seek the unity of the Holy Spirit, the unity of the Body, the unity in the Lord's way, and unity in every aspect in order to express the spiritual unity between the churches. If we apply this spiritual unity to the denominations instead of to the churches, this is wrong. It is wrong to place spiritual unity in the context of the sects instead of in the context of the localities. The subject is right, but the application is wrong.</p><h2 class="head2">The Unity of Congregationalism</h2><p>Now let us see the importance of the boundary of locality. Perhaps we first should look at history. We have seen that in the beginning the churches in the Bible were local. Later, these churches were united to form provincial or district churches. Still later, they were united into an international church under the pope. When the churches were harmonious with God's purpose in the beginning, they were local. Gradually, however, they degraded until there was only one church in the whole world, the Roman Catholic Church. During the Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church was broken up. In this breaking apart, the original local churches were not restored. Subsequent to this breaking apart, the international church became national churches with state churches in different nations. There was some improvement, some advancement, at this stage, with the churches being somewhat closer to the likeness of those in the beginning. The state churches later became independent churches. Within a nation, there were scores, hundreds, and even thousands of small churches. These independent churches took another step closer to the situation in the beginning.</p><p>We must realize how difficult it was for these independent churches to be established. For example, the church in many nations insisted that sermons could only be preached in holy places. These holy places were the dedicated sanctuaries. John Wesley rose up and said that preaching could be done anywhere. He was greatly persecuted! The state church declared that messages preached in undedicated places were defiled. In addition to the place being dedicated, the person preaching the message had to be ordained; no ordinary person was allowed to preach. This is the reason Darby said that Paul, Peter, and John could not have preached according to this view, because they were not ordained. For the state churches, preaching was serious, location was serious, and setting up new churches was even more serious. Even Luther, during the Reformation, dared not establish a church. It was the political power that forced him to do so. Nevertheless, after Wesley was raised up, the climate gradually changed as independent churches were established. The international church had evolved into national churches, and the national churches had evolved into independent churches.</p><p>Among these independent churches, a doctrine that became quite prevalent was the so-called congregationalism, which means that every independent congregation is a church. Who believed in congregationalism? It was the Congregationalists and the Baptists. What is meant by congregationalism? Many children of God among them in their reading of the Bible saw that the churches were all independent of one another. The church in Jerusalem had its own administration, the church in Antioch took care of its own affairs, and the church in Corinth, as well as the church in Ephesus, also had its own administration. Although the church was universal, they thought that each congregation was the unit of church administration. Hence, it was called "congregationalism." They set up congregational churches with each congregation serving as a church. There was no archbishop above them. Compared with the other independent churches, this was an improvement. Now we see progress in these various stages; the international church improved to become national churches, national churches improved to become independent churches, and some independent churches improved to become congregational churches.</p><h2 class="head3">The Mistake of Congregationalism</h2><p>Congregationalism is actually very close to the Bible, but it goes a little beyond the Bible. The Congregationalist brothers studied the Bible but failed to discover the thought of locality. Jerusalem is a city, not a congregation; Antioch is a city, not a congregation; Ephesus is a port city, not a congregation; Colossae is a city on a hill, not a congregation. They thought that Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, and Colossae were congregations, and they concluded that congregations were independent of each other. Church history tells us that not long after its beginning, the church deteriorated until the time of Luther. Afterward there was a recovery, an improvement, until the stage of the independent churches. From the time of the independent churches, the church went to another extreme of taking a congregation as the unit. This included Congregationalists and Baptists and later even the Open Brethren who also went to the extreme of considering a congregation as the unit.</p><p>Now I wish to discuss the reason that congregationalism is wrong. It is the closest to the Bible; yet it is still wrong. The Lord desires that we love one another, receive one another, and avoid envy, strife, and divisions in the same local church. The unity of congregationalism takes the congregation as its unit. This poses a problem in that it is difficult to pin down such a thing as a congregation. There may be one congregation at 145 Nanyang Road and another at 143 Nanyang Road. If I love the brothers at 145 Nanyang Road, I will meet with them. When I disagree with them, I will set up another congregation at 143 Nanyang Road. If we have seen that unity is a matter of locality, we could only go and set up a church in another city, not another one in Shanghai. This is not easy, but still we must love one another. Oh, how great is the Lord's wisdom in putting us in localities and giving us the locality as the boundary! Only here can we really find the cross to bear and the lessons to learn.</p><p>What is the meaning of a congregational church? It means that there can be several congregations within each locality, each having a unity within itself and each independent of the others. This is a very serious matter. The unity of congregationalism is a mistake. The mistake of the international church goes to one extreme, causing many localities to have one church, but the mistake of the congregational churches goes to the opposite extreme, causing one locality to have many churches. The Roman Catholic Church is at one end, with many localities having one church, and the congregational churches are at the other end, with one locality having many churches. This is like a pendulum that swings to one side with many localities having one church and then swings to the other side with one locality having five to ten churches. In the last century the Brethren were raised up, but some of them fell into congregationalism. They were mainly separated into the Closed Brethren and the Open Brethren. The Closed Brethren are still on the side of the united church; the Open Brethren have gone to the other side and become congregations, "chapel" assemblies. They may have one assembly on one street and another assembly on another street, each having nothing to do with the other. This means they have many churches in one locality.</p><h2 class="head3">One Locality with One Church</h2><p>Therefore, we must see clearly before God that in the Bible there is one locality with one church, or in short, one locality, one church. This is the principle in the Bible. If we study the matter of the church, we must be able to understand this principle of one locality, one church. Every mistake comes from violating this principle. One locality, one church is the pendulum. When it swings to one side, it is wrong because it causes three or four localities to have one church or the whole world to have one church. When it swings to the opposite side, it is also wrong because it causes one locality to have several or many churches. There is something abnormal in connection with the locality, or there is something abnormal in connection with the church. In the Bible there is one locality, one church. At the time of the apostles, the population of the city of Jerusalem was about one million. It was one of the most highly populated cities. Many localities in China today are still not as highly populated. At that time three thousand people were saved and then five thousand (Acts 2:41; 4:4). The number of the saved eventually reached several tens of thousands of people (21:20). That was really unusual. Since there was no place large enough for them to meet together, they met from house to house. However, the Bible does not speak of "the churches in Jerusalem." I doubt whether they could easily find a meeting place large enough for three to five thousand to gather together. It may be that all these people did not meet together even once. It could be that they met in the wilderness; we do not know. Although the city was very large and there were many believers, they were still one church. Hence, the Bible shows us one locality, one church.</p><p>We have seen clearly that the Roman Catholic Church has swung to one side with the principle of having one church with many localities. Another group of people are on the other side with the principle of one locality having many churches. In the same locality, you are one church and others are another. This is congregationalism. It is enough to love those in the same congregation and not care for the other congregation. The Open Brethren have gone in the direction of the congregational church; the Closed Brethren have gone in the direction of the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p>Thus, we face a huge problem in China. We must maintain a testimony against the work of the Roman Catholic Church on one hand and the work of congregational churches on the other hand. If we are just a little careless, congregationalism will appear. If we are clear that there is one locality, one church, then we will be clear about Roman Catholicism and congregationalism. For instance, Sian is a locality; therefore, there should be one church there. Regardless of whether the church in Sian is good or bad, it is the one church there. If I am right with the brothers in Sian, I am in the church in Sian; if I am not right with the brothers in Sian, I am still in the church in Sian.</p><p>Now let us see the consequences of congregationalism. If I am a believer of congregationalism and I am right with the brothers, then I will break bread with them; if I am not, we will break bread separately because you love your group and I love my group. This kind of breaking of bread costs nothing; it is unnecessary to hire a pastor. We can just set up a table as we like and break bread. We can form another church, love one another, wash one another's feet from morning to evening, have a love feast at every meal, and have very good fellowship. But the Bible says one locality, one church. The Bible says that "we [the saints in the same locality] who are many are..one bread" (1 Cor. 10:17). But what are you? You, being few, are two loaves. You say, "We are one loaf and you also are a loaf"&mdash;this is congregationalism. It is a dreadful situation for the church once congregationalism appears. Roman Catholicism over a period of eleven hundred years had but one church. If congregationalism exists for a period of eleven hundred years, there may be hundreds and thousands of churches. Those who like contentions always seek causes of contention. Suppose I am contentious and have found a brother to contend with. The contention will end in a division. Then I will suffer because I will have no one to contend with; so I will look for someone else. This is appalling; the church will not only be divided into many pieces but will also advocate divisions. If the principle is wrong, difficulties will follow: once a disagreement occurs, you will set up a table and another will set up another table.</p><p>The Lord has shown us that one locality should have only one church, and one locality should have only one administration. So we must be limited by locality. If any brother is not one with me, I must wash his feet and beg him until he becomes one with me. Here are lessons for me to learn: My temper has to be dealt with; I need to find the reason a brother cannot be one with me and do my best to deal with it; otherwise, there will be no way for us to go on. If we act according to congregationalism, it is very convenient. Once anything disagreeable occurs, I will set up another church. Then in Shanghai there may not only be twenty-four home meetings, but twenty-four churches. Consequently, one locality with many churches will appear. This is a very serious matter. There is a boundary to our unity. The unity of the Roman Catholic Church is against the Scriptures, and "spiritual" unity has come short of the Lord's goal. The unity in the Scriptures is according to one locality with one church. This makes it impossible not to be one in each locality.</p><p>Suppose there are a few brothers with whom the church really seeks oneness. We should find out what their attitude is. Within these few days I have heard someone say, "We can talk and fellowship, even though you can still have your church, I have my church, and he has his church. We all are one; we all stand in our own position to be one with each other. We all have our own elders and deacons, yet we respect one another." I must tell these brothers emphatically that there is only one church in one locality. These ones' thought of rallying brothers together from a few denominations in a locality will only please a few churches. You may deal with the past and deal with it quite well with your cleverness, but what will you do with the future? We all will eventually pass away. What would you have the younger brothers do in the future? If our brothers practice congregationalism in every place, tolerating this kind of unity, to say nothing of sacrificing our obedience, what shall we do in the future? We may get by with five congregations today, but there will be some difficulty in the future, and with it a sixth congregation will appear. With more difficulties, a seventh and eighth will appear. What will we do then? We all must see this basic principle. The Lord's commandment is very clear: On the one hand, He will not allow us to have a united church so that we will not become a power on the earth and among men. On the other hand, He will not allow a church to become several churches in one locality; otherwise, future contentions will be endless.</p><p>I would like you to see that congregationalism is the result of brothers seeing the truth in the Bible only in part. There is no congregationalism in the Bible. Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Thyatira, and Laodicea are all localities. Throughout many years of church history, the Lord's light has become clearer and clearer: from the international church to the national church, from the national church to the independent church, and from the independent church, somewhat beyond the normal standard, to congregationalism. Within these last twenty to thirty years, the Lord has led us to see the local church. It is clear enough. The church today is taking the apostles' way. The church is local. We should not be proud to say that this is preached by us. This is the grace of God. God allowed His children to grope for more than a thousand years. Thank God! We have inherited what they gained and have found the way. Thank God! Although Congregationalism is wrong, it is an improvement. They saw that the "one church" of Roman Catholicism is wrong, but their improvement is beyond the standard.</p><p>Even such good brothers as the Brethren had contentions because one group of the Brethren took the way of the united church and another group took the way of the congregations. The China Inland Mission also practices congregationalism. Today the most prevailing practice is congregationalism. The little booklet written by Goodman entitled An Urgent Cry is also something of congregationalism. What is congregationalism? It is when there is an assembly on a certain street and also one nearby, each of which does not care for the other, whether the other is doing well or doing poorly. The only unity they seek is a unity within their own assembly. As long as they all can be one with each other, they meet together as one assembly; otherwise, they divide. The loving of one another as advocated by congregationalism is this kind of love; it is not limited by locality and does not attempt to learn its lessons within a locality. This is the reason I have said again and again that the lessons to be learned within a locality are an exceedingly severe matter. We live in this city, and it is not easy for us to move away. The Lord has placed us in a certain locality to thoroughly grind us. We cannot act as we like. Hence, we have lessons to learn and the cross to bear. Otherwise, there is no cross for us to bear; in just a few days we will throw away the cross.</p><p>We must see that Paul was against congregationalism in 1 Corinthians. Corinth is a city, and there was only one church in Corinth. "The church of God which is in Corinth" (1:2) is singular according to the Greek text. But how did the Corinthian brothers behave? They said, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" (v. 12). In other words, the one church was divided into four congregations. Those of Paul loved and came together with those of Paul. Those of Apollos found it easy to love and come together with those of Apollos. Those of Cephas came together with others of Cephas. And those of Christ came together with others of Christ and loved one another. But Paul said they were all fleshly, they were all men of flesh (1 Cor. 3:3-4). They were not of Paul, not of Apollos, not of Cephas, and not of Christ, but of the flesh. Paul would not allow them to belong to him, Apollos would not allow them to belong to him, Cephas would not allow them to belong to him, and neither would Christ allow them to belong to Him. They belonged to the flesh. There can be only one church in a city. The desire to be divided into parties or sects within the church is all of the flesh. According to the Bible, we should maintain nothing less than the unity of a church in one locality. Any unity smaller than this is inadmissible.</p><p>If we see this accurately before the Lord, we could say a very precise word to the brothers in the denominations. For example, in Pingliang and in Tiensui there can be only one church in each locality. Show them the Bible, regardless of which verse you use about the church, and ask them whether or not the church is local. In the past there was Corinth; today there is Pingliang. This transition is quite reasonable. In the past there was Ephesus; today there is Tiensui. This is also very reasonable. In the past there was one church in a locality; it should not be changed to several churches today. I know that many brothers are turning back to congregationalism today. Not long ago brothers in Shanghai advocated home churches. Quite simply, this is still congregationalism. Hence, we all must be clear to maintain one locality, one church. The pendulum should not swing to one side or to the other. According to the definition of a home church, each home meeting is a church. Thus, we have "churches" in Shanghai. If this could be so, then not only would there have been seven churches in Asia, but there could have been four churches in Corinth. There could be seven churches in Asia because Asia was a province; but there could not be four churches in Corinth because Corinth was a city. The Corinthians said, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ"; therefore, Paul said they were fleshly. The church is only one; it is impossible to have four churches in one locality. Once this problem is solved, all other problems are solved.</p><h2 class="head3">We Must Fear More to Found a Church<br />than to Do Anything</h2><p>Finally, we must pay attention to another problem. We have seen that the unity of the Body is expressed in the locality. If we do not pay attention to the unity in the locality, then other kinds of unity are vain words because they are not found in the Bible. Unity must be expressed in locality; otherwise, it is vain to talk about it. Unity must not wait until we go to heaven to be realized because we will all be one in heaven. Unity is being one with the brothers around us today. Otherwise, the error of congregationalism will follow. Those in the Roman Catholic Church have learned something about the church, but they have applied it incorrectly. Everyone in the Roman Catholic Church has seen that the church is one, but they are mistaken about the boundary. They think that there is only one church on the earth. What about us? In one point we are the same as they because we have seen that the church is one. However, they have one church for the whole earth; we have one church for each locality. Since Roman Catholicism believes that there is only one church in the whole earth, they have learned the lesson of not setting up another kind of church. This is a good point. No matter how great their difficulties are, they still stay together and dare not divide. Since they have seen that the church is one, they feel that they would be sinning against the Lord if they brought forth divisions. Today as we learn the same lesson, I expect to see the same kind of result, namely, that we will also not dare to set up other churches, but instead remain with the brothers to learn the same lesson.</p><p>I do not know how to speak to the brothers today. I feel we should learn our lesson so well before the Lord that we can do anything except set up another church. When we move to a locality, we may have the liberty to found a school, a hospital, a seminary, a corporation, or a factory. We may have the freedom to do anything. Even if it is not of the Lord, this is not the greatest sin. I am not saying that we should be disobedient to the Lord's will, but I am saying that such a mistake is not the greatest one. Certainly, however, we should never go out to set up another church. Setting up churches according to our own wishes is the greatest sin. We must fear founding a church more than anything else.</p><p>Brothers, do we see the seriousness of this matter? Nothing is worse than setting up a church at will. We can found anything, but we must never establish a church in this manner because this involves the problem of the Body of Christ. We must be clear about this matter before God.</p><p>Wherever we go, we first must find whether or not a church exists in that locality. It is not a matter of whether or not the church there is strong. That is another matter. It does not matter whether or not the church there is spiritual. That is a secondary matter. If there is a denomination at this end or a Roman Catholic Church at the other end, if there are many churches in one locality or one church in many localities, then there is not a church in that locality, and we can set up a church there. Because the church is local, it is neither congregationalism nor unionism. If there is a local church in a locality, we must not set up another. We must fear setting up another table for the breaking of bread. This is a terrible thing.</p><p>My heart is aching today because of those who have read some of our books and have seen a little about the truth of the church and then say, "Let us meet together." Brothers, it is not so simple! We cannot set up a church loosely at our pleasure. First, we need to see whether or not a church exists in our locality. If a local church already exists, then we must communicate with them even if we are unwilling. If there is a denomination or a sect, we cannot join it because we cannot stand in the denominations. But if there is a local church, we cannot set up another one under the pretense of helping it, even though we see some faults in it. We can only help it through teaching, not through setting up another church. My heart grieves because many people are not afraid of setting up another church. They presume that this is a very simple matter and that they can immediately set up a church after discussing it with three or four others. Brothers who are somewhat gifted, who have some scriptural knowledge, and who are capable in preaching, think that they can set up a church. I may have some trouble with my brothers, and it would not be difficult for me to go out to preach, to set up the Lord's table, and to build a meeting hall. But I could never do this, because the church is one in each locality.</p><p>Therefore, brothers, we must be brought to the place today that we would never commit the sin of dividing the Body of Christ. There is only one Body of Christ. I do not want to be such a carnal person, a person of the flesh, causing divisions. When the brothers all stand in this position, our learning will increase and our spirituality will increase. We will be led to the pathway of the church, and all the brothers and sisters will have the real unity&mdash;not a big, outward unity that is obscure within, neither a "spiritual" unity that allows us to remain in divisions.</p><p>The booklet The Urgent Cry speaks of the unity in Christ that exists for one week every year at the Keswick Convention in England. I wish to ask, however, about the other fifty-one weeks of the year. If we are one in Christ, we should be one throughout all fifty-two weeks of the year. If we should be divided, then we should be divided all fifty-two weeks. But the strange thing is that the unity at Keswick lasts one week out of the year. Then everyone returns to the divisions. Some brothers still regard this as an example of unity. However, if we should be divided, we should be divided all the time. If we should keep the unity, we should keep it all the time. Either we unite or we divide. If we can only be united for a week, while being divided for the rest of the year, we would rather stay at Keswick every day and never leave. We must see a thorough and absolute unity, not a so-called "spiritual" unity. The term is good, but it is applied in a wrong sense. The unity we see is the unity of the Body of Christ expressed in the locality. This expression in the locality, however, stumbles many people. This is a great test. Of course, if God were to remove the word locality, then everything would be easy. We could hold a few meetings for everyone to come together and converse and then return to the divisions.</p><p>I wish the brothers in China today would see that the church is local. Later, by God's mercy, we may have several hundred or several thousand local churches raised up. The churches may also spread to foreign countries, to turn back to the Western world from where the gospel came. I hope our brothers in China will not be influenced by congregationalism. There is nothing in congregationalism but one word&mdash;division. It divides a locality into many divisions. I hope the brothers and sisters will have a fearful heart in setting up new churches, daring to do anything but set up a church. We must seriously see that the Body of Christ is expressed in the locality. Of course, we cannot force others to take this way. If there is a denomination in a locality, that is another matter. If there is a division in a locality, that is also another matter. But if there is already a church in that locality, we must not establish another church. If we do this, I think the church in China will have a better way to go on.</p><h2 class="head2">A Problem concerning Unity</h2><p>A brother asked, "As the word concerning the unity of the church goes out from us at this time, people may very easily misunderstand that we are asking others to unite with us. Why do we not unite with them?"</p><p>In order to answer this question, we must let them know the basic problem: Before the Lord we can yield in certain things, but there are other matters in which we can never compromise. What are the things concerning which we cannot compromise? They are the teachings of the Bible because they are the Word of God. Even if we want to compromise, we still cannot. It is not just a matter of saying things one way as opposed to another; we cannot alter the Word of God. In what things can we yield? We can yield in our own position, but toward brothers who are in the denominations, whether in a congregational church or a united church, there are things which we cannot compromise. In these things we should stand firm and should not compromise. However, in things in which we can give in, we should yield because we must seek unity.</p><p>There are two points in which we cannot compromise: 1) Denominations are sin; hence, we cannot compromise in this. God said that divisions (sects, denominations) are of the flesh. We cannot say that divisions are spiritual. If we are not faithful to the Lord, we are not His servants and cannot preach His words. Denominationalism is always to be condemned. This is the negative aspect. 2) We must ask them to acknowledge that the church is local. This is the positive aspect with which we can never compromise. There should be only one church in each locality, not several churches. This is the Word of the Lord, and we have no authority to alter it. We cannot change one or the other. Once the problem regarding the Word of the Lord is settled, there is no problem whether you should unite with me or I should unite with you. This will not involve the Word of the Lord; it will only involve our position. If one considers only his position, he is wrong and is not the servant of the Lord.</p><p>If others are united with us today, how about divisions that may occur in the future? Since they have just started to walk this way, it may be quite easy for trouble to arise again. For those who have done something once, it is extremely easy to do it again. For those who have walked in the way of denominations, it is very easy to walk in that way again. It is not that we do not trust our brothers but that they must condemn denominationalism as sin. Then God will deliver them out of it. If they do not condemn the denominationalism as sin, even though they have come out of it, trouble will arise in the future. Furthermore, if we maneuver to attain unity, problems will arise. We must not relax these two points: Denominationalism is sin, and the church is local. We can tell these ones that we have been walking in this way for thirty years and that we hope they also will walk together with us.</p><p>On the other hand, it is all right for us to consider ourselves as not having walked in this way and starting all over again. In spite of our history, it is all right for us to join others. The Word of the Lord is the Lord's and we cannot give it up, but we can give up our history. The church is local and denominationalism is sin; we cannot relax on these two points. However, we can have a new start tomorrow in regard to our position. If we reject the denominations and they reject the denominations, then we can unite together to become the local church. How about that? Our history is something we can give up, and we can start all over again. We can say that they are not the church and that we are not the church, but that tomorrow we all will be the church. How about this? We will give up anything that can be given up, but the Lord's Word cannot be given up; we cannot relinquish it. This problem is easily settled; this is not a difficulty.</p><p>As to the administration, there also can be only one in each locality. Congregationalism has several administrations in each locality. Acts 14:23 says that Paul and Barnabas appointed elders in every church. If this were the only record in the Bible regarding Paul's action, people could say that it is possible to have several churches in one locality and elders in each one of these churches. However, if we read Titus 1:5, we will see that the situation is different. Paul said, "Appoint elders in every city." When we bring these two texts together, we will see that they are very specific. One text says "in every church"; the other text says "in every city." Therefore, elders are ordained for every church, and the city is the boundary for the elders' administration in the church.</p><p>Many brothers and sisters think that having unity with us is only a spiritual matter and that their administration will still be independent. This is not the teaching of the Scriptures. Every locality must have only one church and only one administration; it is impossible to have several churches and several administrations in one locality. Since this is a very important matter, we must be clear about it. There can only be one administration in one city, not several administrations. If we are clear about this, there will be little problem. Otherwise, when we have trouble in one meeting, we will go to another meeting. If one meeting does not receive us, we can go to another meeting on another street and be received. If the children of God have seen the unity of the church, the brothers and sisters will be one not only in fellowship but in administration as well.</p><p>Watchman</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS</h2><h2 class="head2">Arriving at the Oneness (Hangchow)</h2><p>Brother Niu Shu-guang in Hangchow saw the Lord's way a long time ago in northern China, but like other brothers, he tended toward the so-called "spiritual" unity, thinking that it was all right as long as he did not have sectarianism or division in his heart.</p><p>Recently, he was reading Ephesians, and when he came to the phrase all arrive at the oneness in verse 4:13, the Lord particularly showed him the word arrive in arrive at the oneness. Arriving is more than just something of the heart, it involves some action. Arriving is not just unity of the heart, it is unity that involves some movement. Since there is one life, there should be one testimony. Therefore, he felt it was wrong to have two administrations in one locality and that he should take action to arrive into the Body. After dinner one day we talked together, sang hymns, and prayed. Brother Niu was full of praise and full of indebtedness to the Lord. When he returned to the Body of Christ, he touched God's riches which he could not have touched outside the Body.</p><p>Respectfully,<br />Dah-weh<br />March 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Seeking Fellowship (Foochow)</h2><p>With regard to the condition of the church in Foochow, by the Lord's grace, all the meetings are going on as usual. Every month each home meeting has special gospel meetings for several consecutive days. Thank the Lord, the results are better than those in the past. We have had three baptisms over the past three months. The brothers and sisters are divided into twelve home meetings.</p><p>With respect to the ministry of the word, we are going over Basic Truths. We do this because the newly-baptized ones do not seem to be able to keep up in Lessons for Building Up New Believers, but they feel that ordinary gospel messages are too tasteless. Therefore, they need this kind of message, and then we will continue with the edification of the new believers. In the meetings every month the believers are edified, and sinners are saved.</p><p>With regard to the meetings to edify the new believers, we are now meeting in fourteen homes according to the condition of the believers in each area. In these meetings we preach a message first and then divide into small groups for discussion and testimonies.</p><p>The co-workers have gone out to visit all the localities in the northern and eastern parts of Fukien province. The believers in all the localities are really hungry and thirsty; they hope that people could visit them often to help them.</p><p>With regard to unity, recently many people from different denominations have come to fellowship with us. For example, an elderly Congregationalist minister, who is eighty years old and had been a minister for fifty years, saw the way and wants to walk with us. He stood up in a love feast and gave a short testimony, saying that he was very happy. A female preacher from the Episcopalian Church brought several young brothers and sisters to fellowship with us after seeing this way. This sister is now learning to serve among us. Another Congregationalist preacher, who is a seminary graduate, came from the Dongmen Chapel and was received at last week's Saturday fellowship meeting. Other groups and individuals that love the Lord are also seeking fellowship.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Chen Bi-yin, Chu Mao-xiang, Cheng Zheng-guang,<br />and Yeh Feng-sheng<br />February 16, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Serving Diligently (Changchun)</h2><p>By the Lord's mercy, Brother Zuo-xin and I went to Talien, Shenyang and held ten-day conferences. The Lord gave us grace, and His word made the way clearer. We really could not meet the need in each place, but could only humble ourselves at God's feet and ask for more bread for our friends in the way. We are weak, but zealous, and we are prepared to serve diligently at any time. We have lost too much in the past. Now we are repaying our debt in sackcloth and ashes. We seize the opportunities to set the way before many people.</p><p>Hua Tien-min<br />December 8, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Way of Unity (Peking)</h2><p>The table meeting to remember the Lord was started in Shijiazhuang on the eleventh of this month. In the first bread-breaking meeting there were more than forty brothers and sisters who had come out of the China Inland Mission and the Assembly of God. If the Lord gives us mercy, most of the brothers will be happy to go in the way of unity. There has been a beginning in Changxindian recently. Although there have not been many people saved in the Congregationalist Church and the Assembly of God, they are all willing to come this way. They have seen God's blessing in the gospel. They have seen that God is going on in this way in unity. We can only give praise, thanks, and glory to the God whom we serve.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Caleb Yen<br />February 21, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">May We See and Follow (Hankow)</h2><p>During the few times of fellowship with the brothers, we all tasted the sweetness of the Lord's love and saw the living stones that had passed through carving.</p><p>Today we had a meeting with the leader of the Jesus Family and a few brothers from the Assembly of God and the Lutheran Church. Some professors from the United Seminary also came to the feast. We had good fellowship. May we see what the Lord wants to do in the church today, and may we follow in the way in which we are supposed to go.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Hou Song-san<br />January 31, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Dongxiang, Anyang</h2><p>After returning from Shanghai, I realized that the Lord has lit the gospel fire in the villages, especially in Dongxiang, Anyang. Every day many people repent and receive the Lord in some villages, and they are all clearly saved. The Lord has given us grace in our environment, so the brothers' hearts are filled with praise and thanks, and they are full of joy. The newly saved brothers are all burning. They are very fresh and living. Therefore, I feel more and more deeply that we need some older brothers to come give us much help.</p><p>With regard to the matter of unity, I have been asking the Lord to open the door. Most of the people in the denominations here have already turned to come this way. The rest are not clearly saved, and it is very difficult to talk with them. It is a real problem knowing whether or not they will accept the Lord. May the Lord have mercy on them.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip Gao<br />January 2, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord Being Worthy of All the Glory</h2><p>Since the beginning of the year, we have seen the Lord's presence and blessing. Every meeting is very fresh, and we meet the Lord Himself in every fellowship meeting. The brothers' and sisters' hearts are all one in fellowship. We preached the gospel for five days in January, and the Holy Spirit did a great work each day. Although the weather was very cold, the brothers all came to the meeting hall around 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning. We prayed every morning. It was pouring rain on two days, but the brothers and sisters were burning in their hearts and did not fear the rain. As a result, the meeting hall was still filled. We not only saved quite a few sinners but also revived the brothers and sisters. The Lord is worthy of all the glory. Amen.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Fan Zhi-guang<br />February 27, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord's Preparation (Yichun)</h2><p>Thank the Lord! The Lord prepared a house for us in Yichun. It is a small house with three rooms and three entrances just outside the northern gate of Yichun. It has a second story. (There is no one living upstairs yet.) We made the front three rooms into a double-entrance store. It is located near a small market on a nearby street, and is just across the river from the city. The river is not as big as Lansi, and the water is good. It meets the requirements for a factory, and the Labor and Business Office has allowed us to make the arrangements. We thank the Lord for going before us and preparing a good place for us. We are now buying machinery and materials. We are going on positively.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Jin He-sheng<br />March 7, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">A Great Cry (Chuanchow)</h2><p>During the Chinese New Year, I was invited to Chendaixiang, which is fifteen miles from Chuanchow, to hold meetings for a few days. A preacher came out of the denominations two months ago and is meeting on the ground of the church. There are now more than ten people waiting to be baptized.</p><p>The opportunities for work here are very good. Many villages and cities are in the vicinity. If the church here is strong, it will influence the region greatly. Therefore, I am making a great cry to the Lord to raise up vessels. I plan to visit the churches in the Anhai and Tongan regions next week. If the Lord allows, I will return to Foochow in two weeks.</p><p>Ye Feng-sheng<br />February 26, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">We Have to Start Remembering the Lord<br />(Chikechuang)</h2><p>A few young, immature brothers here have received mercy from the Lord and much care from the brothers in sending the publications. They really have helped us. Because we have been touched by the Lord's love in shedding His blood and dying for us, we feel terrible if we do not remember Him. Therefore, we established the Lord's table on February 25. We are weak and immature, and we really need the prayers and teaching from all the churches.</p><p>Lee Ze-min, Liu Xue-li, Wang Chung-xin, Chang Zai-sheng<br />February 26, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Beginning to See (Changsha)</h2><p>As the church has been seeking the matter of unity, Brother Lan came to Changsha for a conference of seven messages. Many brothers and sisters from the denominations saw the light. Many among them have a heart to have individual fellowship with us, and many come to the meetings often. Another matter which comforts us even more is the young brothers and sisters in the schools. They are beginning to see something inwardly. On the negative side, they have seen that the sects are sin; on the positive side, some of them have seen the testimony of the Body.</p><p>The church in Xiangtan has begun to break bread. Brother Chang Ting-fu and others are responsible. God is moving in a mighty way in various individuals. There is a preacher of a denomination whose wife and daughters are meeting with our brothers. He says that he will take our way.</p><p>Our outward condition is very good, but we lack those who are thoroughly consecrated. We are praying earnestly and hope that some weighty ones who have learned some lessons will come here. There is much work to do and those who are consecrated are few. The looseness in the church service is manifest. We look to the Lord for the way ahead of us. Please remember these immature children much.</p><p>Chang Fang-zheng<br />March 2, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">The Practice of Reading the Bible (Peking)</h2><p>Of the twenty-eight ways to read the Bible, I picked the way of reading book by book. Next I read it historically. From the book of Genesis, I chose seven pairs&mdash;Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Enoch and Noah, Abraham and Lot, Isaac and Ishmael, Jacob and Esau, and Joseph and his brothers. There is also the way of identifying one theme, like the theme of a river; I can find the source, the effect of the river, as well as its spiritual teachings. I also take the way of finding the facts. I also tried to trace the word redemption. Before God I looked to see God's complete plan for redemption.</p><p>In the matter of coordinating to serve the Lord, I am more and more clear in the Lord's light that there is no other way except for submitting to authority. Once there is lawlessness or disobedience, I feel uncomfortable.

The number of people in the gospel meetings has increased. There are many newly-saved ones. The churches will all have baptism meetings soon. In Banhu there are one or two times of fellowship every Lord's Day concerning the church. People have also come seeking fellowship in Donghai. Thank God that He is really with us in each time of sharing or prayer. He has increased our faith. (Deleted)</p><p>Chu Wen-bin<br />February 4, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">The Spirit of the Lord Moving<br />in Anhwei Province</h2><p>I held a conference for several days in Wuhu. While talking with the brothers, I learned that there are good brothers in Dangtu, Anching, and Hefei. There have been meetings in Dangtu for several months. At first there were five brothers who had a heart for the Lord. They had no lack in their living. They prepared the meeting place and chairs. They preached the gospel often, and soon they will have a baptism meeting and will break bread. A sister from Nanking went to Anching and is in nursing school. Three brothers from Wuhu went there; two are working on a farm, and one is working in a bank. Their wives are all sisters. There is a brother named Wang Yi-xun, who is from Anching and who studied at Anhwei University in Wuhu. He became ill and has returned home to rest. They are all desperate to have meetings. They really hope that some people from Shanghai could go there to help them begin the meetings.</p><p>Ji Yung-tong<br />February 16, 1951</p><h1 class="series">THE PRESENT TESTIMONY</h1><h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 37</h1><h2 class="head4">January 1, 1951</h2><h2 class="head1">LIFE OUT OF DEATH</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Life out of death&mdash;dear Master, is it spoken<br />Of the life here, or in the better land?<br />Nay, wherefore wait?

And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth; I being in the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren" (Gen. 24:26-27).</p><p>"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth. And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things" (vv. 52-53).</p><p>"And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped" (Exo. 4:30-31).</p><p>"That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped" (12:27).</p><p>"And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance" (34:5-9).</p><p>"Now once, when Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked; and behold, there was a man standing opposite him, and His sword was drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, Are You for us or for our adversaries? And He said, Neither, but as the Captain of Jehovah's army have I now come. Then Joshua fell to the ground upon his face and worshipped. And he said to Him, What does my Lord speak to His servant?" (Josh. 5:13-14).</p><p>"And when Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he worshipped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, Arise, for Jehovah has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand" (Judg. 7:15).</p><p>"It was for this child that I prayed, and Jehovah has granted me my request that I requested from Him. Therefore I, for my part, have lent him to Jehovah; all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there" (1 Sam. 1:27-28).</p><p>"And on the seventh day the child died. And David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, While the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to our voice; how then can we tell him that the child is dead? He will do himself some harm. And David saw that his servants were whispering, and David perceived that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. Then David rose up from the ground and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went to the house of Jehovah and worshipped. Then he went to his house; and when he requested it, they set food before him, and he ate" (2 Sam. 12:18-20).</p><p>"Then one day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother, a messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys were feeding beside them; and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away, and they struck the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to relate these things to you. While this one was still speaking, another came and said, The fire of God has fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants and devoured them; and I alone have escaped to relate these things to you. While this one was still speaking, another came and said, The Chaldeans formed three companies and raided the camels and took them, and they struck the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to relate these things to you. While this one was still speaking, another came and said, Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother; and suddenly a great wind came from beyond the desert and struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell upon the young people and they died; and I alone have escaped to relate these things to you. Then Job rose up and tore his clothes and shaved his head and fell to the earth and worshipped" (Job 1:13-20).</p><p>We must deal with one matter before God. If we truly intend to be worshippers of God, it is impossible to just worship Him. I am not saying that we should not worship God. We must worship God, but please remember that a day will come when God opens our eyes to know Him as more than just our Father; we will know Him also as our God. We need to see that we are not only His children but also His bondservants. When we see this revelation and meet God as God, we immediately will worship Him. However, we should not stop there. Whenever we have a revelation of God and meet Him, the result should be that we accept His ways. The result of seeing and knowing God is that we accept God's ways.</p><p>God's holy Word shows us that we must know God and we must know His ways. God Himself can only be known by revelation, and God's ways can only be known through submission. We know God Himself through His revelation, and we know the ways of God by being willing to be dealt with and by submitting to Him.</p><h2 class="head2">What Are the Ways of God?</h2><p>What are the ways of God? The ways in which God deals with us are His ways. His ways entail what He wants to do. The ways of God are the choices He makes concerning us. These are the ways of God. His ways are higher than our ways (Isa. 55:9). He has His own ordinations, and there is no room for our choice. He deals with this person in this manner and with another person in that manner. His ways are what He deems best. The ways of God imply that God acts according to His desire and choice.</p><p>Many people balk at the fact that, without an unveiling of God to man, we cannot accept God's ways. We must first have revelation before we can accept God's ways. We ask, "Why did God love Jacob and not Esau?" We feel that God was not fair to Esau, and we even feel indignant about the way Esau was treated. We think that Esau was a very good man who was cheated out of everything. Jacob was the one who was bad. Yet God said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated" (Rom. 9:13). Yet still we reason about this. Those who reason in this way have not seen God. Those who have seen Him know that He is God. God can act according to His pleasure. He does what makes Him happy. He is God. No one can tell Him how He should act. He does not need counselors or advisors. He does not need an advisory board to tell Him how to do things. He does what He pleases. These are the ways of God.</p><p>The ways of God are His choices. The ways of God are what He wants to do. He wants to do things this way, and He wants to deal with us in that way. He wants to accomplish this matter but not something else. He wants us to encounter this circumstance but not that one. These are the ways of God.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Stopping with the Worship of God</h2><p>As we have already pointed out, when a person receives a revelation concerning God and he sees that He is God and that man is man, he only can bow down and worship. But we must not stop there because this is too abstract. We must immediately say, "God, I worship You, and I worship Your ways. I do not just worship You, I also worship Your ways." Our heart must be brought by God to the point of bowing down before Him and saying, "I see that I should not only worship You, but also what You have and what pleases You. I should worship what You choose. I should worship what You have ordained for me. I should worship what You are pleased to bring upon me. I should worship You for the things You do not want me to pursue." Brothers and sisters, it is easy to worship God while we are gathered here in the meeting because there is no price to pay. But let me repeat that all true worship comes from knowing God and receiving a revelation of God. Thank God, I know Him; therefore, I fall before Him, saying, "Everything You have done is right. You are never wrong." This is the way to accept the ways of God.</p><p>We learn to walk step by step. If we want to learn to walk before God, we will have no future unless we can learn to worship the ways of God&mdash;not just to worship God. Our entire spiritual future hinges on our ability to worship the ways of God. Thus, all who know God must be brought to the point of saying, "I worship the ways of God. I worship the things that God has ordained for me. I worship the things God has done to me. I worship God for what He is pleased to do in me. I worship God for the things He strips from me."</p><h2 class="head2">The Worshippers of God's Ways</h2><p>Let us consider a few of the worshippers of God in the Old Testament to see how they worshipped God. We will see the ways of God from the examples of God's worshippers in the Old Testament.</p><h2 class="head2">Worshipping God for a Prosperous Journey</h2><p>The ways of God are what God wants to do in us. Our first illustration is found in Genesis 24. Recall the story in which Abraham said to the servant who ruled over all that he had, "Go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac" (v. 4). This was a formidable undertaking. Abraham was living in Canaan. In order to reach Mesopotamia one had to cross the Jordan River, the Euphrates River, and the stretch of desert lying between them. It was a difficult matter for a servant to go to a strange place a great distance away and persuade a young woman to accept this offer of marriage. Eliezer, however, was looking to God. Although it seemed as if he was going to the ends of the earth to seek Abraham's relatives and find a woman, he was trusting in God. The record in the Scriptures about his trip is very marvelous. It says that when he came unto Nahor, the city of Abraham, he prayed, "O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham. Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master" (vv. 12-14). This prayer seems difficult to answer. But he had not even finished praying when Rebekah arrived at the well.</p><p>We all know the story here and that to the detail everything transpired as he had requested. But what if this damsel was not of Abraham's family? As we know, the type here is of Christ and the church, both being of one family. "He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One" (Heb. 2:11). Rebekah needed to be of the same source as Isaac. What if she was of another race like Syrian or Babylonian? So Eliezer asked about her family background. Yes, she was Abraham's kin. Eliezer immediately bowed his head and worshipped the Lord (Gen. 24:23-27). Do we see? These are the ways of God. If we only will learn to acknowledge the Lord in all our paths as in Proverbs 3:6, we will be acknowledging God in His ways. If we request Him to do this and that and believe, looking trustfully to Him, then when things happen according to our requests, we will worship Him. Thus, we will not worship God merely because He is God; we also worship Him for His actions. Eliezer immediately bowed his head and worshipped the Lord as if to say, "You have given grace to me. You have given grace to me as You have given grace to my master Abraham, and You have led me in the way."</p><p>Brothers and sisters, do we see what it means to worship God? It means to render all glory to Him. Giving glory to God does not mean that we meet with a situation which turns out well after prayer and then we say that we were lucky, that things fell into place at the right time, or that we did things well ourselves. One who knows and has seen God is one who can do nothing but bow down and worship when he sees God do something. Abraham's servant did not even stop to talk with Rebekah. The first thing he did was worship God. He did not feel embarrassed; he instantly bowed his head and said, "God, I worship You."</p><p>What is worship? Worship is giving glory to God when He has His way with us. Giving glory to God is worship. Have I made myself sufficiently clear? I hope that we would see the connection between glory and worship. Giving glory to God is worshipping Him. The glory we give to God can never be more than worship. Bowing before Him is the worship He receives from us. Worship is being able to bow before God and say to Him, "I submit to You." The proud cannot worship God. Proud people can never worship God because when their way is prosperous, they attribute it to their own ability or to chance. They say, "I was smart to do this or to say this." They think, "I was lucky to meet this person." This kind of person can never give glory to God because He does not worship God. Being a true worshipper of God is offering praise and thanksgiving to Him for everything He has done for us and everything He has given us along the way. Let me say that many times we will not be able to refrain from bowing down and giving glory to God. We will have no other choice but to say, "God, I worship You."</p><p>When Abraham's servant went with Rebekah to her house, he explained his mission to Laban, Bethuel, and the rest of her family and told them that he wanted to take Rebekah back with him (Gen. 24:34-49). When Laban and Bethuel heard his story, they acknowledged Jehovah and let Rebekah go (vv. 50-51). We might say that he was very lucky or that he was very shrewd because the matter prospered so well. If we say this, however, it shows that we do not know God, nor have we seen Him. But here was a person who knew God and saw His acts. He had a special trait. Even when his way was prospered to such an extent, he did not rejoice or thank those he was with, he just bowed down to the earth unto the Lord (v. 52). This is real worship.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we must learn to recognize God's ways. I do not know how to press this truth home, but I would reiterate that we need to know two matters. We have two roads. After becoming Christians, we must learn to know the will of God and the work of God on the one hand, and we must learn to know the ways of God, the methods by which He deals with us on the other hand. We must worship God, and we also must accept the ways in which He deals with us. The journey of Abraham's old servant was very prosperous, but he had an outstanding characteristic: His reaction to everything he met was to immediately worship Jehovah.</p><p>We have said before and we will say again that if we really want to worship God, we will find again and again that He gives us many opportunities to worship Him. When the old servant arrived at the gate of the village, he worshipped God, and he worshipped again at the door of Laban's home. When he got inside, he worshipped yet again. When we worship God the first time, He will give us a second opportunity to worship Him. God will do one thing to cause us to worship in speechless wonder. Then He will do something else for which we cannot help but worship Him. Many times God will give us a prosperous way. In these times, we must confess that it is not by our own hand or ordination. It did not happen because we are capable, but because Jehovah did it all. Jehovah led us; therefore, all the glory should go to Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Worshipping God for Looking upon Our Afflictions</h2><p>Our second illustration is found in Exodus 4, when God sent Moses to tell the children of Israel that He had visited them and would deliver them out of the bondage of Egypt. They would not have to fire bricks, the material used to build the tower of Babel. Verse 31 says, "And when [the people] heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped." Do we have a group of people worshipping God for His ways? Many times it seems as if God is leading us in just the same way as He led Abraham's servant. When our way is well-prospered, we cannot but worship God. Here, however, the situation is different. They worshipped here because God visited them and looked upon their affliction. God did nothing but tell the children of Israel through Moses and Aaron that He had remembered them despite the passage of four hundred thirty years. God had visited them and looked upon their affliction. The meaning of looked is "saw." God saw what happened to them. When the Israelites saw that God remembered, visited, and looked upon them, they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p><p>Many times our brothers and sisters suffer trials. They cannot worship God because they think God has forgotten them. Many people have domestic difficulties, but the difficulties never last for four hundred thirty years. How can we say that God has forgotten us? Perhaps the children of Israel said, "We have been slaves for so many years, God does not care," just as we may say, "I have been sick for so long, God would not heal me. I have been unemployed for years, but God will not make a way for me. My husband still does not believe; there are still problems in my family." It seems that God has forgotten us, our difficulties, and our sufferings. But if we say these things, our lips will be sealed and we will not worship God. We will have no way to offer a word of worship to God. But a day will come when we see God. We will know Him and understand His ways, and we will see that God has not forgotten our situation. We will tell God that everything we went through was for our benefit; we will bow our head to say, "God, I worship You." We will be unable to refrain from worshipping God because of our gratitude. We will say, "God, I worship You for all the grace and blessings You have given me."</p><h2 class="head2">Worshipping God for His Salvation</h2><p>In Exodus 12:27 God commanded the Israelites to teach their children about the meaning of the Passover: "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses." How did the Israelites receive this message? "The people bowed the head and worshipped." The people worshipped God. Please remember that in the Old Testament the sacrifice of the Passover was not a sin offering but a memorial sacrifice. This memorial sacrifice caused the people to worship God. God destroyed the firstborn in all the houses of the Egyptians, but He passed over all the houses of the children of Israel. As they recalled the separation that God had made between His people and the worldly people and the different places to which each had been brought, they could not help but worship Him.</p><p>The Passover, like our Lord's table meeting, is a memorial sacrifice and feast to recall the Lord's work and our separation from the world, the recollection of which begets worship in our hearts. We wonder why God ever chose us! We are constrained to worship because of God's way in His selection. Many times God's grace only causes us to give thanks, but it cannot cause us to worship. When we see God's ways, however, we cannot refrain from worshipping. When the Israelites saw the ways of God, they seemingly could not help but say, "God, there are so many people in Egypt, why would You pass over the houses of Israel and strike the houses of the Egyptians? Every firstborn of the Egyptians was slain; how could the firstborn of the Israelites be spared? God, how did You do this?" When we see what God has done and how He has chosen us, we will worship Him. The methods by which God does things are His ways. God not only gives grace to us, but the ways in which He gives grace and chooses us cause us to worship God.</p><p>Have we thought about these matters? I often think about the time when I was saved as a student. There were more than four hundred other students in the school. God did not choose any of those other students. Why would He choose me? My father had twelve brothers and sisters. Among such a tribe, God did not choose another; He chose me. When we think of the way in which God chose us, we are not just thinking of the grace of God. We do not just give thanks; we also worship God for the way in which He works. Worshipping is acknowledging that God has given grace in such a way. This is not just a matter of God giving grace, but of the way in which grace is given. Since He has given grace in such a way, we should say, "God, I worship You. These are Your ways. You are God."</p><p>O brothers and sisters, these are the ways of God! We might ask why He saved us. Let me say that He saved us because it was His delight to choose us. He wanted this and ordained this. There is nothing for us to say. We can only bow our head and fall before Him, saying, "God, I worship You. You not only have grace, but also You take wonderful ways to dispense Your grace." The children of Israel did not merely give thanks to God upon seeing this; they also worshipped Him.</p><p>At the breaking of the bread, as we contemplate His grace in saving, justifying, and regenerating sinners like ourselves, and in making us become His children, we offer thanks to God. But when we think of the way in which He forgave our sins, the process He went through to justify us, and the pains He took to pull us out of the muck and mire from among the thousands of other people around us, and when we think of how we happened to be in a certain church and happened to hear a particular gospel message preached by just the right person, and how that enabled us to receive Him, we remember God's ways. We will offer not only thanks but also worship. We will worship the God who orders our way. When we know the ways of God, we cannot refrain from worshipping Him.</p><p>There is a marvelous point in this verse. When the children of Israel heard the word, they bowed their heads and worshipped. Moses did not teach them this; Moses did not tell them that they should worship. He just spoke the word of God to them, and they simply worshipped. Worship does not require instruction, exhortation, or mental exercise. When we see the ways of God, we spontaneously worship Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Worshipping God at the Proclamation of His Ways</h2><p>In Exodus 32&mdash;34 we read of a serious difficulty that Moses encountered. God gave him two tablets of stone with the Ten Commandments written on them. While Moses was still on the mountain, trouble broke out among the Israelites at the foot of the mount. The people made a golden calf and worshipped it. This provoked God to great displeasure and He said to Moses: "Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiffnecked people: now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation" (32:7-10). God was furious, so Moses pleaded with God on the one hand and went down the mountain to deal with matters on the other. Thereafter, he ascended the mountain again and in obedience to God's command hewed two more tablets of stone. With these in his hand, he went to the top of Mount Sinai. There God made a solemn proclamation. First He said, "The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin" (34:6-7). If at this point Moses had fallen down and worshipped God, it would not have been surprising; but what is amazing is that he made haste to do so after the second part of the proclamation. The second part was totally different from the first. The first part spoke of God's compassion, grace, mercy, and forgiveness, but in the second part He said, "And that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation." When God had proclaimed the awe of His majesty, "Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped" (v. 8). Please bear in mind that knowing God is not merely a matter of grace. If it were just a matter of grace, it would be all over and there would be no problem, but we need to know God's holiness.</p><p>I love verses 8 and 9 in chapter thirty-four. In the latter verse Moses prays, but in the former he worships. He worships and then prays. He acknowledges the rightness of God's ways and then seeks God's grace. He did not say, "You are slow to anger, full of compassion, and ready to forgive, so please have mercy on us and do not do as You plan." We would pray in this way. We always love to pray, "Do not do what You are going to do. Even though this is Your way, do not do it." Moses was very different from us. He took his proper place before God and confessed that God's ways were right. Brothers and sisters, have we ever acknowledged that God's ways are right? Have we ever asked God to do anything that we knew was contrary to His ways of working? Have we ever besought Him to forgive a certain brother and cease to discipline him even when we know that His dealings with that brother were right? If we pray like this, we are not worshipping God. We are, in effect, saying, "O God, please change Your ways. Do not give him a burden, do not let him be sick, do not let him have domestic difficulties." Praying in this way is seeking grace and ignoring the ways of God. In our prayer, we are making ourselves too big; we are not identifying ourselves with God's way. Moses first acknowledged God's authority and His ways. God declared that He would by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. Moses instantly submitted, saying, "O God, You are right, Your ways are right, and I worship You. Since You have decided to do this and because this is Your way, I can only worship You." Thereafter, he prayed that if he had found grace in God's sight, God would still go up in the midst of His people. He prayed for grace, but only after he had worshipped God.</p><p>Sometimes we may visit a brother's home and discover that his child is sick. As we kneel with the husband and wife to pray, we immediately sense that God is not worshipped in this house. We know that God never receives worship in this place. As soon as they kneel in prayer, they say, "O God, heal my child." The first words from their mouths are, "O God, my child must not die; You must heal him." They are telling God what to do. They are deciding God's ways for Him. When they open their mouths, we know that God is not worshipped. I am not saying that we do not know God as our Father. Let me repeat that we need to know God not only as our Father, but as God. It is one thing to be the Father, and it is an entirely different thing to be God. We may visit another brother's home, and again there may be a sick child. When we kneel in prayer with the parents, they pray, "God, we praise You that You are always right. We praise You for allowing our child to become sick. You are never wrong, so we worship You. Everything You do is good. If it pleases You to take the child, we will accept Your will, but if it pleases You to show mercy to us, we ask You to heal him." It is proper to pray, and our worship should not replace our prayer. But we must worship first and then pray. Prayer is saying what I want; worship is acknowledging what God wants. Prayer expresses our desire; worship expresses God's desire. Prayer expresses our will, while worship expresses God's will.</p><p>How we need to learn from Moses' actions in Exodus 34:8-9! He saw that God was severe, and he could do nothing but kneel and bow down to the ground. Moses did not reason with God. Moses did not ask Him what would happen if He carried out such a punishment. He did not say, "If You do not forgive their sin, what will the Israelites do? If You visit their iniquity to the third or fourth generation, what will I do? I have led the people in vain. Forty years have passed already; I cannot wait for three or four generations. I am finished. I have worked in vain." Moses did not exhort God to change. Instead, Moses worshipped. I do not know what to say. The greatest need among Christians today is to learn the lesson of knowing God's ways and embracing them. It does not matter how it affects me or what I want. (Moses had a desire. It was a consuming desire of his to enter the land of Canaan.) However, Moses first said, "You are right in whatever You want; I worship You." Brothers and sisters, we must not only learn to do God's will and accept His work; we also need to love God's ways and His decisions. We must like what God likes.</p><h2 class="head2">Worshipping God as the Captain<br />of Jehovah's Army</h2><p>In the book of Joshua, God commissioned Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land of Canaan. What a weighty responsibility! Moses had become old and died; Aaron had died as well. The only person left was the young man Joshua. Those who had the ability to bear this burden had already gone, leaving a young man alone. What could he do? What must he have felt? The mature, experienced Moses could not do it; how can a young man like himself do it? How could he cope with the seven formidable tribes inhabiting the land of Canaan? And how could he lead a people like the children of Israel with their fear of death and their constant complaints? Joshua was faced with this challenge. Can we blame him for feeling overwhelmed? No, we cannot. If we were in the same circumstances, we would feel overwhelmed too.</p><p>At this point, however, Joshua saw a vision of a great Man with a drawn sword. Joshua did not recognize the Man and asked, "Are You for us or for our adversaries?" (5:13). We must pay close attention to this question. How did the Man answer him? Many people erroneously believe that the Man said He had come to help Joshua, but the Man did not answer in this way. In His answer He first said, "Neither," that is, I am not here to help you, nor to help your adversaries. I am here for only one thing; "as the Captain of Jehovah's army have I now come" (v. 14). Thank God for doing this. Thank God that this is what the Lord Jesus does! He does not help us, neither does He help our adversaries, but He comes as the Captain of the Lord's army. If we are God's army, then He comes to be our Captain. This is not a question of receiving help, but of accepting leadership. He has not come to offer assistance but to demand subjection. He does not come to help but to lead. He says, "As the Captain of Jehovah's army have I now come." How did Joshua react when he heard these words? "Joshua fell to the ground upon his face and worshipped."</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we must learn the ways of God, and this is another of His ways. God does nothing to assist us or to assist our enemies. God does not stand in the midst of the conflict giving a little help here or there. God wants to be the Captain, and He demands our submission. In the face of so many foes, the need would not be answered if God merely helped us. Submitting to Him will solve the whole problem.</p><p>The issue is not whether or not God is helping us, but whether we are submitting to His leadership. When He is in command, all is well. A great trouble today among God's children is that we want everything to revolve around us and everything to serve our interests. But God will not allow this. He wants to bring us to the point of simply submitting to Him. When this matter is settled, all other problems vanish.</p><p>Joshua fell to the ground upon his face and worshipped. If we know God's ways by knowing Him as our Captain, God will handle everything, and we will worship Him. God does not come to assist us in battle; He comes to lead the troops. If we hope He will help us in the fight, we have misunderstood God. God comes to lead the troops. We must submit before Him. When we learn the true meaning of worship, we will also know that there is now a sword drawn on our behalf.</p><h2 class="head2">Worshipping God for Opening the Way</h2><p>In the book of Judges there is a section that relates to Gideon. In chapter seven Gideon had no assurance; he did not know if he would be able to win the battle. He went to the camp of the Midianites and heard one Midianite say to another, "I have just had a dream. There was this round loaf of barley bread tumbling through the camp of Midian. And it came to the tent and struck it, so that it fell and turned upside down. And the tent collapsed. And his companion answered and said, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has delivered Midian and all the camp into his hand." When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he worshipped (vv. 13-15). Gideon did not just worship God; he also worshipped for the things God would do. He did not just worship God for His power; he also worshipped for the way in which God would defeat the Midianites, for His choosing, and for the way in which He was pleased to fight the Midianites. It is God's ways and methods that bring in the worship in this instance. Praise God that it is easy for Him to open a way for us. It seems absurd to expect three hundred men to overthrow the Midianite army, yet God is able to make a way. Please remember that God wants us to constantly emphasize one matter: The portion that God should receive from His children is worship. This does not mean that the work of God is not important, but this does mean that worshipping God is to glorify God. This is what God requires of us.</p><h2 class="head2">Worshipping God for the Gift of a Child</h2><p>In 1 Samuel 1 we truly touch the spirit of worship. Remember that Hannah did not have any children. Her husband had two wives. The other wife had children, but Hannah was barren and suffered much for it. Therefore, she begged the Lord for a child, and her request was granted. As soon as the child was weaned, she brought him to the temple in Shiloh and said, "It was for this child that I prayed, and Jehovah has granted me my request that I requested from Him. Therefore I, for my part, have lent him to Jehovah; all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah" (vv. 27-28). Do we see these two phrases? They are exceedingly precious to me. Read them together. "Jehovah has granted me..I, for my part, have lent him to Jehovah." Jehovah gave the child to her, and she gave the child back to Him. No answer to prayer surpasses this one. The sum total of her request before God was this child. She had suffered for a lifetime. Her constant hope was to have this child, but what did she say in the end? "What You have given me, I will give to You; I will give You the portion You have given me." O brothers and sisters, of such a person it can be truly written that she "worshipped Jehovah." Hannah worshipped God in this instance. Only the person who wants God Himself, rather than His gift, can worship Him worthily. Hannah showed us what was supremely precious to her&mdash;not the gift of God, not the fact He was willing to hear her prayer, not even Samuel whom He gave, but God's way in giving Samuel to her.</p><p>God gave her Samuel, so she gave Samuel to God. When Samuel passed out of her hands, worship came forth. Please remember that no one who is not consecrated can worship God. I think that some among us understand this matter. The day in which we give everything to God, including our "Samuel," will be the day in which we begin to learn how to worship. The day in which we see the altar is the day in which we learn to worship.</p><p>I can never forget Abraham. Lately, we have referred to him frequently, but I cannot refrain from mentioning him again. I never cease to be impressed by the preciousness of his remark to his servants in Genesis 22. When he was about to ascend the mountain with Isaac, he said to his servants, "I and the lad will go yonder and worship" (v. 5). He did not say to sacrifice or make an offering, but to worship. It was not sacrifice but worship. His worship was to offer Isaac up to God. It was good for God to do things in this way, and he worshipped Him. O brothers and sisters, I do not believe that anyone who has not really consecrated his all can truly worship God. If we do not have this kind of consecration, we will be unable to worship even if we try. But when the day comes, as it came for Hannah, that our "Samuel," in whom all our hopes are centered, passes out of our hands into God's hands, then worship will flow out to God with him. Hannah knew the ways of God. Since God had given her a son, she gave him to God, not just once, but for all the days of his life. She worshipped God in this position.</p><p>Worship always follows the cross and the altar. Wherever there is the cross, the altar, consecration, and obedience to the ways of God, there is worship. Wherever one gives up working for one's self or holding on to something for one's self, there is worship. Worship is saying that we are not the center. The meaning of worship is that God is the center. The meaning of worship is that I step aside and give all the space to God. It is necessary for "Samuel" to pass out of our hands.</p><h2 class="head2">Worshipping God for His Vindication of Himself</h2><p>The ways of God do not always correspond to what we have prayed for. The reverse is often true. The ways of God do not always mean prosperity for us; not infrequently they bring adversity. What should our attitude be toward these ways of God? Recall the record of David's sin in 2 Samuel 12. Bathsheba became pregnant and bore a son. God sent the prophet Nathan with the message that the child would surely die. David had sinned, but he loved his son even though the child was the fruit of his sin. David, like all fathers, loved his child. What did he do? He prayed ceaselessly before God, hoping that God would heal the child. But God said, "Because you have given the enemies of Jehovah much occasion to blaspheme Him because of this thing, the son who is born to you shall also surely die" (v. 14). You all know that David knew how to pray. We can see how well David prayed in the Psalms. David not only prayed but also fasted. All night long he lay prostrate on the ground praying fervently. In the end, however, the child died.</p><p>Anyone who is not consecrated, who does not know God, who is not truly in subjection to God, after praying so well and so fervently with fasting, lying prostrate on the ground all night, surely would charge God with harshness when such a request was not granted. Many would say that God is too strict and would never worship Him again. They would stop going to the bread-breaking meeting. They would stop petitioning God and praying to Him. Oh, many people have controversy with God when their ways are not His ways. They fight and argue with God. They ask God why He did such a thing to them. Many people do not submit to God's ways. They say, "I cannot accept the fact that You have touched me in this way." They may not speak this aloud, but they disagree in their hearts and feel that God is too harsh.</p><p>The strange thing is that when others would have rebelled, David did not rebel. When others would have been disappointed, David was not disappointed. When others would have murmured, David did not murmur. When the child died, his servants were afraid to break the news to him. They thought that if David had been so overwhelmed with anxiety when the child fell sick, his grief would be insupportable when he learned of the child's death. What happened? "Then David rose up from the ground and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went to the house of Jehovah and worshipped. Then he went to his house; and when he requested it, they set food before him, and he ate" (v. 20). Worship is bowing to the ways of God. When we submit to the ways of God, this is worship. It is refraining from disappointment and murmuring. It is, henceforth, not being negative, nor arguing with God. Instead, it is saying, "God, You are right in this." This is worshipping God's ways.</p><p>It is often necessary for God to do many things to us to vindicate Himself. Do we understand the meaning of this? God often has to vindicate Himself by making it clear to the angels, to the devil, to the world, and to all His children that He has no part in our sin. When we fail, fall, and do certain things, God's governing hand must come in to vindicate Himself by showing all the angels, demons, worldly people, and the church that He has no part in our action. For this reason, God places us in the fire, and His governing hand is upon us; He does not let us off. How do we react at such times? Those who know and love God, those who have a revelation of Him and have seen His appearing, will bow before God and say, "If my suffering vindicates Your holiness, then I say, `Amen.' If You can make known Your righteousness by my tribulations, then I acknowledge that You do all things well. If Your nature can be vindicated in this way, I gladly accept the sufferings You give me." This is the way to worship God.</p><p>Please note that David acted as a normal human being in this experience. I often feel that God's Word shows us people's inner feelings. David was not devoid of love for his child, nor was he lacking in prayer for the boy. He loved his son and prayed for him. He was not devoid of human affections; he was like all other people in the world. Many spiritual people seem to live in an ethereal realm; they do not seem to be living on earth. They do not act like normal human beings but do things in a peculiar manner. In contrast, David was a normal person with human emotions and love. However, when He saw God's ordination in this, he bowed before Him in worship.</p><p>May God deliver us from our controversies with Him! We often do not get what we hope, expect, or ask for. If we have the vision, we will say, "God, this is Your way; I bow before You in worship! I know that You are never wrong." Brothers and sisters, let me say again that no one can worship God without submitting to His ways. In order to worship Him, revelation is a basic requirement. In order to worship His ways, subjection is a basic requirement. Apart from revelation, we cannot worship God Himself; apart from subjection we cannot worship His ways. We need to be brought to the point where we say, "God, I submit to You even if You take away what I hold most dear and precious. My submission is worship. You are God; You are never wrong. Your ways are never wrong. I praise You."</p><p>I count it as the greatest blessing of my life to have known Miss Barber. Scores of times, perhaps even hundreds of times, I heard her pray, "Lord, I worship You for Your ways." I know these were her deepest, strongest prayers. Scores of times in prayer she said, "God, I praise Your ways." Please remember that God's ways do not always mean a prospering of our ways, nor are they always beneficial to us. God does not always hear our prayer. We may have prayed with fasting, but the child still dies. At this point, we must say, "God I worship you." At such times, we must still worship the ways of God.</p><h2 class="head2">Worshipping God for His Stripping</h2><p>Finally, we need to see that God sometimes refuses prayer because He wants to break us, like breaking David, or wants to vindicate Himself and His holiness. In the following illustration, Job was a righteous man who had herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, and children. One day a servant came to tell him that the Sabeans had stolen all his cattle. Then another servant told him that fire from heaven had burned up all his flocks; nothing was left. Yet another servant told him that he had been robbed and nothing was left. Finally, another servant then came and told him that a great wind from beyond the desert had destroyed his house and killed all his children. Four different servants came and told him that nothing was left (Job 1:13-18). Then Job, whom the Lord said knew of His endurance, rose up, tore his clothes, shaved his head, and fell to the earth and worshipped (v. 20). This was the first thing he did. He not only worshipped God Himself but also His ways. Please remember that there was no element of vindication in this instance as there was in the case of David. It was purely a matter of God doing as He pleased. Nothing was going the right way; there was only suffering. In one day he lost everything; in a matter of minutes he was bereft of everything. Job was a man who submitted to the ways of God. He was able to say, "God, You have done right."</p><p>Brothers and sisters, I do not know what you have gone through, but I do know that God is doing a stripping work on many people, causing them to lose much and blocking their ways. I would like to find out how they are reacting. Many people disqualify themselves from blessing because they keep kicking, fighting, and questioning. They murmur, "Why do others not have such difficulties? Why am I the only one with problems? Everyone else turns mud into gold, but I turn gold into mud. Everything I touch goes wrong." They do not understand why it goes well with others while they have problems. It is easy for others to be Christians, but with them it is not so easy. Perhaps they can do things better than others, but they meet with so many difficult situations. Let me say that it does not matter what we say. We still must learn to obey God and submit before Him. We must learn to receive God's ways. God is in our business, among our friends, and in our environment. The ways He has ordained for us are all good. They are good both in suffering and in happiness. When we submit to God's ways, we will worship.</p><p>A true worshipper cannot complain. Job 1:20 tells us that we must accept the Lord's ways without question. It does not matter whether the circumstances are good or bad. Practicing this is true worship. I do not know what God's ways are with us. It does not matter whether or not God provides a reason for our suffering; God is always good. God had a reason in David's case; it was his sin. We are able to explain this suffering. However, often there is no reason, no sin. We are not worse than other Christians; we may even be somewhat better than others. So then why do we meet with these difficulties? We should only praise God from the bottom of our hearts and submit to His ways. We must say, "God, what You have done is best. I bow before You in worship because what You have done is best."</p><p>May God grant us grace from this day forth to offer Him not only the worship that is borne out of revelation but also the worship that expresses itself in submission and consecration. There are two aspects to our worship; one comes through revelation, and it is the worship of God Himself. The other is to worship the ways of God through our submission. We must say that whatever God does to us is right. Whatever God does is always right.</p><h2 class="head2">Prayer</h2><p>O God, our God, we want to bow down and worship You. Everything that You have ordained is good. We often choose our own way, but You hinder us and do not prosper us. You seem to cause us to run into a wall. We would like to say that this is best if it pleases You. We cannot ask why You have done this. We cannot ask why You have treated our brothers and sisters in one way and us in another way. We cannot ask why You have given grace to some brothers and sisters but do not give grace to us. We want to accept Your ways. We want to accept them when they are reasonable and when they are not. We want to accept them when they prosper us and when they do not. Teach us to see our ways, and teach us to see Your ways. You do not need to give us a reason for what You have done. Whatever You do is right. Stop us from arguing and reasoning about every matter. Save us from all the "whys." Save us from all the questionings. We look to You to save us. Bring our hearts to the point where we become the footstool to Your throne for You to step. Enable us to submit and to worship. Bless our brothers and sisters. We look to You to give grace to us.

(v. 5b).</p><p>"But to me it is a very small thing that I should be examined by you or by man's day; rather I do not even examine myself. For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified by this, but He who examines me is the Lord" (1 Cor. 4:3-4).</p><p>"The tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil" (Gen. 2:9b).</p><p>"And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (vv. 16-17). (The tree of the knowledge of good and evil can also be translated "the tree of the knowledge of right and wrong.")</p><p>After God created man, He considered the problem of man's food. The act of giving life is the beginning of life, but food is for the maintenance of life. God created a living man and therefore needed to consider how man should live. Man should not just live; man also needs a living. God wanted man to depend on Him for his living in the same way that he was dependent upon food for his living. "For in Him we live and move and are" (Acts 17:28). Thus, God uses two trees to speak to us in a parable. The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are a kind of parable. They show us that man has two different kinds of food and can live either by life or by the knowledge of good and evil, that is, the knowledge of right and wrong. Many people have read about the two trees in Genesis 2, but we would like to emphasize that the two trees were put there to show us that man, especially a Christian, can live on earth according to two different principles. Man can live according to the principle of right and wrong or according to the principle of life. Some Christians take the principle of right and wrong as the standard for their living, while other Christians take the principle of life as their standard for living.</p><p>Today we would like to spend some time before God to see these two principles for living. What does it mean when a person lives according to right and wrong? What does it mean when a person lives according to life? Many people only have the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in their lives. Other people have the tree of life in their lives. Some have both trees. The Word of God tells us, however, that he who eats of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil shall surely die, while he who eats of the tree of life shall live. God also shows us that whoever lives by the knowledge of good and evil will lose his position before God. If man wants to constantly live before God, then he must know what it means to eat the fruit of the tree of life.</p><h2 class="head2">Two Principles of Christian Living</h2><p>Here, I would like to add another principle for living: the principle of sin. You could say that everyone in the world can live according to at least three principles: they can live by sin, or they can live by right and wrong, or they can live by life.</p><p>What does this mean? It is very simple. Many people live on earth by following the lusts of their flesh. They are sons of wrath who are bound by the fashions of the world. They live and act according to the operation of the evil spirits in their hearts. Their principle for living is that they live by sin (Eph. 2:1-3). This morning I do not want to speak about this principle. I believe that many among us have already left the principle of sin. What we will consider this morning is apart from the principle of sin. These two trees represent two principles of living. After becoming Christians, some people live by the principle of right and wrong, while others live by the principle of life.</p><p>In speaking about this matter, I am making the assumption that we have already left the principle of sin and are walking before God. If we would consider a little, we would see that some people live according to the principle of right and wrong or good and evil. Please remember that the principle of right and wrong, the principle of good and evil, is not Christianity. Christianity is a matter of life, not of being according to a standard. Christianity speaks of life, not of good and evil. Christianity teaches life, not right and wrong. There are many young brothers and sisters here this morning. I would like to tell you that after you received the Lord Jesus and gained a new life, you gained something marvelous inwardly. You obtained another principle of living. But if you do not know about it, you will set the principle of life aside and begin to follow the principle of right and wrong.</p><h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Following<br />the Principle of Right and Wrong</h2><p>What is the principle of right and wrong? If our conduct is controlled by the principle of right and wrong, then we ask if something is right or wrong whenever we have to make a decision. Would it be good to do this, or would it be evil? When we ask whether it is good, we are, in effect, asking ourselves, "Am I right to do this or not?" Many people consider much whether something is good or evil. They consider whether they can or cannot do a certain thing. They ask, "Is this right or wrong?" As they carefully consider a certain matter, being Christians, they determine whether it is good and right to do that thing. By taking care to decide whether or not something is good and right, they consider themselves to be good Christians.</p><p>God's Word says, "The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Gen. 2:17). At the most, this practice is only a discerning of good from evil. At best, it is merely choosing and rejecting&mdash;choosing good and rejecting evil. This is not Christianity. Christianity does not have an outward good and an outward evil. It does not have a definite standard in place. I may choose something good and reject something evil today, but this is not Christianity. It is the Old Testament, the law, worldly religions, human morality, and human ethics, but it is not Christianity.</p><h2 class="head2">Christianity Is Based on Life</h2><p>What is Christianity? Christianity is life. Christianity is not a matter of asking whether something is right or wrong. Christianity is a matter of checking with the life inside us whenever we do something. What does the new life which God has given us tell us inwardly about this matter? It is very strange that many people have only seen an outward standard, the standard of good and evil. But God has not given us an outward standard. Christianity is not a new set of Ten Commandments. In Christianity we have not been brought to a new Sinai, nor has God given us a new set of rules and regulations with "Thou shalt" and "Thou shalt not." Christianity does not require that we ask whether something is right or wrong, good or evil. On the contrary, whenever we do anything, there is a life within us which rises up to speak with us. When we feel right inwardly, when we feel the life inside of us moving, when we are strong within and sense the anointing, we know that we have life. Many times something is right and good in the eyes of man, but strangely the inner life has no response and grows cold and retreats.</p><p>Please remember, God's Word tells us that our Christian living is based on an inner life, not an outward standard of right and wrong. Many worldly people, who are not saved, live according to the best standard of living they can attain: the principle of right and wrong. If you or I also live by the principle of right or wrong, we are the same as worldly people. Christians are different from non-Christians because we do not live by an outward standard or law. Our subject is not human morality or concepts. We do not determine whether something is right or wrong by subjecting it to human criticism or opinion. Today we have only one question: What does our inner life say? If the life is strong and active within us, we can do this; if the life is cold and retreating within us, we should not. Our principle for living is inward instead of outward. This is the only real principle of living; the others are false. People may say that many things are right to do, and I may feel that to do them is right, but what does the sense of the inner life tell us? The inner life does not agree. If we were to do them, we would not be rewarded, and if we were not to do them, there should be no shame, because they are outside of us. We can only see what is really right when the Spirit of God operates within us. If we feel that there is life inwardly, then that matter is right. If we do not feel the inward life, then the matter is wrong. Right and wrong are not decided by an outward standard but by the inner life.</p><h2 class="head2">The Standard of Life Is Higher<br />Than the Standard of Good</h2><p>Once this matter is resolved, we can see that we must not only avoid all that is evil but also all that is merely good. Christians can only do that which comes out of life. We can see that there are evil things, good things, and things of life. We are not saying that Christians should only do things that are good and things that are of life. Rather, we are saying that Christians must not do good things or evil things. God said, "Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." Note that "good and evil" are put together here as one way, while "life" is another way. Christians should not just refuse evil, they should even refuse good. There is a standard that is higher than the standard of good; it is the standard of life.</p><p>I have spoken about this matter with many young brothers, but I would like to repeat my story again today. When I first began to serve the Lord, I sought to avoid all that was evil and deliberately set myself to do what was good. According to the human point of view, I seemed to be making splendid progress in avoiding evil and doing good. There was a problem, however. Since I was pursuing right and wrong, I wanted to be clear about what was right and what was wrong in each matter before I did anything. At that time I had a co-worker who was two years older than I, and we were always disagreeing. The differences that arose between us did not concern our own personal affairs. Our disagreements were about public matters, and our disputes were public too. I used to say to myself: That is wrong; if he wants to do things that way, I will protest. But no matter how much I protested, he would never give way. His only excuse was that he was two years older than I. I could argue with any other reason, but I could not argue with the fact that he was two years older than I. I could not get around this argument, but inwardly I did not agree with him. I told this story to an elderly sister, who had a wealth of spiritual experience, and I asked her to arbitrate. Was he right or was I? She did not say he was right, nor did she say he was wrong. She simply stared at me and said, "You should do as he says." I was unhappy inwardly and thought, "If I am right, tell me so; if I am wrong, then say it. Why do you say that I should do as he says?" I asked her to give me a reason for her answer. She said, "In the Lord the younger should submit to the older." "But," I retorted, "in the Lord, if the younger is right and the older wrong, must the younger still submit?" At that time I was in secondary school and had learned nothing of discipline, so I gave free vent to my anger. She still smiled and said, "You had better do as he says."</p><p>Once some people were going to be baptized, and there were three of us caring for the matter. I was the youngest, then the brother two years older than I, and finally there was a Brother Wu, who was seven years older than he. I thought, "You are two years older than I, so I have to submit to you in everything. He is even older; let us see whether or not you will submit." We got together to discuss this matter, but he refused to accept anything from Brother Wu. At every point he insisted on having his own way. Finally, he said, "Just leave things to me; I will do it alone." I thought, "What kind of logic is this? You insist that I always obey you because you are my senior, but you never need to obey your senior." Immediately I sought out this sister to ask her about this matter. I was upset that she did not pay attention to right or wrong. She stood up and asked, "Have you not seen what the life of Christ is? Over the past few months, you have continually come to say that you are right and this brother is wrong. Do you not know what the cross is? You are insisting on the rightness of the matter, but I insist upon the life of the cross." I had been insisting upon right and wrong. I had not seen the matter of life, nor the cross. So she asked me, "Do you think you are right in doing this? Do you think you are right to say these things? Do you think it is right for you to tell me these things? They are all right according to reason, but I would ask how you feel inwardly. What is your inner sense?" I could only confess that I had been right according to reason but wrong according to the inner life.</p><p>The standard of Christian living does not only deal with evil things but also with good and right things. Many matters are right according to human standards, but the divine standard pronounces them wrong because they lack the divine life. On the day to which I just referred, I saw this light for the first time. From then on I began to ask myself if the life I lived before God was according to the principle of life or the principle of what I considered right and wrong. I would check, "Am I doing this just because it is right?" The key to everything is this point: Others may say something is right. We also may say that it is right, but does the Lord's life rise up within us or does it recede when we begin to do something? When we begin to do something, do we sense the anointing or do we feel weighed down? As we are doing that thing, do we have an increasing sense that we are on the right track, or is something telling us that we are off? Please remember that life does not make decisions according to outward standards of right and wrong. Matters should be decided according to the sense of God's life or the sense of death. Decisions should be made according to God's life as it rises up or recedes within us. No Christian should say that he can do something because it is good or right. We must ask the Lord within us. What is the inner feeling that the Lord gives? Do we feel joyful inwardly about this matter? Do we have spiritual happiness and peace? These are the matters that decide our spiritual path.</p><p>When I was visiting Honor Oak, there was another brother who was also a guest there. He had many criticisms of the place. He had been a pastor and was a good preacher, and he knew that Honor Oak had much to offer spiritually. Still, he disapproved of many things. Whenever we ran into each other, he would tell me how much better his place was than Honor Oak. During the two or three months we were together, his criticism exceeded that of everyone else. One day he went too far, so I asked him, "You say Honor Oak is bad, so would it not be best if you left? Why do you remain here?" He answered, pointing to his heart, "The reason lies here; it wants to stay. Every time I pack my things to leave, my peace of heart leaves. Once I even left for two weeks, but I had to write and ask to return." I said, "Brother, have you seen these two ways: the way of life and the way of what you consider to be right or wrong?" He said, "Some days I go to my room to pack my bags as many as three times. But each time I want to leave, there is an inward forbidding. Inwardly, I feel that they are doing things wrong, but I also feel that it would be wrong for me to go." God had shown him that if he could receive spiritual help there, he should stay there to meet God. We all can see that this is not a matter of what we conceive as right or wrong. God uses His life to control His children.</p><h2 class="head2">Externalities Do Not Govern Decisions</h2><p>The greatest error among God's children is that many people determine right and wrong by what they see. Many people determine right and wrong according to their backgrounds and based upon their years of experience. Therefore, they do not know what is really right and what is really wrong. Please remember that Christian living is based upon the inward life. Many people only have externalities before God. Many people decide what is right or wrong according to outward things. Life, however, is a different matter. Those with life know what it is.</p><p>I hope we all would see this before God: No Christian can determine anything apart from life. Whatever increases the inner life is right, and whatever decreases the inner life is wrong. No one should determine whether a matter is right or wrong by some outward standard.</p><p>I recall going to a certain place where the brothers were working with real effect. God was truly using them. If you were to ask me whether or not their work was perfect, I would have to say that there was room for improvement. In great humility they asked me to point out anything I saw that could be corrected, so I pointed out this and that. They asked me several times, but they did not change anything. Was I annoyed? No! A foolish person would become annoyed, but one who knows God could not be upset. I could only indicate external matters that needed adjustment, but I could not see what God was doing within them. I had no way to tell God what He should do within them.</p><p>In another place I visited, the brothers were not preaching the gospel. They discussed the matter with me and asked if I thought that they should be doing so. I answered, "Doctrinally speaking, we certainly should preach the gospel." They said they realized this as well, but that surprisingly God did not give them the life to do so. Those who know God can only stand aside in silence, for our pathway is His life, not right and wrong. The difference between these two principles is immense. Brothers and sisters, the contrast here is too great. So many people only think whether it is right or wrong for them to do something. But today we should not act according to what is right and what is wrong. The one question we must ask today is whether the divine life within us rises or falls. This is what must determine the path we take. Everything is decided in our hearts.</p><h2 class="head2">"Hear Him"</h2><p>On the Mount of Transfiguration, Moses was present, representing the outward, moral standard, and Elijah was present, representing the outward, human standard (Matt. 17:3). We all know that Moses stands for the law, and Elijah stands for the prophets. The standard of the law was present, and the standard of the prophets was present. In the Old Testament the law and the prophets were most qualified to speak, but God silenced them here. God told Peter, "This is My Son, the Beloved...Hear Him!" (v. 5). Today the standard for Christian living is no longer the law, nor is it the prophets. The standard for Christian living is now Christ Himself; it is the indwelling Christ within us. Therefore, it is not a question of whether we are right or wrong but of whether or not the divine life in us agrees with something. Often, to our surprise, we find that the life within us disapproves of what we approve. When this happens, we cannot insist on what we think is right.</p><h2 class="head2">The Divine Life Must Be Satisfied</h2><p>I recall a story of two brothers, both Christians, who had a rice paddy. Rice paddies need to be irrigated. Their paddy was halfway up a hill; others were lower down. In the great heat of the day they drew water and filled their paddy. In the evening they went to sleep. But while they were sleeping, the farmer lower down the hill dug a hole in the irrigation channel surrounding the brothers' field and let all the water flow into his field. The next morning the brothers saw what had happened, but they said nothing. Again they filled the channels with water. The following day they saw that their field had been emptied again, but they still did not say anything. They were Christians and felt that they should endure in silence. This happened every day for a week. Some people suggested that they stand guard in their field at night to catch the thief and beat him. They did not say a word in response; they just endured because they were Christians.</p><p>According to the human concept, they should have been walking joyfully, happily, and victoriously because they were enduring in silence, even after drawing water daily and having it stolen so many times. But strangely enough, even though they drew water every day and remained silent while others stole it, they did not have peace in their hearts. They then went to see a brother with some experience in the Lord's work and said, "We do not understand why we have no peace after enduring for seven or eight days. Christians should endure and allow others to steal from them, but we do not have peace in our hearts." This brother was very experienced. He said, "You have not done enough, nor have you endured enough. You should first fill the field of the person who has stolen your water. Then you can fill your own field. Go and try this, then see whether you will have peace within." They both agreed. The next day they got up earlier than usual and filled the field of the person who had stolen their water, before filling their own field. Strangely enough, they became more and more joyful as they filled that person's field. When they came to fill their own field, they had peace in their hearts. They were at peace with the thought of allowing that person to steal their water. After two or three days of doing this, the person who had stolen their water came to apologize, saying, "If this is Christianity, I want to hear about it."</p><p>This shows us that in the realm of right and wrong, enduring is right. What more can we ask one to do? These ones had spent an entire day drawing water, and not in ordinary weather, but in hot weather. They were not educated people; they were farmers. They had done the right and good thing. What else could one ask of them? Yet they had no peace inwardly. This illustrates the way of life. This is the way we take. The way of right and wrong is another way. Man says that right is good enough, but God says that only life is sufficient. We must do things to the point that joy and peace are produced inwardly. This is the difference between the way of life and the way of right and wrong. It seems as if right and wrong are sufficient and that nothing else is needed. But God is not satisfied with being right. He requires us to satisfy the divine life.</p><p>What does the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5&mdash;7 teach us? It teaches us nothing less than that being right is not enough. We must do things in a way which satisfies the life God has given us. This is the content of Matthew 5&mdash;7, the Sermon on the Mount. The Sermon on the Mount does not say that everything is all right as long as things are done according to what is right. Man asks why he has to turn the other cheek when someone hits him. Is it not good enough if we do not say anything when someone strikes us? Is it not wonderful that we have not rebuked him and have shown great restraint? But God says that it is not even enough to just lower our heads and leave when we are struck. This does not satisfy the inner life. We must turn our other cheek for that person to strike as well. This means that we have no hate in our hearts. We are not angry and can endure this treatment a second time. Life is humble. Life can turn the other cheek for another blow. This is the way of life.</p><p>Many people say that Matthew 5&mdash;7 is too difficult for them. I admit that it is. It is impossible for us to carry out Matthew 5&mdash;7. If we try, we will die because we cannot do it. However, we have another life within us. It tells us that we will not be happy if we do not do this. It does not matter how much we have been offended by a brother or sister. If we do not kneel down to pray for him or her, we will not have inward joy. It is good to endure in silence, but if we do not follow the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount, we will not have inward joy. The Sermon on the Mount teaches that we must satisfy the life of God within us. In doing these things, the divine life is satisfied, released, at peace, and happy. This is the whole matter: Are we walking in the way of life or in the way of right and wrong? If we read God's Word clearly, we will see that it is wrong to decide matters by the principle of right and wrong or to live, act, and have our being according to our self-life.</p><h2 class="head2">There Should Be Fullness of Life Within</h2><p>Sometimes we come across a brother who has acted very foolishly. According to what is proper, we should strongly exhort or rebuke him. We tell ourselves that he requires a serious, thorough dealing. We prepare ourselves to face the situation because we know he will be around for a few days. We go to his home and knock on the door, but then we ask ourselves whether we are right or wrong. He acted foolishly, so what can we do but exhort him? We have gone to his door and raised our hand to knock, but inwardly there is a problem. Our raised hand drops to our side. Even though we have convinced ourselves that we are right, this is not a matter of right or wrong. This is a matter of whether or not the life of God allows us. Many times when we go to exhort a brother, he will receive our exhortation with courtesy and promise to do what God says. Yet the more we preach to him, the more our inward being wilts. When we return home, we have to admit that we have been wrong in exhorting the brother! Therefore, it is not a matter of good or bad but a matter of being full of life inwardly.</p><p>I will give you another example. I met a needy brother a few days ago. He was extremely poor and needed some help. I thought that I certainly should do something for him because there was no prospect of help coming to him from any direction. Just at that point I had no surplus, so it was a great sacrifice to come to his aid. I seemed to be exceeding the limits of my strength to help him. According to what is proper, I was right. I should have been happy as I gave him some money. Yet for some unknown reason, I wilted inwardly as I gave him the money which I had promised to give him. A voice within said, "You are just acting on charity. That was not an act of life; it was merely human chivalry and natural kindness. It was not done in life but in yourself." God did not want me to do this. I have suffered concerning that matter for two or three weeks. Even though I had given the brother money, I had to bow before God, confess my sin, and ask His forgiveness when I reached home.</p><h2 class="head2">Our Living and Actions Must Be<br />according to the Leading of Life</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, as we live before God, our actions must not be determined by good and evil, but by the life within. Whatever life wants us to do is worthwhile. Anything that we do without life, no matter how good it may be, will bring us nothing but inward condemnation. A Christian should not only repent before God for the sins he has committed; often, he must repent before God for the good things he has done. The principle of our living is not one that differentiates between good and evil. We must come before God to determine what is of life and what is of death. When we have life within and feel life rising up, we are doing the proper thing. When the life does not rise up and we cannot sense the anointing in our being, we should not care whether we are acting according to right or wrong. Instead, we must confess before God and ask His forgiveness.</p><p>Paul said that he judged nothing by himself, but that only God judged him (1 Cor. 4:3-4). Many people do not understand this passage in 1 Corinthians. This sentence is very simple, but if we do not know life, it is very difficult. If we have an outward standard of good and evil, it is very easy to judge when we are wrong and right. Paul did not act according to an outward standard of right and wrong, so he could only say, "I do not even examine myself. For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord." The one who examines us before the judgment seat is the Lord. In addition, we have a life within us that leads us on. That is the reason 2 Corinthians 5:7 says, "We walk by faith, not by appearance." We do not determine things by an outward, visible law. We live according to the leading which the Lord gives us inwardly.</p><p>We must learn the lesson before God that we should never act merely according to the standard of right and wrong. The standard of right and wrong is not bad; it is a good standard, but it is not good enough for a Christian. The Christian's standard surpasses right and wrong. The things which are wrong are wrong, but the things which are right are not always right. If we act according to God's life, He will show us that His demands are higher than those of human law. This being the case, it becomes very easy to live the Christian life. In every matter when we seek God's speaking within us, spontaneously there will be the shining of inward light. Please remember that our regeneration is a fact. It is also a fact that God is living in us through the Lord Jesus. The Lord is constantly expressing Himself within us. We hope that each of us would be able to say to God, "Grace me so that I live by the tree of life, not by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. I want to constantly pay attention to life. I want to ask, `What is the sense of life?'" If we live by this principle, we will see a great change in our Christian life.</p><p>Many problems arise because we only have a standard of right and wrong. Many mistakes are made because we do not have the standard of life. If we have the standard of life, many problems will be resolved.</p><h2 class="head2">Prayer</h2><p>O Lord, we stand before You beseeching You to speak again. Man is empty and cannot do anything. We can only ask for Your grace to open our eyes. Every time we open our mouths or make decisions, cause us to come before You and ask if our decision is according to right and wrong or according to the inward leading of life. Lord, cause us to see the difference between what is spiritual and what is fleshly. Cause us to really see the difference between inward light and outward law. Lord, save us from the way of death. Lord, it is wrong for us to live by discerning right from wrong. May we see that discerning right from wrong is sin and death, because only those who live in death can do this. Those who live in life must be led by life. It must be the life that takes the lead. Lord, be among us so that we would see this clearly. We have said this many times, and we want to say it again: May Your Word not be spoken in vain. Cause us to know what life is and what law is. Bless these scattered utterances. Have mercy on us, and grace us. Lead us in the way before us. In the name of the Lord Jesus.

Often we are faithful, but despite our faithfulness there is no blessing and no fruit. Often we are diligent, but despite our diligence there is no blessing and no fruit. Often we exercise our faith; we truly believe God can do something. We also pray that He would work, but everything is in vain when God does not bless us. Sooner or later, we who serve God must be brought to the point of expecting God's blessing. Without God's blessing, our faithfulness, diligence, faith, and prayers will be to no avail. However, if we have God's blessing, there will be fruit even if we seem to be wrong or hopeless. Therefore, all problems are a matter of God's blessing.</p><h2 class="head2">One</h2><p>I would like to bring out the matter of multiplying the five loaves (Mark 6:35-44; 8:1-9) with respect to God's blessing. It is not a matter of how many loaves we have in our hands, but whether or not God has blessed them. Even if we had more than five loaves, this would not be enough to feed four or five thousand people. Even if we had ten times or even one hundred times more, we still would not have enough to feed four or five thousand people. It is not a matter of how much we have. Sooner or later, we must be brought to the point of seeing that it is not a matter of what we can pull out of our storage shed, nor is it a matter of how great our gift is or how much power we have. The day must come in which we say to the Lord, "Everything depends on Your blessing." This is a basic matter. How much blessing has the Lord really given us? It does not really matter how many loaves there are. The Lord's blessing nourishes people and gives them life.</p><p>One matter is troubling my heart: Do we truly treasure God's blessing? This is a basic question concerning the work. Perhaps we do not even have five loaves today, but our need is greater than four thousand or five thousand people. I am afraid that we have less in our storehouse than the apostles, while our need is greater than the need at the time of the apostles. Our own store, source, power, labor, and faithfulness will be manifest that they are useless to us one day. Brothers, our future holds great disappointment for us because we will see that we can do nothing.</p><p>We must notice something in the Gospels. Why does the Lord do two miracles are almost the same in nature and in action? I am afraid it is because this lesson is not easy to learn. Why does He feed the five thousand and then feed the four thousand? Two miracles of almost identical nature are repeated twice in the Gospels. We must learn this lesson, but it is not easy. Many people still do not look to God's blessing, but instead look at the few loaves in their own hands! The loaves in our hands are so pitifully few, but we still base our plans on them. The more we plan in this way, however, the harder the work becomes. Sometimes it becomes impossible. I am somewhat comforted by the words spoken by a brother one hundred years ago. He said, "When the Lord wants to work a small miracle, He puts me in a difficult situation. When He wants to work a great miracle, He puts me in an impossible situation." Our situation is difficult, and it even seems impossible. Many times it is really hard, and we are like the little boy with just a few loaves. We can only hope for a miracle, and this miracle is the Lord Himself taking them up and blessing them.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, the miracles are produced by the Lord's blessing. His blessing changes and multiplies the loaves. The miracles are based on the Lord's blessing. When there is a miracle, five thousand or four thousand people are fed. Without a miracle, even two hundred or five hundred denarii worth of bread are not enough to satisfy that many people. The Lord was training the disciples, bringing them to the point of looking to Him for His blessing.</p><p>Many times we do not have the capacity to do something. The outward environment is difficult, even impossible. If our eyes are fixed on the circumstances, we will not have any way to deal with them. However, the Lord repeatedly brings us through. These times are the Lord's blessing. When we have blessing, everything goes well and nothing is difficult. Without the Lord's blessing, everything goes wrong and nothing is easy. The Lord wants to bring us to a point where His blessing takes the first place, a point where we have never been. When the Lord brings us to such a point, He will have a way to go on. If the Lord does not bring us to this point, we will have to say that even two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough. Today the problem is that we cannot meet the need in ourselves. All of our money combined is not enough. All of us combined is insufficient, but the Lord has a way. In the Lord's work, the basic problem is the Lord's blessing; nothing else matters.</p><h2 class="head2">Two</h2><p>Brothers, if God brings us to the point of seeing that everything in God's work depends upon His blessing, it will bring about a basic change in our labor for God. We would not consider how many people, how much money, or how much bread we have. We would say we do not have enough, but the blessing is sufficient. The blessing meets the need that we cannot meet. Although we cannot measure up to the size of the need, the blessing is greater than our lack. When we see this, the work will have a basic change. In every matter we must look at the blessing more than we consider the situation. Methods, considerations, human wisdom, and clever words are all useless. In God's work we should believe in and expect His blessing. Many times we are careless and damage the work, but this is not a problem. If the Lord gives us a small blessing, we can get through any problem.</p><p>We truly hope that we would not make mistakes or speak and act loosely in the work. When we have the Lord's blessing, however, it seems that we cannot err even when we are wrong. Sometimes it seems that we have made a serious mistake, but with God's blessing the result is not really an error. I once said to Brother Witness that if we had the Lord's blessing, the things we did right would be right and the things we did wrong would be right as well. Nothing could damage the blessing.</p><h2 class="head2">Three</h2><p>The basic concern today is that we must learn to live in a way that does not hinder God's blessing. Some habits force God to withhold His blessing, and these must be eliminated. Some temperaments keep God from blessing, and these must be done away with. We must learn to believe in God's blessing, rely on it, and eliminate the barriers which prevent us from receiving it.</p><p>Let us take Sian as an example. When the brothers were divided into two parties, this definitely hindered God from blessing. If their problem had continued to exist, God's blessing would not have come in. In another example, there have been some difficulties in Szechuan recently. Therefore, we cannot expect Szechuan to have any special blessing. I merely mention these matters as examples.</p><p>We must see that the Lord withholds no good thing from us. If the work is not going well, if the brothers and sisters are in a poor condition, or if the number of saved ones is not increasing, we should not use the environment or certain people as an excuse. We cannot blame the brothers. I am afraid that the real reason lies with our harboring of some frustrations to the blessing. If the Lord can get through in us, the Lord's blessing will be greater than our capacity. Once God said to the Israelites, "Prove Me, if you will, by this,..whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it" (Mal. 3:10). God is still saying this today. The normal life of a Christian is a life of blessing, and the normal work of a Christian is a work of blessing. If we do not receive blessing, we should say, "Lord, perhaps I am the problem."</p><p>With the passing years it becomes more and more evident that some brothers receive God's blessing while others do not. Of ourselves, we are not able to form any judgment about this matter, but over the years this fact has become so evident that we know beforehand that there will be fruit if one brother goes out but none if another brother goes out. We seemingly can forecast the result.</p><h2 class="head2">Four</h2><p>There are definite requirements for receiving the Lord's blessing. It does not come by accident or luck. God has His ways and works according to His principles. God likes certain conditions and does not like others. Esau was very good, but God did not like him. Jacob was not good, but God liked him. God has His own reasons. If a person does not receive God's blessing, there is a reason for it. If we do not receive God's blessing, we should not push the responsibility for it onto the situation or environment. There is always a reason for not being blessed. If we could be brought to the point in which we wholeheartedly hope for His blessing and wholeheartedly ask Him to show us the reason for not being blessed, God's work would have a great future. I really hope that we could live on the earth by expecting the Lord's blessing. Nothing is as important as God's blessing. The results of the work are in the blessing.</p><p>I am well aware that we all have our own particular weaknesses. God seems to overlook some of these, but He will not tolerate other ones. Where these exist His blessing cannot rest. It seems that God does not care about some weaknesses. It does not bother Him if you make these mistakes over and over again, but God cares about other weaknesses very much. Therefore, we must be very careful about the weaknesses which might cause us to lose God's blessing. We may be unable to eliminate all our weaknesses, but we must ask God to have mercy on us so that we would be those who are able to receive His blessing. We should say to the Lord, "This vessel is weak, but forbid that it should be too shallow or too small to contain Your blessing." Even though we are shallow and small, we are still able to contain His blessing. God's blessing and gifts are His work. Thus, we hope God would have mercy on us.</p><h2 class="head2">Five</h2><p>Oh, that blessing might flow from us as it flowed from Abraham. I believe that there will soon be a great turn in the gospel work. May the Lord bless us and have mercy on us. May we regard blessing as if we were accustomed to receiving it constantly. We do not want to frustrate God from blessing us greatly. The salvation of one thousand people may hinder the salvation of tens of thousands. Perhaps the salvation of a few score people in one place is a hindrance to the salvation of several thousand others. Each time we receive one blessing, we should expect to receive a second blessing. We must continuously step into greater blessings from God. Each of our co-workers must look to God to do a work among us such as He has never done before. Immediately before us lies a work that is ten times greater, even one hundred times greater, than that which is behind us. Is it possible that the few people who have been saved and the meeting hall we have built have become the limits of our blessing? In the past the work constantly grew, but now we have tied it up. Our past blessings have become our present frustrations. This is very pitiful.</p><p>Each time we come before God, we must be like we were the first time we came out to work. Some have been working for twenty years, yet they seem like those who are new to the work. Some have been working for thirty years, but they seem like they are new in the work. We must set the things of the past aside. In difficult situations God will do more if our hopes, expectations, and hearts are large. We must never measure God by our capacity. A few loaves of bread can feed four or five thousand people. If the blessing is large, nothing can hinder it. If we who serve the Lord truly look for God's blessing when we gather together, the future results will be more than we can ask or think.</p><h2 class="head2">Six</h2><p>God's blessing is like a bird that will only fly from the outside into a room by itself. When it is at the window, we cannot call it to come in. If it comes in, however, it is very easy to chase away. God will bless what He wants to bless; we cannot force Him to do anything. Like the bird, it is difficult to lure in and easy to chase away. With just a little carelessness, we can chase the blessing away.</p><p>Over the past two or three years, I have observed our co-workers doing many things. One co-worker said something to another co-worker, and they had an argument. He was absolutely right in what he said and did, but in my heart, I wanted to say, "Brother, you are right, but should we behave according to right and wrong? Or should we behave according to what will bring in God's blessing?" We often may do something right, but what can we do if God does not bless us when we do things right? We should not ask whether our every action is right or wrong. Instead, we should ask whether we have God's blessing. We are not here to argue about right and wrong; we are here to ask God to bless us. Seeking God's blessing on our work will limit us much in our speaking and in our daily living. We may be right, but will God bless us? It is very easy for us to cut off our blessing. It is also very easy to cut off the blessing of others as well. Our standard is not right or wrong. We look for God's blessing. Both may be right, but can God bless such a work? Our lives must be governed by God's blessing.</p><p>In God's work He will not bless what is wrong, but He will not bless what is right either. When we stand together in one accord, the blessing comes. Therefore, I want us to know that it is a very serious matter when the brothers argue with each other. We may be absolutely right in the matter, but the blessing will stop! Brothers, let me solemnly warn about speaking loosely or thinking that it is good enough just to be right. May the Lord have mercy on us. The brothers have to be careful about speaking among themselves and criticizing one another. It does not matter if we are right. If we are right and God does not bless us, what is the use of being right? The work is not built upon our abilities, nor is it built upon our gifts, faithfulness, or labor. If we miss God's blessing, everything is finished.</p><h2 class="head2">Seven</h2><p>What is blessing? Blessing is God working without any cause. Logically speaking, one penny should buy one penny's worth of goods. But sometimes, without spending a cent, God gives us ten thousand pennies' worth of goods. This means that what we have received is beyond reckoning. God's blessing is any work He performs without cause. This work surpasses what we should receive. Five loaves fed five thousand people, and there were still twelve full baskets left over! This is blessing. Some people should not get a certain kind of result. They should only have a little, but surprisingly they have much. Our entire work is built upon God's blessing. The blessing is the result of receiving what we do not deserve, that is, the result of receiving beyond what our gift warrants us to receive. The result that we get which is beyond what our strength earns is the blessing. Putting it more strongly, we do not deserve any results because of our weaknesses and failures, but astoundingly we obtain something, and what we obtain is the blessing. If we look for God's blessing, He will give us unexpected results. In our service do we hope for God to give us great results? Many brothers and sisters only look for results that can be expected from themselves alone. Blessing means that the result is not in proportion to the cause.</p><p>If we only look for results based on what we are, if we only look for a little fruit, and if we do not hope for great results, we run the risk of losing God's blessing. Since we only pay attention to the fact that we are laboring night and day, God cannot do anything beyond our expectation. We must put ourselves in a position in which God can bless us. We must say to the Lord, "Based on what we are, we should not obtain any results, but, Lord, for the sake of Your name, Your church, and Your way, we hope You will give something to us." Having faith in the work is believing and expecting God's blessing. In God's work, having faith means having the conviction that the result will not be in proportion to us. When we practice this, I believe God will bless our way. I hope that as the brothers discuss the matter of the migrations, the Lord's blessing will exceed our expectation.</p><p>At times it seems that God not only grants no blessing, but even deliberately withholds it. For God to withhold His blessing is more serious than for Him to not grant blessing. With our strength and gifts, we should have better results, but we do not obtain them. We labor through the night and should obtain certain results, but if God withholds His blessing, we will obtain less than we should. We labor for a long time but obtain no fruit. We are diligent, yet there are no results. This is what happens when God withholds His blessing.</p><p>I wonder if we feel the seriousness of this. We absolutely must not argue about the right way to do things. Being right is of no use. We must pay attention to whether or not God blesses us. Often we are very right, yet God does not bless us. It is right to fish all night, yet God does not bless us. We do not live on earth by doing what is right; we live to experience God's blessing. David and Abraham both made mistakes, Isaac was not very useful, and Jacob was crafty, but God blessed them all. It is not a matter of being right or wrong, but of being blessed by God. Perhaps we who are here today are much better than Jacob, but if God does not bless us, nothing will avail. We must be those who can be blessed by God. We can argue and be right, but it is useless if God does not bless us.</p><p>The entire future of the work depends on God's blessing, not on being right. If God blesses, then many sinners will be saved. If God blesses, we will be able to send people out to the remote regions. If there is no blessing, people will not get saved. If there is no blessing, workers will not be produced. If there is no blessing, no one will offer anything. If there is no blessing, no one will migrate. When the blessing is here, even things that seem wrong are right. When God blesses, we cannot go wrong even if we try. One time there was a meeting in which it seemed that we sang the wrong hymn, but we had a good result because we had God's blessing. Sometimes when we preach, it seems that we are speaking the wrong word to the wrong audience, but God still blesses some in the audience. When we speak again, we still may speak the wrong word, but God blesses another group of people. I am not saying that we can be loose intentionally. I am saying that we cannot go wrong when we have God's blessing. It seems that our mistakes should be a frustration, but He cannot be hindered. God said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated" (Rom. 9:13). God blesses whom He likes. This is a very serious matter. We should not think that the blessing is a small thing. The blessing is souls and consecrated people. Behind the word blessing perhaps there are fifty souls or one hundred consecrations. The words, attitudes, and opinions of certain people can stop the Lord's blessing. We must ask the Lord to prick us inwardly until we obtain His blessing. If we do not do this, our sin of losing the Lord's blessing will be greater than any other sin. The blessing could be hundreds or thousands of souls. We must look to God for the blessing and not let it escape. We must beg God to give us grace.</p><h2 class="head2">Eight</h2><p>O brothers! We must learn to live in God's blessing. It is good to work and do things, but we must have our capacity increased. We must ask God to keep us in His blessing in our work and actions. If we do not resolve this problem, our work will be severely damaged. Brother Witness was in Shanghai in 1945. One day he said that the brothers' meeting experienced great blessing from God. I believe that Brother Witness has made some progress in this matter. We must come before God to see that we do not expect the results of our labor, but expect God's blessing. Sometimes there are some results from our work, but they are dry and poor. If we expect God's blessing, many things will happen that are beyond our expectation. If we wait upon God's blessing, things will happen beyond our capacity. We must continually look for miracles and unexpected occurrences in the work. We should not keep expecting that we will be able to bear any fruit. Our expectation of that small amount of fruit limits God. If we do not expect God's blessing, there is not much hope for our future. We will have financial difficulties, and it will be difficult for us to go on. Therefore, we should not look for results commensurate with our individual labor, but we should look for God's blessing. If we only look for commensurate results, I do not know how many years it will take for many people to believe in the Lord. We must always look for God to do things beyond our expectations. We must ask God to give us the vision to see the meaning of blessing.</p><p>Some are checking to see whether or not the young people are doing things right. Instead, we should be checking to see if a person is being blessed by God. If a person can be blessed by God, we do not know how much more fruit he will bear beyond just his gift and ability. If he does not have the blessing, his carefulness and labor will be in vain.</p><p>Some people are blessed by God, and other people are not blessed by God. We may have a better temper and a larger gift than a certain brother, but he bears fruit in his work, while we cannot bear fruit in ours. We look down on many people because we are better, yet God blesses them. We cannot say that God is wrong. We must realize that before God, we are those whom He cannot bless.</p><p>We should not become angry or jealous about this matter. Instead, we should judge ourselves soberly. We have many excuses, and so do our brothers. We are right, and so are they. But what can we do if God does not bless? We are right, but we cannot win souls. They are right, but the church is not built up. We are right, but it is in vain. Therefore, we must eliminate all the things that stop and frustrate the blessing. From now on we should not be those who stubbornly argue over right and wrong; we must be those who receive great blessings from God.</p><p>Watchman Nee<br />November 27, 1950</p><h2 class="head1">THE TREASURE IN EARTHEN VESSELS<br />(A Record of a Mid-week Fellowship Meeting)</h2><p>"For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living. Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead" (2 Corinthians 1:8-9).</p><p>"This therefore intending, did I then use fickleness? Or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there should be Yes, yes and No, no?" (v. 17).</p><p>"For if I cause you sorrow.." (2:2a).</p><p>"And I wrote this very thing to you" (v. 3a).</p><p>"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you would be made sorrowful but that you would know the love which I have more abundantly toward you" (v. 4).</p><p>"Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some do, letters of commendation to you or from you?" (3:1).</p><p>"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God" (v. 5).</p><p>"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us. We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body" (4:7-10).</p><p>"For also, we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, in that we do not desire to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life" (5:4).</p><p>"So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh" (v. 16a).</p><p>"Through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true; as unknown and yet well known; as dying and yet behold we live; as being disciplined and yet not being put to death; as made sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things" (6:8-10).</p><p>"For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted in everything; without were fightings, within were fears" (7:5).</p><p>"But I myself, Paul,..in person am base among you, but while absent am bold toward you" (10:1).</p><p>"For even if I should boast somewhat more abundantly concerning our authority, which the Lord has given for building you up and not for overthrowing you, I will not be put to shame" (v. 8).</p><p>"Because while his letters, someone says, are weighty and strong, his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible" (v. 10).</p><p>"But I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing. But even if I am a layman in speech, yet I am not in knowledge; indeed in every way we have made this manifest in all things to you" (11:5-6).</p><p>"And because of the transcendence of the revelations, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up. Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me. And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me... For when I am weak, then I am powerful" (12:7-9, 10b).</p><p>"For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds" (10:4).</p><h2 class="head2">Paul in 2 Corinthians</h2><p>As we read 2 Corinthians carefully before God, we seem to meet two persons&mdash;Paul in himself and Paul in Christ. Everything Paul speaks of, from chapter one to chapter thirteen, is all according to this principle. If we summarized Paul's message in this book, we could cover everything with his words in chapter four, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels." In chapter one we see this treasure being put into the earthen vessel. From 3:1 through the end of the book, we see the earthen vessel on the one hand and the treasure on the other hand. After reading these words before God, we spontaneously will see under His enlightenment that the earthen vessel does not hinder the treasure from shining. The earthen vessel does not bury the power of the treasure.</p><p>Here we see a person. We have mentioned before that 2 Corinthians is the most personal book in the New Testament. Many Epistles are filled with doctrine, truth, and revelation. Many Epistles move from God's point of view to our point of view. Second Corinthians, however, is the only book in the New Testament which shows us the very kind of person whom God used to pass on His revelation. If we did not have the book of 2 Corinthians, we would never know Paul himself. We would know what he accomplished, but we would never know this ministry. Second Corinthians shows us his ministry, and from his ministry, we meet the man. We see that he was an earthen vessel.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ideal Christian</h2><p>When I first became a Christian, I had my own concept of the ideal Christian, and I tried my utmost to be that kind of Christian. I thought that if only I could attain to the ideal I had conceived, then I would attain perfection. I wanted to be perfect, but I had my own ideal and standard for being a perfect Christian. I thought that if I could reach this standard, I would be perfect. I thought a perfect Christian should smile from morning to night. If he shed tears, I thought he was not victorious, but a failure. I would even say he was wrong. I thought a perfect Christian should be bold, unafraid, and courageous in every situation. If he was fearful in anything, I would say he did not have faith. I would say he was not perfect because he did not trust in the Lord. I also thought the perfect Christian was never sad. If a person was sad, I doubted that he was perfect. I could mention many other criteria, but I do not need to mention too many of these concepts to you. I believe that many of the younger brothers and sisters have ideals of what a Christian is. I am not criticizing because I used to think the same way myself.</p><h2 class="head2">Paul Was a Man</h2><p>One day I read the passage in 2 Corinthians where Paul was sorrowful. I asked, "Was Paul sorrowful?" I read that he shed many tears. I asked, "Did Paul cry?" I read that Paul suffered and was sad. I asked, "Did Paul suffer, and was he sad?" I read that he was burdened and despaired even of his life. I asked, "Did Paul despair?" As I continued reading, I saw that there were many things of which I had never thought. I had never considered that a person like Paul would have these problems. I began to realize that Christians are not another type of angel. God has not put a race of angels on the earth and said, "These are Christians." I also began to see that Paul was very close to us; he was not so far off. Paul was someone I know; he was not a stranger. I know him because I saw that he was a man.</p><h2 class="head2">The Treasure Manifested in Earthen Vessels</h2><p>Many people have a concept of an ideal Christian. Please remember that this ideal was created by us, not by God. That kind of ideal Christian does not exist, nor does God want us to be such. Here we meet an earthen vessel, but the special characteristic of this earthen vessel is that a treasure has been put into it. The treasure transcends and overshadows the earthen vessel and manifests itself from within the vessel. This is the meaning of Christianity and of being a Christian. In Paul, we see a man who was afraid yet strong. He was troubled in his heart yet had hope. He was surrounded by enemies yet was not captured. Although he met with persecution, he did not feel rejected or cast aside. He seemingly was knocked down, but he did not die (2 Cor. 4:7-9). We see his weaknesses, but when he was weak, he was powerful (12:10b). We see him bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, but the life of Jesus was manifested in his body (4:10). We see him being slandered, but he had a good name. He seemingly led others astray, but he was honest. He seemingly was not famous, but everyone knew him. He seemingly was about to die, but he lived. He seemingly was punished, but not unto death. He seemingly was sad, but he always rejoiced. He seemingly was poor, but he made many rich. He seemingly had nothing, but he had everything (6:8-10). This is a real Christian. This is true Christianity.</p><p>A Christian is a person in whom there is a basic, but harmonious, paradox. Christianity means having a life in which there is an incomprehensible, spiritual paradox. God gives us this paradox. Some people think there is only a treasure but not an earthen vessel. Others think that the earthen vessel prevents them from going on. Human thought is always so extreme. We think it would be ideal just having the treasure. We think that the earthen vessel prevents us from going on. Before God, however, we see a treasure placed in earthen vessels. The earthen vessel is not destroyed, and it does not frustrate anything. The treasure is in the earthen vessel.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Power Being Manifested in Man's Weakness</h2><p>The apostle said that he had a thorn in his flesh (2 Cor. 12:7). I do not know what this thorn was, but I know this thorn made Paul weak. He prayed to the Lord about the matter three times, hoping the Lord would remove the thorn. However, the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you" (vv. 8-9). The Lord said even though the thorn in his flesh made Paul weak, His power was perfected in this weakness. How is the Lord's power perfected in human weakness? He said, "My power will tabernacle over your weakness," which means "My power will overshadow or cover your weakness." This is Christianity. Christianity does not eliminate weaknesses, nor does it only look to the Lord's power. Christianity means that the Lord's power is manifested in man's weakness. Christianity does not mean that a new race of strange angels is created on the earth. Christianity means that man's weaknesses can manifest God's power.</p><p>Let me give an example. Once I had a very serious illness. I was x-rayed three times in two months, and each time the report was very grave. I prayed, I believed, and I hoped that God would cure my illness. At times my strength was greater than normal. Before God, I confessed that I had been empowered, but I was angry because I did not know the reason God was treating me this way. At certain times I would be well and full of strength, but I would relapse without warning. What was the use of God giving me this temporary strength? I was very sick at heart. One day as I was reading the Bible, I came across 2 Corinthians 12. Paul prayed to God three times about that thorn, but the Lord was not willing to do anything. Instead, He said, "My grace is sufficient for you." The Lord increased His grace because of the thorn. The Lord increased his power because of the weakness. I saw what Christianity was. As I lay in bed, I asked the Lord to show me more clearly what this was all about. Inwardly, I had the impression of a boat in a river. The boat required ten feet of water for navigation. In the river, however, a submerged rock rose five feet from the bottom of the river. If the Lord so desired, He could remove the boulder to let the boat pass, but within there was a question: "Would it be better for Me to remove the rock or to increase the water level by five feet?" God asked me if it would be better to remove the boulder or to increase the water level by five feet. I told the Lord that it would be better to increase the water level by five feet.</p><p>From that day onward many of my difficulties were gone. I dare not say that I was never tempted again, but praise God, from that matter I discovered God has other ways to meet our needs. This is Christianity. I repeat, Christianity does not remove the boulder; it increases the water level by five feet. This is Christianity. Are there difficulties? Yes, we all have difficulties. Are there trials? Yes, we all are tried. Are there weaknesses? Yes, we all have weaknesses. Please remember one thing, however, that the Lord does not eliminate our weaknesses on the negative side nor give us unwarranted power on the positive side. God's power is manifested in weakness, just as our treasure is in earthen vessels.</p><h2 class="head2">The Paradoxical Spiritual Life</h2><p>Today I would like to say that no Christian has an earthen vessel that is earthy enough to prohibit the Lord's treasure from being manifested. No matter how weak we are, remember that the Lord's treasure is manifested in it. Therefore, we see a spiritual paradox in Paul and in us. Do we know what people said about Paul? They said that his speech was contemptible (10:10b), that he took them by guile (12:16), and that he was fickle and said "Yes, yes" and "No, no" (1:17). They said his letters were weighty and strong enough to terrify people (10:9-10). But paradoxically, God's treasure looks very good in such an earthen vessel. God's treasure would not look so nice without the earthen vessel. I am saying that Paul was a genuine man. Thank God that the Lord shined out, or broke out, from within him. He was not a man without feelings. But in his sorrow, he said, "I always rejoice." He was not rejoicing constantly or in sorrow constantly; rather, he constantly rejoiced in his sorrow.</p><p>Let me tell you that this is the special characteristic of Christianity. There is a smile while tears are flowing. Many Christians act better than Paul, but they do not live like a Christian. They only can praise the Lord; they are not like a Christian. Many Christians think they can attain a state of never being sorrowful or troubled. There are others who are continually sorrowful and troubled. This means that the treasure has not been expressed in them. But here we have a man through whom the Lord Jesus could pass. I have seen some of the Lord's most outstanding children. When I saw them, I immediately knew who they were and what kind of persons they were. But at the same time I knew what kind of persons they were before the Lord. Today we do not want to see any trace of the earthen vessel when we look at people. Sometimes, however, our eyes only see the earthen vessel. Those who know God, however, are able to see the treasure in earthen vessels when they look at God's children.</p><p>Once I met a sister in the Lord. As soon as I met her, I knew that she had a quick disposition. She acted and spoke quickly; she was quick to rebuke others and quick to write letters. Thank the Lord, however, that there were probably one hundred letters in her wastepaper basket which had never been mailed. Because of the earthen vessel, she would write the letters, but the letters in the wastepaper basket proved that she also had the treasure. The treasure was in the earthen vessel. When one saw her, he knew her. She was this kind of person by nature, but one could also see the Lord in her. Sometimes we see a person suffering under trials. But we also see the riches he possesses. This is the treasure in the earthen vessel.</p><p>I hope we would see something before the Lord. Today God is not requiring or expecting abstract things. Some brothers ask me why they are so weak. I say that weakness does not matter at all; they will become strong. One brother asked me what he should do after having done a terrible job. I told him that it was not a problem because the important thing is that God puts this treasure into us. We do not need to pretend, by fixing up the earthen vessel. We do not need to cultivate a certain tone or style. Everything comes from God. The treasure can be expressed from within us, the earthen vessels.</p><p>I had a conversation with the deacons this last Lord's Day. Many of them said that they were praying for a certain family member, a certain sickness, or a certain matter. I asked them how it was going. They each told me that they believed God would heal their illnesses or save their sons and spouses. They were all very confident, so confident that they did not have the slightest doubt. But we should wait and see. The sick ones are still ill, the sons and spouses are still unrepentant, and the difficult matters still remain. Their kind of faith belongs to the angels, not to earthen vessels. Their faith is too abstract; it is too good. No one in the world has such great faith.</p><p>One brother came to tell me that he was learning to believe in God. He dared not say what the outcome would be. Perhaps it would turn out all right, but even if it did not, he would still believe. He prayed to God the day before, and God gave him His promise. He knew that God had answered his prayer, but for some reason he began to doubt when he got up that morning. He prayed again, but he did not know what to do. As he was walking on the road, he began to doubt again, but he did not know what to do. I told him that his doubts were unimportant. True faith cannot be killed by doubts. In fact, real faith looks better when it is surrounded by doubt. I know what I am saying. I hope you will not misunderstand me; I do not want you to go out and doubt. The main point is that our human, earthen vessel is joined to God's treasure. There is not just the latter.</p><p>I like reading about the prayer of the early church for Peter to be freed from the hands of evil men. God heard their prayer. When Peter returned to the house and knocked on the door, they said that it must be his angel (Acts 12:12-15). Do we see that this is faith, real faith? God heard the prayers, but human weakness was in it. We do not see them doing anything to hide their weaknesses. Some people today have greater faith than those in the house of Mary and Mark. They are so certain that God will send an angel and break the lock on the prison doors. Perhaps they are like those in the examples we gave on the Lord's Day. If the wind blows, they say it is Peter knocking. If the rain strikes the house, they say Peter is knocking. These people have such great faith, but what they believe does not happen. Let me say frankly: This kind of Christian can only do things by himself and cheat a group of gullible people. Those who know God will say that there is an earthen vessel in Christianity. In Christianity the treasure is in earthen vessels. Human doubt is really an abomination, and it is sin. Nothing that comes from the earthen vessel alone can be accepted. The crucial matter is not the earthen vessel, but the fact that a treasure has been placed in it. We do not need to improve or fix the earthen vessel. The treasure has been placed into the vessel.</p><p>Many times we have the assurance that God has heard our prayer. During the moments when we feel that our faith is strongest, we may also sense the presence of doubts. When we hear God's voice most clearly, we will also hear the devil's voice. In this kind of situation, I thank and praise God for the faith He has given us. This faith cannot change; it is still present. Before God we can see that the treasure is all the time expressed through the earthen vessel. God's glory is manifested through the earthen vessel.</p><p>Many Christians have a life and walk that are all too artificial; they do not express the treasure. These ones only have human endeavor, performance, and outward behavior. A normal Christian life, however, is one in which one may doubt even in the moments of his greatest assurance. It is one in which one finds himself inwardly weak even in the moments of his greatest strength, inwardly fearful in the midst of real courage before God, and inwardly doubting in the moments of exhilarating joy. This kind of paradox proves that the treasure is in the earthen vessel.</p><h2 class="head2">Human Weakness<br />Not Limiting God's Power</h2><p>Finally, I would like to say that I especially thank God because no human weakness can limit God's power. What do we think in our hearts? We tend to think that if there is sorrow, there should not be joy; if there are tears, there should not be praise; if there is weakness, there should not be power; if there is pressing on every side, there should be constriction; if there is casting down, there should be destruction; and if there are doubts, we should be unable to believe. But tonight I would like to loudly declare that this is not true. God wants us to arrive at the point where we see that everything human is just an earthen vessel to contain God's treasure. Everything human is an earthen vessel for God's treasure. Nothing human is able to bury God's treasure. We do not need to be disappointed when we meet with disappointment. Although we cannot make it, we should allow something positive to come in, and when it does, it shines better, more brightly, and more gloriously. Many times we have doubts after praying, and we think that everything is finished. When faith comes, however, it magnifies the treasure despite the lingering presence of doubt. Faith makes the treasure more glorious. I am not speaking of an ideal; I know what I am saying. God's treasure can be expressed in earthen vessels. This is a spiritual paradox; it is precious to every Christian. It is in the context of this spiritual paradox that we live and learn to know our God.</p><p>As we journey along this way, we will discover the immensity of the spiritual contradiction that exists within us. As time goes on, we find this cleavage, this dividing gulf, is ever widening; the contradiction within us is ever accentuated. At the same time, the treasure is expressed ever clearer. The earthen vessel remains an earthen vessel. How wonderful this picture is! We find a man whose original traits remain intact, yet God gives him a patience far more excellent than his natural resilience. It is better to see a man in whom God has placed humility than to see a naturally reticent person. It is better to see a man in whom God has placed meekness than to see a person who is weak and impotent by nature. It is better to see a person in whom God's power resides than to see a naturally strong man. The inward difference is enormous. It matters little what kind of earthen vessel we have; the treasure can always go inside. The earthen vessel remains an earthen vessel, but it is now a filled vessel. All weak people think that they are too earthen; their vessels are too full of clay and they are without any hope. Please remember that we have no reason to be disappointed or troubled. Whatever is spiritual, strong, powerful, and comes from the Lord can be manifested in us and will shine brighter and be magnified through the earthen vessel. Since this is the case, we can see the importance of the treasure.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, everything depends upon the treasure. I must repeat, all situations revolve around this matter. Every outcome is positive. Those whose eyes are on the negative things are fools. The Lord can express Himself through everyone. When we have the treasure, many will know it.</p><p>Watchman Nee</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT TESTIMONY<br />(The Testimony has been combined with this publication.)</h2><p>THEME: Messages specifically on life.</p><p>CONTENTS: The contents describe the light received before God and the lessons learned in order to help God's children have practical growth in the aspect of life.</p><p>FREQUENCY: Irregular.</p><p>PRICE: Not for sale.</p><p>SUBSCRIPTIONS: Anyone wishing to subscribe to this publication should clearly write his name, address, and the number of copies requested and send this to The Periodical Subscription Department, Gospel Book Room, P.

God uses Christ as the means to reach the goal, which is Christ. We can know and see God's goal particularly from the books of Ephesians and Colossians. In this message we would like to consider God's goal from these two books. There is one difference between these two books: Ephesians shows us that according to the economy of the fullness of the times, God wants to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth (1:10); Colossians shows us that God has not only made Christ to be Head over all things, but God has made Him all and in all (1:18; 3:11b). Colossians shows us that God's goal is Christ, and His means is also Christ. God's goal is for Christ to be Head over all things. In order to arrive at this, God must make Christ to be all. He must be all, and at the same time, He must be in all. Only then will all things be headed up, for if Christ is all and if Christ is in all, all things will be headed up spontaneously.</p><p>Please remember that in God's eyes, there are not many things. In God's eyes, there is only Christ. In God's eyes there is no matter and no thing; in God's eyes there is only Christ. What we ordinarily think of as matters and things do not exist in God's eyes. We may consider that there are many matters and things in this world. According to our worldly view, there are matters and there are things. But in God's eyes, Christ is everything. There is no matter, and there are no things. Christ is all the matters, and Christ is all the things. When the day comes that Christ is in all matters and in all things, God's eternal purpose will be fulfilled.</p><p>I hope that you can see that Christ has headed up all things in Himself. This does not begin in the future when God's eternal purpose is fulfilled; it begins today through the church.</p><p>Tonight I will not go too deeply; I will only touch this matter briefly. God has ordained that all matters and things will be headed up in Christ in the future. How can all things be headed up? God says that Christ is all things. He is all, and at the same time, He is in all. When this happens, we will only see Christ in the world; we will not see matters and things anymore, because all matters and all things will have passed away.</p><p>Today in the church God is starting to show us that Christ is all matters and things. When the church sees this, it will begin to live in the realm of the spirit. If the eyes of the church are set only on matters and things, it has not seen Christ yet.</p><p>The matters I am referring to are not the matters of the world, and the things I am referring to are not the things of the world. The matters and things I am referring to are spiritual matters and things.</p><h2 class="head2">The Revelation of the Gospel of John</h2><h2 class="head3">Christ Being the Things of God</h2><p>I would like to point out a very interesting thing here. The Gospel of John is the deepest Gospel; it is also the last Gospel written. It is the last book written in the New Testament. Many Epistles and books were written before the Gospel of John was written. John wrote his Gospel last. He wrote many things which are not found in the other Gospels. At the end he said that our understanding of Christ should be the same as God's understanding of Christ.</p><p>What we see in this book is not God's requirement for a lamb, or His gift of the bread of life. What we see is not just God's provision of a way, a truth, or a life. It is not a matter of the Lord having the power to restore man's life; it is not a matter of resurrection. It is not a matter of the Lord Jesus being able to give light, restore sight, and lead those who follow Him out of darkness. In the whole Gospel, we see only one great fact. This fact is that Christ is all things. The Gospel of John says that He is the light of the world; it does not say that He gives us light. It says that He is the bread of life; it does not say that He gives the bread of life. It says that He is the way; it does not say that He can show us the way. It says that He is the truth; it does not say that He can teach us a truth. It says that He is the life; it does not say that He can give us life. After Lazarus died, the Lord did not tell Martha and Mary that He had the power to resurrect their brother. Rather, He said that He is the resurrection.</p><p>Please remember that the bread of life is a thing, light is a thing, the way is a thing, truth is a thing, and life, resurrection, and the lamb are all things. But in Christianity, we do not find individual things. In Christianity, there is only Christ! Christ is what it is all about.</p><p>Today we have to see one thing before the Lord. We have to realize that in our experience there are not many matters and things. In our experience, there is only Christ. He does not give us the light; He is our light. He does not lead us to a way; He is our way. He does not give us life; He is our life. He does not teach us to understand a truth; He is the truth. Brothers, do you see the difference? All that God has given us is Christ Himself.</p><p>One day I told a group of people a spiritual fact. As I was speaking, many eyes began to stare at me. I said, "Let me tell you one crucial fact: God's Christ is God's matters. God does not have matters; God only has Christ! He has not given us light; He has given us Christ. He has not given us food; He has given us Christ. He has not given us a way, a truth, and a life; He has given us Christ. God's Christ is all things. Apart from Christ, God does not have any thing."</p><h2 class="head2">What Paul Knew</h2><h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Hope</h2><p>I would like to point out that not only does the Lord Jesus' own word testify to this, but Paul said the same thing. He knew the Lord, and he showed us one very interesting thing. He said to Timothy, "Christ Jesus our hope" (1 Tim. 1:1). I like this word. Do you like it? He did not say that our hope is in Christ Jesus. Rather, he said Christ Jesus is our hope. We do not put our hope in Him, and we do not draw hope from Him. Rather, Christ Jesus is our hope.</p><h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Life</h2><p>Again he said to the Colossians, "When Christ our life is manifested..." (Col. 3:4). He did not say, "When Christ is manifested." Rather, he said, "When Christ our life is manifested." He said that Christ is our life. A Christian does not have many matters; a Christian only has Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Wisdom:<br />Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption</h2><p>This is not all. In these messages, the one verse that we emphasize more than any other verse is 1 Corinthians 1:30. What does it say? It says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." God has not given us righteousness; He has given us Christ. Christ is our righteousness. God has not given us sanctification; He has given us Christ. Christ is our sanctification. God has not given us redemption; He has given us Christ. Christ is our redemption. God has not given us wisdom; He has given us Christ. Christ is our wisdom. This is why we say that the Christ of God is the things of God. God's Christ is God's matters and things. Apart from Christ, God does not have any matter or thing.</p><h2 class="head4">Christ Being Our Righteousness</h2><p>If God were to say to us, "I have made the Lord Jesus the Lord of righteousness; He is the One who justifies you," what would you say? You would say, "Yes, He has justified us." But God has not asked the Lord Jesus to be the Justifier; He has asked the Lord Jesus to be our righteousness. Is this good? This is excellent. He is not the Justifier, but our righteousness. He is our righteousness.</p><h2 class="head4">Christ Being Our Sanctification</h2><p>Paul did not say that the Lord Jesus has become "the One that sanctifies." Rather, he said that Christ is sanctification. The Lord Jesus is not sanctifying us; He Himself is becoming our sanctification. God has made the Lord Jesus our sanctification. Our sanctification is Christ. Our sanctification is not a thing; it is not an act or a behavior. Our sanctification is a person&mdash;Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">Christ Being Our Redemption</h2><p>Again Paul did not say that the Lord is our Redeemer. He said that the Lord is our redemption. Is this not strange? First Corinthians 1:30 does not say that God has appointed the Lord Jesus to be a Redeemer. Rather, it says that the Lord Jesus is redemption.</p><p>Thank the Lord that our Redeemer is Christ, and our redemption is also Christ. The One who sanctifies is Christ, and our sanctification is also Christ. The One who justifies is Christ, and our righteousness is also Christ. The One who gives wisdom is Christ, and that wisdom is also Christ!</p><h2 class="head2">What David Knew</h2><h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Salvation</h2><p>If I stand here and say to you, "The Lord Jesus is our Savior," you will respond, "That is right. The Lord Jesus is our Savior." But Psalm 27:1 tells us that the Lord is our salvation. It shows us that the Lord is our salvation and not our Savior. It is a fact that the Lord is our Savior. But God showed David that the Lord is our salvation. The Lord is our Savior, but He is also our salvation; He is that very thing. The Lord Jesus is the things of God. He is God's matters and God's things. The Lord Jesus Himself is the very thing that God has given us.</p><p>I have no intention of remaining too long on the exposition of the Bible. I am merely laying a foundation. If you spend some time to consider God's Word, you will see that Christ is God's things. God has not only given Him to be our Savior and our Redeemer. He has not only given Him to be the Lord of sanctification and the Lord of righteousness. He has given us Christ to be our things. Righteousness is a thing, sanctification is a thing, and justification is a thing, or a matter. But Christ is these matters or things.</p><h2 class="head2">There Being Only One Person<br />in the Christianity of Life</h2><p>You may ask, "Brother, why do you have to spend so much time on all this?" I must tell you that this is the very difference between a Christianity of life and a Christianity of behavior. There is a vast difference between these two kinds of ways. The gap between these two ways is very great. One is spiritual, and the other is not. One is of God, and the other is of man's mind. These are two entirely different things. If you study God's Word, you will find that there is only one person in His Word; there are not many things. There is only the person; there are not matters and things. There is only one person&mdash;the Lord Jesus. Other than this person, one cannot find any other matter or thing.</p><p>The biggest problem with God's children today is that the Christianity they know is a fragmented Christianity. One person receives a little grace. Another person receives a little gift. A third person picks up tongue-speaking, while a fourth person experiences some changes in his behavior. Some have love, some have endurance, and some have humility. You may consider this as Christianity. Indeed, this is the Christianity that man speaks of today. But actually, this is not Christianity. Christianity is just Christ. Christianity is not a gift; it is not Christ giving you something. Christianity is just Christ Himself. Can you tell the difference between the two? These are absolutely two different ways; they are two entirely different ways. Christianity is not Christ giving you something. Christianity is Christ giving Himself to you. The problem is that in today's Christianity, man thinks only in terms of Christ's gifts. When he was a sinner, Christ gave him grace and mercy. Now that he has become a Christian, Christ gives him endurance and Christ gives him humility and meekness. It seems as if Christ is giving him many things.</p><h2 class="head2">There Being No Non-personified<br />Things in Christianity</h2><p>In God's eyes, what is important is not the gifts of Christ. In God's eyes, He has given us Christ Himself. God has not given us humility or endurance; He has given us the whole Christ. Christ is becoming our humility, and Christ is becoming our endurance and meekness. It is Christ, the living Lord. This is Christianity.</p><p>Please remember that there are no non-personified things in Christianity. We must never receive a merely non-personified thing. In Christianity all things are personified, and that person is Christ. In other words, our endurance is not a thing; our endurance is a person. Our sanctification is not an experience; our sanctification is a person, something personified. Our justification is not an experience; our justification is a person. Our righteousness is not an act; our righteousness is a person. Our redemption and deliverance are not something that we receive at one time; our redemption and deliverance are a person. Our endurance, humility, meekness, love, etc., are the Lord Himself; they are not things. This is Christianity. Christ is everything to the saints today. There is no need to wait for that day to come.</p><p>Many people ask how we can say that Christ is all. If you know the Christianity of life, you will acknowledge that He is all. He does not give all; rather, He is all. These are two entirely different things.</p><p>Why is it that God's children fail so much today? They fail because they have only received a gift before the Lord; they have not received Christ. They have received fragmentary things before the Lord; they have not received the Christ God has given them. They have received only matters and things; they have not received a person. I do not know how much you have seen before the Lord. But I can say that when this question is resolved, all questions are resolved.</p><p>When we were saved, many of us heard God's Word, which says that He so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, so that we will not perish but will have eternal life. When we heard such a word, we felt that we needed to be saved, and we went to God and prayed, "Lord, You have loved me and given Yourself to me. Can You give salvation to me also? You have become my Savior. Can You give me salvation also?" How foolish we were! We felt that having a Savior was not enough and that we needed salvation also! Many people have done this. And what do we do in our gospel preaching? We say that God has given us the Savior, yet when we repent, we pray, "God, grant me Your salvation." However, God has only one Son, and this Son is salvation. When we have the Savior, we have salvation. Do we still have to ask for salvation? Only a foolish man would say, "God, You have given me a Savior. Now please give me salvation."</p><h2 class="head2">"I Am..."</h2><p>Today we are Christians, and we are saved; God has given Christ to us to be our life. But we constantly ask for one thing after another; we ask for one, two, three, ten, fifty, one hundred, ten thousand, one million, and ten million things. We think that these individual things are important. But God shows us that Christ is our everything.</p><p>This is why God's Word shows us that Christ's name is "I Am." Perhaps I should not be speaking so much of this matter outside the Bible; we should consider more of what the Bible says about this.</p><h2 class="head3">Food</h2><p>In the Gospel of John, the Lord said that He is the bread of life. We often ask God for food; we think that there is something called food. We are hungry, and we ask God, saying, "Please give us food." But it is so strange that those who ask for food never receive food. Those who ask for food are always hungry. Those who beg for food are the ones who are always hungry. I cannot say that I have been serving the Lord for many years. But I can at least say that I have been serving Him for some years. During these years, I have never met a person who asked for food and received it. You may say, "Does this mean that God's Word is wrong? Does not Luke 1:53 say that He will fill the hungry with good things?" I say, yes, it is true that the hungry ones will be filled with good things. But with what are the hungry ones filled? We have to realize that what fills us is not food, but Christ. We often feel hungry, and we have a need. We feel empty and believe that God has food. So we pray and hope to receive food. But we do not know how we can get the food. All we know is that we should contact the Lord, believe more, receive more, and enjoy more. But the amazing thing is that when we believe more, receive more, and look to Him more, we do not get the food that we hoped for, yet we are filled. We do not receive the food that we expected to receive. But through our looking to the Lord, and through contacting and receiving Him, we are filled. God's food is Christ. His food is not just food. God has no matters; His food is just Christ. The Chinese have an idiomatic expression "Chien-pien-yi-lu," which means "one thousand pages of the same thing." It is not a good thing to be all the same. But before the Lord, all the things of God are "one thousand pages of the same thing." No matter what we are seeking before the Lord, what He gives us is the same&mdash;Christ; He is "one thousand pages of the same thing." He is the One who meets our need; things do not meet our need.</p><h2 class="head3">Righteousness and Sanctification</h2><p>Many times, I can praise and rejoice for one reason only: my righteousness is not my conduct; my righteousness is a person, who is the Lord Jesus. Because the Lord Jesus has become my righteousness, every time I mention my righteousness, I can say that not only do I have righteousness or justification, but I can speak to my Righteousness, praise my Righteousness, and give glory to my Righteousness. Is this not a wonderful word? You may wonder how one can give glory to his righteousness. Yes, I often give glory to my Righteousness, because my Righteousness is the Lord Jesus. My sanctification is not my work. When I praise my Sanctification, I am not praising my work. No, I hate my work. Yet I can say that I praise my Sanctification, because my sanctification is my Lord. These are two entirely different things. Can you see this? These are not things but the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Tearing Down and His Building Up</h2><p>We can find one fact in our spiritual experience. Some people have been Christians for one, two, three, five, or even twenty or thirty years. The strange thing is that when they first became Christians, they were very patient. But the more they went on as Christians, the more they could not control their temper, and the worse they became. I remember many people telling me that at the beginning, they were very patient. They could forgive, they could pray, and they could suffer any treatment from others. Others could treat them any way they wanted in school, at home, and at work. But now they could not tolerate the same things anymore. In the past they could do everything; now they cannot do these things anymore. Sometimes they managed to hold back their temper, but something within them wanted revenge. We have seen too many examples of this kind. I can tell you one thousand, even ten thousand, stories like this one. Many people can testify that once they were humble, but they cannot be humble anymore. Once they were patient, but they cannot be patient anymore. Once they were loving, but they cannot be loving anymore. Once they were meek, but they have become stubborn. Once they were zealous, but they have become cold. They cannot explain this.</p><p>Brothers, we have to remember that God must take away everything that we have. When we first believed in the Lord, we felt that we lacked love, and we asked God for love. To put it in simple language, God gave us a "dose" of love, or a "packet" of love, so that we could love. It was a thing to us. We may have received plenty of these things. But God cannot allow love to remain forever as a thing in us; He has to put Christ into us. Therefore, He removes that love. Many people had a bad temper before they believed in the Lord; their temper was quick. After they picked up patience, patience became a thing, a gift, a salvation, or a spare part to them. As long as they had such a thing, they could work. During the first, second, and third year, these things may have served well. However, by the fifth year, or even as early as the third year, the situation began to change; the things themselves were gone. Today God is doing the same work in many of His children; He is removing all the things. Not only will He remove the worldly things; He will remove the spiritual things as well. Before you were saved, the matters and things of the world took the place of Christ. After you were saved, spiritual matters and things took the place of Christ. One day God will show you that "Christ is all the world to you." Once God took away the things and matters of the world from you. Now He is taking away spiritual things and matters from you. He will take away your patience, your love, your power, your meekness, your humility, and everything that you have. He will show you that you do not live by patience but by a person. You will be patient because you have received a person, not because you have received a power. You will be humble, not because you have received a power, but because you have received a person. All the spiritual things have to go away. All the "its" have to go away.</p><p>For this reason, God's tearing down work, as well as His building work, goes on daily in many of His children. Daily "things" are torn down, and Christ is built up. This is the way God deals with His children. In the past, God might have given you a thing; He might have given you a power for endurance. You were so sure of this experience that you could almost write down the words: "My problem with endurance is over." Next you had to deal with humility, and God gave you another thing; He gave you the strength to humble yourself, and you were able to say that the problem of humility was also settled. When another thing is not settled, you pray daily before the Lord to try to solve it. You are always busy solving this and that problem. You are always trying to deal with this and that question. You are always dealing with individual problems. Brothers, God will take away many "things" from you; He will only give you One; He will only give you a person. This One will be your humility, your endurance, your meekness, and your love. He is the One who is. When you have Him, you can truly say, "God, You are the I am." This is Christianity. God is continually tearing down and building up. He will continue this work until one day we can say that Christ is everything. One day the universe will confess that Christ is everything. But first God wants us to confess within ourselves that Christ is everything.</p><p>Forgive me for speaking something about myself. I care much for many people and bear much of the responsibility for their spiritual condition. When I met a brother who was wrong, I often tried to exhort him. But I could only say, "Brother, you are lacking in love. Next time, you have to love your brother." He may have succeeded in loving, and I may have felt great that I saw some result to my work. But actually, what he acquired was love and not Christ. Love to that brother was not a person but a thing, a behavior. This is a Christianity of behavior. It is human conduct; it is man who is working, seeking, hoping, praying, believing, receiving, gaining, and acquiring something called love. This is why I say that love is only a thing and a behavior to him. But if that love is Christ, it is a totally different story. Christ alone is everything; it is not him. Christ is loving; it is not him who is loving. This makes love a law of life instead of an act of the will. This is a different kind of Christianity.</p><p>I do not know whether you have seen the difference. What do you feel when you render some help to a brother and open his eyes and help him to go on with the Lord? The most difficult thing we face today is that many people are merely involved in the things of Christianity; they do not know Christ and have not realized that God's thing is just Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Second Stage of Knowing</h2><p>What does it mean to know Christ? I may say that knowing Christ is to know Him through matters and things. What does it mean to know Christ through matters and things? It means knowing that Christ is our matters and Christ is our things. Some people can say that they know Christ as their patience, Christ as their love, or Christ as their humility; this is knowing Christ. Once a person has this knowledge, he will have a thorough change. Once he has this change, he will say that his world does not consist of any thing anymore. I believe that some among us can say this, and some among us know what this means. In my world, my spiritual world, there are not many things. In my spiritual world, there is only Christ. I do not have any holiness; I only have Christ. But this does not mean that I am not holy; it means that Christ has become my holiness. If you have this experience, you will immediately see that Christ is the One who is. This is the focus of everything&mdash;Christ is the One who is. If you have this experience, you will be delivered from all the outward things. The only question now is whether or not you know Christ. It is not a question of prayer, exhortation, or encouragement.</p><p>I wish to see my co-workers paying more attention to this matter. It is not a matter of exhortation or encouragement. If you try to encourage someone, at the most you will stir him up to do something by himself. But the only thing that counts is God opening man's eyes to know Christ. Even if I could repeat the things I have said a hundred times, it would still be useless. If God opens our eyes to see that Christ is the one thing we lack, everything is solved. Many people know Christ as the Lord of justification, but they still fear God and do not know that Christ is their righteousness. Many people know Christ as the Sanctifier, but they are still not sanctified. This is because they think that they lack sanctification. They think that the Lord is the One who sanctifies them, and they ask Him to give them the strength to become sanctified; they want to be sanctified. But while they are doing this, they find that they cannot make it. They cannot do it; they cannot be sanctified. Then God opens their eyes and gives them the light to see that Christ is their sanctification. God is not asking them to be sanctified; He is not giving them the strength to be sanctified. Rather, Christ becomes their sanctification. Christ in them has become their sanctification. When this happens, all problems will go away because He will be the "I am." I can afford to lose my power, but I cannot afford to lose Christ. My sanctification is not something I do in myself. My sanctification is something He has done in me. Once I know what Christ is to me, all the problems are solved. Christ is the One who is. I have nothing else to say. I have only one thing to tell you: Christ is the One who is.</p><p>The problem is that although many of us know that Christ is our Lord, we do not know that Christ is our matters and things. All those who know Him only as the Redeemer, Justifier, Sanctifier, or any other "-er," only know His work; they do not know what He is. But God wants us to know Him as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p><p>Let me ask a question: Is the Lord Jesus you know your Savior or your salvation? Is the Lord you know your Redeemer or your redemption? Is He your Liberator or your liberation? Is He your Sanctifier or your sanctification? Is He your Justifier or your righteousness? Those who know Him as the "-er," only know Him in a superficial way. Those who know Him as matters and things enter the second stage of their knowing of Him, and their knowing of Him is higher and deeper.</p><p>The problem among God's children is that there are too many things. When we know the Lord as the One who is, our things will become a person, and everything will be settled. Then God's purpose, which He intends to fulfill in eternity, will be fulfilled in us.</p><p>Whenever our holiness, redemption, regeneration, power, grace, and gift only remain as things, we are barely touching the periphery of Christianity. When we no longer see these things as things, but as the Lord Himself, we will begin to know God. Then we will begin to enter the goal of God's eternal purpose. From that point on, we will no longer see the many things of this world. We will see the Lord alone. He will become the One upon whom all the issues hinge.</p><p>This is why I said at the beginning that many people have things that are dead. Only when they understand what we are speaking of here will their things become personified. It is Him. Our regeneration is not a thing, but a person. We have a personified One, not a thing. Everything that I have is personified, because everything that I have is the Lord. First, the Lord leads us to know Him. Then He leads us to know that He is our things. When we are led to know Him as all things, we will be delivered from our own life, and we will be delivered even from the spiritual world and spiritual things. From that day on, we will truly say that the Lord is all and in all. We will truly say that He is everything in our living. If I am patient today, I am not the one who is patient, but Christ is my patience within me. When I love today, I am not the one who is trying to love. The power of love is not within me; rather, a person loves within me. If I can forgive today, it is not because I am forbearing, it is not because I have made any effort of my own, and it is not because I am capable. If I can forgive today, it is because there is One within me who is always forgiving. He is my forgiveness. We are humble not because we have told ourselves that we are too proud and that we have to be humble. We do not become humble by suppressing our pride or by making up our mind to be humble. Rather, a person is living out humility within us; He is our humility. This is why we can be humble. This is the law of life which we have been speaking of during the past few months. The law of life is nothing other than Christ becoming our things and Christ becoming our life.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, may the Lord open our eyes. We pray that He would truly open our eyes so that we would see. All things will eventually pass away, and only He will remain. Therefore, here in this place, we should only have Him alone.</p><p>Watchman Nee</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST ONLY&mdash;NOT MATTERS OR THINGS</h2><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 8:28; Col. 3:3-4; 1:16-20</h1><h2 class="head2">Man's Thoughts and Demands</h2><p>The first gift we received from God was the Son of God, who is Christ. But different people have different degrees of knowledge of God. Among God's children, some know the Lord Jesus as one of the many gifts of God, while others know Him as God's unique gift. Many people confess that the Lord Jesus is God's gift, which means that they recognize Him as God's unique gift. But many other people accept the Lord Jesus only as their first gift. Apart from the Lord Jesus, they still see many other gifts. There is the first gift, but there are also the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the tenth, the thousandth, and even the ten thousandth gift.</p><p>When many people believe in the Lord, they accept Him and they are saved. But after they are saved, they find that in spite of their salvation, they still have many shortcomings and needs.</p><p>Some people find that they have a quick temper. Although they are saved, they still have their temper. Some people find that they are very proud. Although they are saved, their pride still follows them. Many people find that they are weak and timid. Although they are saved, they are still timid.</p><p>Hence, among God's children, we very often find that after many believe in the Lord Jesus and are saved, they hope, ask, believe, and pray before the Lord, and subsequently receive many gifts. They regard the Lord Jesus as one of the many gifts. They consider the Lord Jesus as one from among many gifts of God; that is, He is only the first among many gifts.</p><p>It is very interesting that at the beginning of our pursuit of the Lord we see many needs in ourselves. We think that since we are Christians, we should not do this and that. We are very sure that we are genuine Christians, yet we still have many shortcomings. It does not matter what the shortcomings are; as long as there are shortcomings, we consider them as wrong, and we try all we can to deal with these shortcomings. For this reason, we pray before God, we hope, we believe, and we strive, and eventually we receive something. When this happens, it seems as though we have overcome our shortcomings, and we rejoice in our heart that we have acquired a gift.</p><p>In this circumstance, many of God's children begin to think that the purpose of God's gifts and grace is just to fill up our lack. When some people hear this, they may ask, "If God's grace is not here to fill up our lack, what is it for?" Many people think that God's grace is for filling up our lack. This is like a Bible that has two thousand pages. If it is short one page, we try to make up the missing page. This is what we do when we try to use God's grace to fill up our lack. In other words, we think that we are lacking just a part; we think that we are lacking only a little and that as long as we can fill up that little part, we will be perfect. Some have said that they lack five things, and as soon as they have the five things, they will be satisfied. Some have said that they lack ten things, and as long as they have the ten things, they will be satisfied. Some may say that they have love and that they only need a little more humility, a little more patience, or a few other things. As soon as they have these few things, they say that everything will be fine. Man's thought is merely one of lack and shortage. What does he do? He prays to God and asks God to give him what he lacks.</p><p>But the problem is that many of us think that what we lack before the Lord and what we ask for are merely things. Our lack and our prayers are all centered around the matters and the things; they are all individual, countable objects. We say that we lack this or that, and if God will fill up our lack, everything will be all right.</p><p>We lack patience. But what kind of patience are we looking for? Most of the time our eyes do not look to heaven. If our eyes did look to heaven, we would be looking upward. But most of the time, we cannot look upward; we can only watch and look at what is around us. We sigh and say that certain people are good but that we are not like them. What they have is patience, and what we have is a temper. What they have is meekness, but what we have is pride. We wish that we could be as patient and meek as they. Once I prayed to the Lord&mdash;it might have been my first prayer&mdash;that God would give me a Bible like the one I saw in a certain brother's hand. We can only pray for things that we see. We can only pray after we have seen something, and we can only pray for what others already have. We cannot pray for something from heaven which we have never seen. As a consequence, when we pray, we ask for patience like that of a certain person, or we ask for humility like that of another person. In our mind, we already have a picture of what humility is and what patience is.</p><p>If, when we were first saved, God had told us that He was going to pluck patience from a certain person and give it to us, would we not have been overjoyed? If we could have patience and humility on top of what we already had, we would have been satisfied and thought that we were perfect.</p><p>Patience is a thing to us; it is a thing that others possess. There is a certain thing called patience among the brothers and sisters, and we want it. We often hate ourselves, and we blame our parents for begetting us and giving us such a bad temper. We wish that we could be like certain persons, because they have something which we do not have. Many of God's children are after patience as a thing. They want something that will stop them from losing their temper. They think they need something called patience. With many people, patience is a thing. God has this thing, and it is found in many places on earth, but they do not have it. They think they need this thing, patience, so that they can become a patient person.</p><p>Here lies the basic difference between genuine Christianity and wrong Christianity. Many of God's children are looking for things which they think can be found everywhere except in themselves. They think that it is found in Mr. Chang, in Mr. Yu, in Mr. Hsu, or in this or that person, but not in them. They are pursuing after a thing that can be found on earth. This is Christianity in the mind of many. They are craving for and pursuing after things, and they have acquired things. Many people only acquire a thing; yet their heart rejoices and they thank the Lord because they have acquired it.</p><h2 class="head2">There Being Only Christ in the Spiritual World</h2><p>Many Christians have not seen that there are not many things in the spiritual world; there is only Christ. There is no patience in the spiritual world; there is only Christ. There is no humility, sanctification, or light in the spiritual world; there is only Christ. There are not many things in the spiritual world; only Christ exists.</p><p>The Lord has to do a fundamental work in us. This is what we need before the Lord. If you would not misunderstand me, I will say that we need a second salvation. In our first salvation, we saw that our need was Christ and not works. We saw that salvation was through Christ and not through work. Now we need another strong and thorough vision: we do not need things; we need Christ. We need to have an experience as thorough and strong as our first salvation, and we need to have as many things torn down as when we were first saved. When many people were first saved, many things were torn down, and they gained Christ. In the same way, many things need to be torn down in them today. The difference is that what was torn down the first time were sinful things, while the things that need to be torn down now are spiritual things. The first time their pride, jealousy, vainglory, temper, and other sins were torn down. Now their patience, humility, and so-called holiness need to be torn down. These things must be torn down before they will see that Christ is their life and that He is the One who is. This inward Christianity is absolutely different from the Christianity that man commonly believes in.</p><p>If you would not be offended, I would say an honest word to you. In the past, many brothers and sisters have come to talk with me and have asked me many questions. I could only say to them, "You may think that you are better than many people, but I am afraid that you will be the same as you are tonight for the rest of your life. You have many things. You have a great deal of patience and humility. You are a very capable and nice person. You are loving, helpful, and forgiving. You are willing to do this and that. Humanly speaking, it is hard to find a Christian like you. But I must speak an honest word: you only have things. You have to realize that what is truly spiritual before the Lord is not things but the Lord Jesus Christ. What you are, what you can do, or what you have does not matter; only Christ matters. The only thing that has any spiritual value is what Christ has accomplished in you." In the spiritual world, there are not many things; there is only Christ. Christ is the matters and things of God.</p><h2 class="head2">Touching Christ Being Touching Life</h2><p>Perhaps I can cover some practical experiences. Please excuse me for mentioning some of my personal experiences. During the past few days, a brother encountered an accident at home. Because of my responsibility, I should naturally have gone to visit him. By visiting him, I would be able to help him by expressing my personal concerns and also save myself a considerable amount of work later&mdash;we should either want to be a loving Christian or not want to be a Christian at all. But the strange thing is that when I resolved to visit the brother, I became colder and colder within while I was on the road. Nothing seemed to respond within me. I immediately knew that I was trying to perform an act of love. I was trying to perform an act of brotherly love, but as I was doing it, I touched death. It was the right thing to do. It was a good thing, but it was not Christ. I was doing it myself. After I did this, the result was an inward death. I touched death within, and I became cold. I touched an act; I did not touch life. This was an act of love, but I did not find the Lord in the act. I could only say that I was the one who loved. Everytime we touch Christ instead of a work, we touch life. But everytime we touch a work, we will surely die. Anytime we try to do something by ourselves, we will surely die.</p><p>We have to see that Christianity is just Christ. The Christian life is just Christ. We should not pile a thousand good things together and call them the Christian life. Even if we put all the patience on earth, all the humility, and the myriads of good things together, we still could not make a Christian. If we put the myriads of things together, all we would see is a list of things. We would not see Christ.</p><p>A few years ago my co-workers were always teasing me about "face-saving." I not only tried to save my own face but others' faces as well. I do not like to expose others, and I do not like others to feel bad when they leave my house. I do not like to embarrass others by what I say. Before others feel any embarrassment, I become embarrassed for them already. I like being a gentle person, but when I try to be a good and gentle person before my brothers, something within often tells me that I am dead. I immediately become dead. There is no more life in me, and I touch death. The only reason for this is that gentleness is a thing; it is something that I have worked up. It is not Christ. This is why I immediately fall into death. I touch a corpse. I become weakened and powerless. Something within collapses and tells me that everything is lost.</p><p>The problem is that, in God's eyes, whenever we are involved with a thing, we find nothing but death in it. Once we just have a thing, we immediately touch death because what we have is not Christ. But if we touch Christ, we will immediately touch life because Christ is life.</p><h2 class="head2">Only the Tree of Life Being Living</h2><p>We often become convicted in our work. Those who serve the Lord want to serve Him more. It is a good and right thing to serve the Lord. Our service to the Lord often demands that we suffer, sacrifice ourselves, and expend our energy and our money. But the strange thing is that when we do these things, we often do not touch life. Instead, we touch death, we become weakened, and we feel that something is wrong inside. Something within us tells us that we are wrong. Why are we wrong? While we are serving the Lord, while we are working and planning to do this and that for the Lord, we become weakened, and something within strongly rebukes us. Many times, the rebuke we suffer through sin is not as severe as the rebuke we suffer through doing many good things.</p><p>Many people think that the Lord within only rebukes them when they sin. But no! The Lord often rebukes us while we are doing good. The proper principle in God's eyes is not the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but the principle of the tree of life. Being able to differentiate between good and evil is not enough. Everything hinges on life. All those who eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will surely die the day they eat it; only the tree of life is living.</p><h2 class="head2">Two Kinds of Christian Life</h2><p>Among God's children, there are two kinds of Christian life. One kind is filled with things, and the other kind is just Christ. Outwardly, both kinds look equally good. One cannot detect much of a difference between the two. One talks about humility; the other also talks about humility. One talks about meekness, and the other also talks about meekness. One talks about love, and the other also talks about love. One talks about forgiveness, and the other also talks about forgiveness. Outwardly, both are more or less the same. They appear to be the same. But with one, we just have a list of things, while with the other, we have Christ. In reality, the two are entirely different.</p><h2 class="head2">With Christ, There Being the Need of the Cross</h2><p>I would like to point out that when we have things, we do not need the cross anymore. With Christ, there is the need of the cross. The cross restricts us not only from sin, but from our own activity as well. The cross not only tells us that we should not sin, but forbids us from our own activities. The problem with God's children is that they think everything is fine as long as they do something well. They have not seen that the good things are only things. God cares for Christ. Christ is the very good thing. He is the life. If He does not move, we cannot move. It is easy for us to say many comforting words to others. But if He has not said them, we should not, because once we do, we will touch death; we will be inwardly weakened and deflated, and we will collapse. We can help others in many ways. We can be very gentle, and others may consider us nice men. But when we act this way, something within us collapses, and we become weakened. Here we see the need of the cross. The many things we gain through good works do not require the cross. In order for us to allow the Lord to live in us to be our everything and become our things, we need the cross. When He does not move, we cannot move. We have to ask the Lord to deliver us from good and righteous acts as much as we ask Him to deliver us from sins. It is easy for us to ask God to deliver us from sins, because we have condemned sins already. But it is not easy to be delivered from the natural life, because many of us have not condemned the natural life in us. We have not seen the natural life, and we have not rejected it.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Healing</h2><p>What does it mean for Christ to be our matters and things? What is the significance of having Christ as our matters and things? I think we can draw a good analogy from our physical body. Many people are very weak physically. They ask God to heal them. We find three kinds of results or three kinds of faith in this asking. Some people believe that God is their Healer. Others believe that God will give them health and heal them. But a third group believes that God is their healing.</p><p>How does a person pray when he has an illness? What does he seek after? He expects God to be his Healer. God is living, and he wants God to be his Healer, to touch him with His power, to be his Physician and demonstrate His healing power and healing ability. If this is the case, his God is as far from him as his doctor is from him. I wonder if you have heard what I said. This is a crucial word. Many people want God to be their Healer, but the distance between God and such people is as great as the distance between them and their earthly doctors.</p><p>Other people are a little bit better. They want God to heal them and give them health. Then one day God heals them, and they recover. Many people pray, make supplications, and expect healings. But why are they continually weak? There are still many weak ones among us today. Many people expect God to be their Healer or to heal them. But having God as the Healer and being healed are outward experiences; they are merely things.</p><p>What is the result of these experiences? Many times God is willing to heal us. I am not saying that God will not heal us. God can deal with little children this way. But many times, He will not deal with us this way. When we first believed in the Lord, God might have been willing to be our Healer, and He might have been willing to heal us. But after we have believed in Him for a while, He will put us in His hands, and He will educate us and teach us. Then God will no longer be our healer and will no longer heal us. God reserves the best for those whom He considers the best; He becomes healing to them. He does not give them healing, but becomes healing to them. He does not become the healing God to them; He becomes the living God who is healing to them. God is our healing. I do not know how to put this in any better way. I can only say this most reverently before the Lord, that Christ is our healing.</p><p>The trouble is that many people only see healing as a thing. They think that this is something apart from Christ and that everything is over after He has performed the healing. You may remember the story of the woman who touched Christ and how He felt the power go out from Him. The Bible says that He perceived that power had gone out from Him (Luke 8:46). I take the liberty to make this word more plain by saying that Christ Himself went out. He was not performing a healing. Rather, He was the healing. When He became the healing, men were healed.</p><p>We often may be weak and may still have physical ailments. But we can lift up our head and say to the Lord, "Lord, I do not expect You to be my Healer, only to go away after my sickness is gone. I do not expect You to heal me, and then find You gone even though the healing remains. Lord, I expect You to be my healing. It is true that You are my Healer, but I want You to be the Healer in me. It is true that You are my healing, but I want my healing to be something personified. My healing should be a person; it should be something personified. It is a person who becomes my health." God becomes my health. Christ becomes my health. Is there a difference between being healed and knowing Christ as my healing? The difference is great! When I learned this lesson, I found that I not only possessed something called healing, but I possessed a person who has become life to my body. Once I saw this, all problems were solved, and I saw that my body has much to do with the Lord. When I have a problem with the Lord, my body immediately has a problem with Him. If He wants to put us through His test or do anything else to us, there is nothing that we can do to resist Him. Everything that we have depends on the Lord. We can only look to Him; we can do nothing. This is absolutely different from making healing a thing.</p><p>I thank the Lord for healing me many times. I can say that I was sick on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year, and God healed me on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year. I can tell you many stories about how I was healed at a certain hour of a certain day in a certain month and a certain year. I can count many cases of healing. But those healings were small healings. They were isolated things, and they can be counted. Whether there is one case, two cases, ten cases, or twenty cases, they can be counted. But I can also tell you another story, that at a certain hour of a certain day in a certain month and certain year, God opened my eyes to see that Christ is my healing. This is something that cannot be repeated; it is something that cannot be quantified. Once is enough. It is not a thing that can be counted. It is a person, a personified healing. My healing is a person who is in me as my healing all the time. Praise the Lord that this is a fact. Having God heal me and having Him as my healing are two entirely different things. One is a thing; the other is a person.</p><p>Paul was not healed, but he received the healing. Can we see the difference between these two? Paul shows in 2 Corinthians 12 that he was not healed (v. 9). He did not receive the thing which we call healing. But with Paul, we see One who was his healing continually. His weakness remained with him, but his healing also remained with him. His weakness was chronic, but his healing was abiding. What is a healing? To us, a healing is the removal of something. No, healing is not a removal; healing is acquiring something. Healing is not the removal of weakness but the presence of strength.</p><p>When I first saw this matter, the light came very slowly because my mind was filled with things; everything around me was a thing. I did not realize that the Lord wanted to be my thing, and I did not know that healing was not a thing. I only knew that the Lord promised me something; I did not know that the Lord wanted to be my healing. I only knew about the Lord's promise; I did not know about the Lord as my healing. One day I read Paul's story in 2 Corinthians. It was very strange to me. It would have been an easy thing for the Lord to grant him the healing. Removing the thorn was as easy for the Lord as a doctor removing germs. But why did the Lord not heal Paul? I prayed about this, and while I was praying, the Lord showed me one thing. In 1923 Brother Weigh invited me to preach at a certain place. In order to get there, I had to take a little boat along the Min River. The boats often became stuck to the riverbed because the water was too shallow and the rocks were big. The boat owner often had to tug the boat along. While I was praying, this scene suddenly appeared in my mind. I said, "God, it would be easy for You to remove the rocks. Would it not be wonderful if You removed the rocks, and the boat floated on the water instead?" I read 2 Corinthians 12 and realized that this was exactly how Paul prayed. The water was too shallow, and the rocks were exposed conspicuously; Paul prayed that God would remove the rocks so that he could sail on the water once again. But God answered by saying that He would not remove the rocks. Instead, He caused the water level to rise. When the water rises, the boat can pass over the rocks. This is what God is doing. Our problem and our prayer reveal that we are only for a thing&mdash;healing. But His answer is for Him to be our healing. When He is present, we can glide over our problems. Paul's weakness was still there; he did not use his own strength to fight it. If he fought with his own strength, he could only say that his own strength had tabernacled over him. But it was the power of Christ which tabernacled over him (v. 9). It was God who was working. There is a basic difference here. One is God giving me a thing, and the other is God Himself becoming my thing. God in me becomes the thing that I need. God Himself is that very thing.</p><h2 class="head2">"Things" Cannot Go on Forever</h2><p>The same is true with spiritual things. What do many people desire and seek after? They are after a "thing." Many sisters have come to me and said that they want patience. I often felt that the word "patience" was too small to them. They wished they could be patient. They thought it would be wonderful if God gave them a dosage of patience and they took it and became patient. They sought patience. This is a dosage to them, and it will last for three to five days. But there is an expiration date on it. After a while, the word "patience" becomes smaller and smaller, until one day the word runs out. If it is a thing, there is always a day when it will run out. Even if it is something one receives through prayer, it will still run out. Sometimes to answer His children's immediate need and to accommodate their foolishness, God answers their prayers. But God does not answer such prayers all the time. He will not go on this way forever.</p><p>In God's world, there are not many "things." Christ is all and in all. God only has Christ. He cannot allow patience, humility, or love to continue to exist as things by themselves on this earth forever. What does He want in the end? In the end He wants to show us that Christ is patience, Christ is humility, and Christ is love. He gives Christ, not "things." One day when our relationship with the Lord becomes proper, the matter of patience will be settled. It is a matter of Christ, not a matter of patience. Once our relationship with Christ is normalized to the degree that God expects it to be, the matter of patience will be settled, the matter of pride will be settled, and ten thousand other matters will also be settled. The issue is Christ; the issue is not "things."</p><h2 class="head2">The Knowing of Christ</h2><p>Hence, in God's eyes everything depends on how we know Christ. What does it mean to know Christ? Some people know Christ as their love. Others know Christ as their humility. Some know Christ more, while others know Him less. Whatever "thing" you know Christ to be, that "thing" becomes your proper knowledge of Christ. This is the meaning of knowing Christ. The "knowledge of Christ" is not an abstract term; it is not something objective. Our knowing of Christ is positive and substantial. We know Christ by knowing Him as the various "things"; we know that He is this to us or that He is that to us.</p><p>Some of you can stand up and testify, "I did not know what it was to be clean, because everything with me, from my heart to my head and thoughts, was all unclean. But thank the Lord that Christ has become my cleanliness. God has made Him cleanliness to me." You can see immediately that this "thing" is not something that you have; this "thing" is Christ. When Christ lives in you, He brings this "thing" along with Him. It is something that He brings along with Him; it is not something that you have in yourself. This is genuine Christianity.</p><p>I must say bluntly that unless a child of God has his eyes opened to see that Christ is his things, he is not of much use, because all that he has is behavior. He is always the one who is doing the works. Even if he prays and God gives something to him, he only has temporary things that have no spiritual value in God's eyes at all.</p><p>To some people, grace from God comes in the form of separate individual things. To others, who also have the experience of grace, their grace comes in the form of a person, who is the Son of God. One day you will say to God, "I thank You and praise You because the grace I have received is Christ. My grace is a person; it is something personified." When you can tell the difference between these two things, you can tell the difference between life and death. Many brothers can only differentiate between right and wrong; they cannot differentiate between life and death. They can only differentiate between what is good and what is bad. There is only one simple explanation for this: they do not see that everything is in Christ. He, the person, is the matter. He, the person, is the thing. In the spiritual realm, there is only Christ; there are not many matters or things.</p><p>If God opens your eyes one day, you will see that this and that are things as soon as you touch them. This is very strange, yet it is very real. A man may be full of many things. He may be patient, meek, humble, faithful, loving, warm, forgiving, and merciful; he may be filled with many things. But what you see is only a big pile of things. You can at least tell the difference between a man's ring and his finger. You can at least tell the difference between a man's hat and his head, his glasses and his eyes, or his clothes and his body. If you can tell the difference between these things, you should be able to tell the difference between a thing and Christ. If you have never seen this, you will be surprised by what I am saying. But if you have seen this, you will see that this is a simple matter. Everything that is a thing is dead in itself, and outwardly it produces nothing but death. It is dead in itself, and when you perform this thing, if you have any spiritual sense at all, you will feel dead as well. While you are doing it outwardly, you sense that the result is death and not life.</p><p>The only thing you can say about certain persons is that they are very good, that they are nice men. You can only see good and evil in them; you cannot see anything spiritual in them. You can only say that some brothers are good, that they are nice men, that they have a good temper, that they are patient, and that they can suffer and deny themselves. That is all you can say. If patience, suffering, self-denial, humility, and love are only things, you may love them, but the minute you touch them, you are deadened within, and something collapses within you. There is a reaction against these things. Life has a strong reacting power. Sometimes a person says a very nice word, yet it is something that should not have been said, and there is immediately a very violent reaction within you against it. Take the prayer meeting as an example. What does it mean for you to say amen? It means that you are touched by life. When a brother prays, and the prayer touches your life, spontaneously you respond with an amen from within. Other prayers may be very earnest; the words may be very nice and the tone very loud, yet the more the prayer goes on, the colder you feel within. You wish that the prayer would stop because the prayer is exactly like the person who prays. There may be a thing, but it brings nothing but death. Just as a thing is dead in you, it is also dead in others. Things have no spiritual value at all, because man is doing all the work.</p><p>If what we have said is true, there is nothing more we can do before the Lord. We can only look to Him; we cannot do anything or perform any work. Brothers and sisters, we should realize more and more that works are abominable in the eyes of God. If we are truly led by the Lord to go on in this way, we will surely find out one thing: God hates sin, and He also hates behavior. When man sins, God says he will perish. When man behaves, God says he cannot be saved. God rejects behavior as much as He rejects sins. God only accepts one thing: His Son Jesus Christ. Only what Christ has done in us counts. Thank God that it is Him and not us. It is not we who are humble, but He. It is not we who love, but He. He does not give us the power; He is our power.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, I do not know what to say. I hope that the newly saved ones would pay special attention to this matter. As soon as you are delivered from the spiritual things, you will touch the Lord. The sooner you are delivered, the better it will be. The more you procrastinate, the more you will not see. Those who have many things piled upon them cannot see easily. God will have to do a great deal of work in chastising you and putting you down before He can take many things away from you and before you will take Christ. Nevertheless, as you advance somewhat in your Christian life, God will take things away day by day so that He can give you Christ.</p><p>I hope that this day will come. One day all the things in heaven and on earth will be headed up in Christ. One day God's Word will be fulfilled, and Christ will be all. Those who do not know that Christ is all today can never expect that Christ will be all. Today Christ is all my things already. He is already all things to me. God has given us His Son already. He has given us Himself. This is what He has given us. Today Christ has to be all in us. There must be no difference between Christ and things. Nothing can be considered a spiritual thing in itself. Only Christ is all. All things are Christ. Christ is all and in all. This has to start in the church; it has to start with us today. We can declare that He is all because we know and acknowledge that He is all. We can also declare that He is in all. He is in our patience, He is in our meekness, and He is in our love because He is in all. One day (and we hope that that day will quickly come) God's Son will be all and will head up all things because He is all and in all! In that day we will know that what we learned today is for that day. May the Lord bless all of us!</p><h2 class="head2">Prayer</h2><p>O Lord, we pray for grace before You. Lord, we confess that our eyes are blind; we do not see clearly enough. We know about things, but we do not know Christ. Our Lord seems so far away from us. The things seem so real to us, while Christ does not seem real to us. Lord, we pray that You would open our eyes so that Christ would become real to us, so that the things will pass away and life will fill us. Lord, we pray for deliverance from the many things, so that we can know the Lord as a person. May the Lord who is our person become our things so that everything in us becomes living and full of life, and so that others would see Christ when they see the things. Lord, we know that these two ways are entirely different. How different is the sinner's way from the way of the righteous. In the same manner, how different is the way of a genuine Christian from that of a false Christian. Many things need to be broken. You have to break us. Do not allow us to deceive ourselves, to think that we have seen it when we have not seen it, to think that we have touched the right way when we really have not touched it, to think that we are full of life when we are full of behavior, and to think that we are full of Christ when we are full of things. Lord, touch us. Lord, build up Yourself in us in a powerful way so that everything within and without us is just Christ, just Yourself.</p><p>Lord, bless these words so that they would bear fruit and would bring men back to Yourself in a rich way. May You utter what man cannot utter. May You cover man's weakness and forgive man's foolishness. May You gain something among us. We need to be laid bare. May tonight be the night when many are laid bare, when they see themselves as You see them. May a little light enter us, and may it shine through all falsehood and all performance so that we would see the replacements and everything that is not You. Bless Your own word, and glorify Your name. In the name of the Lord Jesus, amen.</p><p>Watchman Nee</p><h2 class="head1">THE FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />AND THE COUNTERFEIT OF EVIL SPIRITS</h2><p>"Abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure" (Phil. 1:9-10, Darby).</p><h2 class="head2">The Baptism or Filling of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>God's Spirit enters into man's spirit so that man's spirit might be released and freed from the soul (Heb. 4:12). The human spirit becomes a submissive organ or the channel from which the Holy Spirit flows forth. When we testify for Christ or pray to attack the authority of darkness, the Spirit is manifested.</p><p>This is the true baptism into the Body of Christ and the oneness of the members of the Body. The particular result of such baptism is the power to testify for Christ and to cause people to know their sins and turn to God.</p><p>The highest expression of the filling of the Holy Spirit is the ability to use all the functions of the soul while simultaneously controlling oneself.</p><p>We only receive the Holy Spirit once, but by renewing our faith or recognizing the truth, we can experience the filling several times. Sometimes it is in growth, at other times it is in a new turn. Since conditions among the believers are different, the same filling of the Holy Spirit can be in different degrees of fullness. After being filled, we receive power for the work, and it is truly our experience.</p><h2 class="head2">The Counterfeit of Satan</h2><p>If a believer is loose in his mind to the point of being "blank" or if he allows his body to come under the sway of supernatural forces, the counterfeit work of evil spirits may accompany the genuine filling of the Holy Spirit. A "blank mind" and "passive body" contradict the requirements necessary for the work of the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, they are the principal requirements necessary for the work of evil spirits. The Holy Spirit fills man's spirit by the law of faith, while the supernatural power of the evil spirits enter man by the law of an empty mind and a passive body. Just like when the Holy Spirit enters the human spirit, the evil spirits can produce all kinds of manifestations to human senses.</p><p>The result of the counterfeit differs according to the condition of the person receiving it. The outward expression is always great, but there is no real fruit. The degree to which the evil spirits possess a person's mind and body differs as well. Some people like to cause divisions and are not willing to be one because of being possessed by evil spirits.
