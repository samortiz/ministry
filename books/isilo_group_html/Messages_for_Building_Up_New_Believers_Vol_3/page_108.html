Not Keeping the Oneness in the Sects</h2>
<p>Heresy is a sect and is considered by God to be a work of the flesh. Therefore, we cannot keep the oneness of the sects. We must keep Christian oneness but not the oneness of the sects. We break our Christian oneness when we maintain the oneness of the sects.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Sects Bringing Swift Destruction upon Men</h2>
<p>Second Peter 2:1 says, &ldquo;But there arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies [sects], even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.&rdquo; Sects bring in destruction. They are brought in by the false teachers. We who are of God must learn to uphold Christian oneness before God. We should not maintain any oneness that is smaller than Christian oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. ONENESS NOT BEING AN ECUMENICAL WORK</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. General Awareness among God&rsquo;s Children<br />
of the Need of Oneness</h2>
<p>After a man realizes that sects lead to destruction and that they are condemned by God, he begins to see the need for oneness among Christians. Many people feel that sectarianism and division are wrong, that they should fellowship with all of God&rsquo;s children, and that this fellowship should be as broad as the Body.</p>
<p>I think this awareness has become quite common in China during the past ten years. Last year someone wrote to me, saying, &ldquo;Although we cannot agree with your teachings against sectarianism, we feel that it is true and right for Christians to be one.&rdquo; This was written by a leader in Christianity. Today many leaders in Christianity feel that they should pay attention to Christian oneness rather than oneness of the sects.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Ecumenism&mdash;<br />
A Oneness That Is a Halfway House</h2>
<p>I realize that many people have been emphasizing oneness during the past years. But what they have produced is a kind of ecumenical movement. This is not a return to the oneness of the Body. This oneness is man made. It is nothing more than an ecumenical or interdenominational work. This ecumenism accomplishes little more than to de-emphasize denominational distinctions. Personally, I feel that this kind of oneness is just a halfway house; neither side will make it all the way home.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Need for Christians to Be Absolute</h2>
<p>Let me say a frank word: If sectarianism is right, we should uphold it. If it is wrong, we should destroy it. What do men do today? They say that there is nothing wrong with the sects, yet they oppose them. Or they agree that sectarianism is wrong, yet they try to keep it. On the one hand, they are reluctant to give up sectarianism. On the other hand, they oppose it. They want to keep both sides happy, and they want to maintain fellowship with both groups. This is not a Christian attitude. If the Lord&rsquo;s desire is for His children to have the fellowship of the Body, we should cast aside all other fellowship and only have the fellowship of the Body. I say to them: If you feel that sects are necessary, then you should do your best to uphold them. You may be wrong in conduct, but at least your intention will be right. Christians must not vacillate in their stand. A Christian must be absolute and faithful in whatever he does. If sectarianism is right, we should maintain it at any cost. If it is wrong, we should oppose it at any cost.</p>
<p>The worst thing to have is a halfway house. On the one hand, they admit that sectarianism is wrong. On the other hand, they are reluctant to give it up, and they try hard to improve it. They admit that denominationalism is wrong, but they try to organize ecumenical affiliations. They are not clear what position they are taking. This is not the Christian way of doing things. A Christian must not change his mind all the time. If something is right, there should be a proper way to handle it. If something is wrong, there should be a proper way to handle it as well. Any compromise or reconciliation is wrong. A Christian should be one who does things in an absolute way. If sectarianism is right, it should be justified. If it is wrong, it should be condemned. There cannot be any compromise or reconciliation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_107.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_109.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages for Building Up New Believers, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 108</div><br></body></html>
