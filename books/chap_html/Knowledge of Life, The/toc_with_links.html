<h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Although we know that God&rsquo;s desire and intention is to gain a corporate man, having His image, manifesting His glory, and possessing His authority to deal with His enemy that He Himself may gain eternal rest, yet very few know that this great desire and intention of God can only be attained through His own life. Even fewer have touched this matter of knowing and experiencing this life which accomplishes the purpose of God. Therefore, the saints today are rather weak and immature. Although there are many seeking ones, yet very few have found the way of life. Many people have even mistaken zeal, knowledge, power, and gifts, etc., for life.</p>
<p>We thank God that in these last days of urgent need God has made manifest through our brother&rsquo;s messages the line of His wonderful and hidden life, and thus made it possible for every believer to see and touch this matter. These messages may be considered a crystallization of the cream of the saints&rsquo; knowledge and experience of life in the past two thousand years, plus our brother&rsquo;s thirty years of personal experience; they are indeed complete and superb. The contents of these messages are divided into two main parts. The first part discusses the knowledge of life and is divided into fourteen main points which show the characteristics of life and its various principles of working. The second part<sup>*</sup> [The second part has already been published by the Living Stream Ministry entitled <em>The Experience of Life</em>.] discusses the experiences of life and is divided into nineteen items which explain the experiences in the various stages of the spiritual life and the way of pursuing life. If we pursue and practice these lessons one by one, we will be enabled to rise in a straight line and rapidly attain to the stage of the maturity of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, these messages have made practical the almost invisible and untouchable science of life. All those saints who live the Lord and pursue after the growth of life need to read these messages.</p>
