   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWENTY-ONE 3 Scripture Reading: John 21:1-25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the concluding message in the series of messages on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these messages we have considered the signs in the twenty-one chapters of this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the two foregoing messages on chapter twenty-one, we pointed out that this chapter is actually an aggregate sign, for everything in it is part of a composite sign.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that in this chapter the Lord reminded Peter of his calling and Peter's denial and then restored him and charged him to feed His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have also seen that according to the Lord's word in 21:18-22, some believers will die to glorify God, and others will live until His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, we pointed out that chapters twenty and twenty-one cover a broad span, a span that begins with the discovery of the Lord's resurrection and ends with His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Between these two events are all the matters related to the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this concluding message let us consider some other important matters revealed in chapter twenty-one of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE LORD'S VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we study this chapter carefully, we shall see an apparent contradiction in the Lord's words recorded here.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, the Lord said to Peter, "Follow Me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the other hand, the Lord referred to His coming back vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I had been Peter, I might have said to the Lord, "Lord Jesus, why do You talk about Your coming?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Does this mean that You intend to leave us?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us suppose that Peter asked such a question and that the Lord Jesus gave the following answer: "Yes, I shall leave you for hundreds of years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then after those centuries have passed, I shall come back."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Lord had given such an answer and if I had been Peter, I would have said, "Lord, if You will be absent from us, why do You ask me to follow You?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How can I follow You if You leave us?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Apparently the Lord's words concerning following Him and concerning His coming are contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order for us to follow the Lord, it is necessary that He be present with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in order for Him to come back, it is necessary that He go away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can we reconcile these things?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord was present with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How, then, could He say, "Until I come"?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since He was present with them, He did not need to come.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the Lord meant that He would leave the disciples and later come back to them, how could He say, "Follow Me"?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How could the disciples follow Him if He was not present with them?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The answer to all these questions is the Lord's invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to His visible presence, He would leave and come back later.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But according to His invisible presence, He would be with them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, He would be with them; on the other hand, He would be away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, they could both follow Him and wait for His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus remained with the disciples for forty days Acts 1:3-4 in order to train them to realize, practice, and live by His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 23 the Lord indicates that some of His believers will follow Him to death for the glory of God and that some will live until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Lord's visible presence, He is away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the time of His coming back, the Lord's visible presence will be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the meantime, according to His invisible presence He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because the Lord was in Peter, Peter could follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that he could follow the Lord as the One who dwelt in him.</S>
