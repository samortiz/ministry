   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a particular point concerning Christ was conceived in a God-seeking person as a prophet, the Spirit of Christ brought forth the speaking of it through the prophet as the instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the way of the prophecy concerning Christ by the prophets in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Luke 24:44 the Lord said, "All the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled."</S>
