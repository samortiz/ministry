<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 15</h1><h2 class="head4">The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 323, Shanghai, March 1939</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Watchman Nee</h2><p>My work during the last year has been centered around Honor Oak (where Mr. Austin-Sparks is). Although there are many other works, to me the most important work is at Honor Oak. The situation in Europe is the same as that in China. Many works and many of the workers are good, but not as the result of revelation. Rather, they are based on tradition. As in China, the knowledge of the flesh and the denial of the natural life are subjects that are almost unheard of. Honor Oak is indeed the center of testimony in Europe and America today. The testimony, the revelation, and the knowledge of the self and the natural man are here. The light concerning the Body life is rarely seen by others. Of course, Honor Oak, like any other place, needs help before it can be perfect. But so many have volunteered to come and help in Honor Oak that the brothers at Honor Oak cannot but be careful. During the past year, they have indeed treated me as being much more than a common guest. They are both open and on guard at the same time. I have gradually shared with them what I have received from the Lord through His grace, what has been kept hidden by the environment. You know that I never presume to be a teacher of others. I know of many areas that God can help Honor Oak in, yet how do I know that I am not wrong? How easy it is for man to be governed by his own deceptive dreams and to be obsessed with his own importance! Therefore, I am waiting and waiting patiently. My heart is really earnest for coming home, yet I know that there is work that I have to do. During the February conference, God led us&mdash;especially Mr. Austin-Sparks and me&mdash;to see many similar things. Our two testimonies are completely one now...</p><p>Brother Watchman, February 17</p><p></p><p>(We received a telegram today (March 9) from Brother Nee saying that he is on his way home. He will arrive in Shanghai, at the earliest, by the end of this month and, at the latest, by the beginning of April. Many places have asked about him. We will answer them all here and not answer each place separately&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee, Chefoo</h2><p>By the Lord's grace, I hope to mail out the manuscript for The Christian next week. This is the Chinese New Year, and we are having conference meetings. On the one hand, we are preaching the gospel, and on the other hand, we are edifying the believers. The conference will end tomorrow. The Lord willing, I will go with a few brothers and sisters to Chi-Hsia County and the surrounding villages to testify for the Lord. After returning to Chefoo, we will go to Tsingtao after the middle of March. Thank the Lord. Lately, the Lord has been doing a new work in Chefoo and Tsingtao. Sisters Soong and Wang, together with Brother Chao Chi-kwang, went to West Village in Peng-Lai to testify for the Lord before the Chinese New Year began.</p><p>Brother Witness Lee, February 27</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Brother Chao Bi-chen, Tsinan</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>As far as the condition here is concerned, the brothers and sisters who have a foundation in the Lord have left. Only four or five young brothers and sisters are still serving the Lord in a faithful way. They have asked me to stay in Tsinan for a period of time. On November 3 I went to Chefoo to attend the co-workers' meeting and told Brother Lee everything. He also felt in his spirit that I should stay in Tsinan for a while and render the saints some help before going elsewhere according to the Lord's leading. We see the Lord's blessing and presence in our work. Now the Lord has opened the door of the gospel. We have been invited to preach the gospel and to testify in the brothers' homes and in the homes of many Pentecostals, Methodists, those of the Assembly of God, and in the homes of many members of Chi-Loo University. May the Lord bless His own work so that the truth is released and so that God's children see the light and take the way of obedience! Please pray much for us. Lately, the work has been too heavy, and I have become too tired. On February 6 I vomited blood. It has now stopped; thank the almighty, gracious Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chao Bi-chen,<br />Tsinan, February 11</p>
