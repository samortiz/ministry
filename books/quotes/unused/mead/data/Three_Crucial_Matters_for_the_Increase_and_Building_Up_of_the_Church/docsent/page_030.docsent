   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EVERYONE FUNCTIONING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In principle, whenever the new ones ask a question, we must give them a clear explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition, from the time that they are baptized, we should take the new ones door-knocking with us so that they can learn how to sing the hymns, read the Bible, and lead the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should lead and teach them from the beginning of their Christian life, just like parents teach their children to speak and to write when they are small.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, we should teach the new ones Life Lessons and also lead them into the practice of what they are reading.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we will do this, after a year and a half, the new ones will be able to do everything that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They will learn how to go door-knocking and how to care for other new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our church life is knocking on doors to preach the gospel, leading people to be baptized, having home meetings to nourish the new ones, and perfecting them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once a week we break bread together in the meeting halls, and every three or four weeks we have a big meeting of the church for blending.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the way we practiced the church life in the past, the saints were not perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We preached the gospel, but not many people were saved; we cared for people, but not many people remained; and we visited people, but there was no result.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have known one another for many years; hence, there was nothing for us to do but go to the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, in the new way the needs in the church are great.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At present there are at least six thousand people in Taipei who need to be cared for by the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, everyone must offer themselves and exercise their function.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders should also make arrangements for the elderly saints who cannot go door-knocking or go to home meetings but can pray and fellowship in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Almost everyone in the world knows about Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People know that believers worship God every Lord s Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, some of the people who come to our Lord s Day morning meetings were not contacted by door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They came to our meeting halls of their own accord because they wanted to attend a Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the sake of taking care of these believers, the meeting halls should have a Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there is not a meeting on Lord s Day morning, they will think that the church has left, and we will owe them an apology.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, we need the meetings in the halls to care for these believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the new way, we create opportunities for those who love the Lord to be able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, all the saints are employed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past the saints were unemployed, but now there is a great need for the saints to give themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need everyone to function.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE NEW WAY BEING A NOBLE SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the period of time when the brothers and sisters went door-knocking and led home meetings, many people in the communities expressed their thankfulness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The new ones who were visited four or five times say continually that they admire our perseverance in visiting them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually this touches them, and they are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They know that we do not want to cheat them; instead, we desire to bring the Lord Jesus to them and to give them the Bible, truth, and light so that they can receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we knock on their door the first time, they may not understand these things; hence, they might become angry and slam the door in our faces.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, after they believe in the Lord, they thank us for preaching the Lord Jesus to them and bringing salvation to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From this we can see that what we are doing in the new way is a noble service.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The evils in society that are reported in the newspapers show the need for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we knock on doors, we are bringing the gospel, life, and godliness to society.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It will be a tremendous blessing for us to gospelize Taiwan.</S>
