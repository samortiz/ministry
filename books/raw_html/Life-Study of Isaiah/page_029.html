<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SALVATION OF JEHOVAH<br>TO HIS BELOVED PEOPLE AND THE NATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE VISION OF CHRIST IN GLORY<br>AND<br>HIS WARNING COMMISSION TO ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 6:1-13; Matt. 13:14-15; John 12:40-41; Matt. 23:37-38; 24:2; Acts 28:25-27</H1><P>Chapters six through eight plus chapters nine and eleven are a cluster of chapters in Isaiah's prophecy which unveil Christ to the uttermost. In this message we will consider the unveiling of Christ in chapter six.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE VISION OF CHRIST IN GLORY</H2><P>In 6:1-7 we have a vision of Christ in glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In Spite of the Rebellion, Iniquities, and Corruptions of Israel, Christ Still Sitting<br>on a High and Lofty Throne in Glory</H2><P>In spite of the rebellion, iniquities, and corruptions of Israel, His chosen and beloved people, Christ is still sitting on a high and lofty throne in glory (vv. 1-4). These verses indicate that no matter what the situation might be on earth and regardless of the corruption and degradation among God's people, Christ is still on the throne in His glory.</P><P>When Isaiah looked at the situation among the children of Israel, he became very disappointed. For this reason, in the first five chapters of his prophecy, he had very little to say that was good about the children of Israel. It was at this point that the Lord brought him into a vision so that he could see the Lord of glory sitting on the throne (v. 1). The Lord seemed to say to Isaiah, "Don't look down at the situation. If you look down, you will be disappointed. Look up at Me. I am still here. There may be nothing good there, but everything is good here. I am the unique good thing in the universe. Look at Me."</P><P>At the beginning of your church life, you might have experienced a church "honeymoon." But after a period of time, what was so sweet to you might have become bitter like vinegar. Then instead of a honeymoon you have a "vinegarmoon." In your disappointment with the church life, you may think that it would be better if you moved to another locality. However, I can assure you that you cannot find a church that experiences a continual honeymoon. In every church there is some vinegar. Therefore, in the church life, we need to learn not to look down at the situation but to look up to Christ. We should not look at anything or anyone other than Christ. The Christ whom we look up to is no longer on the cross; today Christ is on the throne.</P>
