<h2 class="head2">F. The Sixth Church&mdash;Philadelphia</h2><p>Next comes the sixth church; it has the name Philadelphia. Phila means "love" and delphia means "the brothers." Phila- delphia means "brotherly love."</p><h2 class="head3">1. Returning to Brotherly Love</h2><p>Among the seven churches, this is the only one which does not receive any rebuke from the Lord. The Roman Catholic Church was rebuked, and so were the Protestant churches. Only Philadelphia is not rebuked. One only finds praise in Philadelphia.</p><p>What are the characteristics of Philadelphia? Revelation 3:8 says, "I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name." This is the characteristic of Philadelphia. The characteristic of Thyatira is the teaching of a woman. The characteristic of Sardis is a union between the church and the world and a constant need for separation; it is a continuous struggle between life and death. But the characteristic of Philadelphia is brotherly love. Here is a return to brotherly love. There is no worldliness here because all are brothers. There is no need to struggle to separate oneself from death. It is a return to the original state of brotherhood. Here we find brotherly love.</p><p>Just as Sardis comes out of Thyatira, Philadelphia comes out of Sardis. The Protestants came out of the Roman Catholic Church, and Philadelphia came out of the Protestants. This was clearly a new move of the Holy Spirit. This new move attracted people from the dead Sardis and put them on the ground of brotherly love. In other words, they stood on the Body ground. They did not recognize any other relationship except the relationship of brothers. They did not recognize any other fellowship except the fellowship of love. This is Philadelphia.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Keeping the Lord's Word</h2><p>Philadelphia had two characteristics: They kept the Lord's word, and they did not deny the Lord's name. Here was a group of people who were led by God to keep His word. God opened up the Word to them, and others were able to understand His Word through them. They had no creed, doctrine, or tradition, only the Word of God. At the time of Philadelphia, we find a group of people returning fully to the Word of the Lord, who did not recognize any other authority, doctrine, or creed.</p><p>A man can understand and even preach a doctrine, but this does not mean that he understands the Bible. He can memorize creeds and proclaim his faith in them, but this does not mean that he understands the Bible. The Lord would have given us creeds long ago if the church needed them. Today men analyze the Bible and condense its teachings into creeds. Creeds are limited, but the Bible is unlimited. Creeds are simple, while the Bible is complicated. A foolish man can understand creeds if he studies them. But a foolish man cannot understand the Bible. Only a certain type of people can understand the Bible. Only under certain conditions can a man understand God's Word. Creeds open a wide door and anyone can go in. But the door to God's Word is not that wide, and only those with life can enter it. The door of the creeds is so wide that a smart mind is all one needs to enter it. But God's Word is not that simple. Unless a man has life and is single before the Lord, he will not see or understand His Word.</p><p>Many people think that God's Word is too narrow. They want to broaden it so that they can bring more people into it. But those in Philadelphia rejected all creeds and doctrines. They turned back to the Word of the Lord. The Lord said, "You...have kept My word." In church history, there was never an age when men understood God's Word more than those in Philadelphia. In Philadelphia God's Word was given its rightful place. In other ages men accepted creeds and traditions. But Philadelphia accepted nothing other than God's Word. It returned to His Word and walked in it. In church history there was never a time when the ministry of the Word was as rich as that which we find in Philadelphia.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Not Denying the Lord's Name</h2><p>The Lord said, "You...have not denied My name" (v. 8). This is another characteristic of Philadelphia. In the long history of the church throughout the ages, the name of the Lord Jesus has always been last in importance. Men pay attention to names of saints, such as Peter and other apostles. They pay attention to names they like or to names of doctrines and nations. Many say proudly, "I am a Lutheran," or "I am a Wesleyan." Oh, the names of men! Many claim proudly, "I am a Coptic" (of a place), or "I am an Anglican" (meaning British). These are names of countries. These names have divided God's children into divisions! It is as if the name of Christ were not enough to separate us from the world.</p><p>If someone asks you, "Who are you?" and you answer, "I am a Christian," he will not be satisfied. He will ask again, "What kind of Christian are you?" I remember once when I was in another country, a man asked me, "What are you really?" I said, "I am a Christian." He said, "This is meaningless!"</p>
