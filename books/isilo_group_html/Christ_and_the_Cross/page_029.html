<h1 class="title">THE PLACE OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:7-9; 1 Pet. 1:20; Rev. 21:22-23; Heb. 9:14; Luke 24:25-27, 44-46; 1 Cor. 2:2; 1:23, 18; Gal. 5:11</h1>
<p>This book is divided into two sections. The first ten chapters of this book are the first section and are concerning Christ. With this chapter we will begin the second section concerning the cross of Christ. According to the revelation of the Bible, the cross of Christ refers to the death of Christ. This is a very significant matter that occupies a special place in the Bible. In order to know the significance of the cross, we will consider various aspects of the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING PLANNED BY GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:7 says, &ldquo;In whom we have redemption through His blood...according to the riches of His grace.&rdquo; Speaking of God&rsquo;s beloved Son, this verse says that we have redemption through His blood according to the riches of His grace. By His abounding grace God made known to us &ldquo;the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). On the cross and through His blood Christ accomplished the redemption that was planned according to God&rsquo;s good pleasure. The cross was planned by God according to the good pleasure of His will. Knowing the cross enables us to know the mystery of God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Other than Christ Himself, nothing in God&rsquo;s plan has a higher place than the cross. Christ and the cross are at the center of God&rsquo;s plan. Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s purpose, and the cross is the center of God&rsquo;s procedure. Christ is the purpose of God&rsquo;s plan, and the cross is the procedure of God&rsquo;s plan. Everything in God&rsquo;s plan takes Christ as its purpose and is carried out for Christ, and everything in God&rsquo;s plan takes the cross as its procedure and is carried out through the cross. Hence, Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s purpose in His plan, and the cross is the center of the procedure in God&rsquo;s plan. God has determined to do everything in His plan in Christ, and God has determined to do everything in His plan through the cross. Without Christ, God&rsquo;s plan has no purpose, and without the cross, God&rsquo;s plan has no procedure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING ETERNAL</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is eternal. Because the cross is part of God&rsquo;s plan, the cross is not only a matter in time; it has an eternal element. Many people think of the cross, which is God&rsquo;s solution for man&rsquo;s salvation, as a historical event in time. They think that the Lord Jesus came to establish a way of salvation after man sinned and deserved to perish. Although such a thought does not seem wrong, it is far from the revelation of the Bible because it makes the cross an afterthought in the carrying out of God&rsquo;s plan in relation to the problem of the fall. However, the Bible reveals that the cross was planned and determined by God in eternity (1 Pet. 1:20). Before man sinned and fell, or rather, before man was created, before the universe was created, and before time came into being, that is, in eternity without beginning, God planned the redemption of the cross according to His good pleasure and His foreknowledge. The cross is part of God&rsquo;s eternal plan, not an afterthought. The cross was planned by God in eternity but fulfilled in time. For this reason, the Bible says that Christ, who accomplished redemption on the cross, was prepared by God before the foundation of the world. Long before the foundation of the world, before anything had come into being, God in His eternal plan determined that Christ would carry out the way of salvation on the cross. The cross was determined before the foundation of the world in eternity past.</p>
<p>The cross comes out of eternity past, and it will continue to exist in eternity future. Christ is in heaven as the Lamb who was slain (Rev. 5:6), and in eternity future He will still be the Lamb who was slain (13:8). Christ being called the Lamb indicates that He was slain, and being slain is a matter of the cross. Therefore, Christ as the Lamb should remind us of His cross. In eternity future Christ will still be the Lamb, and He will still be called the Lamb. This indicates that in eternity future the efficacy of His cross will continue, and we will continue to remember the cross.</p>
<p>In eternity future the relationship between God and His redeemed ones will be based on Christ&rsquo;s status as the Lamb. Thus, in eternity future the efficacy of His cross will remain between God and those who have been redeemed. The efficacy of His cross will not only be remembered by us but also enjoyed by us. In eternity future God will be with us as the light of life and everything in the Lamb who was slain (21:22-23). We will enjoy the fullness of God and express the glory of God in the Lamb who was slain. His death on the cross is eternally efficacious in us and between God and us. As a result, we will have an eternal relationship with God. Through the eternal Spirit, Christ offered Himself on the cross without blemish to God (Heb. 9:14). Hence, the accomplishments of His cross are eternal, not temporary. The efficacy of the cross is eternal; it is not limited to time.</p>
<p>The cross is eternal and belongs to eternity. The cross was planned in eternity past and will remain in eternity future. The place of the cross in eternity speaks of the significance of the cross. We must not diminish the significance of the cross by considering the cross to be something transient, something related merely to time.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 29</div><br></body></html>
