   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE BEGETTING, NOURISHING, AND PERFECTING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 4:15; John 15:16; Eph 3:8-11; John 21:15-17; Acts 5:42; 1 Thes 2:7; Eph 4:12; 1 Thes 2:11 THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter and the next chapter, we want to see four crucial matters for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is not a congregation or an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Testament tells us emphatically that the church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A person s body is not an organization but an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A wooden stand is a lifeless organization of pieces of wood that have been put together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ s Body, however, is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A newborn child is not brought into being by organization but is begotten, conceived, and formed organically in his mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His birth is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church also was born of God, in Christ, through Christ, and with Christ to be the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the church is altogether organic.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament there is a type concerning the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the type of Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God created a man, but He did not create a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God took a rib out of Adam, and with that rib, He built a woman Gen 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This woman became Adam s counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Adam s counterpart came out of him and was given back to him to be attached to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eve was the second part of this complete human being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A man is a unit but not a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The wife is the counterpart of the man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The husband and wife make a complete melon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The husband is one half, and the wife is the other half.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they come together, they match each other to make a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why the Bible says that it was not good for Adam to be alone Gen 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For a man to remain alone is for him to be just half.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He needs another half.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To get married is to gain a complement, a counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The relationship of Eve with Adam is a picture showing the relationship that the church has with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is not something organized, but something that comes out of Christ and grows into His counterpart with His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul received the revelation of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Body is organic, not lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christianity in its degradation has made the church a lifeless organization instead of an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In human society there are different kinds of organizations or clubs, but the church is not like that.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Apparently, the church is merely a kind of gathering, but actually the church is something born of God, with Christ, and through Christ to become Christ s Body, His organism to express His very being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man s body is his fullness for his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is the Head of His Body and the Body is the Head s fullness for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because our physical body is organic, we have to care for it in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a wooden stand has been damaged, I may fix it with glue or with nails and a hammer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when my finger is cut, I cannot care for it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I keep the cut on my finger clean and protected, it will be healed by the life in my body causing the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The cut on my finger is healed by the growth of my body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only something with life can grow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because we are organic, whatever we eat must also be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we eat organic food, it is digested and assimilated organically to become the very element in our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually it becomes the very cells and tissues of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is an illustration of what it means to be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be organic means to have life, and life moves, grows, begets, and develops.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church, composed of God s chosen and redeemed people, is not something organized by God but something begotten by God with His life to make this entity full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our organic, physical body will not assimilate inorganic things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We human beings have been built up by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What we eat must be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we take in organic food, it works together with our organic body to build up our body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a good illustration of how the church can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church cannot be built up by adding something inorganic to it or by organizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is altogether by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because the Body of Christ is an organism, its building up should be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Paul s Epistles there are four particular books dealing with the building up of the Body of Christ Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These four books show that the building up of the Body of Christ must be organic because the Body is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can make an addition to a physical building or house because it is inorganic, but we cannot make an addition to a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The tree increases by growing because it is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The church should not have inorganic things added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church needs to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Anything inorganic that is added to the church is false like a false denture that has been added to our own body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A person s teeth were not added to his body but born into his body to be a part of his body organically.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today we must realize that the church can only be built up in the way of life, the organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The inorganic, organizational way does not work, but whatever is organically begotten of the church or for the church really works.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today in the Lord s recovery there is the need of the increase, but we should not consider that the increase of the church comes by the way of addition.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The increase of the church is for the increase of the Body of Christ in the organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In order to have the increase of the Body of Christ accomplished, there are four crucial organic matters which we greatly need: begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning begetting, nourishing, and perfecting, and in the next chapter we will go on to talk about prophesying.</S>
