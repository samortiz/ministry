Messages fourteen through sixteen were given to the church in Anaheim on August 25, September 1, and September 8, 1996
In this introductory word, we first need to see that there are two views concerning Christ in the four Gospels
John among the four Gospels stands by itself, because all the other three Gospels are concerning Christ as a man
The Gospel of John is a record of Christ living as a physical person but having His being all the way mystical; hence, a mystical record
The entire universe, including the heavens, was contaminated by Satan, an archangel created by God, in his rebellion against God
It is significant that the entire world today uses one calendar, which counts the years from Christ's incarnation
Christ is also revealed in His becoming the Lamb to take away the sin of the world judicially for the New Testament
When He was put to death on the cross, God considered Him the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world
The fourth great event in the history of the universe, through which Christ as the Word speaks, is His becoming the Spirit
We can remember these five great historical events with five words: creation, incarnation, Lamb, Spirit, and ladder
In order to have a ladder, there is the need of a base, and the base for Christ to be the heavenly ladder is the house of God, Bethel
In all these five universal, historical events, Christ, the Word of God , defines, explains, and expresses the invisible God
In His creation 'the heavens are telling of the glory of God; and their expanse is declaring the work of His hands
What is referred to in Acts 14:15-17 and 17:24-29 serves the same purpose of revealing Christ's creation speaking for God
The intrinsic, central line of the five historical events in the introduction to the Gospel of John is like the trunk of a big tree
In Genesis 28 Jacob saw a ladder set up on earth and reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it
In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus told Nathanael that he would see the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man
As many as received this light, this shining, the trunk would give them life to be the authority to become the children of God
In this wonderful Word, through whom the creation was carried out and through whom incarnation was accomplished, is life
The life in the Word is the light that speaks to the world by shining forth, as His coming to the world, what God is
God has the only begotten Son as His speaking, the Word, to speak for Him and He also has the Spirit to bring forth the Word
In Luke 24:44 the Lord said, 'All the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled'
The Lord's word here indicates that the entire Old Testament is a revelation of Him and that He is its center and content
In the New Testament Christ as the Word of God was incarnated to be a man to express God, that is, to speak God
The Only Begotten became the firstborn Son of God and in the same delivery in resurrection we all were born regenerated to be sons of God
A big gospel campaign may attract many people, but eventually most of these people are not cared for and become lost
John 1:12 says that as many as receive Christ, God will give them the authority to become the children of God'
Although the one to whom you are speaking may be too busy to talk at that time, you can make an appointment with him for a later time
Corinthians 14:1 says, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy'
When it remains in them, it is again the word, but when it is spoken forth by them through the Spirit , it becomes spirit and life
In this way Christ being the Word of God implies Himself as the word in the form of a person the spoken word and the written word the Bible
We went to the foothills of Lebanon where there was a fountain and a spring gushing out a river, the river Jordan
We should say to people, 'Have you ever got to know that God is a fountain, Christ is a spring, and the Spirit is a river'?
Praise Him that He chose us and then called us to receive Him, the flowing God as the fountain, with Christ as the element in the flow
Within this psalm, we can see God as a fountain flowing like a river to satisfy us and fill us up with His pleasures
Blood signifies redemption judicially, and water signifies life flowing organically to be dispensed into God's elect
To the thirsty and waterseeking Samaritan woman the Lord said that He has the living water which is able to cause her to never thirst again
To those who held the Feast of Tabernacles, on the last day of their feast, He said, 'If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink
In John's last book, Revelation, the Lord said to all people, 'I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely'
The fountain is the source; the spring comes up and emerges from the fountain; then it gushes out to be the flowing river
We all know that this calling with a promise from the Lord is still sounding today to everyone who lives on this earth
Matthew 28:19 says clearly that we are to baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit
When we speak of the Triune God according to His economy, we are speaking of Him according to His moving and acting, not His essence
God the Father planned to do something; the Son accomplished the plan; and the Spirit applies to us what the Son has accomplished
The Father spoke in heaven concerning the Son, the Son stood in the water on the earth, and the Spirit soared as the dove in the air
Words like these in the Scripture are strong evidence that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are economically three
God's elect participate in what the Triune God has done and enjoy Their work with Themselves for their satisfaction
By God acting economically, we can participate in what He is and what He has worked out for our pleasure and satisfaction
Such deformed theology has forced us to put the truth in writing through publications such as Affirmation and Critique
The third process, His death by crucifixion, lasted six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning to three o'clock in the afternoon
For the first three hours He was persecuted by human rebels, and for the last three hours He was judged by God
The Father as love is the fountain, the Son as grace is the spring, and the Spirit as the fellowship is the flowing river
He became flesh, putting on human nature by partaking of human blood and human flesh to be a real man through human birth by a virgin
In the same way, the Triune God laid aside His divine form in incarnation to become in fashion as a man in order to court man
The marriage life with Christ for eternity in the new heaven and new earth will include all of God's chosen and redeemed people
In Revelation 19 the bride is revealed on the wedding day, and in Revelation 21 this bride becomes the wife of Christ for eternity
Because the One who passed through death was the embodiment of the Triune God , the Triune God was passing through the death on the cross
Colossians 1:20 reveals that all things created by God both in the heavens and on the earth needed to be reconciled to God
Through His death Christ created in Himself as the sphere, as the realm, and as the element the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man
Peter 3:18 tells us that when Christ was dying on the cross, He was crucified to death in His flesh, but not in His Spirit
By this resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God by the designation of His flesh through the Spirit of holiness
In this is a passing from our old state into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation
Romans 95 says Whose are the fathers and out of whom as regards what is according to flesh is the Christ who is God over all blessed forever
We must be clear that Christ is God over all, which means that He is above all the created things, and He is blessed forever
Christ is our God above all things and is worthy to be praised with well-speaking of adoration, respect, and desire
We can be vitalized by singing the following song with an exercised spirit: 'Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit
It was in the 'likeness of the flesh of sin' that God had the way to condemn sin, that is, to annihilate sin, to abolish sin
Christ became the flesh of sin only in its likeness, like the bronze serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness
Christ is the tabernacle of God , which refers to Jesus as a man in the flesh to be God's temporary dwelling place among men on the earth
It is for the building up of the house of God at Bethel that His redeemed people are transformed by the Spirit into stones organically
In Bethel, the house of God , Christ is the heavenly ladder that brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven as well
Christ as the Son of Man, in His humanity, is the ladder as the stairway, the way , by which we can ascend from the earth to reach God
The Messiah of God, the Christ of God, is the God-appointed and God-commissioned One to accomplish God's economy
All the believers have been transformed to be stones, so they are now the constituents for the building up of God's eternal dwelling place
In His redemption God made Christ the replacement for the sinners who are serpents in the eyes of God to suffer Gods judgment on the cross
In type the serpent which signifies Christ as the replacement of Gods people is a bronze serpent a serpent in likeness but not in reality
The bride, produced by regeneration and taken by Christ as the Bridegroom, is the increase, the enlargement, of Christ
Adam was a bachelor, a single man, but one day the Lord opened his side, took out a rib, and built that rib into Eve as a wife to match Adam
Gradually and steadily with the proper care, we as their parents should feed, nourish, and cherish them day by day through the vital groups
These points are of three sections, and these three sections are mostly according to our participating in the Divine Trinity
Christ is God for the purpose of dispensing Himself into us as the flowing God issuing in the spring of the living water
In John 4 He is the spring of living water to quench our thirst, to satisfy us, make us happy, and be our pleasure
He carries out God's commission by being the Lamb to redeem, the Spirit to dispense life and transform, the house, and the ladder
For eternity the Lord Jesus will be the universal steady and strong ladder bearing the burden of the heavens and the earth as the Son of Man
Verse 8 says that today we are keeping the reality of the Feast of Unleavened Bread as the continuation of the Passover
The entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life
At other times we have said that the Christian life is a suffering life, but we suffer so that we can feast more
Enemies indicates fighting and suffering, but the Lord makes our fighting a feasting and our suffering a table
In John 3 we saw that Christ as the Bridegroom, who is above all things , speaks the words of God to spread God
He also refers to us the Feast of Tabernacles, signifying the consummation of God's full salvation organically
Everyone had a tent, and God had a tabernacle among these tents, so the Feast of Tabernacles was a remembrance of God's story
Although the New Jerusalem will be solidly built with gold, pearls, and precious stones, it will be called a tabernacle
The reality of the Feast of Tabernacles is a time of enjoyment in remembrance of how we experienced God and of how God lived with us
Eventually, our Feast of Tabernacles will be the enjoyment of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth
The second section in chapters six and seven is on Christ as our enjoyment, signified by the Feast of Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles
It is used in the Gospel of John for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, the One who takes care of our case and our affairs
When they persisted in questioning Him the Lord said to them He who is without sin among you let him be the first to throw a stone at her
According to the law, such a sinner should be stoned; but Christ, who came full of grace and truth, would not condemn her
In our vital groups, we need leaders who know how to shepherd sinners who need the forgiveness of sins and the setting free from sins
After the Lord healed this man, the Pharisees said to him, 'Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner'
If we are not certain about the divine things, that means we are still blind and need our eyes opened by the Lord
Christ was the door in the Old Testament age for His people to enter into God's economy by being kept in the custody of the law
He was also the door for the Old Testament saints such as Abraham and even Moses to enter in through their expectation of the coming Messiah
If we feed upon Christ as our pasture in the morning, enjoying Him as the feast, we will eagerly go to the meeting in the evening
We should help him to enjoy Christ by calling on His name and by opening up His Word to digest one or two verses by pray-reading them
According to ethical logic, a person should learn how to be patient and endure to overcome his temper, but this does not work
If we have Christ, we possess the divine element, which is His divine constitution of all the attributes of what God is
In regeneration we have received this life, and in the growth of the divine life through sanctification, renewing, transformation, etc
The Comforter refers first to Christ coming in the flesh to be the first Comforter to take care of our cases and affairs
In the second stage Christ as the Spirit is our second Comforter both in us and in heaven before God the Father
In John 14 the Lord said that He would ask the Father to give us another Comforter, that is, the Spirit of reality
In the evening on the day of resurrection, Christ came to the disciples, who were in a room with the doors shut
His caring for us is of two aspects: the aspect of shepherding by the Shepherd and the aspect of comforting by the Comforter
The Shepherd supplies the necessities of the flock, but we need something more intrinsic, more organic, and more tender
We need an inward, organic comforting shepherding as in 1 Peter 2:25, which says that He is the Shepherd of our souls
Many Christians are not clear about this intrinsic, organic relationship between the processed Triune God and the transformed believers
Verse 23 says that the Son and the Father will come to His lover, who is indwelt by the Spirit, and make a mutual abode with him
The new man was created by Christ on the cross in Himself as the element and was born, brought forth, in resurrection to be a new babe
Finally, in eternity He will be the Son of Man as the heavenly ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven forever
After the Lord's long discourse in John 14 through 16, which was His last speaking on earth, He had a concluding prayer in chapter seventeen
For Him to die was not bad but glorious, because His death as the grain of wheat was unto glorification in His resurrection
Now that we have covered the Word, God, and the all-inclusive Christ, we need to go on to see the consummated Spirit
The Holy Spirit was first used as a divine title in the New Testament in relation to the incarnation to make man holy
The Spirit was not yet at the time of John 7:39 because He had not yet been consummated by the resurrection of Christ
These are not three Spirits, but one Spirit in three aspects referring to the same person the pneumatic Christ
The consummated Spirit is the indwelling Spirit who dispenses the resurrection life to the believers' mortal body
The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross
Philippians 1:19 reveals that we can be saved organically in our daily life by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God has been breathed into the believers in Christ
He was breathed into the believers as the Spirit of life, not the Spirit of power who was poured out in Acts 2 on the day of Pentecost
The consummated Spirit is the divine breath, breathed by the pneumatic Christ into the believers on the day of His resurrection
We are now receiving the breathing to be sent as sons of God and prophets to speak to our relatives, neighbors, and colleagues
In the Gospel of John, the all-inclusive Christ is unveiled in twenty items, from God to the consummated Spirit of life
The consummation and outcome of this salvation show us where the Lord's heart is and what the Lord desires to have
Christ as the merchant seeking pearls found one pearl of great value and sold all that He had by going to the cross to purchase it
When we experience the all-inclusive items of what Christ is, we become a part of His increase, which is His Body, the church
Christ works to gain His desire first by the judicial redemption accomplished by Him as the flesh in His incarnation
The intensified work of Christ's organic salvation is carried out by Him as the sevenfold intensified Spirit in His intensification
Incarnation, inclusion, and intensification are the three stages of Christ for Him to consummate His complete salvation
The preparation of the bride is by Christ's redemption, organic salvation, and the intensified work of His organic salvation
It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints
The New Jerusalem will be for Christ's eternal enjoyment in its ultimate consummation in the new heaven and new earth for eternity
We will be blessed to be invited to participate in Christ's wedding as His bride, and eventually we will all be a part of the wife of Christ
The Gospel of John, a full revelation of Christ as the Word of God defining and revealing God, is composed of two sections
John was very strong to unveil the glorification of the incarnated Jesus, that is, the glorification of Christ by God with His glory
In His being glorified, He as a grain of wheat passed through death unto resurrection, and that is glorification
When Christ was resurrected, He was glorified to produce us as His many grains to form and constitute His Body
The glory of God was the 'motor,' the motivating power, for Abraham to leave Chaldea and journey to the good land
The Son prayed that the Father would glorify His name, and the Father answered Him, 'I have both glorified it and will glorify it again'
He was pressed, constrained, in the shell of His humanity, and He longed to be put into death, which was a baptism to Him
For Him to be glorified is for Him to be released from the shell of His humanity through death and resurrection
The believers who suffer with Christ in this age will be glorified in the kingdom age, that is, will reign with Him as His co-kings
The first one is Matthew 28:19, where the Lord charged us to baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit
In His resurrection He became the second Comforter in the stage of Christ as the life-giving Spirit, the stage of His inclusion
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one and abide in us; therefore, we are 'four-in-one,' a divine and human constitution
The essence is the intrinsic part of the element, the element is the reality of the substance, and the substance has a source
We the believers are just the constituents containing the source, the element, and the essence to be a divine and human constitution
The Spirit indwells this abode with the Father and the Son for the mutual dwelling place of the Triune God and His transformed elect
The Father needs a house for His dwelling, the Son needs a vine for His spreading, and the Spirit needs a child for His moving
His members were regenerated by the Father in Christ's resurrection to be God's children, who are the constituents of the house of God
The oneness of the believers is by the Father's eternal life conveyed in the Father's name and in the Father's word
Our oneness is incorporated with the oneness of the economical Trinity for the church life constituting the Body of Christ
The Son gives the divine glory in the divine sonship to His believers, who are the many sons of God sharing the divine sonship with Him
Such a right to glorify God in the sonship has been given to all the disciples of Christ because they are God's sons and have His sonship
John 17 shows us two kinds of oneness which are incorporated together through the coinhering of the Triune God with the believers in Christ
The believers in Christ are many and the Triune God is three; among the three there is no division but only harmony and oneness
The new man came into being by being created by Christ on the cross and by being regenerated by the Father and born by the Spirit
John 16:21 unveils that the travailing and delivering woman is the believers and that the child delivered is also the believers
That the new man was created by Christ with Himself as the element on the cross should be considered the conceiving of the new man by Christ
Ephesians 2:15 reveals that Christ created in Himself, with Himself as the element, the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man
Christ did not have any brothers before His death, but after His resurrection early in the morning He told Mary, 'Go to My brothers'
The New Jerusalem is the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated into one with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified elect
Water signifies the death of Christ, into which we all have been baptized, and the Spirit signifies resurrection
To be born anew is to be born of water, signifying the death of Christ, and of the Spirit, signifying Christ's resurrection
The vegetable kingdom is a realm of the vegetable species, and the animal kingdom is a realm of the animal species
Also, to enter into the divine realm, the realm of the divine species, we need to be born of God to have the divine nature and life
That man was created in the image of God and after His likeness indicates that man was created in God's kind, in God's species
We have the reality of the divine life within us and we are being transformed and conformed to the Lord's image in our entire being
In His crucifixion, after He was pierced by a soldier, blood and water, two elements which are critical to human life, came out of Him
It is also considered God's own blood, which is very dear to God and with which God has purchased and obtained the church as His flock
God's purchasing the church with His own blood indicates the preciousness, the exceeding worth, of the church in the eyes of God
The river of water of life signifies the Spirit of life, and the tree of life signifies Christ as the embodiment of the divine life
These apostles were commissioned by the ascended Christ to cooperate with Him to carry out God's New Testament economy
Although it is correct to say this, it is more intrinsic to say that John 21 is the completion and consummation of the Gospel of John
The Lord saw the Israelites as sheep harassed by their leaders; they were cast away like sheep not having a shepherd
The Lord's shepherding is secondly in His heavenly ministry to take care of the church of God, issuing in His Body
Although Paul was on an urgent trip back to Jerusalem, while he was journeying he sent word for the elders in Ephesus to come to him
Brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant'
God raised up our Lord from the dead to be the great Shepherd to consummate the New Jerusalem according to God's eternal covenant
Christ's shepherding of His flock includes His caring for their outward things and also their inner being, their souls
Christ indwells us to be our life and everything, but He is also overseeing, observing, the condition and situation of our inner being
He shepherds us by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our soul, our real person
Peter's word indicates that the heavenly ministry of Christ is mainly to shepherd the church of God as His flock which issues in His Body
The Shepherd responds to the seeker by saying Go forth on the footsteps of the flockAnd pasture your young goats By the shepherds tents
The Lord is pasturing all His seekers as lilies, taking care of them, feeding them, and shepherding them that they may grow
The church life in Taiwan began with about three or four hundred believers, but after four years we had forty thousand
Most of the people were not saved directly by my ministry; they were saved by the proper shepherding, the proper care
The way that can save people effectively must be by small vital groups, and every one in this small vital group must be a shepherd
In 517 Paul said Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in word and teaching
Double honor refers to material supply for the support of the faithful elders, especially those who labor to teach others
We can speak of the five great historical events in John 1: creation, incarnation, the Lamb, the Spirit, and the ladder
At another time we can speak of our Lord as the Son of Man, who as the ladder brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven
The other sheep are the Gentile believers who would be joined together with the Jewish believers to be one flock
We must rise up to seek after the Lord so that we can be the overcomers to bring forth the building up of the Body of Christ
The Lord will have a way to consummate this age and to bring in His kingdom to celebrate His wedding day for His pleasure and satisfaction
In order to understand the Gospel of John we must see its intrinsic revelation, which is that John reveals the Triune God
No other book in the Bible reveals the Triune God so much and so clearly and intrinsically as John, especially in chapter fourteen
In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus said, 'You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man'
Jacob saw a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reached to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it
The love of the Father, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit are the reality of this ladder for going up and coming down
The number that represents the New Jerusalem is twelve, signifying that God in His eternal administration is mingled with His creature, man
Eventually, the Triune God becomes the living water, which the Lord Jesus presented to the Samaritan woman in John 4
Question:John 4:14b mentions the fountain and the springing up, but where is the river, signifying the Spirit?
The New Jerusalem is the issue of God's flowing in three stages: in the Father's stage, in the Son's stage, and in the Spirit's stage
We have to pray and look to the Lord very much that He would show us the intrinsic significance of John 1 through 16
God the Father is the fountain emerging in God the Son as a spring gushing up to be a river, signifying God the Spirit
Our enjoyment of such a flowing, triune, processed God brings us into the incorporation of the Triune God with us, His redeemed people
As the second Comforter, Christ is the Spirit of reality who comes not only to be with us but also to be in us, the redeemed ones of God
The vine tree is for fruit-bearing, and fruit-bearing is for the spreading and multiplication of the vine tree
We still need some further understanding concerning the incorporation of the Triune God with us, His redeemed people, seen in John 14:17b-20
Verse 17b shows that the Spirit of reality is in us and verse 20 says that the Son is in the Father we are in the Son and the Son is in us
We have said that these four ins show the Triune God coinhering with us, and this coinhering is an incorporation
The all-inclusive, compounded, life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God
Christ is the centrality and universality of the Divine Trinity because He is the embodiment of the Father and He is realized as the Spirit
The Word gives us life by speaking; the light gives us life by shining; and the Spirit gives us life by entering
When we receive the Word, the light, and the Spirit, we receive life, and this life is the authority for us to be the children of God
The threefold spreading and dispensing of the Word the light and the Spirit produces Gods children Gods species through the divine life
We need Christ as the Lamb to take away our sin, which is the barrier that prevents Him from dispensing Himself into us as life
According to Hebrew history, there was a place at the temple where a spring was built which flowed continually
Physically speaking, a person's proper eating and drinking will result in him being a strong and healthy person
In the divine and mystical realm, this incorporation is a divine and human constitution, the organism of the Triune God
Our enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God has one issue in three aspects for the three of the Divine Trinity
John also wrote the book of Revelation, which begins with the shining lampstands and ends with a call to drink the living water
