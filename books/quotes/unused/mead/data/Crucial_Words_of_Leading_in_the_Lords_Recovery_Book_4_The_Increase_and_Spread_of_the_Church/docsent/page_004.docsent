   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE CHURCH IN TAIPEI</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I began to serve the Lord, I worked in Chefoo and then went to Shanghai, the largest city in China.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In May 1949, there was a strong wind from the Lord to go to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I looked at the outward conditions then, I did not know why the Lord sent me to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later I felt that I should travel by train south to Kaohsiung, stopping at stations along the way to visit the scattered saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I went to Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung and saw that there was a group of brothers in each place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This showed me the need of the work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I returned to Taipei, I fellowshipped with the brothers, and we decided to start the work on August 1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time there were at most three to five hundred saints on the whole island, most of whom were from China and had been scattered throughout the island.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By 1956 this number increased to thirty-five to forty thousand, and close to half of these met in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every brother and sister would complete an information card when they were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to these cards, there were between fifteen and seventeen thousand saints in the church in Taipei in 1956.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The number of people increased very quickly; it was truly the Lord s mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, because of frustrations and disruptions, our increase almost stopped from 1956 to 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to our record, in 1956 there were approximately three thousand people participating regularly in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, after almost thirty years, there are about five thousand five hundred saints participating regularly in the church life with about three thousand five hundred in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Looking at these figures, there has not been much increase in the past thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There has also not been much spread.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1956 there were fifty local churches; today there are eighty or more local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only thirty or more churches have been added, and some of the larger cities still do not have a church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of the saints who went abroad, only a few spread to the United States, and even fewer spread to other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must use the Lord s word, especially the book of Acts, to check our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus started to minister when He was thirty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Three and a half years later He was crucified, and then He resurrected and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The events over the next approximately thirty years are recorded in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During these years the church increased rapidly and spread immensely even in a time in which it was not convenient to travel from one place to another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nearly two thousand years ago there were no steamships or trains, much less cars or airplanes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, in such old and backward conditions the church spread from Jerusalem to Spain, which was the uttermost part of the earth at that time, in less than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today it is very convenient to travel from one place to another, not only from one place to another within Taiwan but also to other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Despite these advantages, generally speaking, the Lord s recovery in Taiwan has remained stagnant for a quarter of a century; this is the heavy burden within me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>RECONSIDERING THE PATHWAY, FUTURE,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AND PROSPECT OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that we all could be quiet before the Lord and reconsider our pathway and future.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have been saved, and to us the prospect of seeing the Lord in the future is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we must ask whether the Lord has a similar feeling when there is such a need for the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consider the seven hundred million people in India who are in a desolate condition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some English missionaries went there in the past, but not many people are willing to go there now to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Honestly speaking, we should send saints from Taiwan to India and Burma.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Recently a local church has been raised up in southern India by a secondary school teacher who met with us for a year when he was in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Subsequently he received a burden and returned to India to establish churches there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the same time a church has been raised up in northern Burma, and it has been in contact with the church in Bangkok, Thailand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a great need in these places.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We could not meet the need even if we sent three hundred saints to work in India and another hundred to work in Burma.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Arabic-speaking world is also desolate; we need to receive a burden from the Lord to spread there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE FIRST STEP</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>GOSPELIZING AND TRUTHIZING TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord s will is not for us to stay in Taiwan to be in a life of ease and comfort, to receive blessings, to be cultivated in the truth, to grow in life, to be spiritual, and then to see Him when He returns.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This may be very good for us, but this will not satisfy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before focusing on preaching the gospel to the uttermost part of the earth, we need to consider Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Over the past twenty or more years, a church should have been established in every town on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, this is not a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today on the island of Taiwan the worship of idols is still prevailing, whereas the gospel of the Lord is not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have no way to gospelize Taiwan, not to mention truthizing it, because there has not been enough propagation and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It takes just four and a half hours to travel by train from Taipei to Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The distance between them is so short, and transportation is so convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In addition, many places are densely populated, and it is easy to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we do not have much propagation and increase; we have failed the Lord and His gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although there are more than five thousand saints who regularly attend the meetings in the church in Taipei, who love the Lord, and who offer much in the way of material offerings, there has been little spread.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is inexcusable that we are taking care of local needs only.</S>
