This was the one thing that the young ruler lacked. What we lack may be something else. We may think that we have overcome everything, but there is still one thing. At the beginning of his pursuit for victory, a Christian may find that he is able to overcome many sins. But in the end, he will find that there is a particular sin among many sins, the victory over which is the final test of victory. Without overcoming this one sin, he is still defeated.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if you have not seen tonight that one entangling sin has been following you all the time, you have surely not overcome. If a man has not realized that there is one sin that entangles him, he has not taken the first step in the overcoming life. In fact, the thought of victory has not even crossed his mind. In the beginning man's sins are general, and all men are bound by the same common sins. But when a man begins to seek after victory, he can overcome many of these general sins, but he is unable to do anything about one particular sin.</p><p>In Shanghai there was a brother who had overcome many sins. He had consecrated everything he had. But he could do nothing about his temper. In his pursuit he realized that he could not overcome this one sin; it had always been a frustration. If he could overcome this one sin, he would be victorious, and if he could not overcome this one sin, he would still be defeated. The whole issue of victory rested on this one last sin. We all think that we can make it by ourselves. But if we were able to make it by ourselves, we would have no need for the Lord's substitutionary work.</p><p>God puts this one last sin before us. He wants to see how we deal with it. We may have kept the Ten Commandments, but the Lord will say, "Still you lack one thing." There is still one thing which we are not able to do. God is trying to show us that we cannot make it. But we think that we can make it and that we are able. God has no choice but to show us this one last sin so that we will find out whether or not we really can make it by ourselves. When the young man heard the Lord's word, he was taken by surprise. He wondered what would happen to him if he gave all he had to the poor. He thought that if this was what he had to do, he could never make it, and he went away in sorrow (v. 23). He could not overcome. He could do many things, but he could not overcome his love for money.</p><p>In Luke 19 there is another rich man. He was also a ruler, yet not an ordinary ruler. He was a tax collector. He was older than the previous man. Brothers and sisters, who is more generous with money, a young man or an old man? A young man is usually more generous because he has not experienced the world as much as an old man and does not know the power of money as much as an old man. A young man is not as well acquainted with money as an old man is. An old man has lived longer in this world and has dealt with money all his life; he is more aware of the power of money. This is why many misers are older persons. We can safely conclude that Zaccheus should have been more covetous of money than the young man in chapter eighteen.</p><p>Zaccheus wanted to see the Lord. Because there were many people, he climbed up a sycamore tree to see Him. When the Lord saw him, He said, "Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house" (v. 5). Zaccheus came down and received Him, rejoicing. Others observing the Lord murmured, saying, "He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man" (v. 7). But Zaccheus stood up and said, "Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much" (v. 8). Once this word came out of his mouth, his possessions were finished. Zaccheus had done what the young man could not do. The Lord told the young man to do this, but he could not do it. The Lord did not tell Zaccheus to do this; he did it of his own accord. Both were rich men, and both occupied a similar position. The young man thought that he could inherit eternal life, but in the end he could not have it. Zaccheus thought that he was not worthy, but in the end he received what he sought after.</p><p>Saul was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward (1 Sam. 10:23). Zaccheus was lower than any of the people. Zaccheus could not make it, yet he made it. What was the difference? The Lord said, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham" (Luke 19:9). Salvation is of Jehovah, and on that day God did something for that house. Zaccheus was able to give away the money he loved. The young man could not do it because he trusted in himself. Zaccheus was redeemed of the Lord because he was a son of Abraham. Those who believe in God and who are of faith are the sons of Abraham (Gal. 3:7). The young man intended to do everything by himself. He asked what he should do to inherit eternal life. Zaccheus did not do anything. He came to the Lord only on the ground of being a son of Abraham, and he trusted only in God's salvation.</p><p>At first there was no difference between the two men. Both were rich, and both were rulers. The young man was good and Zaccheus was evil. However, good and evil according to one's natural disposition have no bearing on the subject. The young man did not commit adultery or murder; he did not steal. But in the end he found that he could not make it. Zaccheus was a wicked man, but in the end he made it. What was the reason for this? If a man had to give all that he had to the poor before he could have eternal life, no one would be saved. The young man thought that he could make it by himself, but he found that he could not, so he left in sorrow. The Lord said, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to go into the kingdom of God" (Luke 18:24). He did not say that it was impossible; He only said that it was difficult. It is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. The Lord was saying that there was no way for the young man to enter the kingdom of God. After the Lord said this, the disciples said, "Then who can be saved?" (v. 26). Everyone has some money in his own pocket. Who then can be saved? The Lord answered, "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God" (v. 27). We cannot make it, but God can make it. The young man could not make it when he trusted in himself. Zaccheus made it when he trusted in the Lord. One left without salvation, while the other saw salvation come to his house.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 43: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (3) &nbsp; pg 52</div><br></body></html>
