   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Redemption speaks of the great controversy between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God used all the firstborn as a type of the whole family, because the firstborn is born at the height of a man's strength.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For God to kill the firstborn means that everyone is to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All those who are lost to God have only one end death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Redemption is God's act of recovering the fallen ones from Satan's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Redemption is for God to gain something, whereas salvation is for us to gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because we need salvation, redemption comes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way of redemption is through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Lamb of God, the Lord Jesus bore the sins of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He shed His blood on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is typified by the blood of the lamb in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Exodus 13:2 the Lord said, "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the firstborn were to be sanctified unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not believe that a person who has truly seen redemption can remain unconsecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians only know what it means to be saved; they do not know what it means to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many children of God only know salvation; they do not know redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Salvation secures blessings for man but has no reference to God's right or to man's position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Salvation is related to us personally.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In God's eyes, we have gained something.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we look at ourselves, we see that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we were taken away in a trance to God's throne like Paul was, and if we looked at the matter from God's point of view, we would see that we are not only saved but also redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Spontaneously, we would consecrate ourselves and say, "I can no longer live unto myself."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 2 Corinthians 5:14 Paul said, "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word judged in Greek means "carefully considered."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Salvation addresses the matter of who is living, whereas redemption addresses the matter of to whom one is living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Salvation looks at the matter from man's side, whereas redemption looks at the matter from God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the saved ones are also redeemed ones because salvation is based on redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without God's redemption, there can be no salvation for man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consecration is an unknown topic to many people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, it is a simple thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consecration is not man doing many things for God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man can do many things for God without being consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It has nothing to do with whether or not we will be preachers for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It has to do with our ownership; to whom do you belong?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To whom are you living?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many people struggle and strive for their own preferences because they have not seen the meaning of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not see that redemption settles the matter of the Lord's ownership of us, and if we only pay attention to outward works, we will find that it is hard to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not try to tackle this problem in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need light from God to see the meaning of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we see it, we will consecrate ourselves spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people think that consecration is a difficult and insurmountable thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Paul said, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service" Rom 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He considered and concluded that consecration was the most reasonable and sensible thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A consecrated person is one who kneels under the cross and at the same time stands by the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He kneels under the cross to receive salvation, and his view from the throne constrains him to consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those with a sensitive conscience consecrate themselves as a gesture of gratitude for their salvation, while those whose conscience is not as exercised do not consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But no matter how we feel and no matter what kind of conscience we have, we have to realize that consecration is not something that we can muster up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Consecration is based on light; we need to consider the matter from the point of view of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Knowing a doctrine and seeing revelation are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people know the doctrine, theology, and teaching of redemption, but they do not have the revelation of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Exodus 12 tells us that God smote the firstborn of the whole land of Egypt, but redeemed the firstborn of the household of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This shows that all the redeemed ones belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Redemption signifies a change in right.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God delivered those who were under Satan's hand into His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Does this mean that all of the Israelites belonged to God?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The firstborn of Israel were only taken as representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All of the children of Israel should have been God's, but the history of Israel shows that not all the firstborn belonged to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Most of them did not want God, and God put them aside.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Exodus 13:2 all the firstborn belonged to God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But Numbers 8:18 says, "And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only the Levites could participate in the services after God's tabernacle was erected.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Why was it only the Levites?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>While Moses was on Mount Sinai, the people worshipped the golden calf under the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When Moses heard this, he declared, "Who is on the Lord's side? let him come unto me" Exo 32:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At that word the sons of Levi came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the Israelites were redeemed, but only the Levi stood up to declare that they were the Lord's. Numbers 8:18 tells us that God chose the Levites to replace the firstborn of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Exodus 12 and 13 speak of the whole nation of Israel being redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All of them received salvation and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Exodus 32 they murmured against God and did not believe that He would lead them into the promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As a result God chose from among them the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Here the Levites signify consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They took the place of the firstborn among the Israelites to serve God.</S>
