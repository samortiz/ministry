   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BURNING INSIDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I know a lady who is very good-tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She never gets angry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is always a smile on her face.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One day while her niece was visiting in her house, an extremely unreasonable person rebuked her for a length of time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many unbearable words were hurled at her, but she did not answer a word; there was still a smile on her face.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the person was gone, the niece admiringly said, "Auntie, that was quite a demonstration of patience to be able to hold your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I were you I would have lost my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At least I would have said something back to him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The aunt said, "No. Do not think that I was not angry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was burning inside!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I have cultivated forbearance and suppressed my feeling."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our problem is not whether trouble does or does not explode out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, it is whether there is trouble inside or not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Alas!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is all too true that we have all kinds of problems inside!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible shows us that we are naturally sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is nothing strange about a man going after sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His inward and outward parts feel compatible with each other when he sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a most natural consequence to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our human life is bound to be manipulated by the flesh, the world, and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SEED OF SIN WITHIN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people look nice outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They have a high sense of morality, and a decent standard of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It seems as if they possess a better life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the outward niceties are merely works of repression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are like a horse held tightly by its reins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Given a chance, it will plunge into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me say an honest word: every man can become a bandit, and every gentleman can become a dishonorable criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just let the hands go, and every vileness can break forth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is the seed of sin within man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not a strange thing for man to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No one needs to make up his mind to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He only has to make up his mind not to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Never has a person written in his diary, "From this day on, I am determined to lose my temper once a day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I neglect to do so, I will punish myself!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only patience requires deliberation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Committing evil is very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no conscious effort required.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A deliberate work is needed only in doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>SIN IS AN INHERENT NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I sleep in that little room right outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there is a bright light in this hall, I will not be able to sleep there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If I want to sleep, all I need to do is close the door, and the light will be shut out from me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Darkness is the inherent feature of that room; light is the foreign element.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All I can do is drive away the foreign element.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I cannot drive away the inherent darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You can close your door to sinless aspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But you can never close your door to sinful temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the life we have is corrupted, the expression of it in our living is likewise evil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The salvation of God is to regenerate us so that we will have an exchange of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The new life is the life of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regeneration is receiving God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It means that henceforth our whole being is taken away, and God is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not live our own life anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God becomes our living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I never exhort people to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It will not work even if I exhort day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is impossible for man to live God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only the coming in of God's life can result in God-like living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To receive God's life is regeneration, and only regeneration will result in a change of outward behavior.</S>
