S. 1:9-11, 15; 2:2, 14; 3:6-7a, 9, 11</h1><p>Two books in the Bible are closely related: the Gospel of John, which tells us how to take the Lord Jesus as our life, and the Song of Songs, which deals with loving the Lord. Apparently, these two books have no relationship with one another, but in experience we have found that the real way to enjoy the Lord as our life is found in the Song of Songs. If we would pray over the eight chapters of this book in the spirit, we would see how to take the Lord as our life. It does not speak about taking the Lord as our Savior or our Redeemer, but as our life.<p>In this book, a seeking one is hungering and thirsting after the Lord. She loves the Lord and she is seeking the Lord. Actually, this is just enjoying the Lord as life. This book is not about a work or an enterprise; it speaks of a walk that is always seeking after the Lord. It seems that the seeking one has nothing to do except to seek after the One whom she loves. There is nearly no work involved and nothing to do but to seek after such a wonderful Person.<h2 class=head1>THE UNIQUE BOOK FOR LIFE</h2><p>The Song of Songs is the unique book in the Bible showing us the proper way, not only to love the Lord, but also to enjoy Him as our life. We all know these verses: John 14:6, &#8220;I am... the life&#8221;; John 11:25, &#8220;I am the resurrection, and the life&#8221;; John 10:10, &#8220;I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly&#8221;; John 1:4, &#8220;In him was life; and the life was the light of men&#8221;; and 1 John 5:12, &#8220;He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.&#8221; So many Christians know all of these verses, but it is not a matter of knowledge; it is a matter of enjoying Christ as life. Many Christians know that Christ is life, but how many of them enjoy Him as life? The way to enjoy Christ as our life is revealed in this book, the Song of Songs.<p>What is found in the Song of Songs is also found in the Gospel of John in principle, but it is difficult to find unless you first see something in the Song of Songs. Apparently, the Song of Songs is merely a book on loving and seeking the Lord. But I can testify that no other book among the sixty-six books of the Bible has been so helpful to me in the matter of life as this book. I have spent more time in this short book than in any other book of the Old Testament. If we really desire to experience Christ as our life in a way of enjoyment, we cannot stay away from this book.<h2 class=head1>ONE LESSON</h2><p>As I have mentioned previously, in the entire book of eight chapters, the Lord is mainly teaching the seeker a unique lesson. Here we have one who is seeking the Lord and who finds Him. After she finds Him, she has the appreciation and enjoyment. Whoever really seeks the Lord will find Him, because the Lord has promised this in Matthew 7:7. If we seek the Lord, surely we will find Him. He will never disappoint us. And the one who loves Jesus in this book is seeking Him in a wonderful way. &#8220;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth. Draw me, we will run after thee.&#8221; Immediately she finds the one whom she is seeking, and he brings her into his inner chambers. Then she has the appreciation. The seeking one says that her beloved is just like a bundle of myrrh and a cluster of henna flowers.<p>Chapter two then tells us of the enjoyment. He is not only the bundle of myrrh and the cluster of henna flowers, but also the apple tree in the woods. How enjoyable it is to sit under His shadow for rest and to eat His fruit for satisfaction! This is real enjoyment. She sought the Lord, she found the Lord, she appreciated the Lord, and she really enjoyed the Lord. Hallelujah! He is satisfied, and we are satisfied! What else do we need? It seems that there is nothing left to say but, &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221;<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
