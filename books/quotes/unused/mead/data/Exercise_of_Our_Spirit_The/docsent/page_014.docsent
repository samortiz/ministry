   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING NOT ACCORDING TO THE TEACHINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF RELIGION BUT BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To live by considering what is right and what is wrong is the teaching of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where I was raised in China, many considered that there was no need to receive Christ, since they were already taught right and wrong by Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, God s salvation is absolutely different from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not a matter of right or wrong, good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a matter of living and doing things by the self in the soul or by Christ in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To live by the spirit is the mark of God s salvation; this has been missed by religion, but today the Lord is recovering this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To exercise our spirit by coming together to pray is only a small part of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to constantly exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever we do or speak, whoever we contact, and wherever we go, we must do it in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have been learning this lesson for more than thirty-five years, yet even today I still fail.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were all born in the soul, raised in the soul, and educated in the soul, and we have practiced to live in the soul continually.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of this, it is very easy for us to live in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Within our sixteen waking hours, how much do we live, abide, and remain in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord told us to watch and pray Matt 26:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to be watchful that we would not live in the soul and prayerful that we would live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are not watchful, we will immediately fall back into the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christianity today has missed the mark, always giving teachings to people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not need mere doctrinal teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is sufficient simply to check whether or not we are in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need for us to teach someone to outwardly love his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may simply ask, Brother, are you in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a brother is in the spirit, he will be right toward his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if we are not in the spirit, our contact with others is mere soulish or fleshly conversation, not spiritual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I often realize that even in doing good things I have been too much in the soul and not faithful to remain absolutely in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, when I go to the Lord I spend more time to confess than to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To remain in the spirit is a real lesson for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Recently, I have considered before the Lord what the content of my messages should be.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not care to pass on merely doctrinal knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more I have been with the Lord, the more I have had the deep feeling that our urgent need is to be brought into the full realization that we must live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>DENYING THE NATURAL SOUL TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In all four Gospels the Lord Jesus told us that we need to deny the self and lose our soul-life Matt 16:24-25; Mark 8:34-35; Luke 9:23-24; John 12:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Epistles also frequently tell us that we need to live, walk, do things, and pray continually in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to see the things of God, have wisdom, and receive revelation, we need to be in the spirit 1 Cor 2:11-12; Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Satan uses two means to improperly develop the human soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first way is supernatural, as in Buddhism and Hinduism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These devilish isms teach people to exercise their soul in a supernatural way, developing it to contact the evil spirits in the supernatural world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The other way is through contact with the natural world by means of modern education, science, and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Education, television, and newspapers are often used by the devil to improperly develop the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of this, it is difficult for people to turn from the soul to the spirit and to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some young brothers have come to us to argue whether or not we should play sports.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What matters is not sports themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What matters is whether we are in the soul or in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Are we certain that we are in the spirit when we are playing sports?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we can exercise our spirit by praying while we do something, it is fine to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, often while the brothers are playing sports, they realize that they are in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not a matter of what we are doing; it is a matter of in what person we do it, in the soul or in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The issue today is not what we do but simply whether we live by the spirit or by the soul in whatever we do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>EXERCISING THE SPIRIT BEING NOT ONLY TO PRAY BUT TO LIVE, WALK, SPEAK,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>AND DO EVERYTHING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To exercise the spirit is not only to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we cannot exercise our spirit in other matters, we will not be able to exercise our spirit in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The reason we sometimes cannot pray and do not have the appetite to pray is that we are soulish, even fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have left our spirit behind and have not used it for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Medical experts tell us that if we covered our eyes for a number of months, we would lose our function of sight.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the same way, many brothers and sisters set their spirit aside and always use their mind, emotion, will, or simply their physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because they have no exercise of their spirit, their spirit is out of function.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 1943 I was very sick and was confined to bed for six months.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After these six months I could not get out of bed and stand on my feet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The function of my legs was weakened, and it took me a long time to recover my walking function.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Similarly, we may have put aside the function of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may talk, argue, reason, debate, discuss, and even quote the Scriptures merely by exercising the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because of this, a church may be poor, weak, and in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is due simply to one thing: we have neglected our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not argue, reason, or talk in the soul but simply exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we want to argue, we must first exercise our spirit to contact the Lord and consider our argument before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to come back to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To exercise the spirit is not only to pray but to live, walk, speak, and do everything in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is to take care of our inner man and always go along with the inner man in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we practice this, it will be easy to pray at any time and in any place, because our spirit will be strong, living, and active.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Not only in prayer or in reading the Word but in all matters in our daily life and walk, private or public, we need to always exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If before we come to read the Bible we first prepare ourselves to exercise our spirit, we will see a difference in our reading.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Likewise, in all things we should first exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we want to talk with our wife or with a brother, we must be ready to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even to go shopping we need to prepare ourselves by exercising the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we do this, we will be saved from much of our shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We will do many things in a brief and simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We do not trust in mere doctrinal teachings, which do not work.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Rather, we trust in the practice of exercising the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In whatever we do, we need to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The one thing that the New Testament charges us to do at every time is to live, walk, pray, receive wisdom and revelation, and do all things in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>RECEIVING WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>AND REVELATION IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Ephesians 1:17 speaks of a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We cannot receive revelation by arguing with people.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The more we argue, debate, or merely study, the more we are blinded.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should not trust even in our studying.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The more we study in our natural mind, the more we are darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we would silence our natural mind and enter into the spirit, we will receive light and revelation in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A brother may not be clear concerning a certain matter, but if he would enter into the spirit, light and revelation will come.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Arguments and reasonings get us nowhere, but to enter into the spirit brings in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A husband may feel that he is right and his wife is wrong, and the more he argues, the more he feels he is right.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>However, if he would stop his arguing and reasoning and enter into the spirit, he will realize that he is wrong, and he will repent, even with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Darkness and blindness are in the mind, but light and revelation are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Certain Christians say that they are not clear about the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The more they argue, the more they remain in darkness, but if they would enter into the spirit, they will receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is true of all matters.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Sometimes people are bothered by me because when they come to argue about something, I prefer not to join the argument.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Whenever I did argue, I regretted it afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is better not to speak in this kind of arguing way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Rather, if we would enter into the spirit and remain in the spirit for a certain time, everything will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We will be clear with our wife, children, parents, the brothers, the sisters, the church, and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>To be in the mind is not to be clear, but to be in the spirit makes everything crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>John said, I was in spirit on the Lord s Day....and when I turned, I saw Rev 1:10, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>As John was in spirit, he saw the entire situation of the church, the world, all the ages, and even eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When we simply enter into the spirit, everything is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Please try this.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If any part of the Word is not clear to you, do not merely try to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Instead, bring what you have read into the spirit, and there you will see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Wisdom and revelation are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In order to have wisdom we must remain in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When we are outside of the spirit, we may do many things foolishly, but if we are in the spirit, we will do things with wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>All things are clear when we are in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>PRAYING IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>AND GIVING OTHERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRAY</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>On the one hand, when we come together to pray, we should not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The Lord is ready, so we should simply take the initiative to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>On the other hand, we should give others the opportunity to pray in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Again, we may use the illustration of a basketball team.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>It is never right for one player to play while the others are idle.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>To pray and to give others the opportunity to pray are two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Those who pray much should give the opportunity to others, and those who do not pray must learn not to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Those who do not play should not complain that others play too much.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If you wait, the ball will go to another player.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>In the meetings we all must learn to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>This is a help for us to exercise our spirit to pray in the meetings.</S>
