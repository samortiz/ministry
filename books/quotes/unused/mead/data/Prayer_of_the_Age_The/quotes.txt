[1]  THE PRAYER OF THE AGE Scripture Reading: Heb 10:12-13; Acts 2:32-33, 36; Eph 1:22-23; 2:6; Matt 16:18; 18:18
[2]  We need to realize that today the Lord Christ is not merely the Lord who created the universe.
[3]  THE PRAYER OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST
[4]  The fourth main point in this chapter is the prayer of the church as the Body of Christ.
[5]  This kind of prayer is not the prayer of individual believers but the prayer of the church as the Body of Christ.
[6]  We also need to learn how to exercise what the Lord has attained, because the Lord has not only obtained to the highest extent; He has also attained to the highest height.
[7]  If you have the vision of what the Lord has obtained and attained, when you are in this situation, you will pray, Lord, You are the transcendent One.
[8]  If we have the vision that we are the Body of the Head and that the Head has ascended to the heavens and is now transcendent, we will take the ground and claim what the Lord has attained.
[9]  To ask is to be at some distance from the Lord, to seek is to go toward the Lord, and to knock is to arrive at the presence of the Lord.
