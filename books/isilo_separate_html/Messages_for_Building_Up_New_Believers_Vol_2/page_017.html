<p>Acts 10:2 says that Cornelius was &ldquo;devout and one who feared God with all his household, giving many alms to the people and beseeching God continually,&rdquo; and 11:14 says, &ldquo;...who will speak words to you by which you shall be saved, you and all your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius&rsquo;s entire household was saved; it was not just one person who was saved. Cornelius invited his relatives and close friends to hear the words of Peter. While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were in Cornelius&rsquo;s house, and all of them received salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Household of Lydia</h2>
<p>Acts 16:15 says, &ldquo;She was baptized, as well as her household.&rdquo; The apostle preached the gospel to Lydia&rsquo;s household, and the whole household believed and was baptized.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Household of the Jailer</h2>
<p>Acts 16:31 says, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; This is one of the most outstanding verses in Christianity. Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household. God&rsquo;s Word does not say that if you believe on the Lord Jesus, you and your household shall receive eternal life. It says that if you believe on the Lord Jesus, you and your household will be saved.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire Old Testament, God dealt with man by households. Likewise in the New Testament, He deals with man by households. This is the smallest unit; one cannot reduce it to a smaller one. If anyone believes in the Lord Jesus, his whole household shall be saved. This is indeed a wonderful thing. I do not know why this is so, but the Lord&rsquo;s Word says it is so. The Old Testament and the New Testament are consistent; both recognize the same unit.</p>
<p>The church in Philippi started with a jailer. Paul said, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; Verse 34 says, &ldquo;And he brought them up into his house and set a table before them; and he exulted because he had believed in God with all his household.&rdquo; Here we see a wonderful picture. In the beginning the promise was given to the jailer; no one else heard it. &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; Later, the jailer brought his household to Paul. After Paul spoke to them, they were baptized. Then the jailer brought them into his house and set a table before them; and he exulted, having believed in God. &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&rdquo;&mdash;this is not something difficult to achieve. The apostle gave the jailer a promise, and his whole household was saved. Everyone listened, everyone was baptized, and everyone exulted.</p>
<p>Suppose the apostle told the jailer, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved.&rdquo; If this was the case, we would have to wait a few days after a person was saved, teach him something, and hope that he would understand. Then he might gradually testify to his family, and his family might eventually believe and be saved. If this had been the case, how long would it have taken for the jailer&rsquo;s household to be saved? The apostle did not preach the gospel this way. He did not deal with individuals one by one; instead, he addressed the whole household. He said, &ldquo;You and your household&rdquo; shall be saved. You need to see this: The salvation of a household is no different and certainly no more difficult than the salvation of one person. You should never forfeit the privilege of saving the whole household. If you bring the whole household along, the whole household will be saved.</p>
<p>I hope that when the church preaches the gospel five or ten years from now, household after household will be turning to the Lord. From now on, the goal of our workers in evangelism should be whole households. If our goal is a household, we will gain a household. If our goal is only an individual, we will gain only an individual. God does things according to our faith.</p>
<p>If we are clear about God&rsquo;s way with men, we will not suffer unnecessary loss. God takes a household as a unit. If God gains a person, He should gain his whole family as well, regardless of how many persons there are in that family. I hope you will tell the brothers to rise up household by household. Those who are the head of a family have the ground to bring their whole household to the Lord, and they should help their families be saved.</p>
<p>Household salvation means household rejoicing. This is a great matter! If we see that God&rsquo;s dealing with man is by households, we will experience much blessing. We must learn to lay hold of this promise of God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
