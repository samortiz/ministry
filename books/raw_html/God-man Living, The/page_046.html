<h1 class="title">THE FIRST GOD-MAN&rsquo;S LIVING<br />
A MAN OF PRAYER</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 14:19, 23</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="2">
<li>The divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man in the record of the synoptic Gospels concerning the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens, the Slave-Savior in God&rsquo;s gospel service, and the Man-Savior in God&rsquo;s salvation:
	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="5">
	<li>In the performing of the miracle of feeding five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, He trained His disciples to learn from Him (Matt. 11:29) that:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Before performing the miracle, He took the five loaves and two fish, looked up to heaven (indicating that He looked up to His Father in heaven), and blessed them (Matt. 14:19), indicating that:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As the Son on earth sent by the Father in heaven, He was one with the Father, trusting in the Father&mdash;John 10:30.</li>
			<li>He did not do anything from Himself&mdash;John 5:19.</li>
			<li>He did not seek His own will but the will of Him who sent Him&mdash;John 5:30b.</li>
			<li>He did not seek His own glory but the glory of the Father who sent Him&mdash;John 7:18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>After performing the miracle, He went up to the mountain privately to pray (Matt. 14:23; cf. Luke 6:12), indicating that:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He did not remain in the issue of the miracle with the crowds but went away from them privately to be with the Father on the mountain in prayer.</li>
			<li>He might ask the Father to bless all those who had participated in the enjoyment of the issue of the miracle:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) That they would not be satisfied with the food which perishes;</li>
				<li>2) But that they should seek for the food which abides unto eternal life;</li>
				<li>3) And recognize that He was not only the Son of Man but also the Son of God:
					<ol class="none">
					<li>a) Who was sent and sealed by the Father,</li>
					<li>b) And who could give them the eternal life&mdash;John 6:27.</li>
					</ol></li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>He might receive of the Father some instruction concerning how to take care of the five thousand people fed by His miracle.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
