(This section is on the rejection of the Lord by the ruler, Herod.) A tetrarch is a king under the emperor. Herod "heard the report concerning Jesus." This might have been because of the preaching carried out by the twelve disciples.</P><P>Verse 2:"And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and because of this these works of power are operating through him." Herod recognized the Lord merely as John the Baptist and not as the Christ.</P><P>Verses 3-4:That was before the twelve disciples were sent forth to preach the word. Herod married his brother's wife and thus committed adultery. John spoke frankly to him. From this we see that we should not be careless concerning sin. This is the only place in the Bible that mentions the celebration of a birthday. To celebrate birthdays is not very good, for it easily gives rise to trouble. Sin easily enters when men indulge in pleasures. Herodias was obviously an adulteress. John was put in prison on account of her, for John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her" (see also Mark 6:18).</P><P>Verse 5:"And though he desired to kill him, he feared the crowd because they held him as a prophet." Early on, Herod desired to kill John, but he feared the crowd. After having contact with John, he realized that John was a righteous and holy man (Mark 6:20), because his conscience was touched by John's preaching. The king feared John and kept him safe (Mark 6:20). Although his conscience was touched, he could not stand against the power of Satan. In times like this, Satan is hiding behind the scenes to oppose the children of God. The same is true with us today; although our conscience functions, we do not have enough strength to resist sin.</P><P>Verse 6:"But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in their midst and pleased Herod." Children should not be allowed to be exposed in public places. Today's parents should give heed to this matter.</P><P>Verse 7:"Hence, he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked." When one is at the peak of his pleasure, it is easiest for him to lose self-control. Herod's promising with an oath is an example of this.</P><P>Verse 8:"And she, being instigated by her mother, said, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist." The innocent daughter was instigated by her mother to request the head of John to be placed on a platter. Having this kind of education, this girl's entire life would be disastrous; surely she would become a vicious woman. Parents are responsible for their children in things such as movies, dancing, reading materials, etc.</P><P>Verse 9:"And the king was grieved, yet because of the oaths and those reclining at table with him, he commanded it to be given." Although the king's conscience was pricked, he was afraid of losing face. He would rather sin than lose his face.</P><P>Verse 12:"And his disciples came and took the corpse and buried it; and they came and reported the matter to Jesus." This verse shows us one of the principles of Christian conduct in the world. Without any noise or publicity, John's disciples buried the corpse; they only went and reported the matter to Jesus. The corpse was the evidence of John's having been treated unreasonably and an irrefutable proof of his having been falsely accused. When you suffer mistreatment, you should keep silent, hide the evidence, and report the matter to Jesus. But we are not like this. When we encounter such situations, we take delight in exposing the evidence of our having been wronged.</P><P>Verses 13-21:This portion is the second subsection within the second major section. The general thought here is that the Lord Himself had to die; the multiplying of the loaves signifies the Lord's death for us. John 6:1-14 records the same incident as this section. From John 6:26 on, the meaning of the multiplying of the loaves is explained. It does not mean to have some refreshments, but it actually signifies the Lord's death (John 6:35, 48, 51, 53-58).</P><P>Verses 14-16:Compassion is the Lord's nature. Regardless of how much He was rejected, He was always compassionate toward people. The disciples asked the Lord to send the crowds away. This means that they wanted people to leave the Lord. How improper that was! Often we also have the same kind of tone. Believers should not have an attitude of being irresponsible; rather, they should seek opportunity to be responsible and imitate the Lord Jesus' being responsible here. We should not be willing to make bricks only because we are under the leather whip. The Lord here not only preached but also ministered to people. The Lord was a rich poor man. "You give them something to eat." We believers should not act poverty-stricken or be poor rich men.</P><P>Verses 17-18:Why did the Lord ask the disciples to give them to eat? It was because the disciples had something. Regardless of how little, it must be given first to the prophet (1 Kings 17:13-14). So it is with the matter of donating money. "Bring them here to Me." Whatever is the least, after being put into the Lord's hand, will become the most.</P><P>Verse 19:"And after commanding the crowds to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds." Every loaf of bread that is placed in the Lord's hand will be blessed. However, after the blessing, there must be the breaking. People want the blessing but not the breaking. A grain of wheat falls into the ground, but unfortunately it is not willing to die. "If it dies" indicates that there is the possibility of not dying. Every loaf of bread that is in the Lord's hand will be broken. If it is not broken, the five thousand cannot be satisfied. Whenever and wherever we resist the Lord's breaking, we will be put aside by the Lord. Whenever the Lord accepts our consecration, He immediately begins to break us. Unfortunately, most of us cry out in pain. After the breaking, there is the need to distribute to the crowds. To distribute to the crowds requires power. If the believers would obey, after being broken they will spontaneously have the power. Sometimes after our consecration we encounter some unusual situations, such as losing our child or losing our wealth. This is the breaking. Ordinarily, there would be no breaking, but after consecration, there will be the breaking.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
