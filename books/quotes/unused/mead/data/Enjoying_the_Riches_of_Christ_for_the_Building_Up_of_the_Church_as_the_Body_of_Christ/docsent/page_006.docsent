   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMY OF THE MYSTERY FOR THE DISPENSING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8-10; Col 1:15-18; Isa 9:6; Matt 16:16-18; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Col 3:4a, 10-11; 2:6; 1 Cor 6:17 CHRIST BEING MYSTERIOUS AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The source of the church is Christ; the church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But who is Christ and what is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christianity has tried to teach clearly about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today even a young believer can say something definite about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet the more we study the Bible, the more we realize that it is difficult to completely comprehend who and what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is easy to understand many other things, but it is very difficult to know Christ completely.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many in Christianity think that they know Christ in a complete way, but in actuality, there is no possibility to completely know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is too wonderful, too all-inclusive, too mysterious, and too marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even we as men are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have three lives: a physical life, a soulish life, and a spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet we do not know ourselves completely.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How then can we completely comprehend Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have a mind and emotion, but where is our mind, and where is our emotion?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have two hearts: a physical heart and a psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Medical doctors can touch our physical heart, but they cannot touch our psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also have a soul and a spirit, but where is our soul, and where is our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I know much about myself, but I am not completely clear about myself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I know that I have a mind, an emotion, and a will; I know that I have two hearts; I know that I have a soul and a spirit; and I know that I have a physical life, a soulish life, and a spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have so many good things, but I am not so clear about all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are wonderful, but we are not as wonderful as Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is much bigger than we are; He is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Forty years ago I thought I was very clear about Christ, but today, if you ask me about Christ, I must confess that although I know much about Him, I am not very clear about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not possible to completely comprehend all the things concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, I have no intention of trying to make you clear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, I may puzzle you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are going to enjoy Christ, we have to be puzzled.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are clear about Christ, we are finished with the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, it is better not to be so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHRIST BEING GOD AND THE IMAGE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to this verse, Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This point is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is "the image of the invisible God."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is Christ God or the image of God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since God is invisible, how can He have an image?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Does anything invisible have an image?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be sure, an image must be visible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As God, Christ is invisible, yet He is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a puzzle to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CHRIST BEING THE FIRSTBORN OF ALL CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The latter part of Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that He is one among the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is the Firstborn, the first item, of all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then verse 16 says that "in Him all things were created."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that He is also the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is Christ the Creator or a creature?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be sure, He is the Creator, but He is also an item of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have composed several hymns on the subject of Christ being the creature as well as the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some have condemned me for teaching this, but I do not care whether or not they condemn me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, I care for Colossians 1:15b, which says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our Lord Jesus Christ is too wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is not only the Creator, He is also the creature, and He is not only God, He is also man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we recognize that Christ is a man, we have to admit that He is a creature, because man is a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ partook of blood and flesh Heb 2:14 , and blood and flesh are items of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The so-called systematic theology says that Christ is the Creator and admits that Christ became a man, but it is reluctant to admit that Christ is also a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, as man is Christ not a creature?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How could He have blood and flesh without becoming a creature?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is the Creator, yet one day He became a man, a creature with blood and flesh.</S>
