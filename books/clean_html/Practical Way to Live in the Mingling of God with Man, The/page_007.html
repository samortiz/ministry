<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Manifested through Us,<br />
and Our Living Christ</h2>
<p>When Christ is formed in us, whenever we think, love, or decide, we will have the image of Christ and bear the expression of Christ. This means that spontaneously Christ will be magnified through us, and our life, being, and doing will be an expression, a manifestation, of Christ (Phil. 1:20-21). To have this kind of living is to live Christ. This is the Christian daily living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL WAY TO EAT AND DRINK CHRIST&mdash;<br />
READING THE WORD AND PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Christian daily living is a living of experiencing Christ in a practical way. As we have seen, enjoying Christ as food and drink is vital to the practical experience of Christ in a daily way. However, we may not know how to eat and drink Christ. We as Christians are familiar with many spiritual terms. Yet when we are pressed to give exact definitions of these terms and to testify concerning our experience of them, we frequently realize that we know very little. Hence, although we know that Christ is food and drink to us, very few of us know how to enjoy Him as such. We need to know practically how to enjoy Christ as food and drink.</p>
<p>We drink Christ by praying, and we eat Him by contacting His word. The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The best way to contact the Spirit is by praying. When we pray, we exercise our spirit, and when we exercise our spirit, our spirit contacts the Holy Spirit (John 4:24; Rom. 8:16; Eph. 6:18). The more we pray, the more we exercise our spirit and contact the Spirit with our spirit. Since the Spirit is the living water (John 7:38-39), at the very moment we are praying, we are drinking the living water. Although praying is the main way to drink Christ, we drink Him any time that we exercise our spirit to contact the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord is not only the Spirit for us to drink by prayer; He is also the Word for us to eat (John 1:1; Rev. 19:13; John 5:39-40). Whenever we contact the Word with our spirit, we feed on the Lord. In John 6:57 the Lord says, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; When the disciples heard this, many of them reacted, saying, &ldquo;This word is hard; who can hear it?&rdquo; (v. 60). Surely they were trying to understand how the Lord could give them His flesh so that He could be eaten by them. Then in verse 63 the Lord said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The Lord told His disciples to take Him as their food, but He was not referring to His physical flesh. Rather, it is the Spirit who gives life, and the words that He had spoken to them were spirit and life. According to these verses, taking Christ&rsquo;s words is the same as taking Him as our food. The Lord&rsquo;s words are to be taken not just in the mind but in the spirit. If we take the word of God only in the mind, it will be merely doctrine and teaching. However, if we take the word in our spirit, it will become food (Jer. 15:16).</p>
<p>If we are to enjoy Christ as food and drink, we have to take the word and pray in our spirit. When we pray to the Lord in our spirit, we drink the Lord as the living water. When we contact the word with our spirit, we feed on the Lord as our food. Day by day we have to learn how to experience and enjoy Christ by contacting the word and praying in our spirit. When we learn this, we will experience the Lord&rsquo;s energizing power, by which we can live, think, love, choose, and act.</p>
<p>The breakfast that we eat every morning is the strengthening and energizing power within us by which we can live throughout the day. Just as we eat breakfast every morning, we have to come to the Lord every morning and eat and drink of Him. We need to come to Him to contact His word and to pray to Him in our spirit. The more we contact His word and pray to Him in our spirit, the more we will feed on Him and drink of Him and thus experience Him as our life, energy, and strength by which we can live as a normal Christian. If we eat and drink Him by reading and praying, we will think by Christ, love by Christ, decide by Christ, and have a life that is fully in Christ. Such a life of eating and drinking Christ is a life of enjoying and experiencing Christ as everything to us in a practical way.</p>
