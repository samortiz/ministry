<p class=hbody>The living of Christ when He sojourned on earth,<br>The sixteenth Psalm shows us, was wholly of worth.<br>His attitudes, choices, and interests all tell<br>The man who in God’s tabernacle may dwell.</p><p class=hbody>“Preserve me, O God, for in Thee I confide”—<br>In God He took refuge whate’er did betide.<br>“O Thou art my Lord, I’ve no good beyond Thee”—<br>He spoke in Himself unto God constantly.</p><p class=hbody>“As for all the saints who are dwelling on earth,”<br>To Him they’re the people of excellent worth.<br>Of them He has said He has all His delight—<br>In proving this all the four Gospels unite.</p><p class=hbody>“Their sorrows are increased who other gods choose”—<br>All things of the idols did Jesus refuse.<br>He spoke not their names while upon earth He trod;<br>His interests were ever and only for God.</p><p class=hbody>“The Lord is my portion, the Lord is my cup”—<br>For everything He to the Father looked up.<br>“The Lord I will bless who my counsel doth give”—<br>Himself He denied and by God’s word did live.</p><p class=hbody>His heart thus was glad and His spirit rejoiced,<br>And e’en in His death praise to God could be voiced;<br>His soul God would never abandon to hell,<br>But in resurrection His body would dwell.</p><p class=hbody>God raised Him, and He with God’s glory was crowned;<br>Then fulness of joy in God’s presence He found.<br>E’en now at the Father’s right hand is His seat,<br>Where flowing forever are pleasures complete.</p><p class=hbody>(Hymns, #1082)</p>
