   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This being the case, how we need to be watchful and on the alert so that the old man will never have a day to rise up again!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But is not this very difficult?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Surely the flesh regards this as difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, in order for the cross to work in the believers, they must have the empowering of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The cross and the Holy Spirit can never be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The cross makes it possible for the believers to overcome sin; the Holy Spirit makes real in the believers' lives what the cross has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A believer who wants to be delivered from sins must not make provisions for the flesh; he must be watchful and must be ready to pay any price.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He should have less hope in himself and more trust in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With man it is impossible; with God, nothing is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The death of the cross is different from any other kind of death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of death is most painful and slow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, if we truly reckon ourselves dead and take the cross of the Lord as our own cross, it will be painful and miserable as far as our flesh is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus hung on the cross for six hours before He died; His death was very slow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the lives of Christians, the experiences of co-crucifixion belong often to this six-hour period.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He had the power to come down if He desired.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same is true for those who are crucified with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever one allows his old man to leave the cross, his old man will leave the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The old man is hung on the cross through one's reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If one maintains the attitude that the old man is dead, the old man will be as powerless as the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But once a person relaxes, the old man will be activated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many of God's children often wonder why their old man keeps resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They forget that the death of crucifixion is slow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan is very alert; he takes any opportunity to resurrect the old man and to cause the believers to commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever we are not watchful, his temptation and deception come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When outward temptation and deception come, the old man within is quick to respond.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At such times, we should come back once again to the foundation of the cross and should once again reckon ourself dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should wait through this reckoning for the Holy Spirit to apply the power of the cross until the temptation loses its drawing power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every believer should have this extraordinary experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are about to be defeated, we should come again to the cross and reckon ourself dead; by this we will experience power coming into us, preserving us, and strengthening us to resist the temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, is it not true that sometimes we reckon over and over again and still do not see any result, but instead we sin?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the experience of many.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that our "reckoning" has some problem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have truly reckoned, we will surely find extraordinary power coming into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should remember that this "reckoning" is not to say with our mouth, "I am dead, I am dead"; neither is it to think in the mind, "I am dead, I am dead."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the judgment of our will to reckon ourself dead and to maintain this attitude of reckoning with a believing heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may say that this is a decision in our will by which we declare, "I am dead."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, first we are willing to die, then we reckon ourself dead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to learn to reckon with the will and with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we really stand on Romans 6:11, we will constantly have the experience of being free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a believer first takes this attitude, Satan will purposely try to stir up a storm and will cause the believer to feel that things are too much for him to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At such times, he should calmly rely on the Holy Spirit to apply to him the power of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not think that the temptation is too great, and do not encourage the enemy because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You should reckon yourself dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The cross has the power to overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If unfortunately we fail, we should rise up even more and should trust more in the power of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Holy Spirit will lead us to victory in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brothers, "sin will not lord it over you, for you are...under grace"!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rom 6:14 .</S>
