Verse 47 of chapter 2 gives a description of the early believers in Jerusalem: they were 'praising God and having grace with all the people
We have peace, we are being built up, we fear the Lord, we have the comfort of the Holy Spirit, and we are praising God
In Acts the Lord 'added together day by day those who were being saved'; that is, the number of believers increased day by day
Our present rate of increase cannot compare to the increase that we experienced during our first eight years in Taiwan
Very few saints are answering the Lord's calling to be set apart by the Lord and be useful in full-time service
We cannot use human methods, such as opening a kind of school to recruit young people in order to cultivate and produce some useful ones
Our situation should be that year after year new ones are called by the Lord, raised up by Him, and set apart by Him
In view of this situation, we must rely on the workers going out rather than on the saints being scattered in order to raise up new churches
The foundation for many aspects of the work has been laid in Taiwan, but the work in the United States is altogether in the initial stage
The living conditions in Taiwan are stable because of a prosperous economy and a well-developed education system
When Western missionaries went to China to preach the gospel they had to establish schools because education helps the spread of the gospel
In addition, the environment in Taiwan is safe and secure, and the government grants people freedom of religion
There are less than four thousand Chinese readers, but there are close to ten thousand English-speaking readers
In the United States there are close to a hundred million Christians, of which forty million are Catholics and sixty million are Protestants
If the work influences only one percent of the sixty million Protestants, this would be six hundred thousand people
The co-workers in Tainan are free to develop the work in Tainan, but they must not interfere with the work in other churches
If a country has the best president, but none of its ministers work diligently, sooner or later that country will fall
In a sense, the work needs leadership, but in another sense, the work does not need a leader or leaders, because we are not an organization
Once they are serving in a certain place, whether large or small, they should work until that place becomes a 'New Jerusalem'
The work does not need a commander-in-chief, nor does a district meeting or a group meeting need a commander-in-chief
If the grace he has received is similar to what Barnabas received, his work will be comparable to the work of Barnabas
Once an aspect of the work is placed in our hands, we should exercise to function; we should not wait for 'instructions' from a leader
If the church does not advance or spread, the elders should go before the Lord and see if there are others who are more useful
The elders do not have a specific term of service, like the president who serves for four years and the legislators who serve for two years
When the coworker serves directly he does not know how to train others and even believes that he is the only one who can carry out the work
When a co-worker goes to a place where there are no elders, he should train the local brothers with the aim of producing elders
At present, however, the elders do not bear the burden of the churches, because the co-workers are still bearing the burden of the elders
Many new believers have not remained after being baptized, because we have not spent enough time to care for them
Not only should the elders spend more time shepherding, but the responsible ones in the districts and the serving ones should shepherd more
There should be one weekly meeting in the meeting hall, and the rest of the time can be used for small group meetings
They can meet two times a week, but it would be best to meet three times so that they can also shepherd and care for other saints
They should observe how the groups are progressing, how many new ones are being gained, and how many backslidden ones are being recovered
It would be best if the business affairs took up only one-tenth of our time and visiting and shepherding took up nine-tenths of our time
The meeting was not in the hands of the elders; in other words, the elders did not consider the meeting to be their responsibility
Otherwise, several hundred saints will come together for one and a half hours every week without receiving a supply
Of relying on the co-workers, the elders should labor and pay the price to receive a supply for the Lord's Day meeting
The small groups can decide how to use the rest of the evenings in the week; they should include a prayer meeting
The saints in a group may decide to pray in the home of one saint this week and in the home of a different saint next week
In this way the church is responsible only for taking care of the meeting on Lord's Day morning and the mid-week meeting
The mid-week meeting can be on a Wednesday or Thursday, and each small group can decide whether to visit or to shepherd on other evenings
If the elders cannot give good messages, they can coordinate together to select a few messages and digest them
Every Lord's Day morning when the saints come together, the elders should supply them in a proper way with 'food'
Because there seems to be a hint of bureaucracy among us, no one should be assigned to be a leading one in a small group
We should eliminate any administration through the districts by letting the saints serve and take care of their activities
When the saints meet on the Lords Day morning it is the responsibility of the elders the fathers and mothers to give them something to eat
Eventually, the Lord will open a door for the consecrated saints to address the real need of the group, and the quarreling will stop
Our situation can be compared to a family in which the elderly father and older siblings restrict the younger siblings from doing anything
The elders and responsible ones must not shackle the saints; instead, they must supply the saints so that the saints come forth to serve
Although it is not appropriate for the elders to choke the workers so severely, the co-workers should be 'choke-proof'
A brother who serves in a locality should not stop doing something simply because he feels that the elders are not fully supportive
If the co-workers have something, they will supply life in the meetings, and whenever they open their mouths, the saints will be enlivened
The co-workers should never be useless; instead, they should always advance and look for opportunities to develop their function
Even in a young people's conference during the Thanksgiving holidays, the young students bore the responsibility of the meetings
We later asked the young people to take care of another conference, and two hundred and twenty-five young people were baptized
A person who oversees is one who lets others handle and be responsible for church affairs while he takes the oversight
A full-time co-worker who is specialized in giving messages is, in principle, the same as a pastor or preacher in Christianity
Timothy 517 says Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in word and teaching
They were the first group of believers to recover the church life, but they paid too much attention to the gift of preaching the word
Whether you have the gift of prophesying does not matter, because 1 Corinthians 14:31 says, 'You can all prophesy one by one'
The ability to give messages is not the result of a change in status; it does not come when a person begins to serve full time
The movements of a boxer are not to gain people's applause; rather, his sole aim is to deliver a blow to his opponent
Moody, a prevailing American evangelist, preached the gospel, he was approached by a learned person who was in the congregation
Moody then suggested that this person preach the gospel with his correct grammar to see how many would be saved
On the one hand, the elders should not expect the co-workers to bear the responsibility of ministering the word
We do not attend meetings in order to listen to beautiful messages, and the full-time workers are not the only ones who should give messages
An elder may say that he cannot speak the word because he has not received much training and does not know the Bible
It may not be beneficial for the elder to invite him to speak the word, because the co-worker may not have a burden for that locality
Our weakness has been that we have the concept that it is the full-time co-workers who are specialized in giving messages
If the elders are willing to endeavor, they will be very effective when they speak the word, because they know the needs of the saints
There was also a brother who did not know how to give messages and was not eloquent, but he established the church in Tsingtao
Timothy 517 says Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in word and teaching
Some elders should devote all their time to administrating the church, and some brothers who serve full time should get a job
The elders should take their hands off and let the saints be responsible for giving suggestions and making decisions
When the saints are assigned to a service, they should be in charge of everything, and the elders no longer need to manage that service
The churches in Taiwan are established; consequently, even if the saints make a mistake, it will not be serious
Suppose there are eight districts in a church, and the elders delegate the church affairs to the eight districts
They should oversee the saints, letting the saints have authority for their service and allowing them to develop
Concerning the finances, the size, and the type, he and those who coordinate with him must go before the Lord in prayer
After working in a place for two years, the co-workers and elders should not be tied down, and the saints should be useful
After working in a local church for three years, a co-worker should be able to leave, because he should have raised up useful saints
The more the co-workers have labored, the more responsibilities they have gained, but other saints were not brought in to function
As a result, no responsibilities are handed over to the saints, and the saints are not raised up to bear responsibility
In this way we will produce capable saints who function according to their ability, and every brother and sister will be useful
To change our system does not mean that the coworkers should no longer serve rather the coworkers should do more to raise up useful saints
Some brothers have suggested that we take the co-workers out of all the localities, but this will not resolve our situation
If our concept and our way of working are changed, even if the co-workers are not removed from the localities, we will have results
The work in the towns and villages will increase the number of local churches, but it will not necessarily increase the number of saints
Even the Taiwanese students have had little effect on the campuses there because they were not brought into function here in Taiwan
It is regrettable that the co-workers replaced the saints when they should have been leading them into service
When you observe a particular skill in a saint, you must let him serve, and you must be willing to be led by him
The saints in Los Angeles have at most a 'junior high school education,' but the saints in Taipei are mostly 'graduate students'
In most cases we baptize the new ones immediately, and at least eighty percent of those who are baptized remain
In contrast, we have baptized at least two thousand people here, but not even a hundred have remained in the church
If we pull the co-workers out of the local churches, the churches will still be weak; moreover, the co-workers will have no place to work
If the co-workers are willing to assist the elders in one accord, two to three thousand new ones will be added in a year or two
If the co-workers go to labor in a small town, they may not gain two thousand new ones, even after laboring for ten years
We must concentrate our energy on the schools in these three centers because this work will have double the results with half the effort
Every year the co-workers who have been manifested in their function should go abroad because there is a great need overseas
Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia all have urgent needs, but the door for the work is not as wide open as in Indonesia
A foundation has been laid there, and the brothers are able to accomplish a certain amount of things themselves
During the past five years there has been some progress there, but this was due to the help rendered by the co-workers
If the co-workers in the local churches lead the saints to serve, their leaving will not affect the churches when the need arises
The coworkers should remain in the large local churches to labor in the strategic places push forward the work in schools and then go abroad
We must have a thorough change of concept and work hard, because it is not easy to train apprentices, all of whom have opinions
Sister Dora Yu thought that Brother Nee, being young, had been delayed by some amusement, so she asked him to withdraw from her school
Because Sister Barber realized that Brother Nee was good material, she continually dealt with him and at the same time also supplied him
He was constantly rebuked, but he was not disheartened, because Sister Barber not only rebuked him but also supplied him
Of course, we need to deal with their opinions, but at the same time we should supply them and let them function
There are the co-workers and the elders, under whom are the responsible ones in the districts and in the small groups
We are like orchard keepers, who do not bear fruit themselves but who cultivate the fruit trees that bear fruit
It is not sufficient for us to be the only persons doing the work of watering, pruning, and spraying for the bearing of fruit
Not only so, elders should teach, lead, and even correct the saints so that the saints are able to bear responsibility
If we can bring all three thousand saints into the service, in five years there will be at least fifty to sixty thousand saints
If the coworkers teach these new ones raise them up perfect them and bring them into the service the coworkers will gain some apprentices
It is regrettable, however, that we have neither learned to bring the saints into the service nor learned to perfect the saints
The Lord will have to lead the co-workers to another place where there are no saints, where the work has not reached
Although the other saints can also do a limited amount of work, it will be difficult for them if their function is not manifested
Since we do not teach the new ones how to bring others into function, they will repeat our pattern of doing everything by themselves
Rather, it is because the first co-worker cannot coordinate with another person; hence, the two cannot work together
In this case, each co-worker is a separate cord, and they cannot be twined into a twofold cord, much less a threefold cord
We may think that we know how to arrange the chairs, but it is not easy to teach another person to arrange the chairs
In some homes the mother has to go to work in the morning, so she leaves a note for her children, telling them what to do
A local church is under the administration of the elders, and it receives teaching and shepherding from the elders
For this reason, the elders should endeavor to bear the responsibility of administrating, teaching, and shepherding
These are two problems: the elders who have jobs are entangled, and the elders who are older are short of energy and stamina
Without the co-workers teaching the elders and the elders teaching the saints, it will be difficult for us to have a breakthrough
The co-workers must learn how to teach others, and the elders must be willing to learn so that they also can teach others
We must be willing to ask the saints to come and help so that we will be able to carry out the burden of increase
They will be under the direction of the elders, who regard them as unsuitable to do anything but accept the elders' directions
The three elders love the Lord, tithe more than ten percent, are in every meeting, and bear all the responsibilities in the church
They are busy serving God with a conscience void of offense and the Lord has kept them faithful for twenty years they have made no mistakes
We will have no way to spread unless the Lord changes our environment by sending us to another island to do a pioneering work
If we do not change our way, we will not learn something new; rather, we will keep the old things and have only old people
They will serve for many years, loving the Lord and being irreproachable, but they will be unable to bring other saints into the service
Although the elders do not make mistakes or commit any sin, the church will not increase, and the second generation will be lost
In the churches in Taiwan many saints have been baptized, many have been recovered, and the saints are in one accord
We can produce a local church with two to three thousand saints, but we do not have the capacity to do more than this
Fewer serving ones means that the saints are not functioning; instead, only the responsible ones in the district are functioning
If our situation is normal, the responsible ones will not be the only ones functioning; all the saints will be functioning
The responsibility of giving a message to feed the saints should not be borne by the responsible brothers in the districts
The elders should not interfere with the other activities in the districts but should let the districts develop spontaneously
If everything is directed by the elders, the church will be limited, and many useful saints will not be utilized
If the Lord were to scatter twenty-five hundred saints to fifty new places, there would be fifty saints in each place
We have fellowshipped concerning this in the past, but in our practice we continued in our habit and disposition
It is relatively easy for co-workers to give attractive messages, but they must spend time to prepare a message that will touch the saints
It is not difficult for a co-worker who is eloquent, knows the Bible, and has spiritual experience to give an attractive message
Without experience and learning, they should not expect their speaking to penetrate the inner being of the saints
A person with experience must study how to present a message that not only penetrates the heart but also constrains the saints
If she is not willing to spend time and exert some effort, it will be difficult for her to keep her children on the right track
Some co-workers' functions have not been fully manifested in the work, because they are not willing to put in much effort
It is not difficult to be busy, but those who are serious in leading the saints will surely have a difficult time
They must be perfected to do more than attend meetings, listen to messages, and help take care of some business affairs
There was a brother in the church in Chefoo who was the director of a hospital run by the Presbyterian denomination
We had a burden for him and considered when to visit him, how to visit him, who should visit him, and what to say to him
During that time we learned much concerning how to visit the saints, and the Lord's presence was with us in that training
On two different occasions the brother suggested that we visit the director, but we did not feel that it was the right time
It is convenient to do things by ourselves, but mothers know that patience and time are needed to teach children to do things
The work and the church are progressing very slowly because we do not serve with the saints in order to teach them
Places that are of greater importance will require more co-workers, and smaller places will not need as many co-workers
At present, this will not be possible because there are local churches in many places, and every place needs to be strengthened
We have fellowshipped previously that taking the co-workers out of their localities will not solve our problem
Our strategy will be to focus on large cities, to strengthen the students' work, and to take care of the need overseas
In places where there are elders the coworkers should strengthen the functions of the elders by leading the elders to advance and learn more
If the co-workers do not strengthen the testimony in the large cities, the elders will not be able to adequately meet the need
The result of such work will be that the responsibilities of a local church will be borne by the elders and the saints
The co-workers should not direct the affairs of a local church and should not use the elders to carry out the directions of the co-workers
The co-workers should not be itinerant preachers, who visit different places to hold revival meetings or edification meetings
Since we do not have sufficient co-workers, we will concentrate on the large localities and will not be able to cover all the smaller places
In the early stage of the church in Taipei, we felt that the testimony needed to spread to the local Taiwanese people
Most of the land we have purchased is in the Wanhua district, which has a large concentration of local Taiwanese speakers
There is a sister who has many Taiwanese-speaking friends but cannot bring them to the meetings because of communication
Translation into Taiwanese is good, but it takes up much of the time during the meeting and can be a distraction
The elders and co-workers in every locality should bring this matter before the Lord and consider what is best for their situation
We must fellowship with the saints so that an atmosphere of having no distinctions can also be produced in Taiwan
We should have love feasts and invite the Taiwanese brothers and sisters to our homes to have meals and fellowship
We should strive to have no differences in spirit, in fellowship, in affection, and in any dealings with one another
In every local church a door should be opened to the Taiwanese people, and a language bridge should be built for the Taiwanese saints
Of course, since we are in Taiwan, there should be no distinction between the local people and the mainlanders
During this transition time, however, we need to build a bridge so that the local people can enter into the church life
We do not have secrets that we keep from the saints in fear of their excelling in the service and becoming better than us
On one hand, we should not be afraid to let others serve, but on the other hand, we should watch them; that is, we must oversee
If you are in Adam your end will be with Satan but when you are transferred out of Adam into Christ your relationship with Satan is broken
If you do not make such a transfer, one day you will share God's judgment on Satan; you will be with Satan in the lake of fire'
If a teacher is afraid and never gives the car to a student, the student will never have the opportunity to learn to drive
If we do everything by ourselves from beginning to end, there will be no one to continue the work after we die
It is the Lord's sovereignty and His mercy that we have encountered problems and suffered a loss in recent years
For nearly ten years we were engaged in a battle, both in the East and in the West, concerning the truth and ground of the church
We should have the assurance that after so many years of observing, listening, and learning, the saints are able to bear responsibility
Other believers can carry out their respective commissions, but our commission is to build up the church life in every locality
The places abroad that need our help are Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Manila in the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia
Malaysia is divided into two areas: the center of one area is Penang, and the center of the other area is Sarawak
Through the fellowship it may be that when a co-worker returns, he visits the various local churches in Taiwan to supply the churches
Taiwan has been the center of the work in Southeast Asia, but this does not mean that Taiwan controls the churches in other places
Every local church should take care of its own administration; however, the work, being regional, has a center
The first kind of work is to serve in a local church, to help that church, by diligently training and perfecting the saints
They can visit a local church if there is a need, and then they can visit another local church if there is a need
Although the elders are not directly involved in the work, the work and the churches are the one testimony; they are intimately related
When the co-workers go abroad, they must do a better job than they do in Taiwan; they must be able to help the churches
New Zealand has rich soil, good climate, and bountiful produce but a small population; it needs to be developed
It is good to exchange co-workers between the East and the West, because this is a kind of fellowship and help
As we come to understand and know one another more and as we also grow in life, there will be more traffic between the East and the West
The co-workers here should use Taiwan as a base for their going to the places in East Asia for the spread of the work
The co-workers who go abroad to labor for the Lord should take note of the saints who are seeking and promising
When these young ones finish their education and return to their countries, they will be a great help to the churches
The co-workers going abroad and the young saints coming to Taiwan will increase the burden of the churches and the co-workers in Taiwan
In the Old Testament the Levites received the tithe of the Israelites and then gave one-tenth of what they had received to the Lord
We should not wait until we receive a surplus in order to give ten percent; rather, we should first set aside ten percent by faith
Regardless of whether we have enough to meet our need, the churches in Taiwan must offer one-tenth by faith to the Lord
Such a project cannot be accomplished within a short time; nevertheless, we should ask the Lord to lead us in this matter
In this way funds will gradually be accumulated, and it will be easier to bear the financial burden at the time of the conference
In the future we will need to rent a hall that is large enough to hold ten thousand people in order to hold a conference
The summer holiday may be more suitable because a substantial number of saints either work in schools or are students
According to past years, the work accomplished during the summer is often more effective than what is done during the rest of the year
If the co-workers can go and strengthen the churches there, an international conference would have a greater effect on the saints
On one hand, the co-workers should strengthen the local churches, help them to spread, and perfect and cultivate the saints
The Lord will bless and propagate His work, so the churches need to receive this burden and give one-tenth of their offerings
The general business office of the church in Taipei can open an account to take care of the offerings from the churches
The work in Hong Kong began in 1937 when Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi was led by the Lord and confirmed by the work to begin the work there
In the spring of 1950 Brother Nee visited Hong Kong from mainland China for the last time and brought a revival to the church in Hong Kong
From 1956 to 1958 one of the elders there was dissenting concerning the leading in the work; he desired to take another way
When the problem in Taiwan broke out, this brother spoke with the dissenting brothers in Taiwan and supported them
In September three brothers returned to Hong Kong, and the dissenting brother was stopped from doing anything further for the time being
We must pay attention to a fundamental point in the young people's work, which is that we must bring them into working with us
A normal situation would be that many students are saved, but no co-worker has ever entered the gate of the school
We need to be aggressive and learn how to preach the gospel in a school without ever setting foot in the school
A brother serving with the young people in a locality should find out if there are any brothers or sisters in his target school
Only when the service is in the hands of the saints, and they are asking a co-worker for help to carry out a service, is it a success
The practical way is to labor and gain one person, working on him until he is burdened to preach the gospel in his school
A co-worker who goes to a school in order to preach the gospel will accomplish little, because when he leaves the school, the work will end
If a co-worker can serve according to this fellowship, the work will continue after he leaves, because it is borne by the students
No matter where we are, we will succeed in every situation, and we will gain double the result with half the effort
Perhaps a co-worker serves with a group of at least ten young saints who do not know how to meet when they come together
He should be so burdened for the gospel that even if the director of his school opposes Christ, he would find a way to preach the gospel
Our work is a success if we do not go to a school and ask the director for a room in order for the young saints to meet
If the co-workers grasp this principle and practice it diligently, they will succeed and the work will be light
There will be a work in the universities a work in the junior high schools a work in the high schools and a work in the vocational schools
The saints in the district labor to cook meals and spend time with the students, and all they receive is criticism'
A person may put a cup of hot water in the refrigerator in order to keep the water fresh, but this also causes the water to cool down
Your intention is not for the students to cool down, but because you do not understand their situation or circumstances, they become cold
Those serving with the young people should be cautious; that is, they should be sober and consider the situation thoroughly
If the coordination from a district is appropriate it will be beneficial but if the coordination is inappropriate it will become a hindrance
One thing that is definitely helpful is to have a place for hospitality, that is, a brothers' house or a sisters' house
Such a place does not require much effort and will not compromise the effect of the work, because the young people do the work
If it were not for the young people's work, the testimony of the church might have been lost during the turmoil
The elders were willing to support the work financially, but those who bore the responsibility of the young people's work turned them down
If the serving ones had accepted their money at the time, the young people's work would have been affected when the turmoil came
Although the church can rise up and care for a burden, we do not need an arrangement; rather, we need to learn the lesson of faith
If the church does not pick up the burden, the Lord has other ways; He is living, and He cares for the needs of His children
The students who attend night school can have a meeting during the day, and other students can have a meeting at night
If the students feel to serve on the campus of National Taiwan University, they should have the freedom to do so
Whether the result of our service is manifested in a school or in a district does not matter, because the result belongs to the church
The serving ones from different areas of the work can fellowship without prejudice concerning the service of a student
We must also work with the elementary school students, because they will be gospel seeds in junior high school, high school, and college
When we gain the young people as gospel seeds, the work will multiply and increase in every level of education
We should help young people understand that spending a great amount of time to study does not necessarily increase one's learning
Often those who regularly attend the meetings succeed in their studies because the meetings become their relaxation
The young people must understand that spending a large amount of time studying does not necessarily mean that they will study effectively
Perhaps a young person would gather five or six friends and have a meeting and then gather five or six more for another meeting
In Matthew 25:24 the Lord is portrayed as a hard man, reaping where he did not sow, and gathering where he did not winnow
We do not fear the difficult environment because the more difficult the environment, the more effective the work
If a surface needs to be elevated, it will be filled in, and if a road needs to be made straight, it will be straightened
Especially those who are involved with the young people's work need such a spirit, because the young ones can be very active
If we continually have elders' meetings and nucleus meetings but are unable to enliven all the saints, we will achieve nothing
By the Lord's mercy, none of my messages, especially those given in the United States, are old; instead, every message is new
In order to coordinate with me, he prepared many books concerning edification of new believers and basic practices of a Christian
The preciousness of Andrew Murray's The Spirit of Christ lies in its being very practical, not merely doctrinal
Some believers criticized our translation and said that it was difficult to read, even though the translation matched the original text
The vocabulary and the phrases used by the author are understandable, being neither too difficult nor too deep
We are the ones who will suffer loss if we think that this book is too difficult to read and therefore do not read it
Those who desire to carry out a work at a school must first enliven a saint who is either a teacher or a student in the school
The co-workers must work until the young saints are enlivened so that they can do the gospel work in their schools
In particular, the elders should grow in life so that they may supply life to the saints so that the saints also can grow in life
They can pursue the Word and grow in life, and at the same time they can bear the responsibility of shepherding and feeding
In order for our church life to have content, we need three things: healthy words, growth in life, and shepherding
From this time forward, the elders and serving ones in every local church must spend adequate time to be filled with healthy words
As long as we are willing to spend time to digest these books, we will produce 'milk' and become 'nursing mothers' to feed the saints
We may also use books concerning crucial truths in the Bible, edification of new believers, and basic training
If a father and the older siblings do all the work in a family, the generation that comes after them will follow their pattern
If the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones will go elsewhere and meet, they will give other saints the opportunity to serve
Even in a family, when the parents and older siblings are not present, the younger siblings take care of everything
The elders should not make any arrangements but let the saints take care of everything and see what the results will be
They should not touch the saints who meet regularly but focus on visiting the saints who have not been meeting
If we would practice this for one or two years, there would be four to five hundred more saints in the meetings
A district with four to five hundred saints can be formed into ten groups, and these groups should go out for the gospel
We do not bring the saints into function, because we unconsciously think that they are limited in their capacity but that we are not
The elders should be aware of the saints who have not been meeting for a long time and welcome them when they come to a meeting
The elders should be aware of their own growth in life of the growth in life of the saints and of the growth in life of the responsible ones
The elders must first learn the lessons of life, and then spontaneously and automatically they will fellowship concerning life
If a responsible one is not doing well, the elders should fellowship with him and supply life for his progress
Both the co-workers and the elders must be desperate to study the word so that they can minister a word of life
Every week the elders and co-workers must supply the saints with the word so that the church can develop and be full of content
In addition the churches are not developing because the elders have not handed the services over to the saints and the work is not advancing
If they cannot help the saints to grow in life or supply the saints with the word, what else can the co-workers do?
The saints do not need help with the service; the co-workers do not need to be involved with the services in the churches
Even if there are more regular services, such as ushering during the meetings, the co-workers do not need to be involved with the services
We do not need to give useless messages; we should not speak on loving God today and denying the self tomorrow based on whims
If a certain district has four full-time brothers who neither supply life nor minister the word, the brothers are not doing a proper work
Only when we change our concept, our disposition, our way of doing things, and our system will we be delivered
No matter how much more we do, we can only maintain our situation, because we do not bring the saints into function
Some saints are unwilling to come to the meetings, but if we change the way we do things, they will have a desire to come to the meetings
The elders have spent enough time in the affairs of the church, but the saints are neither being supplied nor educated
The co-workers, elders, and responsible ones should not try to do everything but rather should bring the saints into function
When the church in Los Angeles received more than one hundred visiting saints, four brothers were responsible for serving meals
In order for the word to come forth, there cannot be only a few saints functioning; all the saints need to function
Unless we change our disposition and our practice we will have no way to go on and no way to spread we will remain in our current situation
We should never think that only certain qualified saints can be involved with the gospel and that only a handful are capable
If the Lord gives a brother the burden to lead a few junior high students, he should pray for them desperately until they are burning
As a result, each of the students will bring at least one classmate to salvation, and there will be a hundredfold increase
They can be likened to someone who has been studying for many years and yet has not graduated from elementary school
The co-workers and elders consider the saints and feel that no one is capable; therefore, they do everything themselves
Whether in meal service or giving hospitality, the saints take care of everything without being instructed by the elders
When we begin to serve in this way, some saints may oppose us, but we should not stop out of a desire to avoid making mistakes
If they truly had worked in the principle of 'Christ is everything,' there would have been no need for slogans
There has never been the feeling that some co-workers belong to this region of the work, and others belong to another region of the work
If a co-worker wants to serve in a university where there are no saints, he should pray earnestly until there is at least one student there
If there are already several saints on campus, he should find them, fellowship with them, and bring them into function
To use a military example, he should supply them with ammunition, teach them how to shoot, and identify a strategic plan for them
From now on the affairs of the church should be turned over to the saints; the affairs of the church should be under their care
The co-workers and elders should just oversee the services, rendering appropriate adjustment and encouragement
They should not minister doctrine but should make an effort to use appropriate material and learn to give a message
The meetings of the church are the meetings of the saints; hence, the elders and co-workers should not lead the meetings
The elders should also endeavor to utilize more of their time for shepherding and less time for church affairs
Since the affairs of the church have been handed over to the saints, the elders should let the saints be responsible
The elders should take care of shepherding and deal only with crucial matters, leaving the ordinary affairs to the saints
The elders should turn over the responsibility of a certain service to two or three saints who can train and instruct other saints
We should not be rigid in forming small groups by assigning someone to be responsible or someone to take the lead
We should let the saints endeavor to look for backslidden saints and to preach the gospel and bring in new ones
The elders need only to oversee from a distance and render appropriate correction, guidance, and encouragement when needed
Not only should the saints do things, but they should take up the burden and the responsibility for the things that they do
When a co-worker goes to serve in a locality, he wants the elders and the saints to hand everything over to him
The co-workers serve in a way that causes everyone else to become 'unemployed' because they must be directed by the co-workers
All the brothers and sisters who serve together are co-workers, but this does not mean that they can take the lead in the work
If the co-workers want to be useful in the Lord's hand, they must adapt to their environment and not expect the environment to adapt to them
Some brothers said that there are many capable saints in the church in Los Angeles and that the serving ones there are also capable
The truth is that the saints who are brought into function become capable, but those who are not brought into function remain limited
In the past we have said that the co-workers should be accommodating of others to the point that they are like glue
The coworkers have no alternative but to be like glue which can be applied to any surface in any condition even if the surface looks messy
When the co-workers serve, they must adapt to their environment and not expect the environment to adapt to them
The usefulness of a co-worker will be very limited unless his concept is changed, no matter whether he is abroad or in his own country
The first kind of elder is elders in position only; they are limited by both their time and the extent of their burden
The third kind of elders is the elders who are capable and willing to do things they give their energy their time and their all to the Lord
The affairs of the church should be entrusted to the saints, and the elders should oversee, instruct, enlighten, and lead the saints
They are unwilling to stir up trouble, and they are reserved and unwilling to voice their opinions when the elders are restrictive
The first thing a co-worker must observe in a locality is whether the elders function as elders and the deacons function as deacons
If there is not a proper functioning among the elders and deacons, a co-worker should find ways to help establish the services of the church
It may take a month for an area of service to be established and then another month for another area to be established
Have you ever seen a mason, as he is building a house, build himself into a pillar and become a pillar in the house?
Some co-workers in the local church serve to the extent that they cannot leave that church; they cannot be moved
As a result of their lack of service, the brothers in one locality do not even know to purchase train tickets for visitors
With such a solid and strong structure, the pillars will be able to stand, even when the co-worker leaves to do other work
He should not give the saints the feeling that he is upholding the church in a locality, as if he were a big pillar
The saints must be the pillars in a locality, and a co-worker should go there only to support the saints on a temporary basis
No matter what the circumstance is, the elders in a locality must accomplish some things, and they should delegate things to the deacons
Although some saints love the Lord, they have little growth in life and limited experience and knowledge of Christ
If most of the saints in a locality are progressing, the elder should not give ordinary messages or do an ordinary work
It is not fitting for them to say this; it is also not fitting for someone to say that he does not have the gift of eating
He may observe that the saints love the Lord, attend the meetings regularly, and tithe, but they do not have a good foundation in life
They have been regenerated, but they do not have sufficient knowledge concerning regeneration and do not know the experience of regeneration
If they were willing to spend time, make an effort, and diligently endeavor before the Lord, they would have a living word
The building up of the church services; second, the growth in life of the saints; and third, the supply of the word
Formerly, both the co-workers and the elders kept the services in their hands and were unwilling to hand them over to the saints
Our watching is not with a hope that the things would return to us, and we do not focus on mistakes that the saints might make
When we hand a certain matter over to a brother, we should watch him as if we were sitting next to him and teaching him to drive a car
Some co-workers seem very capable in the work, but their service is superficial; it is a work without the element of life
If a co-worker gives messages full of the divine life, this life will continue to operate in the saints even after he leaves
In other localities many things are blocked, and nothing is accomplished because the elders control the saints
Whenever there is something that needs to be done, we should hand the responsibility over to the saints and let them take care of it
The saints who meet regularly do not exercise their function, we do not help them grow in life, and we do not supply them with the word
Whether the message is simple or deep, we should always give a word that causes the saints to be enlivened, fed, and satisfied
The churches have been here for more than twenty years, and some elders and responsible ones are getting older
It is not sufficient for the elders and co-workers to ask the saints to pray, pray-read, and release the spirit in the meetings
Unless the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones have a fundamental change in life, any method will merely be superficial
We need to be regulated while we are being trained, but we should be living and not rigid in our practical application
Since we love the Lord and are willing to serve Him full time, we must have a heart for the work and not turn to the world
According to our present situation, twelve brothers will go overseas for at least two to three months every year
While they are abroad, their ability to supply the word will increase, and the propagation of the work will also increase
Whenever there is an opportunity, the co-workers should go abroad to serve for a period of time and then return
They should endeavor to help the place that they visit and to bring back something new, thus having a kind of fellowship
In short, there should be much fellowship among the saints from all over the world, either by their coming here or our going to visit them
We visited a few churches that were established by migration and saw that the Lord has blessed many aspects of the church life
