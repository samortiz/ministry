<p>We have seen the assurance of our salvation, that is, how we know that we are saved. We have also seen the security of our salvation, that is, how we can never lose our salvation. But is that sufficient? Unfortunately, many Christians are content to go only this far&mdash;<em>having</em> salvation, but having little joy or <em>enjoyment</em> of that salvation.</p>
<p>Our friend with millions in the bank may have the <em>assurance</em> that he is rich, and he may have the <em>security</em> of knowing that his deposit is safe. But if he never spends a dime and is content to live a pauper&rsquo;s life, we can hardly say he has the <em>enjoyment</em> of those riches. Objectively speaking he is rich, but in his practical experience he has nothing.</p>
<p>This is the condition of many Christians today. They are saved, but in their daily life they have little experience of the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). However, God&rsquo;s intention is that we not only have Christ, but that we enjoy Him, even to the uttermost (John 10:10; Phil. 4:4). The normal condition of a Christian is to &ldquo;exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:8).</p>
<p>But nearly all of us will admit that there are times, even many times, when we do not have this overflowing joy. Does this mean that we have lost our salvation? Absolutely not! Our salvation is based upon God, not upon us. But although we cannot lose our salvation, we can lose the joy of that salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Loss of Joy</h2>
<p>What are the things, then, that cause us to sometimes lose our joy? The first item is sin. Joy depends on our having unbroken fellowship with God, but sin separates us from Him and causes Him to hide His face (Isa. 59:1-2).</p>
<p>The second item is grieving the Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:30). When we are saved, we become God&rsquo;s temple and have His Spirit indwelling us (1 Cor. 6:17, 19; Rom. 8:9, 11, 16). This Spirit within is not a &ldquo;force&rdquo; or a &ldquo;thing,&rdquo; but a living person, Jesus Christ Himself (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17; 13:5). Like every living person, He has feelings and attitudes. Thus, when we speak or do things contrary to Him, He is grieved within us. When the Holy Spirit is grieved, our spirit, which is joined to Him (1 Cor. 6:17), is grieved, and we lose our joy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Maintenance of Joy</h2>
<p>Our salvation is like a rock, immovable, but the joy of our salvation is like a delicate flower, easily upset by a little breeze. Therefore, it is something we must cultivate and nourish. What, then, can we do to maintain this joy?</p>
<p>First, we can confess our sins (1 John 1:7, 9). When we confess our offenses to the Lord, His blood cleanses us, and our fellowship with Him is restored. After David sinned, he prayed, &ldquo;Restore to me the gladness of Your salvation&rdquo; (Psa. 51:12). There is no need to wait. The precious blood of Christ cleanses us from every sin.</p>
<p>Second, we can take God&rsquo;s Word as our food. Jeremiah said, &ldquo;Your words were found and I ate them, and Your word became to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart&rdquo; (Jer. 15:16). Often we discover that after reading and praying over God&rsquo;s Word, our heart is bubbling over with enjoyment. No famished man is happy. Likewise, we should not remain famished Christians. We should continually feed and feast on God&rsquo;s Word (Matt. 4:4).</p>
<p>Third, we can pray. Often after opening our heart and speaking out to the Lord, we sense a deep joy and refreshment. Isaiah 56:7 says He will cause us to rejoice in His house of prayer. Real prayer is not the recitation of familiar words and phrases&mdash; it is a pouring out of our heart and spirit to the Lord. Jesus said, &ldquo;Ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full&rdquo; (John 16:24). Real prayer is releasing and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Finally, we can fellowship. The greatest enjoyment for a Christian is to be together with others who love and enjoy Christ. No human words can utter the sweetness we experience when we praise Him and speak about Him together. First John 1:3-4 says, &ldquo;That you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. And these things we write that our joy may be made full.&rdquo; Real fellowship is not a duty, but an enjoyment&mdash;the greatest joy on earth.</p>
<p>Thus, we have the assurance, the security, and the joy of our salvation. Praise Him for such a full salvation!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
