   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO HOW TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN A PRACTICAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FEEDING ON CHRIST AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>DRINKING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:22-24; Col 1:18-19; 2:2-3, 9; Eph 3:8; Gal 1:16; 2:20; 4:29; Eph 3:17; Phil 1:20-21; 1 Cor 2:16; Matt 16:24-25; Rom 12:2; John 6:57</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous chapter, we fellowshipped concerning Christ being everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, we learned that when we realize the glorious fact that we are in Christ and Christ is in us, we will automatically be normal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter, I feel burdened to fellowship more concerning this Christ who is in us and in whom we are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we know that Christ is life and everything to us, we have to know more particularly who Christ is and how we can experience Him practically.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AND THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Colossians 2:9 says, For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can explain what the fullness of the Godhead is in a very simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is love, so love is an item of the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is also light; thus, light is an item of the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, God is power and life, so power and life are items of the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, because God is holiness and righteousness, these also are items of the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This fullness the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, because everything of God is in Christ, Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is impossible to experience God without Christ; outside of Christ, we can never contact God in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything that God has and is dwells in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only so, from Colossians 1:18-19 we also know that God s desire, intention, and eternal plan is to give the first place to Christ in everything because God s pleasure is to have all His fullness dwell in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ must have the first place, that is, the preeminence, in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In God s heart, mind, desire, intention, and eternal plan, there is nothing but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God put everything of Himself into Christ, made Christ everything in His purpose, and gave Him the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a Christ is surely beyond our imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the apostle Paul told us that what he preached was the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The riches of Christ are unsearchable; that is, they are endless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the Christ in whom we are and who is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>KNOWING AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AS FOOD AND DRINK</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although it may be easy to understand such a Christ and to speak of the unsearchable riches of Christ doctrinally, it is difficult to experience Him in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Practically speaking, what aspects of Christ have we experienced?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is one thing to say that Christ is unsearchably rich; it is quite another to actually experience this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I once counted two hundred seventy-seven aspects of Christ in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to experience Christ in each of these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in particular, we need to practically experience Christ as two things food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is the bread of life and the living water John 6:35; 7:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In John 6:57 the Lord said to His disciples, As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me. It is not enough for us to simply realize that Christ is food to us; we have to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must not only realize that He is the living water to us; we must drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord emphasizes in this verse that we must actually eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Frequently, I want to ask the young people, How much have you enjoyed Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Did you feed on Him?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Did you drink of Him?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not say that Christ is food and drink to us and yet not practically enjoy Him daily as such.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have found that many people do not know how to feed on Christ and drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They know that Christ is food and drink to them, and they know that they are in Christ and that Christ is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, they know neither how to feed on Christ nor how to drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They know so much, but they cannot bring their knowledge into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to know how to enjoy and experience Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is food and drink to us, and we must know how to eat and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God s eternal desire is that He would mingle Himself with us to make each of us a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s intention is to make each of us not merely a man of God but a God-man a man who is mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can illustrate very simply how God can be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order for anything to be mingled with us, it has to be eaten by us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we eat something, that thing mingles with us and becomes our element and a part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When a typical American man is fully grown, he may weigh two hundred pounds and stand over six feet tall.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The way that this man becomes so big is by eating the produce of America over the course of many years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After eating the meats, fruits, and vegetables of America, he is, in a strict sense, a constitution of American food.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because this man has eaten and digested this food, it is mingled with him and has become his element.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have an imbalanced idea of what God is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We frequently think that God is high, great, and far from us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our idea is that we must bow down and prostrate ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a mistaken concept.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Scriptures tell us clearly that immediately after God created man, He presented Himself to man in the form of the tree of life Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God came to man as the tree of life not to be outwardly worshipped by man but to be eaten by man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One day God came to this world in the form of a man John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When He was on the earth, a woman addressed Him as Lord, Son of David Matt 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord responded by telling her that He was the children s bread v. 26 . Although the woman called Him Lord, Son of David, He identified Himself as bread.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the Gospel of John, Christ is God incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yet He told us that He is the bread of life for us to eat and the living water for us to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>According to our concept, God is mighty, glorious, great, and very far from us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, God s intention and desire is that He would be food that we would take and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The more we eat Him, the more pleased He will be.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The best worship, the real worship, and the worship that the Father seeks is our enjoying God cf.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>4:14, 23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God s eternal intention is to make Himself food to us so that He can be eaten and digested by us and thereby be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God is in Christ Col 2:9 , who is our true food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everything of God is in Christ, Christ is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 , and now the Spirit is in us.</S>
