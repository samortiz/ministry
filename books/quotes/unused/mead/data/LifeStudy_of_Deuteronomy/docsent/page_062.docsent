   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Remembering the Need</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of a Sojourner, an Orphan, or a Widow</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 24:17-22 we see that the children of Israel were to remember the need of a sojourner, an orphan, or a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the children of Israel were not only to give to aid the needy ones but were also to remember their need.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of waiting for the needy ones to come to them, they were to remember them and then do something for them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>a. The Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not to Distort Justice Due a Sojourner</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>or an Orphan, or to Take a Widow's Garment as a Pledge</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The children of Israel were not to distort justice due a sojourner or an orphan, nor were they to take a widow's garment as a pledge v. 17 . They were to remember that they were slaves in Egypt and that Jehovah their God had ransomed them from there v. 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not Turning Back to Gather</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>a Forgotten Sheaf in the Field but Leaving</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It for the Sojourner, the Orphan, and the Widow</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the children of Israel reaped their harvest in their field and they forgot a sheaf in the field, they were not to turn back to gather it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This sheaf was to be for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow, in order that Jehovah their God might bless them in all their undertakings v. 19 . What was left in the field was to be God's harvest for the poor ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the one who reaped the harvest did not turn back to gather the forgotten sheaf but left it for the poor, this would give God an opportunity to bless this one in all his undertakings, that is, in all his business.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Beating Down the Fruit of Their Olive Tree</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>and Not Going over the Boughs Afterwards</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the children of Israel beat down the fruit of their olive tree, they were not to go over the boughs afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The olives that remained on the tree were to be for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Cutting the Grapes from Their Vineyard</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and Not Gleaning Afterwards</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the children of Israel cut the grapes from their vineyard, they were not to glean afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The remaining grapes were to be for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow v. 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After giving this statute, the Lord said, "You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing" v. 22 . For the people not to glean after cutting the grapes from their vineyard was for them to remember that they were slaves in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were to have such a remembrance and leave some grapes in the vineyard for the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose the owner of a vineyard, knowing that he was not allowed to glean after cutting the grapes, decided to be very careful and strict in cutting the grapes, trying not to leave any clusters of grapes behind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The one who was so strict would have been dealt with strictly by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God would have withdrawn His blessing from the work of such a strict one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the end of the year, he would not have much profit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the one who was not strict in cutting the grapes but left clusters for the needy ones would be blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the end of the year, he might be surprised to see that, because of God's blessing, his profit greatly exceeded his expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The statutes and judgments concerning aid to the needy indicate that God is living and real.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In all that we do in the matters of lending and harvesting, we should remember God's need with respect to the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we remember this need, then secretly God will remember us and bless us in all our undertakings, in all our business.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all have to believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we are doing our business, we should remember the needy ones among God's children and have a heart toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have a heart to care for the needy ones, spontaneously we will set aside a portion for them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God will see this and He will be happy about it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then, in a secret way, He will come in to bless our work or business.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only will we be blessed, but the body of God's people will be under His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result, instead of scarcity, there will constantly be surplus upon surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This continual surplus will show forth the riches of God.</S>
