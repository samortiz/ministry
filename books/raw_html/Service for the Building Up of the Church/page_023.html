        <h2 class="head2">Negligence in the Principle<br />
of God Being Mingled with Man<br />
Leading to Problems<br />
in the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>Some may ask why we are speaking of the principle of God being mingled with man in relation to the church. The main reason is that this principle eliminates many problems. I know of a group of brothers who pursued spirituality to such an extent that they acted as if their humanity was annulled. They were very earnest in seeking the Lord, and they loved the Lord very much. However, they encouraged people to be spiritual to the extent that they despised what was human. If they saw someone behaving as a normal human being, they would despise him and speak of him as being in the flesh or even devilish. I must admit that their love for the Lord was genuine and that they pursued the Lord, but their idea of spirituality resulted in a grave mistake of neglecting the principle of the building up, which is the principle of God being mingled with man.</p>
<p>We should never think that annulling our humanity is the way to be spiritual or to be the church. The mingling of God with man does not make us spiritual by annulling our humanity. I hope that all God&rsquo;s children will see this basic principle: the church is a hybrid of God mingled with man. Without divinity there is no church, but without humanity there also is no church.</p>
<p>The problem with the group of brothers who pursued so-called spirituality is that they tried to completely annul their humanity. When they spoke of having no use for humanity and of humanity having no ground before God, I thought, &ldquo;This speaking does not make sense. If there is no use for our humanity and no ground for our humanity before God, why are you speaking? You should let God do the speaking. How can you explain the Bible if you have not been educated? You can explain the Bible because you have gone to school and received a human education. How can you say that there is no use for humanity and no ground for humanity?&rdquo; The church does not annul our humanity.</p>
<p>In contrast to these brothers, there are also groups who pay attention only to human factors. Such ones say that everything is up to man and depends on man; as a result, they put God aside. Although they acknowledge God and worship God, they limit God to the heavens. They say that God remains in heaven and does not involve Himself with human affairs. They also think that in order to live in the twentieth century, we must be modern and up to date with the trends of this age. This poses a problem in the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
TO BRING GOD INTO MAN AND MAN INTO GOD</h2>
<p>If we want to build up the church, we must see this principle: the church is a hybrid produced through the mingling of God and man, man and God. The basic work of the church is to open a way for God to enter into man. It also brings man into God in all things so that man can grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. The more our service causes the mingled element of God and man to increase, the more the church will be built up. If our service results in people focusing on annulling their humanity in order to be spiritual, we will tear down the church instead of building it up. However, if we lead people to focus on humanity and put God&rsquo;s divinity aside, separating the two elements, we will also tear down the church instead of building it up. The basic principle in the building up of the church is to bring God into man and to bring man into God.</p>
<p>Whether we are giving a message, administrating in the church, visiting people, fellowshipping with others, or functioning in the meetings, we must grasp this principle. When we are about to pray, we should check with ourselves to see whether our prayers are coming out of God being mingled with us. This is a big matter. Although we want to render help to the saints with families, how do we teach them? If we tell them to pay attention to being spiritual while annulling their humanity, there will be problems in their family life. However, if we put aside the divine life and teach them only about being a husband and a wife, there will also be problems. Hence, in everything, whether in the church, in our homes, or in our personal life, we must grasp the principle of God being mingled with man so that God can have a way to enter into man and so that man can be brought into God.</p>
<p>The main reason there are so many divisions in the church today is that the principle of God being mingled with man has been lost. If God&rsquo;s children would keep this principle, I believe that there would be oneness in the church. When we ignore this principle, we tear down the church and damage the church, and the church becomes divided. The only way to build up the church today is to build according to the principle of God being mingled with man. In everything we must give God the way to enter into us and to bring us into God. I hope that we are all deeply impressed with this principle and will apply it in our service practically.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
