<h1 class="title">THE EXCELLENT WAY TO EXERCISE GIFTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:31; 13:1-8, 13; 14:1</h1>
<p>First Corinthians 12:31 through 14:1 speaks of love. These chapters are closely related, because the Bible was not initially divided into chapters or verses. Chapter 12 speaks of various gifts and how to exercise them. Chapter 14 speaks of the most profitable gift for the church, which is to prophesy, to speak for the Lord. But in between these two chapters, chapter 13 speaks of the excellent way to exercise the gifts, that is, of the manner in which these gifts should be exercised.</p>
<p>In verse 31 of chapter 12 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I show to you a most excellent way.&rdquo; The word <em>way</em> can also be rendered &ldquo;manner.&rdquo; This word has two meanings in Greek: &ldquo;path&rdquo; and &ldquo;method.&rdquo; Paul speaks of love in both chapters 13 and 14. Love is the way to exercise the gifts and to build up the church, and it is also the manner in which the gifts are exercised. &ldquo;If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries...but do not have love, I am nothing&rdquo; (13:1-2). This means that if we do not have love, our gifts are useless. The gifts must be exercised in love in order for there to be true function. Love is the only way and the only manner in which to exercise the gifts.</p>
<p>After defining love in chapter 13, the apostle says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts&rdquo; (14:1). <em>Love</em> in this verse is not something innate; it is something that needs to be pursued. We need to pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts. In other words, gifts function in coordination with love. Spiritual gifts are useless without love, and love by itself falls short. We must have spiritual gifts as well as love. Love is the most excellent way and the best manner in which to exercise the gifts. We need to hold to truth in love so that the Body may build itself up in love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TOUCHING THE AUTHORITY OF THE HEAD</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that in our service to build up the church, we must first touch the authority of the Head and then touch God&rsquo;s heart, that is, touch His love. Touching the authority of the Head will resolve most problems, because most of the problems in the church are the result of not touching the authority of the Head. For instance, spreading rumors is a particular problem in the church, and it unconsciously brings in death. Although the saints often receive a life supply in their fellowship with one another, our conversations are not free of the poison of death, which is spread through rumors. If we spread rumors loosely, we are not under the ruling of the Head and have not touched the authority of the Head. Thus, we can cause many problems in the church. Satan uses loose words to bring the poison of death into the church so that the church is not built up.</p>
<p>For example, brothers often say to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I heard that Brother So-and-so is going to a certain place to work and is preparing to stay there for three months. Is this true?&rdquo; When I ask where they heard this, they say, &ldquo;Someone told me in a letter.&rdquo; I often reply, &ldquo;If you ask Brother So-and-so, he will tell you that he does not know when he will be going or how long he will be there.&rdquo; Persons who are not under the divine ruling spread words loosely.</p>
<p>Rumors are often false, inaccurate, and unfounded. Even if the things being spoken of are accurate and true, can we say that we have the authority of the Head and the ruling of the Head to repeat such things in our speaking? If we are under the ruling of the Head, we will not speak without the permission or command of the Head. Whether or not our words are true or accurate, we would not dare to overstep the Head. Once we touch the Head, we will not have much to say. Once we touch the Head, our words will not be loose. Those who have touched the throne will not speak loosely. Not only will their words be true, correct, and accurate, but they will speak only what is permitted by the throne.</p>
<p>Many saints have a problem related to their speaking because they have never been dealt with by the Lord concerning their speaking. For instance, when a brother once told me, &ldquo;So-and-so flew to Bangkok, and So-and-so took a boat to Singapore,&rdquo; I wanted to ask him why he was telling me these things, and how these things concerned me, but I did not. Many brothers and sisters cannot keep anything to themselves; once they know something, they must tell someone.</p>
<p>We also encounter loose talking in the matter of visiting the saints. A brother once said to me, &ldquo;I just went to visit a brother, and he was quarreling with his wife!&rdquo; When I heard this, I thought, &ldquo;If you, as a visiting one, are so loose with your words, the church should not assign you to visit others.&rdquo; If a brother is quarreling with his wife when we visit him, we should bring the matter to the Lord, and the Lord&rsquo;s throne would certainly not allow us to tell others. If we talk loosely instead of giving heed to the Lord&rsquo;s ruling, we will give Satan an opportunity to work, and there will be problems. For example, if the quarreling brother&rsquo;s wife hears of this &ldquo;report,&rdquo; she will surely complain to her husband. As a result, the brother will no longer be open to the visitation of the saints. Furthermore, he will be unwilling to receive any help from us.</p>
<p>We need to be very careful concerning our speaking. If we touch the throne and are ruled by the Lord, we will not be able to tell others about a brother losing his temper, and we will not even tell our own wives. This is not a matter of regulation; it concerns the throne.</p>
<p>Loose speaking is often the cause of conflicts and problems in the church. We might not have an intention when we say things, but others may listen with an intention. A little word can poison a brother with death. If we are not under the ruling of the throne, we will have many problems. If we serve in the church for many years, we will contact one another frequently. In order to avoid problems among us, our speaking must be ruled. This is not a regulation. It would be useless to put up a sign that says, &ldquo;Do not speak loosely.&rdquo; This is altogether a matter of accepting the ruling of the throne.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:15 says, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; Some translations render this verse as a reference to speaking. For example, the Chinese Union Version says, &ldquo;Speaking a truthful word with love.&rdquo; This translation makes some sense because the words <em>all things</em> in this verse certainly include the matter of speaking. In order to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things, we should grow in our speaking. If we accept the ruling of the Head in other matters, we should accept it with regard to our speaking.</p>
<p>Hence, we must touch the throne for the service that builds up the church. The throne will rule over us and terminate the elements of the old creation in us. Stones must first be cleaned before they can be used in making reinforced concrete. If dirty stones are mixed into the cement, the reinforced concrete will not be firm or solid. In the church we are stones. Christ&rsquo;s life can be compared to cement, and the Holy Spirit can be compared to water. In order for us to be fitly joined together, the dirt and dust must first be washed off of us. This washing is not accomplished by the redemptive effect of the precious blood; it is related to the ruling of the throne. When we are ruled by the throne, we are purified experientially. There are certain things that I cannot do and certain things that I cannot say because of the throne. The throne also prohibits me from having certain attitudes and certain thoughts. If we live under the ruling of the throne, God will purify us in our experience.</p>
<p>The most important issue of touching the authority of the Head is that we know our place in the Body. This is important. If we touch the throne and live under the ruling of the throne, we will be fitly joined and firmly knit together, and the church will be built up.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Service for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
