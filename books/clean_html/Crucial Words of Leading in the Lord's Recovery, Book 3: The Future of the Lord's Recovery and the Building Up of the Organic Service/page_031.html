<h2 class="head2">Some Important Terms in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<p>In addition to studying the Life-study messages and the basic truths, we must study some important terms in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God</h2>
<p>We must study God; that means we must study the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;Jehovah God. This topic is great. For the past twenty centuries no one has studied the Triune God as thoroughly as we have. We have expounded almost every verse in every chapter in the Scriptures that refers to the Triune God&mdash;to the Father, to the Son, and to the Spirit. Some of us may have been in Christianity for many years without ever hearing that when the Lord Jesus came to the earth, He came with the Father. When I was a young person in Christianity, I heard only how God so loved the world that He sent His Son to the earth but that God remained in heaven on His throne. If we were to ask the theologians in Christianity, I am afraid that they would say the same thing. After spending much time to study this matter, I can say that in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus repeatedly said that He came from the Father and with the Father (7:29; 8:29). When the Lord Jesus came, He was the Son of God, who was sent by God and who came from God; however, He also brought the sending Father with Him. Hence, in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus repeatedly said that the Father was with Him and that the Father never left Him (v. 29; 16:32). John 14 records how Philip asked the Lord to show the Father to the disciples, and the Lord Jesus said to Philip, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?&rdquo; (vv. 9-10).</p>
<p>In verse 10 the word <em>in</em> is not merely to be &ldquo;with&rdquo;; rather, it is to be &ldquo;within.&rdquo; For example, if a brother is with me from morning to evening, we are with one another. However, I cannot enter into him, nor can he enter into me; we cannot be within one another. But the Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son (10:38). No one can describe this type of being &ldquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some people may ask whether this means that the two are one. Yes, They are one, but They are also two. Modalism annuls the distinction between the Father and the Son by saying that the Father and the Son are one entity. However, scriptural theology teaches that the Father and the Son are one by the Son being in the Father and the Father being in the Son, yet the two are clearly distinct. This is a mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ</h2>
<p>We must know Christ. If we would know Christ, we should know that Christ is all-inclusive. In the table of contents of our hymnal, under the category &ldquo;Praise of the Lord&rdquo; there is a sub-category &ldquo;His All-inclusiveness.&rdquo; We need to know Christ not only in His love, His grace, His light, and His power; we should also know His all-inclusiveness and His unlimitedness. Even if we were to give ten million messages on the riches of Christ, we would not be able to exhaust the riches of Christ. We must pursue to know Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit</h2>
<p>We need to know the Spirit. For two thousand years, almost nothing has been spoken in Christianity concerning the seven Spirits, but the last book of the Bible refers specifically to the seven Spirits. Matthew 28:19 says, &ldquo;Go...baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Then Revelation 1:4-5 says, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.&rdquo; Did you hear about the seven Spirits when you were in the denominations or in the Catholic Church? Did you ever see a book on the seven Spirits? The creed that was instituted by the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325 is incomplete because it does not reflect the book of Revelation; it does not mention the seven Spirits. We must study the items concerning the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Believers</h2>
<p>We must study the believers. The believers are the saved ones. We must study about ourselves to see what we are. We know that we are saved, but what are we? Those who are not saved do not know what Christians or believers are, and even the believers do not know what they themselves are. Thus, we must read through the New Testament to study ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Church, the Kingdom, and<br />
the New Heaven and the New Earth</h2>
<p>We must study the church, and we must study the kingdom, which is the coming millennial kingdom. Moreover, we must study the new heaven and the new earth, in which is the New Jerusalem. These are the important terms in the Bible: <em>God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom,</em> and <em>the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</em> We must thoroughly study all of these items.</p>
<p>Three treasures we possess are the Life-studies, our theology from creation to the New Jerusalem, and the important terms in the Bible&mdash;<em>God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom,</em> and <em>the new heaven and the new earth.</em> If we spend time to study these treasures, we will definitely receive a good foundation in the truth.</p>
