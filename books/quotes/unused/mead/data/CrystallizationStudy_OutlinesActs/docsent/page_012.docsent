   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul s fourth ministry journey Acts 27 28 shows in a particular way his life of living Christ, magnifying Christ, doing all things in Christ, and pursuing Christ in order to be found in Christ Phil 1:19-21a; 3:8-9, 14; 4:13 : All during the apostle s long and unfortunate imprisonment-voyage, the Lord kept the apostle in His ascendancy and enabled him to live a life far beyond the realm of anxiety; this life was fully dignified, with the highest standard of human virtues expressing the most excellent divine attributes vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>5-9.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was Jesus living again on the earth in His divinely enriched humanity!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was the wonderful, excellent, and mysterious God-man, who lived in the Gospels, continuing to live in the Acts through one of His many members!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was a living witness of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and God-exalted Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Paul s living and ministry he expressed the very true God, who in Jesus Christ had gone through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, and who, as the all-inclusive Spirit, was then living in him and through him Gal 1:15-16, 24; 2:20; 3:14; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 28:6.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the sea in the storm, the Lord had made the apostle not only the owner of his fellow voyagers 27:24 but also their life-guarantor and comforter vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>22, 25 ; now, on the land in peace, the Lord made him furthermore not only a magical attraction in the eyes of the superstitious people 28:1-6 but also a healer and a joy to them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The warm welcome that Paul received from the brothers in Rome and the loving care of those in Puteoli vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>13-15 show the beautiful Body life that existed in the early days among the churches and apostles: Apparently, the apostle, as a prisoner in bonds, had entered the region of the dark capital of the Satan-usurped empire; actually, as the ambassador of Christ with His authority Eph 6:20; Matt 28:18-19 , he had come into another part of the participation in the Body life of Christ s church in the kingdom of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While he was suffering the persecution of religion in the empire of Satan the satanic chaos in the old creation , he was enjoying the church life in the kingdom of God the divine economy for the new creation ; this was a comfort and an encouragement to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The continuation of the book of Acts is the corporate continuation of Christ with the corporate living of the perfected God-men as the reality of the Body of Christ 28:31; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 5:17: The book of Acts was actually not ended but left open that more may be added; the reason for this must have been that the work of the Holy Spirit in preaching Christ for His propagation, multiplication, and spread through the believers of Christ was not yet completed and needed to be continued for a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such an evangelistic work for Christ s propagation, multiplication, and spread is according to God s New Testament economy for the producing of many sons for God Rom 8:29 that they might be the members of Christ to constitute His Body 12:5 for the carrying out of God s eternal plan and the fulfillment of His eternal will; this is revealed in detail in the twenty-one Epistles and the book of Revelation, which follow the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since God is after a corporate vessel, we must be brought into the reality of the Body of Christ and learn to live the Body life by denying our natural life; otherwise, we are useless in His hand and can never fulfill His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the four Gospels God was incarnated, passed through human living, died, and resurrected, thus completing Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 ; in the book of Acts this embodiment of God, as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , spreads Christ into His believers, working the processed Triune God into His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people to make them the constituents of the church, through which God may be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The ultimate issue of the church will be the New Jerusalem in eternity future as God s full and eternal expression, which will also be God s eternal kingdom as the sphere in which He reigns in His divine life in eternity forever and ever; this should be the reality and goal of all our gospel preaching today as we follow the pattern of the apostle Paul proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, unhindered Acts 28:31.</S>
