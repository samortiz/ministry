<P>Verse 20:"And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years approached from behind and touched the fringe of His garment." The daughter who had just died was twelve years old, and the woman here had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years. This shows that the year the daughter was born is the first year that the woman began to suffer from the hemorrhage. This signifies that when the Jews were receiving grace, the Gentiles had nothing to do with God. The woman with the hemorrhage signifies the Gentiles. A hemorrhage indicates the extermination of life. The Gentiles are like dead dogs. The daughter's death signifies the Jews' initial rejection of the Lord. Here, the Lord had no intention to heal the woman with the hemorrhage; rather, He intended to go to Jairus's house. But on the way, out of convenience, He healed the woman. This signifies that the Lord is for the Jews, but since the Jews reject Him, the Gentiles are blessed.</P><P>The resurrection of the daughter signifies the millennium; this is the grafting again of the natural branches into their own olive tree, as mentioned in Romans 11:23. In resurrecting Jairus's daughter, the Lord "took hold of her hand." This is similar to His healing of the leper by touching him. However, in the healing of the woman with a hemorrhage, it was the woman who touched the fringe of the Lord's garment; this is faith.</P><P>Verse 21:"For she said within herself, If only I touch His garment, I will be healed." Faith requires the word of God. Here, the clause "she said within herself" seems to indicate that it was a kind of psychological reaction within her. However, she did not ask the Lord to touch her, for she believed that "if only I touch His garment...." This was an indication of her faith. "Only" is a word of comparison. Perhaps she heard that Jairus had asked the Lord to lay His hand on his daughter and that the Lord was willing to go. Thus, she believed. Therefore, it was not just a guessing within her.</P><P>Verse 22: "And Jesus, turning and seeing her, said, Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you. And the woman was healed from that hour." "From that hour." These are Matthew's own words; the incident itself ends with "your faith has healed you." "Hour" refers to the time of the entire incident. The reason that the Lord told her, "Your faith has healed you," was to give her a word to prepare her to be able to resist any future temptation or attack. Here Matthew's record is again very brief. This is his characteristic.</P><P>Matthew 8—9 has a total of ten miracles. In the entire book there are sixty-five quotations from the Old Testament.</P><P>Verses 23-25:The Lord said that "the girl...is sleeping"; He did not say that all those who die are sleeping. " The crowd making a commotion." People in the world cannot render any help to the living, but they render a great deal of help to the dead. "The crowd had been put out." It seems that the Lord gave the order to put out all those who believed that the girl was dead. The dead must be shut out of the gate of life.</P><P>Verses 27-28:"Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to Him, Yes, Lord."</P><P>Verses 29-30:Here it was the opening of the eyes; later it was the opening of the mouth (v. 33). This is a picture of the millennium (Isa. 35:5-6).</P><P>Verse 31:"But they went out and spread reports about Him in all that land." The most important thing in doing spiritual work is obedience. Otherwise, we may cause damage to the Lord's work.</P><P>Verses 32-34:This shows the Jews' rejection of the Lord.</P><P>The healing of the woman with the hemorrhage and the raising up of Jairus's daughter have a doctrinal, dispensational significance. The death of the daughter signifies the death of the Jews; the healing of the hemorrhaging woman signifies the salvation of the Gentiles; and the raising up of the daughter signifies the restoration of the Jews. In the other Gospels, the emphasis of the record of these incidents is on the moral aspect. When the Jews will be willing to confess the Lord as the Son of David, the Messiah, their eyes will be opened and their mouths will speak. This also has a doctrinal significance.</P><P>Matthew 9:35—10:42 is the third minor section of the third major section. This section records the Lord's sending out of the disciples after He had been rejected.</P><P>Verse 35:"And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness." The reason for the sending out is that there were too many cities and villages. After working among the people, the Lord saw their need. Therefore, He sent forth the disciples. The gospel of the kingdom of the heavens includes the gospel of grace plus the powers of the age to come.</P><P>Verse 36:"And seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd." The Lord "was moved with compassion for them" because they were harassed and cast away. The Lord was not sympathetic toward their sins, for sins need His redemption. The Lord sympathized with their being harassed. He not only deals with sins but also shows compassion toward our distressed condition. God sent the Lord not only to be our Savior because of our sins but also to be our Shepherd, to be a Friend of sinners, because of our distress.</P><P>Verse 37:" Then He said to His disciples, The harvest is great, but the workers few." The nation of Israel as a whole rejected the Lord, but individually speaking, there were still a great number who needed reaping. The workers are those who labor and toil. Although the harvest is great, not many workers can endure the hardships in laboring and toiling.</P><P>Verse 38:" Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest." Here we see a great spiritual principle: In His heart the Lord intended to send out the disciples, yet He first would ask the disciples to beseech Him for the thrusting out of workers, and then He would carry out the sending.</P><P>The chain of prayer is as follows: (1) A certain matter is of God; (2) man prays concerning it; and (3) God works to accomplish His will. In answering prayers, God is accomplishing His own will. For that reason, Gordon Watt said that prayer is the laying of tracks for God's will to run on.</P><P>The Lord asked the disciples to beseech Him to thrust out workers. Afterward, those who were thrust out were the disciples themselves. When we pray to God for a certain matter, we ourselves must first be prepared to be willing to do it. If God cannot change those who pray, He cannot change those who are prayed for. If we ourselves are not ready to be sent by God, we should not expect God to send others.</P>
