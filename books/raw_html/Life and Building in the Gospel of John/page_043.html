        <h2 class="head1">THE LORD AS THE SON OF MAN<br />
BUILDING UP THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<p>If we only had the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 1:51, we would be able to understand that the Son of Man has made communication between heaven and earth possible and even that what is in heaven can be joined to what is on earth. However, if we compare John 1:51 with Genesis 28, we will see that something even greater and deeper is implied by this communication. According to Genesis, the communication between heaven and earth occurs at Bethel, the house of God.</p>
<p>God became a man in order to live the human life. This was God building Himself into man. Man enters into God in order to live the divine life. This is God building man into Himself. Thus, two parties, God and man, are mingled as one and built up as the house of God. This is the significance of Jacob pouring oil on the stone at Bethel. The ladder in Genesis is the Son of Man in the Gospel of John. This ladder is set up on earth and reaches into heaven so that there can be communication between heaven and earth. God can enter into man and man can enter into God because the Lord was incarnated to be the Son of Man.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is indeed a ladder. The purpose of a ladder is to go from a low place to a higher place. Formerly, heaven was heaven and earth was earth. In other words, God could not communicate with man by being joined to man. In his dream Jacob saw a ladder reaching from earth to heaven. This ladder was the means of communication between earth and heaven. He also saw angels ascending and descending on the ladder. According to this picture, what is in heaven is coming down, and what is on earth is going up. In other words, something from God is coming down to man, and something from man is going up to God. According to John 1, the Son of Man is the ladder. He is God becoming a man; the Son of God becoming the Son of Man; and as the Son of Man, He is the ladder that joins heaven and earth. Thus, God can reach man, and man can reach God. On the Son of Man there is not only coming but also going.</p>
<p>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&rdquo; The Lord is not only life but also the way. No one can come to the Father except through Him. Apart from the Lord, man cannot enter into God, nor is it possible for God to enter into man. The Lord Jesus is the way. God can reach man through Him, and man can reach God through Him. God can communicate with man through Him, and man can communicate with God through Him.</p>
<p>When God is in communication with man and man with God, God and man are built up. When God enters into man, man is built together with God. When man enters into God, God is built together with man. When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he did not mention the ladder; rather, he said, &ldquo;This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven&rdquo; (Gen. 28:17). Then he took the stone that he had used as a pillow and set it up as a pillar, poured oil on top of it, and called the name of that place Bethel, which means &ldquo;house of God&rdquo; (vv. 18-19). He called the name of that place Bethel, the house of God, and he also said that the stone upon which he had poured oil was the house of God (v. 22). The word for <em>house</em> can also be translated as &ldquo;temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stone signifies man, and oil signifies God the Spirit. The oil being poured upon the stone signifies God reaching man. This is incarnation, the Word becoming flesh (John 1:14). The Word is God, and God is Spirit (1:1; 4:24). The stone upon which the oil was poured signifies a man in whom God dwells. This means that there is communication between God and man and that God is being built into man and man is being built into God. The result of this communication is the producing of a building, the temple. God and man are built up together to become Bethel, the house of God.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John speaks of the Lamb with the dove (1:29, 32), not of religious concepts related to the Messiah, the Prophet, or a Rabbi. The Lord Jesus came as the Lamb of God with a dove in order to take away the sins of the world so that man may receive God. His purpose is to bring God into man and to build God into man so that man can enter into God and be built into God. Thus, God and man can be built together to become a temple. In this temple heaven can communicate with earth, and God is joined with man. Through this communication God and man become a mysterious building called Bethel. This is manifested in the Son of God coming to be the Son of Man.</p>
<p>The apostles also expressed this thought when they wrote the Epistles. First Peter 2:5 says that the believers are living stones that are being built up together as a spiritual house. We are stones upon which oil has been poured; we are a group of people upon whom the Spirit of God has been poured. When we are built up, we will become God&rsquo;s dwelling place. First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the house of God. The church is His dwelling place, Bethel, which is built with living stones. In Bethel heaven is open to the earth, and the earth reaches heaven. It is here that God becomes man to live the human life, and man enters into God to live the divine life. This is where the Son of God became the Son of Man, and the sons of man become the sons of God. This is also where God is being built into man, and man is being built into God. This joining, mingling, and building will continue until God and man are fully blent into one, and heaven and earth are indistinguishable. This is Jacob&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to the earth as the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world, and He also gives us the Holy Spirit (John 1:29, 32-33; 3:34). The Lord came not merely to save us from the lake of fire but to bring us into communication with God. Thus, God can live the divine life in us, and we can live the human life in Him; He can build Himself into us and build us into Himself. Hence, heaven can come down to earth, and the earth can reach heaven. Those who experience this can testify and say, &ldquo;We can live a heavenly life on earth and be a heavenly person on earth. Although we live on earth, God can be expressed through us.&rdquo; Such an experience exceeds any religious thought and concept. To merely forsake evil and practice good deeds is far inferior to this revelation.</p>
<p>The Son of Man is our way in the universe. Through Him heaven can reach the earth, and earth can reach heaven. Through Him God can be built into us, and we can be built into God. Then we become persons who not only communicate with God and are joined to Him but are also built together with Him. We become not only stones upon which oil has been poured but also Bethel, the house of God. This is what the Lord Jesus desires to accomplish in His coming as a Lamb with a dove.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>Orthodox Christianity lacks the light concerning the Son of Man coming as a Lamb with a dove. The revelation in the Gospel of John is not related to a shallow religious concept. In eternity past the unlimited God, who dwells in unapproachable light and whom man cannot touch or comprehend, was the Word. In time He came forth as the Word, first in His creation of all things and then by coming as a man. He came forth because He desires to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that man would receive Him and be born of God with the divine life. Those who receive Him can touch and enjoy God, and they can enter into the fullness of God. Furthermore, God can be fully expressed through them.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill this desire, God came as the Lamb to take away man&rsquo;s sin and remove the barrier of sin between God and man. He also came as the dove, the Spirit, so that man can enter into God. He is the mysterious Son of Man in heaven and on earth (3:13). When He was on earth, outwardly the Son of Man was a man but inwardly He was God. This God-man is a ladder in the universe. Through Him God can enter into man and man can enter into God. He brings God into man and builds God into man, and He also brings man into God and builds man into God. Thus, God and man can be joined and built together in Him.</p>
<p>The Son of Man is not only the way in the universe; He is also a building, God&rsquo;s dwelling place (2:19, 21). This is Bethel, God&rsquo;s house. In Him God has rest, and man has a home. He is the gate to heaven on earth. He is awesome! In Him God is expressed, and man can touch God. This should be the situation of the church and of every Christian.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Christianity has deviated and lost these genuine things. Christianity can be likened to a person who has precious gems in his hand but who falls while walking, drops the gems, and is covered with dust and dirt. For two thousand years Christianity has taken one fall after another, and as a result, it has become filthy and has lost all the treasures in the Bible. Everything genuine has been lost, and only dust remains. We do not need to fall anymore. We need to shake off the filth that contaminates us. We need to be delivered from every religious concept. We do not have concepts concerning the Messiah, Elijah, the Prophet, or a Rabbi. Our unique revelation is of the Lamb of God with the dove as the way. He is the mysterious Son of Man who brings God into man and man into God so that heaven can communicate with the earth, and God and man can be joined and built up to become Bethel, the house of God.</p>
<p>This will be the situation in eternity future in the New Jerusalem. Before that day comes, however, the church has a foretaste of the powers of the age to come and can taste the situation of eternity (Heb. 6:5). If our eyes are opened and we receive the vision of what God desires to do in the universe, we will have Bethel among us; that is, we will have communication between heaven and earth, and we will be joined to God. We will have the Son of Man as the ladder through whom God and man can be joined, mingled, and built together to be the house of God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
