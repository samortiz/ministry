   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPEAKING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to verse 26, Christ gave Himself up for the church so that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the Lord Jesus gave Himself for us in the flesh, He was resurrected and in resurrection became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whatever He speaks is the word that washes us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word rendered word in verse 26 is not logos, the constant word, but rhema, which denotes the instant word, the word the Lord presently speaks to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the life-giving Spirit, the Lord is not silent; He is constantly speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you take Him as your person, you will discover how much He desires to speak within you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Idols are dumb, but the indwelling Christ is always speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one who takes Christ as his life and his person can remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the contrary, he will be constrained by Christ to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As I minister to the Lord s children, I experience Christ speaking within me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Greek word rendered words here is also rhema, the instant and present spoken word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This differs from logos, the constant word, as in John 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the speaking Spirit, the Lord is speaking the rhema to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever He speaks is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If day by day there is no speaking of the Lord within us, it is an indication that there is some problem within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there is no speaking, no rhema, then in our practical experience the Spirit is absent, for the Lord s speaking actually is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as we have the Lord s present word, we have the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot separate Christ as the life-giving Spirit from His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His presence consists in His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can we know that Christ as our person is present with us?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We know it by His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not have His speaking within us, we do not have His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if we turn to Him, to mean business to take Christ as our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His speaking will begin again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His speaking is the living word. the living word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is our wonderful Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How practical, subjective, intimate, and real He is as the speaking Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>METABOLIC CLEANSING AND TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Spirit is the water that washes us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more the Spirit speaks, the more we are washed, cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every time He speaks within us we should experience cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This cleansing is a metabolic cleansing that removes what is old and replaces it with what is new.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How different this is from some type of outward cleansing!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is by the inward, metabolic cleansing that we have transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By the metabolic cleansing that comes from the speaking of Christ as the life-giving Spirit, we are truly changed, transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because such an inward transformation is taking place within us, there is no need for outward correction in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s way in His economy is not to change us outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His way is for Christ to give Himself up for us and then to come into us as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a very practical sense, the Lord s presence is one with His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever He speaks, we realize His presence within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This speaking of the life-giving Spirit within is the water that cleanses our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This cleansing water deposits a new element into us to replace the old element in our nature and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This metabolic cleansing causes a genuine change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This change is what we mean by transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Outward correction has no value.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What the church needs is the inward metabolic cleansing that comes from allowing Christ as the life-giving Spirit to be our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In verse 26 we have Christ not in the stage of the flesh, but in the stage of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have pointed out, the life-giving Spirit is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ s speaking is the Spirit; it is the very presence of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we honor the speaking of the Spirit within us, the Spirit s speaking will become the water that cleanses, purifies, sanctifies, and supplies us with the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This element replaces and discharges our old element and brings about genuine transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way we are purified and sanctified; in this way we also experience the practicality of the church life.</S>
