   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT, THROUGH THE PRAYERS AND PETITIONS OF THE BELIEVERS, MINGLING WITH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE LORD'S WORDS TO MAKE THEM SPIRIT AND LIFE, THAT IS, THE SPIRIT WHO GIVES LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The life-giving Spirit, through the prayers and petitions of the believers, mingles with the Lord's words to make them spirit and life, that is, the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 6:17 says, "...which Spirit is the word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although it is not easy to understand these words, in our experience we can comprehend them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 6:63 we cannot figure out how the words spoken to us by the Lord are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we can find out in Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we receive the word of God through prayer and petition, the word becomes the Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we want to enjoy the Spirit and life in the word, we must do so through prayer and petition v. 18 . Using today's word, this means that we need to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not enough to merely read.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have experience can testify that in reading the Bible, we need to repeat our reading a few more times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are reading, we must turn it into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, we may read John 3:16, which says, "For God so loved the world..."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we merely read these words, we will have only the word and not the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if we read these words in a spirit of prayer, saying, "Oh, God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise the Lord, this is too good.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God loves the world...," this word becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will be enlightened and will pray with weeping, "Oh, God loves me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, thank You that You love me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way the word becomes spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is through prayer that the word can become spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times when we pray-read the word of the Bible in this way, it causes us to be inspired and weep.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only the word of the Bible but even the hymns affect us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A few days ago I sang Hymn #1 in Hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I love that hymn very much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first stanza says, "Glory be to God the Father, /And to Christ the Son,/Glory to the Holy Spirit /Ever One."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Stanza two says, "As we view the vast creation, /Planned with wondrous skill,/So our hearts would move to worship,/And be still."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I came to this stanza, my tears came down.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then stanza three says, "But, our God, how great Thy yearning/To have sons who love..."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By reading this I knew that what God wants is not even the beautiful creation; He yearns to have many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regardless of whether it is the word of the Bible or the hymns, if we read with a spirit of prayer, often we will be moved and will shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This experience shows us that the life-giving Spirit, through the prayers and petitions of the believers, mingles with the Lord's words to make them spirit and life, that is, the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THIS SPIRIT BEING ALSO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>POURED UPON THE BELIEVERS, AS A MANTLE CLOTHING THEM, TO BE THE SPIRIT OF POWER</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>TO THEM FOR ACCOMPLISHING GOD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This Spirit is also the poured out Spirit Acts 2:18, 33; Luke 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is water that we can drink and that can also be poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This Spirit was poured upon the believers to be the mantle Spirit clothing them, like the mantle of Elijah clothing Elisha to become his power 2 Kings 2:12b-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This mantle Spirit is the Spirit of power for the believers to accomplish God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>X. BECOMING THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Finally, this Spirit becomes the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the sevenfold intensified Spirit as the One who strengthens the believers in the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The degradation of the church is so deep that without the seven Spirits there is no way to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In these last days the seven Spirits enable the believers to become overcomers in the midst of the degraded situation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today, in order to be the overcomers in the midst of the degradation of the church, we must have the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In conclusion, we see that the Holy Spirit has eighteen statuses for God to become man and to make man God that God and man may be joined and mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These eighteen statuses are 1 God; 2 the Triune God; 3 the Holy Spirit; 4 becoming man; 5 passing through human living; 6 passing through death; 7 resurrecting from death; 8 ascending to the height of the heavens; 9 becoming the life-giving Spirit the Spirit of life; 10 becoming the compound Spirit as the anointing ointment; 11 becoming the consummation of the Triune God; 12 becoming the Lord Spirit; 13 becoming the Spirit; 14 becoming the Spirit of Jesus Christ; 15 becoming the Spirit of reality; 16 as the Spirit in the word of God; 17 as the outpoured Spirit the mantle Spirit the Spirit of power; 18 becoming the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that you will study this message thoroughly and also will do your best to prophesy in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Especially the co-workers and elders have to take the lead in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have to become newer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you stand up to speak, you will become new.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you do not speak, you will become old.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If one speaks every day, he will become new.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If one closes up and does not speak, he will become old.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Not to speak for the Lord is to be old; to speak for the Lord is to be new.</S>
