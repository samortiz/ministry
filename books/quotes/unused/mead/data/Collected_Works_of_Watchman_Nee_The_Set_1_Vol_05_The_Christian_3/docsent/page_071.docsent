   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VERSE NINETEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 19: "As many as I love I rebuke and discipline; be zealous therefore and repent."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Laodicea is what the Lord "loves."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Can we be the same?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Can we ourselves be cleansed from all Laodicean sins yet still love all the Laodicean believers?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here the Lord reveals His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The original meaning of the word "love" means to treasure, to love intimately.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is very interesting that out of seven letters the Lord told only two churches that He loves them one is Philadelphia, the best; the other is Laodicea, the worst.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He told it to Philadelphia, so that they would not backslide, and to Laodicea, so that they would not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the love of Christ has not forsaken Laodicea, neither should we.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Quite often, we run the risk of being too much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before the heart is taught by the Lord, we are the Laodiceans, but after we fully submit to the Lord, we not only drop all the Laodicean conduct but also hate the Laodicean brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should realize that any "holier than thou" attitude is just the attitude of Laodicea!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the Lord thinks that He should still love Laodicea, we should also think the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet how hard this is!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the eyes of Christ, the attitude and the conduct of Laodicea are so worldly they make Him vomit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have the same heart as the Lord, we would have the same feeling as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a believer stays in the world and boasts of his worldly riches, even Christ cannot restrain Himself from spewing him out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will in fact have a stronger feeling than others would have!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet His admonition, exhortation, rebuking, warning, and lastly, His love are still not cut off from them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although they made Him sad, forsook Him, put Him to shame, made Him vomit, and shut Him outside the door, He still loves them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Indeed, love can do the job where nothing else can.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The issue of love is not kindness but strength the strength to remain unchanged in the face of rejection and negligence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The issue of love is its purity and its self-denial.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here the Lord Jesus reveals to us what love is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we learn much about the condition of Laodicea, but even the more we learn about Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such love of the Lord for Laodicea is sufficient proof that Laodicea is not the unsaved ones or the hypocrites.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He cannot "love" an unsaved one so much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"As many as I love I rebuke and discipline."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus warned them in this way to show them that their destiny is not so pleasant, so that they would not continue pushing forward in an ever bolder way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the Lord's advice is very strict, it issues out of love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is waking them up from their dreams with His sharp words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If words do not work, He will use His hands; first the "rebuking," then the "disciplining."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His love is so great that He was willing to rebuke and to chasten.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The rebuking and chastening of the worldly people is often motivated by hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times they do not care for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But our Lord does this with a loving heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives....But if you are without discipline...then you are illegitimate and not sons" Heb 12:6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, discipline shows the love of the Lord; on the other hand, it shows the position of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those whom the Lord disciplines are the ones He loves, and they belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the Laodiceans were believers, not perishing ones cf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1 Cor 11:32, 2 Sam 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second "I" is emphasized in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that the Lord's love is different from man's love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Often man will cover, eradicate, and deny his beloved one's fault.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a one becomes full of sin and beyond hope of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was the way David dealt with Absalom and Adonijah.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their response was rebellion!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord's love is not blind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He wants to remove sins with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He does not like to discipline, but if His people do not listen to His calling and warning, He will not let them commit sins without rebuking or disciplining them because He loves them so much.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"Be zealous therefore and repent."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The disciplining rod has been raised; only zeal and repentance will prevent its striking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"Be zealous."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Their love should be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of course, this is not something that man can do with his natural ability, but if they recall the truth that stirred up their first love, their zeal will be stirred up again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"And repent."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They should see and confess the shortages the Lord told them of and seek for healing according to the Lord's instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The heart that loves the world chokes the heart that loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The thorn chokes the growth of the good seed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These ones should remove everything that freezes their hearts and should repossess the past truth and rekindle their zeal through drawing near to God, musing, praying, and reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They should purge out the invading lusts and should give room to the good seed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord is dealing with His people here.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many times He puts before them things that humiliate them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He does not ask them to do anything new; He only asks them to "repent."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is not asking them to receive any new wonderful ability that they may be able to "fly high" later.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He asks them only to realize and confess that they have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But how hard it is for the self-contented heart to take this!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord's words never please man's flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord did not want His people to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He only wants them to understand themselves, so that they would stand one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To suffer for the Lord is much better than to work much for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul said, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Acts 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord said, "I will show him how many things he must suffer on behalf of My name" Acts 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is what the Lord treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not to suffer for yourself but to suffer for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To have "kept the word of My endurance" Rev 3:10 is much better than to "have need of nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>"If we endure, we will also reign with Him" 2 Tim 2:12 .</S>
