   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Oil</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, we can see in these verses something of the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was born of the Spirit, and the Spirit even descended upon Him in the bodily form of a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit lit. descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased" Luke 3:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit did not descend upon Him in an abstract way, but in a definite form.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was full of the Spirit, led by the Spirit, and in the power of the Spirit: "And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit lit. returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee" Luke 4:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was even anointed with the Spirit: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me " Luke 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With the humanity of Jesus as the fine flour, there is the oil as the Spirit anointing, mingling, and saturating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Frankincense</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can also see something of the fragrant frankincense in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was so fragrant and so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is very difficult to translate this word "frankincense."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some versions say that this is something restful and satisfying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not only sweet and fragrant, but restful and peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In all these verses we see that Jesus is really the fragrant frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has the fragrance of the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Jesus was being arrested, Peter was strong with his sword to cut off the ear of one of the servants.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Lord Jesus told Peter, "Suffer ye thus far.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And he touched his ear, and healed him" Luke 22:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus stopped the sword and recovered the ear.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not anything natural; this is the fragrance of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His most tested hour, Jesus would not accept any protection; He cared instead for the suffering one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Salt</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In these verses we can see the fine flour, the oil, the frankincense, and also the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When people wanted to make Him great, He ran away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When they rejected Him, He did not reprove them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they arrested Him, He could have destroyed them by calling twelve legions of angels, but He did nothing Matt 26:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He even healed the ear of the one who came to arrest Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the killing of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There was no corruption or fermentation with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was under the salt all of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regardless of what kind of situation or circumstance He was in, He was always under the killing in His actions and words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His human living, there was the real salt.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So in Jesus, we see the fine flour, the oil, the frankincense, and the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Gospel of Luke is strategic in showing us the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why we cannot find these verses in the other three Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are the unique verses concerning the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need to pray-read these verses at least three or four times, and put them into practice in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is only by feeding upon His humanity in these verses that we will experience His humanity in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>REAL WORSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What the Lord is seeking today is the local churches where the saints worship God with their experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the real offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to experience Christ in our daily walk, and we must learn how to cook and prepare Christ that we may bring Him to the meetings for a present to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the cakes, wafers, and portions of the meal offering were made and cooked at home and then brought to the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Day by day we need to work on Christ: experience Him, enjoy Him, apprehend Him, and cook Him a little.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will then have something to bring to the meeting and present to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the real worship, and this is the real recovery of the church life in all the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not just a matter of meeting together, but of meeting with Christ as all kinds of offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is by this that we are united, and it is also by this that we render our worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is absolutely different from today's so-called Christian service.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may be faithful to Him in this matter.</S>
