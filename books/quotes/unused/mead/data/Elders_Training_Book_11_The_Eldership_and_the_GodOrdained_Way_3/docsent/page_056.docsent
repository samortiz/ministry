   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Mutuality is for the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Formerly in our practice, we only had one or two speakers in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today some may think that, if we arrange to have eight to ten speakers in the meetings, we have mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, this is plurality, not mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ten speakers would become clergymen, and the rest of the saints would become laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the church meetings, however, everyone can speak to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the clergy-laity system, if a question is raised in a group meeting, only the leader of the meeting is qualified to answer the question.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in the group meeting, everything is mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I ask a question, someone who was baptized three days ago can answer my question.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He may not be able to answer my question adequately, but whether an answer is adequate or not is a matter of degree.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I ask a question in a group meeting, the answer someone gives may be absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The answer may be wrong, but the activity of each one answering is right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To sit quietly in the meeting without speaking is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is better to function in a wrong way than not to function at all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To speak in the group meeting is right, but to be silent is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a meeting in Elden Hall in 1966, I stood up and said that everyone could speak at least four words in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As I said this, I wondered what four words everyone could speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then I said that everyone could say, "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Scriptures are full of the expression "O Lord," and Revelation 19:4 says that the elders and living creatures worshipped God, saying, "Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can speak and sing these four words in any kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way our meetings will never be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To sit silently does not require the exercise of our spirit, but to speak does.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our speaking in the spirit is very pleasant to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today if our meetings are full of speaking, more people will come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But our silence will kill the meetings, and fewer people will come.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every kind of Christian meeting, including the group meeting, is for worship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To bow down or kneel down is not the true meaning of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To worship God is to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to John 4, to drink Him as the living water is real worship vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>14, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To drink the living water is to enjoy God.</S>
