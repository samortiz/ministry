   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD PRESENTING HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AS A FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Jeremiah 2:13 we have the first crucial matter in this book concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse God, through the prophet, presents Himself to the children of Israel as a fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In principle, God did the same thing in Genesis 2, after the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God did not say to man, "You must know that I am your Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Remember that you are My creature and that you should be holy and loving, just as I am."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead of giving such a charge to man, God placed him in a garden, in front of two trees the tree of life, which signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that God wanted man to partake of Himself as signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Immediately after the first mention of the tree of life, we are told that "a river went out of Eden to water the garden" v. 10 . It is significant that the last chapter of the Bible also speaks of the tree of life and the river of water of life Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The picture in Genesis 2 of the tree of life and the river indicates that God is both the tree of life and the living water for man's existence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What God desires of man is that man would eat of Him as the tree of life and drink of Him as the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through our eating and drinking of Him, God is able to dispense Himself into us as our life and our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>AN ABSTRACT OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As I have been carrying out the life-study of the Scriptures, I have sometimes pointed out that the particular book we were studying is an abstract of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reason I say this is that all the books of the Bible are concerned with the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, now I wish to say about Jeremiah what I have said about other books: The book of Jeremiah is an abstract of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have already seen that the book of Jeremiah is an abstract of the Bible in the sense that it presents God as the fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us now go on to consider another way in which this book is an abstract of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Genesis 3 the devil appeared in the form of a serpent, and both Adam and Eve were seduced by him to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Jeremiah the serpent also comes in to distract God's people from the tree of life to the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jeremiah 2:13 says, "My people have committed two evils: / They have forsaken Me, / The fountain of living waters, / To hew out for themselves cisterns, / Broken cisterns, / Which hold no water."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This tells us that Israel had been distracted from the tree of life to the tree of knowledge, from the fountain of living waters to the idols the cisterns .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The children of Israel might have said, "We are not worshipping idols we are hewing out cisterns."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They did not realize, however, that by hewing out cisterns they were turning to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My point here is that in Jeremiah we can see the two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Chapters two through ten show us the same two trees that were in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In these chapters of Jeremiah, God seemed to be saying, "Foolish people!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why do you not come to Me?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why do you not partake of Me as the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why do you go to the other tree, to the idols?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By turning to the other tree, Israel had forsaken God and His law.</S>
