<h1 class="title">JESUS IS THE PROPITIATION FOR OUR SINS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 John 2:2; 4:10</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Sin separates man from God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man&rsquo;s sins violate God&rsquo;s righteousness.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s heart draws Him toward man in love, but God&rsquo;s righteousness has forced Him to forsake man. Therefore, His love cannot reach sinful man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jesus propitiates for us
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus bore man&rsquo;s sins according to the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus propitiated the very matter which formerly prevented God&rsquo;s love from reaching man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God provides in love
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus as our propitiation is the provision of God&rsquo;s love.</li>
	<li>Because God, in His love, wants to be gracious to man while at the same time God&rsquo;s righteousness puts requirements upon man, God provided man with the Lord Jesus as the propitiation.</li>
	</ol>
<span class="normal"><em>Note:</em>The point is not that God was angry and would not forgive man, and that the Lord came to propitiate God&rsquo;s wrath. We have to be clear. The One who conciliates the situation is God Himself. God&rsquo;s heart causes Him to deal with man in love, but God&rsquo;s righteousness puts requirements upon man. Therefore God Himself provided man with the Lord Jesus as the propitiation to propitiate the contradictory situation between God&rsquo;s love and God&rsquo;s righteousness.</span></li>
<li>How to obtain the propitiation of the Lord Jesus<br />
