   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ethics</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moreover, in human culture people discovered that man is corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although man's corruption is not always manifested, there is, nevertheless, the seed of corruption within him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, people discovered that within man there is also good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the Chinese philosophers argued as to whether man's nature is good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both theories are correct.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God created man, his human nature was good, but after man fell, his nature became evil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, ethics were produced and added to human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ancient Chinese sages all spoke about ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Tradition</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every nation has its own traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Chinese have their traditions that were handed down from their ancestors through the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These traditions are in the blood of the Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, the Japanese, the Arabs, the Indians, and the Jews all have their own traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all know that when someone is born, he is right away under the four great, permeating influences of culture, religion, ethics, and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today the entire human society is influenced by these four items, even to the extent that man has become a composition of these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Simply put, man is an entity of culture, religion, ethics, and tradition combined.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have spoken about these four matters, but these are not my burden; my burden is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These four items are not Christ; they are all replacements of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Stanza 3 of Hymns, #541 says,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not philosophy nor Any element Can to Christ conform us As His complement; But 'tis Christ Himself who All our nature takes And in resurrection Us His members makes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No philosophy or ethical element can produce the members of Christ, nor can they produce the Body of Christ an organic church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Stanza 4 says,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not religion, even Christianity, Can fulfill God's purpose Or economy; But 'tis Christ within us As our all in all Satisfies God's wishes, And His plan withal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All our problems are due to our lack of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we lack Christ, we are like a human body lacking nutrition, and this allows all kinds of sickness to come in. Once the nutrients are balanced and complete, then the sickness goes away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is similar to what stanza 5 says,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the gifts we're given By the Lord in grace, All the different functions Cannot Christ replace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only Christ Himself must Be our all in all!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only Christ Himself in All things, great or small!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CHRIST BEING DIFFERENT FROM RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This surpassing Christ, this transcendent Christ, is different from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most people confuse Christ and religion, thinking that Christ is the founder of the Christian religion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Strictly speaking, this is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Philippians 3:6 Paul said, "As to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These two clauses tell us that Paul had been one hundred percent a Jewish religionist.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Jewish religion is a religion which is formed according to God's holy Word in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It keeps God's holy Word and teaches people to worship the unique, true God and to act and behave according to His commandments that they may please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, those who have read the four Gospels in the New Testament all know that the true God whom the Jews had worshipped from antiquity was one day incarnated to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God Himself became flesh, was born in a manger, grew up in a poor family, and came out of a despised, remote region.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was Jesus, who is God, the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is the God of the universe, the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The name Jesus means Jehovah the Savior or the salvation of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, Jesus in the New Testament refers to Jehovah in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Recently I read a tenet of faith, which was put out by a very large, respected denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It said that the One who visited Abraham in Genesis 18, the Jehovah whose feet Abraham washed, for whom he killed a calf and spread a feast, and with whom Abraham ate, was the Jesus in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is definitely right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the Jews wanted their traditional religion and rejected the Savior Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the Lord Jesus came to the temple, the Jews considered Him a Samaritan and one who had a demon John 8:48 ; they did not want the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please tell me, who crucified the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was not merely Pilate the Roman governor, because he was in favor of releasing Jesus; three times he declared that he found no fault in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Jews, however, demanded that Pilate release Barabbas the robber and crucify Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, it was the Jewish religion, the high priest, the Pharisees, and the elders who crucified the Lord through the hands of the Romans soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The religionists care for religion; they do not care for Christ.</S>
