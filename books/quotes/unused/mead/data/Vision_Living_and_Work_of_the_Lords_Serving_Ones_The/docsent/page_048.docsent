   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A SERVING ONE AND HIS FELLOW WORKERS 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is impossible for those who are working for the Lord to work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They need co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, as soon as co is mentioned, we think of an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The cooperation among the schools in a university depends entirely on organization.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A board of directors hires a president, who then selects the heads of the departments and hires the staff.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the organization of a university.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A person who enters such an organization is clear about his position.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He knows whether he is a department head, a teacher, or an office clerk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the principle in every business.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the same with the government.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a representative body with its councilmen, and there are administrative units with their respective officers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not have organization in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This does not mean that everyone can do his own thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not have an organization, but we still co -work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is something that human culture and society do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The human body has no organization, yet all its members co-work every day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Each member knows its position and exercises its function for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one member acts alone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the principle that we live by in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>KNOWING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>AND LIVING IN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now that we know the principle of the Body, we should apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose a brother is burdened to go to the villages for the propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whom should he fellowship with first?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He does not need to seek someone who is far away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He should first fellowship with those who are serving with him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then he should seek those who have the same burden in order to fellowship and pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without fellowship, he is not living in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not a regulation; it is something spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When he is burdened for the propagation, he must first fellowship concerning his burden with the ones whom he serves with.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He can tell them that he is burdened for the propagation, but he is not clear concerning where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then they can pray with him or pray for him privately.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After such fellowship, his business becomes their business, and they can pray together concerning his burden.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is where we should begin our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, he can approach the elders whom he is close to and who render him help in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is not handing over his responsibility to an organization, nor is he bidding them farewell.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is fellowship in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fellowship of life is altogether a matter in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not go to the elders to ask for advice nor to receive an order, and the elders should not be political.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must all learn to live in the fellowship of the Body and speak in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here is a further illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose the brother goes to a town for the propagation and labors for three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, he only encounters difficulties on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is more than likely that a person who begins laboring for the Lord will encounter such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not expect that everything will be smooth when we labor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There will always be adverse circumstances when we go out in a pioneering way, because no one has paved the way for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Should he pack up his bags and leave, or should he fast and pray?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose the Lord seemingly does not hear him; should he return to fellowship with the brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must not forget that we are not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We serve in groups of two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead of going to someone far away, he should first fellowship with the two or three who are with him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then if the work continues to fail, he can fellowship with the co-workers in his initial locality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the proper relationship that we should have with our fellow workers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>EVERYONE NEEDING SKILLS IN ALL AREAS</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>RELATED TO THEIR FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Suppose three saints go out for the propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After they pray and fellowship, one saint may want to do the children s work, another may want to labor with the elderly saints, and the third may want to work with the young people and the young working saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This way is not wrong, as long as they have thorough fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who go out for the propagation must learn to be skilled in all areas.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not say that my gift is to preach the gospel, so the others should set up a platform and invite people so that I can give a good message.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should never have such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, we should learn to do everything that is needed in order to carry out our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can set up a platform, we can invite people, we can usher, and we can speak with the gospel friends.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are pioneers; therefore, we need to learn to be skilled in many areas.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not seek to specialize in only one thing; rather, we should be able to do whatever is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should be neither rigid nor stiff.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should all be able to do the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is good enough to gather some children together and teach them to sing a few songs.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One does not have to be able to sing well.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On the contrary, children like the older sisters who sing short songs off-key.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we go out to work, there should be nothing that we cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If there is a need, we can give a message, or we can do the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should not have opinions, and we should learn while we work.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>KNOWING THE SPIRIT, KNOWING LIFE,</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>AND KNOWING THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some of the older retired saints have finished their family obligations, are willing to serve full time, and are burdened for the propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some younger saints can go with the older saints to propagate.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>An older sister can live with several young saints and be a companion to them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Such a situation would be very sweet and helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The older sister can invite the neighborhood children to come and sing songs.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The young saints can distribute tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to receive this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Do not do things according to the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have been influenced by degraded Christianity and limited by our fallen nature; hence, the Lord is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I have always endeavored to escape degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Even though Christianity does not like me, it cannot be denied that I have published a large number of books and that the Lord s recovery is spreading through the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must endeavor to know the Spirit, know life, and know the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should also do our best to live in the spirit, in life, and in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we coordinate with three saints, we should fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we coordinate with thirty saints, we should fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The more fellowship there is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When we fellowship in this way, the Lord s blessing will come in.</S>
