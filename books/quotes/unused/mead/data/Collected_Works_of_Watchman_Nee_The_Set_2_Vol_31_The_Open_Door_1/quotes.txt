[2]  The Sino-Japanese War July 1937 September 1945 forced many saints and workers in the Lord's recovery to move from the coastal provinces to the interior of China.
[3]  During this time of dispersion, Watchman Nee was burdened to published The Open Door, not as an official publication, but as part of his personal ministry to serve the scattered saints.
[4]  There were nineteen issues of The Open Door between September 1937 and September 1939.
[5]  For years I have felt the need of a publication which could be used to communicate news of the work in all of the localities.
[6]  The name, The Open Door, was chosen much earlier, and I had hoped that others would be raised up by the Lord to bear its responsibility.
[7]  "Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing the word as the gospel" Acts 8:4 .
[8]  The Lord Jesus commanded, "You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth" Acts 1:8 .
[9]  But until today, we are still in "Jerusalem"; we have not preached in all "Judea and Samaria" yet, much less the uttermost part of the earth.
[10]  I left Tsinan the day you came to Hankow.
[11]  I did not receive this news until I arrived in Hong Kong.
[12]  I had to go to Canton for my passport, and after I returned from Canton to Hong Kong, I was sick for over ten days.
[13]  May the Lord bless you according to His promise.
[14]  After the meeting at Lo-Yuen, the Lord willing, I shall travel to Ning-Teh, Foo-An, and Shia-Pu.
[15]  It has been a few months since we parted in Canton.
[16]  While I was en route to Wei-Yang from Kutien, I sent you a letter.
[17]  I also felt that I should render something to meet their need out of the love and compassion of the Lord, and I considered this as important as the work of personal evangelism.
[18]  News from Yen-Ping and Nan-Ya, Fukien Province
[19]  It took me only two and a half hours to travel by bus from Jien-Ou down to Yen-Ping on the fifth of this month.
[20]  I thank the Lord for showing me that the work is the Lord's. When it is effectual, one should not be thrilled; and when it is not effectual, one should not be disheartened.
[21]  Peace to my beloved brothers, Watchman and Tsi-yi:
[22]  Through reading The Open Door I have come to know a little about the situation among the brothers.
[23]  On September 22-24 Brother Ke-san, Jai-seng, and I prayed in one accord for the work in Foochow, Pu-Tien, and Sien-You.
[24]  I went to Sien-You from Pu-Tien, and Brother Ke-san conducted a Bible study in Pu-Tien.
[25]  I have received your letter of November 15, which was sent through Brother Yueh-chao.
[26]  Since you and Brother Nee have left Shanghai, I have been going on according to the principle of separation between the church and the work.
[27]  I hope that Brother Tang Shou-ling and David Hsu will come to Shanghai, but they have not come, and I do not know where they are.
[28]  Since the Lord has put me on this frontline, I feel that I should follow those who are my seniors to go on in this one flow, even though I admit that I am far behind.
[29]  Yesterday I received your express letter dated the nineteenth of last month.
[30]  According to your instructions, I forwarded it by express mail to Shanghai the day before yesterday and charged Brother Ho Yueh-chao to send it to the printer.
[31]  After Sisters Peace Wang, Phoebe Chang, and I arrived in Chungking, we met together to pray for the future of the work.
[32]  We have decided to have a week of gospel meetings with the women in the Meditation Chapel of X denomination beginning January 3, 1938.
[33]  After the meetings, the Lord willing, Brother Yu-zhi will conduct another gospel meeting, which will be followed by Bible studies.
[34]  I arrived safely in Hong Kong at 3 p.m. on the eleventh.
[35]  Some brothers and sisters went early that day across the harbor to wait for me at the pier.
[36]  Had they not waited for me, I would have been in trouble, because I had a great deal of luggage and could not speak the local dialect.
[37]  Brother Philip Luan has moved to Hong Kong with his family.
[38]  We received your letter dated the eighth of this month.
[39]  After reading it, we were filled with unspeakable thanksgiving to our Father.
[40]  At the same time, we were also filled with shame, because we have remembered our sisters so little.
[41]  I can only ask the Lord to forgive us for the past and to lead us on in the future.
[42]  Because of a boil on my hand, it has been difficult for me to write, and I was delayed in replying to your letter.
[43]  I have to ask the Lord to show me what position I should stand on and what gift I have been given in the Body of Christ so that I may be faithful to the end and so that I may not overstep or restrict the gift of the Spirit.
[44]  I have testified for the Lord in Nan-Sha and have spread the Lord's accomplished work on the cross to the men in the X hospital.
[45]  Some of the soldiers have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior.
[46]  Since the beginning of the war, both the south and north parts of the country have been greatly affected.
[47]  I have been remembering the brothers and sisters living in the war zone day and night.
[48]  A while ago I received the Shanghai local newsletter as well as The Open Door from Hankow and realized that the Father has bestowed wonderful grace to preserve us all in peace.
[49]  The following is a list of local churches around this area and their addresses:
[50]  1 Han-Jiang Brother Fang Shi-rong is the responsible one.
[51]  He has heard my supplication and provided a brother to travel with me.
[52]  On the seventh we boarded the boat; Sister Cheng Feng-yi and Brother Shen sent us on our way.
[53]  On the morning of the thirteenth, I took the train, got off at a little after 10:00 a.m., and took the bus at 11:30 a.m. At 1:00 p.m. I got off the bus, and I arrived home by 3:30 p.m. Thank and praise the Lord, we have seen His guidance and provision in everything.
[54]  Tonight, Brother Han Fu-sheng with his children and amah, Brother Zhang Gung-jih and his family, Dr. and Mrs. Qu of Jiu-Jiang and their family, Mrs. Hu and my wife, and one sister from the Wei household left for Ch'ang-Teh on a steamer.
[55]  I sent out all the copies of The Open Door the day before yesterday.
[56]  With the exception of those bound for Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, Shanghai, and Kiangsu, which I have given to Mr. Nee with the mailing list to be sent out from Hong Kong, the rest have all been sent out from Hankow.
[57]  Chefoo, Peking, Tientsin, Tsinan, and regions in Chekiang are not in the war-zone, and I have mailed the magazine to them directly from here.
[58]  The purpose of my writing this letter is to tell you how much we have been praying for the brothers and sisters in Shanghai!
[59]  Although I have not yet written to you, I have never forgotten about you.
[60]  1 Mr. Watchman Nee has been busy in various places for the work.
[61]  Presently, he is traveling between Hankow, Canton, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.
[62]  2 Since I have to take charge of this publication, and since the war has made conditions so critical, I will try my best to publish news about the work and about the church, beginning with Issue No. 3.
[63]  I was comforted to find out about the condition of the co-workers in China through reading The Open Door.
[64]  It would be best if you could take the steamer that passes through Manila so that the brothers and sisters here may have the opportunity once again to receive your teaching and learn about the details of the work in China.
[65]  I really thank the Lord for your letter today.
[66]  My heart was filled with sadness to learn that Brother Luan was so physically weak.
[67]  I received your letter awhile ago and found that you were already in Hankow.
[68]  Praise and thank the Lord, although the clouds of war are thick, we have been protected.
[69]  We are safe, and we can serve the Lord as usual.
[70]  The Lord has already opened a door for us for the gospel in the inland region.
[71]  I received the letters you sent me, as well as The Open Door.
[72]  I will be able to distribute the latter to the brothers in a few days.
[73]  He answered your prayer and brought blessing to the work here.
[74]  Thank the Lord, Kuo Men-ping, a friend of Brother Wu Ai-huei and a shepherd by trade, was clearly saved.
[75]  Peace in the Lord to Sisters Ruth, Peace, and Phoebe:
[76]  Brother Nee boarded the steamer for Shanghai yesterday the tenth at noon.
[77]  Praise and thank the Lord, his speaking really helped many of the brothers and sisters.
[78]  I received your letter from Mr. Ho last night.
[79]  Thank our Father for bringing me through the last few months so that I can count more of the Lord's grace and give Him more thanks.
[80]  The brothers and sisters are living peacefully day by day through relying on the Lord's grace; they are not frightened.
[81]  Praise and thank the Lord that in this difficult time the gospel work has an open door in every place, even though all occupations have stopped.
[82]  I left Ch'ang-sha on the fifth of this month and arrived in Kuei-yang on the fifteenth.
[83]  I still do not have a companion, but the Lord's grace is sufficient for me.
[84]  In January Sister Wang held a gospel conference for women which continued with a Bible study.
[85]  Brother Chang Yu-zhi is involved with prison evangelism work, which began January 24.
[86]  My younger sister and I left Ch'ang-sha on December 29 and have arrived safely in Kweichow.
[87]  My sister Jing-hsia and I experienced the Lord's grace and leading and arrived safely in K'un-ming on January 12 at six o'clock in the evening.
[88]  We took hospitality with Brother Huang Tsung and are temporarily staying in his home.
[89]  I read Sister Lee's letters in Brother Weigh's house and Brother Huang's house today and learned that she wanted to work in Kuei-yang and K'un-ming and that she was asking about the land and sea routes.
[90]  I never thought that I would come to Yuan-Jiang.
[91]  I had never even heard of Yuan-Jiang, much less considered coming here.
[92]  I was originally going to go to Chi-Li, but instead I ended up here.
[93]  I have not heard any news about you for a long time.
[94]  Please greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord and the ones that I know: Brother Nee, Brother Luan, and Sister Chang.
[95]  To my beloved sister in the Lord, Mrs. X:
[96]  I read your letter of the ninth, and it reminded me of the verse: "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God."
[97]  When I saw you in Hankow, your speech, attitude, and dress all told me how I should learn to be a faithful witness for the Lord.
[98]  On the one hand, I love and respect you for your change; on the other hand, I marvel at the Lord's power and commit my family more zealously before Him and ask Him to change them also.
[99]  The beloved in the Lord are more dear than sisters in the flesh.
[100]  I always feel that seeing a brother or sister in the Lord, or even hearing their voices, can give me great blessing and joy.
[101]  After coming to Lan-chou in November, I returned to Hangchow in the beginning of December for ten days.
[102]  I met with Sister Miao and Sister Tso and learned that you, your wife, and Sister Jing-huai had gone to live in Hong Kong temporarily.
[103]  I am sending you this quick letter because I have to rely on the Lord more, not because I have lost my job.
[104]  The brothers and sisters left in Hangchow are Ruan Chi-yu, Mrs. Ruan and their baby, Brother and Sister Ah-lai, Brother Lee Kwei-sien, Brother Huang Tsai-ching, and his old mother.
[105]  I received the large package you sent through Mr. Hsie.
[106]  May the Lord give you faithfulness and prudence in distributing food among the poor in His household.
[107]  Most of the brothers and sisters in the city have moved to the villages in the hills, but Brother Shan Kai-fen is still responsible for the meetings.
[108]  I was overjoyed to receive The Open Door second issue !
[109]  The only problem was that my issue came so late.
[110]  I was late in learning about the travels of the brothers and late in my rejoicing.
[111]  Please do not forget me, this weak little brother in the Lord, because I think of you always.
[112]  When I read The Open Door, I saw that all the brothers and sisters were very busy with the work and that you were laboring physically and in heart.
[113]  I do believe I am still the Lord's. As long as what I do is for the Lord, I trust that I am working for Him.
[114]  The following are excerpts from Brother Lan Tsi-yi's letters from the period between December 29, 1937 to January 22, 1938.
[115]  1 There is one matter to report that requires prayer in one accord.
[116]  Since I left the orphanage in Hankow, the management was handed over to the X denomination.
[117]  2 One letter from Hsinchih for Miss Lo Jing-hwei.
[118]  3 One card from Chen Kuo-yang of Ch'ang-sha for Mr. Rui Di-min.
[119]  The emphasis of The Open Door is the gospel work in all the localities.
[120]  Therefore, we ask God to care for the brothers and sisters in tribulation in these difficult times on the one hand, and we hope that the brothers and sisters who have news would send the details to us by airmail or express mail on the other hand.
[121]  5 P. O. Box 84, Hankow, March 1938 NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK The Work in the Remote Regions,
[122]  To the brothers who have been called together in grace:
[123]  We had a week-long special gospel conference beginning February 7 at two o'clock every afternoon in the meeting place of the local church in K'un-ming next door to the Tung Hsing Pharmacy, Tung-Ren Street .
[124]  I was responsible for it, but Brothers Chou Kang-yao, Chou Hung-bao, Chang Jing-yuan, and Chen Hsi-wen all helped quite a bit.
[125]  I was helped in the second issue of The Open Door by your frank teachings in the Lord!
[126]  We have recently rented a local house in Shi-Ping for a meeting hall, and I have rented a portion of it from the church because there were extra rooms.
[127]  I am preparing to go out to work, but I have not been able to leave because some sisters are undergoing trials.
[128]  I went to Yi-Yang on the ninth and took a private boat on the eleventh to Yuan-Jiang.
[129]  The brothers and sisters the refugees in Yuan-Jiang are all safe in the Lord's grace.
[130]  The Lord has arranged for Brother Gun-jih to teach English at the T'ao Hua Lun Lutheran Secondary School in Yi-Yang.
[131]  Through him the Lord resolved the burden of living for Brother Chang's family and also enabled him to stand firm for the Lord in Yi-Yang.
[132]  I also found out to my comfort that the brothers and sisters in all the localities had been protected by the Lord!
[133]  There are a few matters that I want to report to you; I hope you will take time to read them:
[134]  I had just returned from the meeting place when I received your letter.
[135]  I already have the second issue of The Open Door.
[136]  Having been assured of God's leading and arrangement, I accepted the invitation of the brothers and sisters of the assembly in Han-Jiang and arrived on the fifteenth with Sister Weigh Kwang-ying.
[137]  Because it is the traditional time of the New Year, I want to take this opportunity to pray for a few days with a few sisters who have already been called out, if the Lord is willing.
[138]  If the Lord delays and keeps me away from home, I will wait for a clearer leading and then go to Sien-You and Feng-Ting to work, because the brothers and sisters there have invited me.
[139]  I was led by the Lord three weeks ago to leave Ning-Hai and work in the region of Huang-Yen and Hai-Men.
[140]  I have not had any news about the condition of the assembly in Shanghai and the brothers in Kiangsu, Shanghai, and Shao-Shing.
[141]  I would imagine that the brothers in Shanghai must be in the same situation.
[142]  Peace to my brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:
[143]  I received both the money which you wired to me through the Bank of China on the twenty-fourth and your letter of the twenty-fifth.
[144]  I passed on X dollars to Brother Chen Meng-jao and distributed the rest.
[145]  Brother Watchman Nee was recently in Shanghai, and we invited him to conduct a Bible study on the topic of "The Truth Concerning the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit."
[146]  The place was 34 Wen-teh Lane, Hardoon Road, every evening from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., January 31 February 12.
[147]  We thank the Lord because His promise never changes.
[148]  The Travels of the Co-workers in Hong Kong One
[149]  Sister Mei Guang-yao was saved and baptized last Saturday.
[150]  Sisters Yu Su-jen and Rachel Lee hope to go to Yunnan on or around February 10.
[151]  The Lord willing, Mr. Luan will take Brother Chen Ju-yien, Brother Ho Nai-zhao a responsible brother here , and myself to Macao and Chungshan this afternoon.
[152]  Did you receive the letter I sent from Macao on the eighteenth?
[153]  We have not received it because surface mail from Macao to Chungking takes a very long time Editor.
[154]  Yesterday evening February 24 we began a Bible study in Kowloon, and Brother Nee is responsible for it.
[155]  Brother Watchman Nee left Shanghai on February 15 and arrived in Hong Kong on the seventeenth.
[156]  There is a Bible study in Hong Kong which began on the twenty-fourth.
[157]  He will leave Hong Kong on March 5 for Singapore and then go to England by way of India.
[158]  1 Brother Chang Jing-yuan and Sister Chang Jing-shia arrived safely in K'un-ming from Ch'ang-sha on January 13.
[159]  2 Sister Wang Juh-ching arrived safely from Hankow in the middle of January.
[160]  3 Brother Chen Ho-seng, who used to work in the Euro-Asia Airlines Office in Peking, was transferred to their K'un-ming office as the radio operator.
[161]  1 Please ask God to save more people in K'un-ming into His church and to raise up more brothers to be elders and more brothers and sisters to be deacons.
[162]  May the Lord bless your share of the labor in the work.
[163]  Our ship left Hong Kong at 4:30 p.m. on the seventh and arrived at Haiphong at 7:00 on the tenth.
[164]  Brother Tseng, who works at Haiphong, helped us to go on and accompanied us to Ho-Nei a three-hour train ride from Haiphong .
[165]  Brother Chen Ho-seng met us at the station and took care of everything for us including acting as a guarantor.
[166]  May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be to you.
[167]  Since parting from you at the station, I arrived in Canton by the Lord's grace.
[168]  I cannot deny the dangers of the Canton-Hankow Railway, neither can I refrain from praising our God, saying, "Jehovah will keep you from all evil; He will keep your soul.
[169]  Peace in the Lord to our dear Sister X:
[170]  We have received special mercy from the Father and are in a peaceful situation.
[171]  Whenever we think of the brothers who are fleeing from the war, we can only pray desperately for them before the Father.
[172]  May the Father of mercies, the God of grace and mercy, shorten the days for the sake of His chosen people so that His children might be kept safe and at peace, living their lives in godliness.
[173]  I left Canton on the twenty-third of last month and went with a colleague and a few of his relatives to Wu-Chow in Kwangsi province.
[174]  I was originally going to stay there for awhile, but I received a telegram telling me to return immediately to Canton.
[175]  We have just wired X dollars through the post office.
[176]  Please distribute it for us to all the brothers in the war zone.
[177]  We received The Open Door today and learned that the brothers and sisters are still laboring to bear the responsibility of the holy work for the Lord's name.
[178]  We should sing Hallelujah together and praise the Lord Jesus Christ for His grace!
[179]  The war has caused us to remember our brothers and sisters in the assembly in Shanghai.
[180]  I found out that you were in Hong Kong yesterday from Brother Ma Di-sheng.
[181]  Thank the Lord very much for this opportunity to communicate with you....The brothers and sisters in certain places in Sha-Di are suffering more in places like Tou-Peng, Hsin-Wan-Di, San-Cha-Dai, Twelve Dai, and San-Tai-Chiao.
[182]  I hope that the brothers and sisters in the Lord do not forget to pray for them before the Lord.
[183]  1 The meeting in the city of Shao-Shing has stopped.
[184]  Most of the brothers and sisters have fled to Jou-Shan and are meeting there.
[185]  I received the money you wired from the bank.
[186]  I received your letter from Hankow and was filled with unspeakable joy!
[187]  My living in the past several months has really been in a black tunnel.
[188]  I have passed through many dangers, but thankfully the Lord's presence protected and constantly comforted me.
[189]  Since I left Wu-Sung on October 31 for Hangchow, I stayed in town for fourteen days, and then I followed the people here from Hangchow on the fifteenth.
[190]  Sister Chang Yi-hwa from Ning-Po sent a letter saying that they are all well.
[191]  When will you and the others be coming back to Shanghai?
[192]  Will you wait for Peace and then come together?
[193]  I will not be able to go anywhere for awhile; I moved into the meeting hall last Wednesday.
[194]  Two months have passed quickly since I left you in Hankow.
[195]  The brothers and sisters now living in the Gospel Court in Hankow except for the local brothers and sisters are: Brother Chou You-sheng from Nanking , Sister Shang Yi-rung from Tsao-Yang , Brother Kuo Pu-yueh from Hou-Ma , Sister Wu Teh-hsing from Tsao-Yang , Brother Wang Ching-shan from Tsinan , senior Mrs. Wu from Tsao-Yang , Brother Huang Da-rei from Shu County , Sister Huang Shu-hsien from Shu County , Brother Shang Jiu-tze from Tsao-Yang , Sister Liu Yu-ying from Shu County , and Brother Tsung Kung from Sian .
[196]  Other brothers and sisters living in Hankow in our fellowship : Brother Timothy Chou, Brother Chung Shuan-ching, Brother Luke Hsuan, Brother Yu Hsiang-shan, Brother Wang Yung-yuan, Brother Bai Kuang-liang recently from Tsingtao , Mrs. Hsia Chang Yun-mei, Dr. Kao Yueh-ying, and Mrs. Bai Brother Bai's wife .
[197]  We ask the Lord to give us an opportunity to learn how to serve others and to ease the burden which the brothers and sisters bear for us.
[198]  Praise our God for bringing me from Hou-Ma to Hankow in three days and three nights.
[199]  He gave me a burden for the need to come to Hankow, so I came not long after.
[200]  Due to the many things entangling me and to the fact that I do not have a settled place, I can only send a simple greeting to the brothers and sisters in the Lord.
[201]  I hope that you will forgive me before God.
[202]  After the hospital was destroyed last year on December 9, I took a train with some friends to Ch'ang-sha in the middle of the night on the eleventh.
[203]  I am telling you about my situation so that those in the Lord who know about it will remember me before the Father for my weaknesses.
[204]  The brothers and sisters in the Lord in Tsinan whom I know of, who meet at 10 Kuang-Chih Street, and the rest are all safe.
[205]  I believe that the Lord's blood has cleansed us, and we have been sealed.
[206]  Our hearts are filled with thanks and praise to the Lord who loves us!
[207]  When I pass out gospel tracts on the street, many people come over to ask for them as if they are asking for something precious.
[208]  They wrote a letter inviting Brother Witness Lee to come here, but Mr. Lee said that he did not have a burden to come yet.
[209]  I also heard that the brothers and sisters in Peking invited Brother Philip Luan.
[210]  From The Open Door, I found out about the condition of the Lord's work in all the localities.
[211]  Thank the Lord, He always takes care of His work.
[212]  The assembly in Peking really needs the light the Lord brought in through The Open Door the principles of the work.
[213]  The condition of the assembly is really good now.
[214]  There were more than seventy in one table meeting.
[215]  However, the point is not how many people there are, but the godliness displayed in the worship.
[216]  Greetings to my dear Mr. Nee and all the brothers
[217]  Thank the Lord, I unexpectedly received The Open Door a few days ago and really received much comfort and encouragement.
[218]  I saw that God has seen the hungry lambs in the inland and remote regions of our country, and He is using the war to save sinners by sending out his servants.
[219]  I heard that you had already arrived in Chungking.
[220]  Forgive me for waiting to greet you until now.
[221]  I heard my father tell his company in Hankow to send X dollars to you in January.
[222]  Mrs. Han Fu-sheng is safe in her ancestral home in Wu-Jen, Kiangsu.
[223]  The above are excerpts from Brother Ho Yueh-chiao's letter of January 26 Editor.
[224]  1 The co-workers and many brothers and sisters are really concerned about the news of the churches and individual brothers and sisters from the war zone and the areas neighboring it!
[225]  Therefore, we hope you will do your best to send the news to us.
[226]  Because the postal service is often blocked, we think it would be best if you could send your letters by express mail or air mail.
[227]  6 P. O. Box 84, Hankow, April 1938 NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK A Letter from Brother Hsu Dah-weh, Chekiang
[228]  I went first to the Ho home in North County of Wu-Yi and was stranded there for eight days by the rain and snow, so I did not come into the city until the day before yesterday.
[229]  If the Lord allows, I might go to Hsuan-Ping to do some work and then from there go to Wenchow and Ping-Yang to see the brothers.
[230]  Presently, I cannot go to Shanghai, so I will lose this opportunity to see Brother Nee according to God's decision.
[231]  In the past three weeks God has done a new work among our sisters and has revived many people.
[232]  Many prodigal sons have come back to the Father's house!
[233]  The Lord has gained something, so we must rejoice with Him!
[234]  Two or three people began to pray in one accord, and then the Lord began to work.
[235]  After sending the manuscripts for the thirteenth and fourteenth issues of The Christian to Shanghai, I did not prepare many more articles because I knew that it was inconvenient to print and mail the publication.
[236]  I received the second issue of The Open Door a long time ago, and the third issue came a few days ago.
[237]  I am sure that the loving, merciful Father has given you and all the brothers His rich, unsearchable, marvelous, indescribable grace through the Spirit of Christ.
[238]  May He abundantly give you even more in the future so that all the glory might be to Him!
[239]  God had prepared a comfortable place for me to give hospitality to a few sisters so they could get to know the life of prayer and fellowship.
[240]  When I see His doings, I know that the day of His coming is near.
[241]  Letters from Brother Han Fu-sheng, Ch'ang-Teh One
[242]  The work in Ch'ang-Teh has been blessed much by the Lord recently.
[243]  We see the Lord's own hand helping us in everything.
[244]  A Letter from Brother Yang Shao-tang, Chu-Wo
[245]  After the Bible study in Lin-Jin, the Holy Spirit stirred up a love for the truth in people.
[246]  We arrived in Ch'eng-tu yesterday at 3:20 p.m. Even though the seats on the bus had no backs, the Lord's grace was sufficient.
[247]  Today Brother Chao Rue-tze said that not long after he came to Ch'eng-tu, he thought of preaching the gospel in a teahouse because the teahouses here can seat one to two hundred people.
[248]  His faithfulness, love, and mercy enable me to live joyously during these days.
[249]  The Table of Contents of this book is as follows:
[250]  When she left, she carried only one Bible with her.
[251]  We received God's promise to have a conference for two days on February 3-4.
[252]  More than sixty brothers and sisters came to the meetings.
[253]  Although we do not write often, in my spirit I feel that our fellowship before God is like one family around the same father.
[254]  If the environment permits, I will go to Kweilin to work for three months.
[255]  After returning to Fukien, I taught for awhile at a girls' school, but I quit because I wanted to live for the Word which I believed.
[256]  May the Lord cultivate me so that my suffering life will grow.
[257]  I want to be faithful in this way and follow Him to the end!
[258]  I hope that through the grace of God, I will lead sinners to the Lord, edify the brothers and sisters, and grow in life myself, despite my weakness.
[259]  The churches here have been deeply blessed by God.
[260]  If God opens the way, I am willing to come see you shortly.
[261]  Every time I pray, I believe that God is protecting Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, Brother Tang Shou-ling, and Brother Chao Rue-tze and his wife.
[262]  In my heart, I do not want to live in Hong Kong.
[263]  But since the Lord has loved me so much, in these last days, I should love Him and take up my own cross to preach the gospel.
[264]  I do not understand Cantonese or English, so I would not be able to testify for Him.
[265]  If the Lord prepares a brother in the Lord as a partner with me in business, we could set up a milk processing plant or some other business.
[266]  Thank God that we can love each other in the Lord.
[267]  With regard to the sisters in Chefoo, Sister Jin-gui often accompanies me.
[268]  On Saturdays, Mrs. Hsu Kuang-yueh comes with us to the Sin-Sheng Factory.
[269]  Mrs. Luan meets there and teaches the sisters to read some easy lessons they have just learned to read . In addition to the Sin-Sheng Factory, Sin- Feng also wants us to come visit those who have believed or want to believe.
[270]  He knew that Kuei-yang lacked workers to preach the Lord's salvation, and He answered our prayer.
[271]  I pray that the Lord would impart some spiritual gifts to you so that you might bring them to us.
[272]  Brother Nee went to Southeast Asia on March 5.
[273]  I read this month's issue of The Open Door and realized that the brothers and sisters in the Lord wanted to know where my younger brother, Tang Shing Brother Tang Shou-ling is.
[274]  This is why all the brothers and sisters in the Lord care about my brother as if he were their own flesh brother.
[275]  The post office's handling of printed material is very slow.
[276]  In this publication: 1 We will not have a definite number of pages.
[277]  We will do our best to put all the news into it that we receive while we are in the editing process.
[278]  We hope that our readers will pray much for the work of God, the workers, and for the churches in all the localities.
[279]  There is a branch store of the Gospel Book Room in Hankow.
[280]  Any locality near Hankow that wants to buy publications from our book room can buy them directly from Hankow.
[281]  Those who live in Hankow should go to Gospel Court, Hsiao Tung 1 Alley.
[282]  We have received the fourth issue of The Open Door, and we have learned that many co-workers are pioneering in the interior under God's direction, particularly in Yunnan.
[283]  I spontaneously sang hallelujah when I saw this situation.
[284]  The three of us went out into the streets for seven afternoons passing out gospel tracts and preaching.
[285]  The bustling crowds would gather to listen as we shouted out the gospel.
[286]  On the last Lord's Day evening, we prayed together in one accord and committed the newly established church in Ku-Jiu and the responsible brothers Brother Gung and Brother Ruan to God and His word of grace Acts 20:32 .
[287]  At the end of last year, I went to Bai-Chien-Ji in Lien-Shui County to work.
[288]  The Lord revived several of the people and saved several entire families together with some sinners.
[289]  I was with Brother Hwa Shi-bin in Huang-Yen for a twelve-day conference from February 27 to March 10.
[290]  The main points of Brother Hwa's messages were on God's eternal, unchanging plan and how it is being carried out throughout the ages until it is realized.
[291]  I left Yung-Jia on the twenty-fifth of last month and went with Brother Hwa Shi-bin and Brother Huang Li-chuan to Rue-An.
[292]  I held a conference with Brother Hwa in the independent church in Rue-An.
[293]  Then I went with Brothers Hwa and Huang to Ping-Yang to visit the brothers on the second of this month and held a conference for five days in Fang-Yen-Hsia.
[294]  Today I came with Brother Hwa and Brother Chen Chin-fa to Hsiao-Nan County of Ping-Yang.
[295]  The Lord willing, we will visit the brothers in Shan-Men of Bei-Jiang County.
[296]  Yesterday, I read the third issue of The Open Door and rejoiced to learn that the work in the remote areas is actively being pursued.
[297]  Brother Hu Yi-min invited me to go with him last year, but my business and family entangled me, and I dared not agree rashly.
[298]  However, I am very concerned about the work, and it seems as if I have already gone there.
[299]  God led Brother Chen Bing-hsi to Chang-Pu to pioneer the work there.
[300]  He met several times in Yeh Jeng-kuang's home in Pu-Yi.
[301]  Later, a Presbyterian minister invited Brother Bing-hsi to pray for a sister and to cast out a demon in her.
[302]  There were not many people in the edification meetings for the sisters in Sien-You, but it was of the Lord.
[303]  Thank Him for manifesting His presence and His co-laboring.
[304]  There are many new ones in our meetings now.
[305]  Seven or eight have confessed the Lord since the Chinese New Year conference.
[306]  We thank the Lord because almost every day people seek us out to ask questions about the truth!
[307]  Every time I mention the name Jesus, I feel so sweet, and I feel that the Lord is so close to me.
[308]  1 Brother Chen Ke-san will go to Feng-Ting, Pu-Tien, Sien-You, Foochow, and Yu-Si to work in the near future Pu-Tien, Fukien.
[309]  2 Brother Chai Tze-chung will continue to help the believers in Chuenchow Pu-Tien, Fukien.

[312]  NEWS OF THE CHURCHES A Letter from Brother Chou Shing-yi,
[313]  My mother, sister, and I arrived safely in Shanghai from Mo-Gan-Shan on the tenth of this month.
[314]  Brother Tang Shou-ling, Brother Sun Wen-yuan, Sister Yu Siao-ke, Sister Yeh Chui-chung, and their families are temporarily staying on the mountain.
[315]  I was originally going to travel with the brothers and sisters, but God gave me a clear leading and miraculously opened a way for me to come, so I came before Brother Tang and the others.
[316]  I received your letter from Chungking and reckoned that it had taken more than a month and a half to get to me.
[317]  It is really terrible that the communication is so poor.
[318]  On February 24 I received a letter from Ning-Hai.
[319]  The brothers are scattered because of the war, and it is difficult to get messages to one another.
[320]  When I received your letter, it was as if I were seeing your face.
[321]  Your remembrance of our brothers and sisters in Shao-Shing is with the same burden as our remembrance of the brothers and sisters in other localities.
[322]  Although I have never met you, we are connected because of the Lord Jesus' precious blood, so I dare to write this letter and tell you of my news to comfort the hearts of the brothers and sisters who are concerned.
[323]  I left Nanking with my mother and brother last August 25.
[324]  In the past few months, I have deeply felt the pain of severed fellowship with the brothers and sisters.
[325]  Through The Open Door I have learned about the situation of the brothers and sisters and the condition of the churches, and feel very comforted!
[326]  All things really work together for good to those who love God.
[327]  He opened a way for us to pioneer the gospel into the interior regions.
[328]  Peace to my dear Brother X in the Lord:
[329]  The brothers in Chefoo have all been kept safe by the Lord's grace.
[330]  I received The Open Door and was happy to see some news of brothers that I know, as well as the condition of the work.
[331]  I was called by the Lord two years ago, but because of my personal situation, I was slow to submit.
[332]  I did not feel peaceful to remain in my work, but whenever I preached the gospel, my heart was filled with joy.
[333]  I wanted to quit twice to go preach the gospel, but I was not bold enough to quit and work for the Lord.
[334]  I often prayed to the Lord and debated with Him, saying, "If You do not want me to work, take away my job.
[335]  When I got to Brother Tze-sien's place, I intended to spend some time with the brothers in the Lord and be edified, as well as to learn some hymns and to understand more of the Bible, after which I would begin my work for the Lord.
[336]  In these days, so much has happened, but our God is faithful.
[337]  What God Himself has ordained, no one can change.
[338]  Therefore, even though we passed through the darkest, stormiest days, the victorious Lord still led us to this place.
[339]  I received The Open Door twice and read both issues.
[340]  He really showed me that He is calling His children to do His holy work.
[341]  Beloved sisters in the Lord, Miss Lee, Mrs. Yuan, and Miss Chang:
[342]  Although we passed through danger several times, I did not feel at all afraid, because God was with me.
[343]  Sister Tang Mei-lih sent a letter from Shanghai on April 11 saying that Sister Lee Shi Sai-ho fell out of a car and was injured.
[344]  Brother Ho Yueh-chiao sent a letter from Shanghai on April 14 saying that The Christian cannot be sent to any locality in Shantung province except for Chefoo and Tsingtao.
[345]  The name list of the responsible ones in each church in Wu-Yi contained both elders and deacons and deaconesses.
[346]  Wu Jou-shiang, Gu Zhang-feng, Hsu Chi, Chui-feng, and Chu Hwei-ai are all deaconesses.
[347]  I am sending this as a correction Ding Keh-chang.
[348]  Reading The Open Door has reminded me of your work in the Lord.
[349]  Meeting of a Few Co-Workers in Northern Kiangsu
[350]  We trust by the Lord that you continually remember us and are concerned about our situation before God our Father.
[351]  For this reason, we are writing this letter to tell you about the matters concerning us so that your hearts may receive comfort and joy.
[352]  The God who bears our burdens has heard our prayers and answered the prayers of His children.
[353]  Many people have been raised up to take responsibility for the work of prayer.
[354]  The entire county of Tai-Shun has about two hundred villages.
[355]  Indeed the Lord has saved many people through sufferings.
[356]  I went south to Yen-Ping on the fifth of this month.
[357]  I stayed for a week and fellowshipped with the sisters.
[358]  Thank the Lord for giving me a good opportunity to testify for Him to my family, relatives, and neighbors.
[359]  On the trip home I have done my best to visit the brothers and sisters in the Lord.
[360]  The X dollars that Brother X offered for the brothers and sisters in Hankow who are escaping the war were sent the day before yesterday to Brother Lan in Hankow.
[361]  After returning from Malaga, I had three small Bible studies with the brothers.
[362]  I combined the X dollars and X cents that I received there with another X dollars and sent it to Hankow.
[363]  Although it is not very much and cannot solve the problem, I ask my Lord to bless these five loaves and two fishes.
[364]  I hope you can go to Hong Kong to wait for a boat to Southeast Asia after you finish your work in Chungking, Ch'eng-tu, Kuei-yang, and K'un-ming.
[365]  Although the work is of the apostles, we must exhort the brothers and sisters in each locality to be "always abounding in the work of the Lord."

[369]  Greetings to the brothers and sisters who inherit grace with us:

[371]  The Lord began to work in San-Ban-Gang three years ago.
[372]  Brother Hu Siao-lan from the church in Dong-Gou came to visit us occasionally.
[373]  3 and 4 of The Open Door, we learned about the condition of the work in all the places in China and about the travels of the brothers and sisters.
[374]  The brothers and sisters here were scattered into the countryside three months ago.
[375]  We have passed through all kinds of dangers in the past one hundred days, but we thank our God for leading us through safely.
[376]  The church in Ch'ang-sha has not had a local person raised up to be an elder.
[377]  I cannot release my burden for the meetings, so I feel that I should remain in Ch'ang-sha temporarily.
[378]  Brother Lan Tsi-yi wanted me to completely drop everything regarding the meetings in Ch'ang-sha when I was in Hankow.
[379]  He asked me whether I could go to Hankow to help with the Gospel Book Room and to rest.
[380]  The Lord has not yet given me a vision concerning this work, yet I have had the faith to do it all along.
[381]  We received all twenty copies of The Open Door which you sent and have distributed them to the brothers and sisters.
[382]  Thank the Lord that we can still receive the news concerning the travels of the brothers and sisters and the work, even though we are in an unstable environment.
[383]  However, the brothers need more growth in spiritual life to stand firm for the Lord.
[384]  The Lord's servants, Chen Jai-seng, Chai Tze-chung, and Chen Ke-san, have gone there to work, as have other brothers who love the Lord.
[385]  Enclosed please find X dollars collected from the offering box for the work in the remote regions and X dollars for the brothers and sisters in need.
