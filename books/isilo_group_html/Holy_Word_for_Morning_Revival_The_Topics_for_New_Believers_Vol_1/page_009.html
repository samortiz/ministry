The Bible tells us that Christ is the image of God [2 Cor. 4:4b; Col. 1:15]<sup>41</sup>....Romans 9:21 tells us that God created us and chose us that we might be vessels to contain Him. Hence, we were not only created according to the image of Christ, but we were also created as vessels instead of instruments....God did not create us as instruments to work for Him; instead, He created us as vessels to contain Him.<sup>42</sup><h2 class="head1">God Created Man with a Spirit</h2><p>The second striking point in the creation of man is that God created man with a spirit....Genesis 2:7 says that God formed man of the dust of the ground. No doubt this refers to man&#8217;s body as the framework of man&#8217;s being....After God formed a body for man, God breathed the breath of life into man&#8217;s nostrils. Dust does not have any life, but the breath of God has life....In Genesis 2:7 the word for breath in Hebrew is neshamah. It is used also in Proverbs 20:27, which says, &#8220;The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah.&#8221; This indicates that the very breath of life breathed into man&#8217;s body became man&#8217;s spirit. This is confirmed by Job 32:8, which says, &#8220;But there is a spirit in man, / And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.&#8221; In this verse a spirit in man and the breath of the Almighty are in apposition, indicating that the spirit of man and the breath of God are one. The spirit of man is the breath of God, and the breath of God is man&#8217;s spirit.<sup>43</sup> [Furthermore], man&#8217;s body and man&#8217;s spirit came together to produce a living soul (Gen. 2:7)....A human being is a soul with two organs. The outward organ is the body; the inward organ is our spirit, which is the breath of life. Thus, in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 we are told that a whole man is composed of spirit, soul, and body.<sup>44</sup></p><p>The tripartite man was created with a spirit to be the receiver and container of the divine life (Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27).<sup>45</sup> A radio has a receiver within it so that it can receive, contain, and express the radio waves from the air. The outward box of the radio is not good enough. It needs an inner recipient, an inner receiver. Within us there is also a receiver, and this receiver is our spirit.</p><p>Zechariah 12:1....ranks the spirit of man with the heavens and the earth. It says that the Lord is the One who stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him....This shows that only these three things are important and vital in this universe. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God. Here you have the purpose of the universe, the meaning of the universe. The heavens with all the stars and planets are for the earth. The earth is not for the heavens but for man. Without the earth, man could not exist. The earth is just right for us to live to fulfill our purpose. Man is not for education, for clothing, for food, for housing, or for entertainment. Man is good only for God. Man is a God-bottle, a vessel to contain God.</p><p>As God-bottles, we need a God-receiver. God is Spirit (John 4:24). Since God is Spirit, we need a spirit to receive Him. Only our spirit can receive the Spirit. Only our spirit can touch the Spirit. Only our spirit can contain the Spirit.<sup>46</sup></p><p> If we did not have a spirit...we would become meaningless. Also, if there were no God in the universe, the whole universe would become empty....Without God being the Spirit and without us having a spirit to contact God, [to contain God], to be one with God, the whole universe is empty and we are nothing. By this we can see the importance of our spirit.<sup>47</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
