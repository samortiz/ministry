HAVING PARTNERS IN CHRIST</h2><p>We need to have a normal Christian life as well as a normal church life. Individually, we need to grow in life; corporately, we need to be built up in life. We need a normal daily life for the church life. A normal church life helps us to have a normal Christian life. One of the first things we need in the church life is to have partners, companions. All the believers are partners of Christ to carry out God’s economy (Heb. 1:9; 3:14). The apostle Paul also had partners such as Silas, Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and many others (Acts 15:40; Rom. 16:21; 2 Cor. 8:23; Philem. 17). Practically speaking, it is good for us to have one or two saints in our age group to be our partners. We can call on the Lord and help one another to flee youthful lusts together (2 Tim. 2:22). We can stir up one another to love the Lord and study the word together. We can pray for our friends and go to preach to them together. It is so good to have partners in Christ to experience life and grow together. Our partners make the church life more real and more dear to us.<h2 class=head1>II. PREACHING CHRIST TO BEGET MEMBERS FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>[The gospel is Christ, who is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, reaching us as the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God for our enjoyment.] [My intention is to impress you that in the universe and today on this earth there is something called the gospel which we are reminded and commanded to live for. The Lord commanded us to live for this gospel uniquely. What are we living on this earth for? Do we live for our profession or for our job to make a lot of money? What is man living for? Poor human society has so much activity but no goal. Do we have a goal? Our goal is the gospel, and our gospel is the Triune God processed to be the very Spirit within us as our salvation, as our life, as our life supply, and as our all-inclusive enjoyment. What a wonder and what a dory to live uniquely for such a gospel. I have been living uniquely for this gospel for over fifty years. Hallelujah for this! It is worth it!]<p>The preaching of the gospel is the carrying out of God’s economy in life. Many of our friends, neighbors, and relatives around us have never heard the gospel and are not saved. Their destiny is eternal perdition, without God, without hope. We must allow the life in us to flow into them through the preaching of the gospel. Make a name list of your friends, neighbors, and relatives. If you do not have enough friends, make more friends at school. Pray with your partners and by yourself for the ones you are burdened for. Your prayer will bind the devil who is holding them captive and will loose them for the Body of Christ (Matt. 18:19). Then go with the authority of Christ (Matt. 28:18), and preach to them the gospel, the good news. You may use the booklet, The Mystery of Human Life, or other appropriate literature. If they would not believe, do not argue, just continue to pray for them. If they respond to what you are saying by smiling, they are the sons of peace (Luke 10:6). They have received faith through hearing your preaching (Rom. 10:17). Then you should lead them to repent, call, pray, and believe. After they pray they are ready to be baptized into the Triune God immediately (Acts 2:38; 8:36-38; 16:33; 22:16; Matt. 28:19). We must practice this every week.
