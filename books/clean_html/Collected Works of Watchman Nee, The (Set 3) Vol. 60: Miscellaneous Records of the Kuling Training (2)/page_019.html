<h2 class="head1">THE ONLY CRITERIA FOR RECEIVING SALVATION&mdash;<br />THE HEART TOUCHING THE LORD</h2><p>Luke 7:36-50 speaks of a sinful woman being forgiven of her sins. She was full of gratitude to the Lord for the forgiveness she received. She realized that the multitude of her sins had not stopped the Lord from forgiving her. This led her to appreciate the Lord's love. She was not conscious of any condition for believing; she simply felt the Lord's compassion. She touched the Lord with her heart, and she was full of gratitude for His salvation. That was all she did to be saved. Believing simply means touching the Lord with the heart. In preaching the gospel, our emphasis should not be on how much men understand salvation. As long as they touch the Lord once, their sins are forgiven. The woman was forgiven of all her sins because she loved much. Once she exercised her love to touch the Lord, she was saved.</p><p>In Luke 18:13-14 the Lord said, "But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner! I tell you, This man went down to his house justified rather than that one; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted." Here was a man who was saved. He did not have to make any so-called commitment. He did not have any spiritual knowledge. He only felt that he was a sinner and prayed for God to be propitiated to him. That was all he did to be saved. When a man comes to God, we do not have to worry if he understands the truth of the gospel. As long as his heart turns to God, he is saved. For this reason, we do not have to pay too much attention to what we preach concerning God's accomplishments for us. All we need to do is to make the sinners feel that they have sinned and make them come to God.</p><p>Luke 15 speaks of the parable of the return of the prodigal son. He was able to return home because he came to himself. This is all that was needed. Once the prodigal son came to himself and decided to turn back to his father and confess his sin, he was saved. In saving men, we do not have to make them understand too much. It is enough to have a sincere heart to come to God. We can help them understand the truth of the gospel later.</p><p>Luke 19:1-10 is the story of Zaccheus's salvation. His "seeing" was similar to the "touching" of the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5:25-30). Many people pressed against the Lord, but He did not feel anything. As soon as the woman with the issue of blood touched Him, however, He felt something. The look of Zaccheus was the same. Once he looked, the Lord's attention was drawn towards him. Our Lord does not save anyone who does not care to be saved; He saves only those who are eager to be saved. He does not save the pressing ones; He only saves the touching ones. He does not save the noise-loving crowd; He only saves those who have come purposely to look for Him. Zaccheus was saved because he was intent on seeing the Lord. His penetrating concern earned him the Lord's salvation. Once a man's heart stretches out, the Lord's attention is drawn to it.</p><p>In Luke 23:39-43 we find the two thieves being crucified with the Lord mocking Him at the beginning. Before one of them died, however, he suddenly had a change of heart. He said to the Lord, "Remember me when You come into Your kingdom." His heart was stirred up to touch the Lord, and his whole being was drawn forward. Although his words missed the mark, the Lord knew his heart. The Lord was not wrong. He answered him, saying, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise." As soon as the thief's heart was stirred up, the Lord saved him. His salvation was not dependent on the amount of doctrine he knew.</p><p>In John 4:1-10 the Lord preached the gospel to the Samaritan woman. He did not explain the truth of the gospel to her in detail. He did not tell her how He was going to die for her. He only said, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water." The Lord's word shows that God is willing to grant men salvation. As long as a sinner says in his heart, "This is the Savior that I need," he will be saved immediately. We have to follow our Lord's example. The most economical way to preach the gospel is to save the most number of men with the least amount of teaching.</p>
