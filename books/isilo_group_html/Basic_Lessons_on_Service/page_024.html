Matthew 26:30 says that after the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup, the Lord and the disciples sang a hymn. Then they went out to the Mount of Olives. Hebrews 2:12 is a strong verse telling us that after Christ's resurrection He declared the Father's name to the disciples and praised the Father in the midst of the church. Then Ephesians 2:18 says that through Christ (who died on the cross and who created the one new man of two peoples) and in the Spirit we come to the Father. This is a brief definition of the dispensing of the Triune God. John 4:23-24 says that the Father today seeks after those who will worship Him in their human spirit and in truthfulness. We worship the Father in our spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit and in Christ the Son as our reality who becomes our genuineness and sincerity for the true worship of God. We need to impress the saints with the truths revealed in these portions of Scripture.</P><P>In the previous lesson, we shared concerning the practice of remembering the Lord at His table. Now we want to speak concerning worshipping the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WORSHIPPING THE FATHER</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. After Eating the Bread and Drinking the Cup</H2><P>Matthew 26:26-30 shows that we should worship the Father after eating the bread and drinking the cup. Verses 26-29 show us that the bread was broken and eaten and that the cup was drunk. Then in verse 30 there is the singing of a hymn to the Father, showing that the worship to the Father must be after eating the bread and drinking the cup.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By Praising</H2><P>We worship the Father by praising. This is also based upon Matthew 26:30. This is a unique verse telling us that a hymn was sung. That means to praise. According to the Greek text, we may say that they "hymned a praise" to the Father. To worship the Father at the Lord's table, we have to sing hymns of praise to Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Christ, the Firstborn of God,<br>Taking the Lead among His Brothers</H2><P>Christ, the Firstborn of God, takes the lead among His brothers to sing hymns of praise to the Father. Hebrews 2:12 says, "I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You." The literal meaning according to the Greek is "I will hymn You." Matthew 26:30 and Hebrews 2:12 show us the worship of the Father at the Lord's table. In what kind of meeting can Christ sing hymns of praise to the Father in the midst of His brothers? Matthew 26:30 gives us the answer. Matthew 26:30 is a precious verse showing us that it was after the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup that Christ took the lead to sing hymns of praise to the Father among the disciples.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Service &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
