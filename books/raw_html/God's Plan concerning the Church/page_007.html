        <h2 class="head2">Being to God Himself</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is for us to be His sons and to be holy so that we can be to Him, that is, so that we can be brought into God and be mingled with Him as one. Being brought into God and being mingled with Him are the issue of God&rsquo;s life; this life makes us His sons and transforms us. The extent to which we let God&rsquo;s life transform us is the extent to which we are brought into God; and the extent to which we are transformed by God&rsquo;s life is the extent to which we are mingled with God. When we are transfigured into His glorious image, we will be brought completely into God and fully mingled with Him.</p>
<p>Romans 6:3 says that we have been baptized into Christ; that is, we have been brought into Christ through baptism. Everyone who has been baptized was baptized into Christ, that is, brought into Christ. This was planned and determined by God in eternity. Then in time through Christ&rsquo;s redemption God accomplished His plan so that we can be to Him, that is, so that we can be brought into God and mingled with Him as one.</p>
<p>To be holy is for God to mingle with us; to be brought into God is for us to be mingled with God. When the holy city, New Jerusalem, appears, this mutual mingling will be complete. At that time, God will be fully mingled with us, and we will be fully mingled with God. He and we will be completely mingled to become one, being inseparable, and having the same nature and the same glory. This ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s eternal plan will be accomplished in the future, but we can experience it today. When we are in our spirit, we sense that God is mingled with us and that we are mingled with God to the extent that God flows out of us. Many saints have had such experiences. These experiences prove that our mingling with God into one is practical.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s primary purpose in having the church is to work Himself into man and to work man into Himself so that He may have a union with man and be completely mingled with man. When God made a counterpart for Adam, He said that it was not good for man to be alone (Gen. 2:18). This indicates that it is not good for God to be alone in the universe. God needs a counterpart in the universe, and this counterpart is the church that He planned to gain. The church is God&rsquo;s counterpart. Without the church to match Him, God is alone, which is not good for God. This means that it is not good for man to not be joined to God as God&rsquo;s counterpart. When God gains the church and when man becomes God&rsquo;s counterpart, God and man will be fully joined and mingled together. Then God will be satisfied, man will be at rest, God&rsquo;s problem will be solved, and man&rsquo;s problem will also be solved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING THE MULTIFARIOUS WISDOM OF GOD<br />
KNOWN TO SATAN AND HIS ANGELS</h2>
<p>On the one hand, God&rsquo;s eternal plan concerning the church is for the man whom He loves to have His life and be mingled with Him. On the other hand, God&rsquo;s eternal plan concerning the church makes the multifarious wisdom of God known to His enemy, Satan and his angels, that is, to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies (Eph. 3:10). Satan thinks that he is shrewd and clever; he does not know that he always gives God the opportunity to express His wisdom. Satan&rsquo;s tricks give God the opportunity to express His wisdom. God&rsquo;s wisdom is fully expressed, because Satan provides a contrast.</p>
<p>The history of the whole universe is like a play. A good play always involves changes in the plot to demonstrate the wisdom of the playwright. The plot of the play of the universe has numerous rich and epic developments that express God&rsquo;s wisdom. In the universe the church can fully express God&rsquo;s wisdom. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 4:9 says, &ldquo;We have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s wonderful doings in the believers are manifested to the men of the world and to the angels, especially to the angels who followed Satan to rebel against God, so that they may know the multifarious wisdom of God. God&rsquo;s creation is wonderful because it can express God&rsquo;s wisdom, but God&rsquo;s creation expresses only a part of God&rsquo;s wisdom. God&rsquo;s wisdom is fully expressed only in His making fallen sinners into His sons to be His church.</p>
<p>After God created man, Satan came in to seduce man, which caused sin and death to enter into man, making man a sinner with a record of sin before God. This was Satan&rsquo;s trick to prevent God from reaching His purpose in man. However, God became flesh and lived on the earth as a man in order to accomplish His plan as a man. From the day that this man, Jesus, was incarnated, Satan searched for opportunities to destroy Him. Satan seemed to eventually succeed when He was crucified. With Christ&rsquo;s death, Satan must have thought that God could no longer do anything. Satan did not know that Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion afforded God the opportunity to deal with all his tricks in humanity. Through the death of the Lord Jesus, God dealt with man&rsquo;s record of sin and the power of sin in man. Furthermore, the death of Jesus gave God an opportunity to express His resurrection power.</p>
<p>Satan put the Lord Jesus to death, but God raised Him from the dead. This resurrection dealt with the death that Satan had injected into man and enabled man to receive God&rsquo;s uncreated life. When God&rsquo;s life enters into someone, he is changed inwardly and brought into God in order to become a member of the mystical Body of Christ to express everything of God. This mystical Body of Christ will become the New Jerusalem in the future to fulfill God&rsquo;s desire and express God&rsquo;s glory. Then Satan will be silenced in awe of God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom. The &ldquo;plot&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s redemption expresses His wisdom. The emphasis of God&rsquo;s plan is not individuals but the church.</p>
<p>In addition, because sin entered into man, God gave the law. When the law was given, the children of Israel also came under the law of the commandments in ordinances. Hence, the law of the commandments in ordinances became a wall of partition that separates the children of Israel from the Gentiles, that is, separates into two the people whom God chose in eternity for the accomplishing of His plan. The law, however, gave God a further opportunity to express His wisdom. Ephesians 2 says that God abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances and broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross; thus, Christ created the two into one new man, into His mystical Body (vv. 14-16, 18), which is the church, in the Holy Spirit through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection from the dead. In producing the church, God dealt with the problem of the law of the commandments in ordinances so that His wisdom might be expressed through the church. Therefore, all the matters pertaining to the church express the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>Colossians 2 says that in Christ &ldquo;dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&rdquo; (v. 9) and that &ldquo;all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden&rdquo; in Christ (v. 3). This means that the wisdom of God involves everything of God. Without God or His power, God&rsquo;s wisdom is empty. God&rsquo;s wisdom cannot be expressed without Himself as the resources or without His power as the driving power. God&rsquo;s wisdom can be manifested because He is the resources and because His power is the driving power. God expresses His wisdom through the church by expressing Himself and His power, that is, by expressing everything of God. Through the church God is making known His multifarious wisdom to Satan and his angels; that is, God is manifesting all the fullness of the Godhead through His power and through His work in the man whom Satan corrupted.</p>
<p>When the condition of the church is normal and spiritual before God, men sense that the church has a method, way, wisdom, and power that are not of man. There is something in the church that is beyond worldly knowledge and capabilities. This is God&rsquo;s wisdom. Many eminent scholars acknowledge respectfully that something is in the church and in the people who fear God and belong to Him. That something is God Himself, God&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<p>God is the wisdom of the church. When a church lives before God, it manifests wonderful things that are not seen in the world. However, when a local church loses its divine nature and its heavenly position, it cannot express God&rsquo;s wisdom. We are not yet in that glorious day, but men can see God&rsquo;s wisdom in a church that is according to God&rsquo;s standard.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s wisdom involves everything of God, which today is hidden in Christ. When we partake of Christ, we partake of this wisdom. God has made Christ wisdom to us (1 Cor. 1:30). Christ is wisdom and everything to us from God. When we live by Christ, live Christ, and let Christ live in us, we will be wise and have a way. Then we can experience and express everything of God. If the church is full of Christ and lives Christ out, it will express God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom before Satan and his angels and put them to shame. This is God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church in relation to Satan. God intends to deal with Satan, the power that rebelled against Him in the universe, through the church. God wants to express His wisdom to Satan through the church in order to put Satan to shame and to silence him.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
