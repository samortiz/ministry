<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>To Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>We received all your letters. Please do not worry about anything. Sister Chang Yi-hwa from Ning-Po sent a letter saying that they are all well. Sister Wang Ai-juan has already come to Shanghai and will teach in Hwei Feng Girls' School. Mrs. Shen Guang-ling has not been well recently. Mrs. Shen Chui-fen is very well now and can walk a few steps by herself. Sister Ho Shao-ying married Brother Chu Chen. Sister Yin Hsia-chin has not found a teaching job for next semester. I (Sister Yi-feng) will continue teaching as a tutor for Fu's family next semester. God has led me through everything. I really thank Him! I (Sister Yu-ying) will continue to tutor for Shen's family next semester. The last letter I sent home to Jia-Shing on November 4 has not been answered. I do not know where my father, brother, or sister-in-law are. God is never wrong in what He wants us to pass through. Please pray for them that they would write me a letter telling me how they are. Chi Wen-ju and Mrs. Zhu Ming-sheng's sister have come to Shanghai. Please do not worry. Sister Hu Hsi-hsin has not found a teaching job for next semester.</p><p>Sister Di Hwei-jia of Yi-Shing sent a letter after Mu-Wei Girls' School in Sung-Jiang was destroyed. In the past she had only heard people talking about trusting in God and believing that all things are God's will, but she did not understand them. However, now she has tasted it. She said one thing that really touched me, "Now is the opportunity to know what it means to live according to one's environment and to live in Christ. The visible things will all pass away, but the eternal things will never be lost." She also said that God loved her so much this summer that she was able to be baptized; this bears special significance for her. We have not received any letters from her since Yi-Shing capitulated. Please pray much for her and her family. Mrs. Hsu Chang Hsiu-feng can come to the meetings now. Peace in the Lord! Greet Sisters Wang and Chang for us.</p><p>Your sisters,<br />Yi-feng, Yu-ying<br />February 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I am praying to God to see whether He wants me to teach in the mornings. I am asking Him if He wants to give me a position as a teacher. If God does not want me to, I am willing to obey. May God direct me in the way in which I should walk so that He may gain me and so that I may not hurt His heart. Rather than sadden the Lord, I am willing to hurt myself. Thank and praise God. He poured His own love on me richly. I am very well physically. Sometimes I am weak, but whenever I go to God, all the weakness passes away. Last week Sister Yi-feng and I went out every day to visit the sisters because it was winter vacation. I really feel that some sisters are very dear before God. Visiting the sisters can really help ourselves as well as teach us how to pray. Thank God for gracing us in these past two weeks. God has shown us much light through Mr. Nee. He spoke about the matter of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. It could not have been clearer. The outlines included: (1) the work of the Comforter in the Christian's heart, (2) the work of the Spirit poured out on our body, and (3) every believer needing to live a life "full" of the Holy Spirit. The last few days feel like days of showers. Many people have received blessing, but we do not know what fruit will be born in the future. There is the need for many supporting prayers.</p><p>Sister Chi Wen-ju arrived in Shanghai from Jien-Teh last month. I have already introduced her to a teaching post at Hsieh-Tsin School. Sister Wu Pei-shueh also has a teaching job at Hsieh-Tsin now. Altogether, six sisters are there. May they have a good testimony in the school to glorify God. Sister Ding Chung-jen is studying obstetrics at Dr. Ai's place on Hsin-Ja Road. She will graduate in six months. We have no news from Sister Jin Bao-jieh from Ping-Hu and Sister Di Hwei-jia from Yi-Shing. I have heard that Sister Wu Jen-han of Jiang-Yin is in Nan-Tung. Sister Liu Hwei-fen returned to Tientsin because her mother was physically weak. Mrs. Si Jiu-rong had a baby girl last week. Peace in the Lord. Greet Miss Wang, Miss Chang, and Mrs. Yuan. Sister Kao Ya-luh just came to see me. She said that her nephew has moved from Soochow to 106 Cheng Street, Jin-Kou Town, Wu-ch'ang. He does not need help financially, but if someone there knows him, it would be good if he could visit him. (A letter from a brother in Wuhan said that Jin-Kou Town was more than twenty miles from Wu-ch'ang, so they have not been able to visit him yet&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Your sister,<br />Wang Yu-ying<br />February 12</p>
