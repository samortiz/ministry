[1]  Christ as the Spirit in Romans for the Divine Sonship
[2]  Christ as the Spirit in 1 and 2 Corinthians for the Building Up of the Body of Christ
[3]  FOR THE DIVINE SONSHIP Scripture Reading: Rom 1:3-4; 8:26-30, 14-17; 5:10; 8:2, 9-10
[4]  From Romans to the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, the New Testament Epistles reveal that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.
[5]  Christianity has made a mistake in saying that Christ is Christ, the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit, and They are separate.
[6]  BEING FOR SONSHIP IN THE MAIN PART OF THE BOOK
[7]  However, there is a difference between Christ and us.
[8]  Only after the portion on redemption is there the main part of the book, from 5:12 onward, which speaks of sonship, that is, of the sons of men being designated the sons of God by the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of life.
[9]  As the continuation of Romans, 1 Corinthians is a book of building.
[10]  Romans brings us to the point that we are the Body, but it is the following books that tell us how the Body is built up.
[11]  THE SEALING SPIRIT AND THE SPIRIT AS THE PLEDGE
[12]  Second Corinthians 1:22 says that God has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.
[13]  We must never forget this verse that speaks of the sealing Spirit and the Spirit as the pledge.
[14]  Whereas the seal marks us out as God s inheritance, God s possession, the Spirit as the pledge is an earnest, guaranteeing that God is our inheritance and possession.
[15]  In 2 Corinthians, therefore, we have the Spirit as the sealing Spirit, the Spirit who gives us the foretaste of all that God is to us, the Spirit who gives life, the liberating Spirit, and the transforming Spirit.
[16]  May we all keep in mind the foregoing titles and aspects of the Holy Spirit: the Spirit of life, the Spirit of the divine sonship, the Spirit of building, the manifestation of the Spirit, the Spirit of sealing, the Spirit of pledging, the Spirit who gives life, the Spirit who liberates, and the Spirit who transforms.
[17]  God s intention is to be our enjoyment in Christ as the Holy Spirit.
[18]  the State of the Flesh to a State of Glory
[19]  In many passages, the Holy Spirit in Greek is literally the Spirit the Holy.
[20]  Romans shows us that Christ as the Spirit of life comes into us for the purpose of sonship in holiness that we may be completely transformed and conformed to His image to be the sons of God in full.
[21]  Since 1 Corinthians is a book of building, the Spirit mentioned in this book is the Spirit of building.
[22]  OF THE GOSPEL IN GALATIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 16:23-24; 2 Cor 13:14; Gal 3:1-3, 5, 8-14; 4:6; 5:25, 22-23; 6:8 THE TRANSMITTING SPIRIT IN 2 CORINTHIANS 13:14
[23]  Before we consider the Spirit in the book of Galatians, we will review the revelation of the Spirit in 1 and 2 Corinthians.
[24]  The center of the gospel is Christ, and Christ is realized as the Spirit.
[25]  This gospel has the promise that God will put His Spirit into the man who is fallen to the uttermost to be the Spirit of the Son, the Spirit for our living, the fruit-bearing Spirit, and the Spirit unto whom we sow and of whom we reap.
[26]  IN EPHESIANS THROUGH HEBREWS Scripture Reading: Eph 1:13-14; 2:18; 3:16; 4:3-4, 23; 6:17; Phil 1:19; 3:3; 4:12-13; Col 1:8; 1 Thes 1:5; 4:8; 3:13; 5:19; 2 Thes 2:13; 2 Tim 1:14; Titus 3:5; Heb 3:7; 9:8; 10:15; 6:4-5; 10:29; 9:14 THE SPIRIT FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST IN EPHESIANS
[27]  Ephesians 1:13 and 14 speak of the Spirit as the seal and the pledge cf.
[28]  In Ephesians 3, the Spirit is the strengthening Spirit, the Spirit who strengthens us into our inner man v. 16 , and in chapter four the Spirit is again the uniting Spirit vv.
[29]  The only explicit mention of the Spirit in Colossians is in 1:8, which speaks of the believers love in the Spirit.
[30]  This book does not speak much about the Spirit because it deals with Christ as the Head directly.
[31]  Thus, we go on to 1 Thessalonians 1:5 which says, For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, even as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.
[32]  Then 4:8 says, Consequently, he who rejects, rejects not man but God, who also gives His Holy Spirit to you.
[33]  There is an additional item, however, in 9:14, that tells us that Christ offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, the Spirit the eternal Gk.
[34]  This means that the Spirit is not only eternal but that the Spirit is eternity.
[35]  CHAPTER SIX THE SPIRIT IN JAMES THROUGH REVELATION Scripture Reading: James 4:5; 1 Pet 4:13-14; 1:11; 1 John 2:20, 27; 3:24; 4:13, 15; Jude 20; Rev 2:1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18, 29; 3:1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 22; 4:5; 5:6 THE SPIRIT OF ENVY IN JAMES
[36]  James 4:5 says, Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy ?
[37]  The law in the Old Testament tells us that God is a jealous God Exo 20:5 , and 2 Corinthians 11:2 also speaks of the jealousy of God.
[38]  The Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord, is a Spirit of jealousy.
[39]  Jude 20 says, But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.
