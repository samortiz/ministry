   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Causing Enmity between the Seed of the Serpent</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Seed of the Woman</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Adam and Eve were waiting for death, thinking themselves to be under the sentence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, the mention of a seed came as glad tidings to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They thought it was impossible for them to have a seed because they were doomed to die immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Adam heard that the woman was going to have a seed, he called his wife's name Eve, which in Hebrew means "living."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As Adam and Eve were awaiting the sentence of death in fear and trembling, there suddenly came the glad tidings that this woman would have a seed, and Adam spontaneously said, "Living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You are not dying, you are living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your name is Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You are living."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have seen in message seventeen, when Adam first saw Eve in Genesis 2:23 he was excited, saying, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in Genesis 3 Adam was also excited.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of receiving the sentence of condemnation, he heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So, Adam called his wife, "Living."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have all heard these glad tidings and we all should call ourselves "Living."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you ask me my name, I will tell you that my name is "Living."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God preached the gospel in verse 15, and Adam reacted to the gospel in verse 20.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If Adam had not reacted to the gospel, he would have called his wife "Dying," saying, "Poor woman, don't you know that you are the cause of death?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your name should be Dying."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, after Adam heard God's preaching of the gospel he was happy and called his wife's name Eve "Living."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The whole world today is under the sentence of death, and we must go to them proclaiming Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the people hear the glad tidings of Genesis 3:15, receiving the gospel and responding to it, they will shout, "Now we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 Enmity between the Seed of the Serpent</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and the Seed of the Woman</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The seed of the serpent are the people who follow Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible uses various terms to describe them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 3:7 they are called the "brood of vipers."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Matthew 13:38 they are designated "the sons of the evil one."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus referred to them as being of their father, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1 John 3 the Apostle John said that everyone who practices sin is of the Devil v. 8 ; he also used the term "the children of the Devil" v. 10 . All of these titles indicate that the people who follow Satan are the seed of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether they are called brood of vipers, sons of the evil one, or children of the Devil, the meaning is the same: they are the seed of the serpent and they persecute and fight against the Lord Jesus and the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The seed of the woman is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was born of the virgin Mary Isa 7:14; Matt 1:23; Gal 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, He is truly the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the very seed prophesied in the glad tidings proclaimed by God Himself in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the One who bruised the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is great enmity between the people who follow Satan and the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2 The Seed of the Woman</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Bruising the Head of the Serpent</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus, the seed of the woman, has bruised the head of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord has destroyed Satan, the one who holds the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is fully revealed in Hebrews 2:14 and 1 John 3:8.</S>
