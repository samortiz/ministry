   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. A BOOK OF CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation is a book of conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the book of Revelation were deleted from the Bible, there would be a great shortage, for there would be a beginning but no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although there is the beginning in the book of Genesis, without the book of Revelation there is no conclusion or consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After having a good start and after passing through so many works, there is the need for God to have a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without Revelation, there is no conclusion of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is great; He is a God of purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the fulfillment of His purpose, His economy must be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Bible students have neglected the matter of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we did not have Revelation, we could not see the consummation of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In fact, we would even find it difficult to realize what God s economy is, because we would not see the result, the issue of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in this book the revelation of God s economy is so clear because it contains the conclusion of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without Revelation, we would also have no conclusion to the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ came in the flesh and died on the cross to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But what does redemption accomplish?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To say that Christ s redemption only saves sinners and brings them to heaven is a very poor conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of conclusion is not so meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in Revelation we see that Christ redeemed us, purchasing us with His blood, to make us a kingdom and priests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, this book discloses the conclusion of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 1:6 says that Christ has made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The believers redeemed by the blood of Christ have not only been born of God into His kingdom John 3:5 , but have also been made a kingdom for God s economy, which is the church Matt 16:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John, the writer of this book, was in this kingdom 1:9 , and all the redeemed and reborn believers are a part of this kingdom Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One of the main aspects of this book is that God is recovering His right over the earth to make the whole earth His kingdom 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ came, He brought in the kingdom of God with Him Luke 17:21; Matt 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kingdom has been enlarged into the church Matt 16:18-19 , which will bring in the consummation of the kingdom of God to the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, the kingdom of God today is in the church, but on the other hand the kingdom of God is coming through the overcoming believers 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then Christ and the overcoming believers will reign over all the nations in the millennial kingdom 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The redemption through Christ s blood has not only made us a kingdom to God but also priests to Him 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The kingdom is for God s dominion, while the priests, being those who express God s image, are for God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the kingly, royal priesthood 1 Pet 2:9 for the fulfillment of God s original purpose in creating man Gen 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kingly priesthood is being exercised in today s church life 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It will be intensely practiced in the millennial kingdom 20:6 , and it will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem 22:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The book of Revelation also presents a wonderful and marvelous consummation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this book we see God s economy, Christ s redemption, and the church s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without Revelation, we could read the Epistles again and again without realizing that the church is Christ s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In which of the Epistles do we see the churches shining as lampstands in the dark night?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only in the book of Revelation do we see this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Revelation, the churches firstly are the shining lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, in eternity, the church will be the New Jerusalem, a golden mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the wonderful consummation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The present situation is a lie, and we should not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not just say, How evil is the Catholic Church and how pitiful are the Protestant churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must look at the other side, the eternal side, where we see the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even today, during the dark night, we have the shining lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Along with God s economy, Christ s redemption, and the church s testimony, Revelation also discloses the enemy s destination.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we did not have the book of Revelation, we would not know what Satan s destiny is, and no one would be able to understand why God has been and still is tolerating the subtle, evil, dirty Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, if we get into this book and see the conclusion of Satan s record, we shall be happy and laugh at the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, in Revelation we have the conclusion of four major things God s economy, Christ s redemption, the church s testimony, and Satan s destiny.</S>
