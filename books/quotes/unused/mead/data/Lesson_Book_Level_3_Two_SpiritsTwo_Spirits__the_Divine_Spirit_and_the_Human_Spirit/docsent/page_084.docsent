   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Mingling of the Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with His Redeemed 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Father's Nature, the Son's Redemption,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and the Spirit's Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Jerusalem is a composition of the divine Trinity with God's redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First of all it is composed of God the Father's nature, signified by the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The city and its street are made of pure gold 21:18, 21b , denoting God the Father in His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The twelve gates of the New Jerusalem, which are twelve pearls 21:21a , signify God the Son's overcoming death and His life-imparting resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An oyster is a small animal which lives in the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It has a life which overcomes the death waters, and by secreting a life element, it produces pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ's overcoming death plus His life-imparting resurrection secretes the "juice" of the divine life to form us into pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So in the pearl we can see the Son in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The pearl signifies God's redeemed and regenerated people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to John 3, regeneration is the entry into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You cannot enter into the kingdom of God unless you are born of the Spirit John 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regeneration is the entry, the gate, into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The precious stones signify the transforming work of God the Spirit Rev 21:11, 18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After regeneration, the Spirit continues to transform the regenerated people of God to make every one of them a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By this you can see that the New Jerusalem is a composition of the Father as the substance, of the Son as the entry, and of the Spirit as the transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a building of the Trinity with redeemed, regenerated, and transformed humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Consummation of the Divine Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The entire New Jerusalem is saturated with God the Spirit as the river of living water which flows out of the throne of God the Father and of the Lamb, God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the river the tree of life grows Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The life water, God the Spirit, quenches thirst, and the life tree, God the Son, nourishes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The entire city, which is a composition of the Trinity with His redeemed people, is watered, nourished, and saturated with the divine life, which is nothing less than the Triune God Rev 22:1-2, 14, 17 , dispensing Himself to saturate His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What a picture this is!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a blending of the Triune God with His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The nature of the Father is the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The redemption of the Son, including His death and resurrection, is the entry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And the Spirit's transformation is the work to make us divine and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a composition is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is saturated by the eternal life, which is the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the consummation of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I look to the Lord that through these messages you may see a vision of God's economy, God's goal, and what God is doing to reach His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What God is doing is dispensing Himself as the Father, the source, as the Son, the expression, and as the Spirit, the very entering in, into you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Day and night He is working on this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is working toward this one goal, that we all would be a lampstand in this age to express the Triune God, and eventually that we would be that bride in eternity, a composition of redeemed and regenerated humanity saturated with the Triune God as life.</S>
