<h2 class=head2>C. Godliness with Contentment</h2><p>In verse 6 Paul says, “But godliness with contentment is great gain.” Concerning the expression “contentment,” Vincent says, “An inward self-sufficiency, as opposed to the lack or the desire of outward things. It was a favourite Stoic word.” The expression “great gain” means great means of gain. It mainly denotes the blessings in this age—godliness plus self-sufficiency and the ability to be free from greediness and the cares of this age.<p>Paul’s mention of gain in verses 5 and 6 brings him to the matter of dealing with money lovers in verses 7 through 10. For this reason, he uses the conjunction “for” to join verses 6 and 7.<p>Once again I would point out that because we pay attention to these details, we have come to know the Bible in the way of life, light, and spirit. We do not claim to know the Bible more than others do in geography or history. Neither do we claim the ability to recite more verses. But we can testify that by the Lord’s mercy and through the help of great Bible teachers who have gone before us, the Lord has shown us much light. The Lord has given us light, life, and spirit through the Word. The Psalmist once declared, “The entrance of thy words giveth light” (119:130). Furthermore, the Lord Jesus said, “The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life” (John 6:63). We praise the Lord for giving us light, life, and spirit!<p>The Lord Jesus was raised in a carpenter’s home in Nazareth and was regarded as one who was unlearned. But there can be no doubt that He had tremendous light, life, and spirit. To have light, life, and spirit does not depend on one’s scholarship or degrees. On the contrary, our confidence in our education can hinder us from receiving light, life, and spirit through the Word.<p>In 6:7 Paul goes on to say, “For we have brought nothing into the world; it is evident that neither can we carry anything out.” This has been wisely ordained by God that we may trust in Him for our needs and live by Him in order to express Him without preoccupation or distraction.<p>Verse 8 continues, “But having food and covering, with these we shall be satisfied.” Although the word covering refers to clothing, it may include dwelling. To be satisfied is to have sufficient provision for our needs.<h2 class=head2>D. The Desire to Be Rich</h2><p>In verse 9 Paul says, “But those who resolve to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into ruin and destruction.” The resolve mentioned here is related to the strong desire to be rich. This is the love of riches, not the possession of them, that leads the avaricious into temptation. Some are actually rich; others have only a strong desire for riches. This evil desire ruins and destroys them. Ruin here implies destruction, and destruction implies perdition, both temporal and eternal. Those who resolve to be rich fall into a snare, as into a net, and also into many foolish and harmful lustful desires, which cause men to drown or sink into ruin and destruction.<p>In verse 10 Paul concludes, “For the love of money is a root of all evils, which some having aspired after have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.” Paul says that the love of money is a root of all evils. He does not say that it is the only root. The Greek word rendered aspired after means craved for, longed for. Those with this craving have wandered away from the faith; they have been led astray from the contents of our belief, from the truth of God’s New Testament economy.
