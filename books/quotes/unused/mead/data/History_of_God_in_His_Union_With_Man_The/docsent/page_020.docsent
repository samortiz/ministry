   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The more you read a book like Genesis, the more you must admit that the Bible is really a record of God's movements; it is the history of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You cannot say that the record in Genesis is merely a record of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While it is a record of mankind, it is not primarily such.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis is primarily a record of God, then of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without God there would be no way for man to be here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is the Initiator; He is the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then man came into existence from God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, if Genesis is a record of man, it must certainly be even more the record of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GOD'S INTENTION TO HAVE MAN FOR HIS EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the last message we saw God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was the origin of His history.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not come from anywhere, because He is self-existing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have no human words to explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has no parents, no genealogy, no origin Heb 7:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when He was there in eternity past, He began to move.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We saw in message one that He firstly began to form an economy, to make an arrangement, according to His heart's desire for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was the beginning of His move.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, in that move there was a council among the three of the Godhead, among the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and a strong determination was made.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He wanted to have mankind so that He could have an organism to express Him, represent Him, and even be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This organism would be His enlargement, His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible shows us that eventually after God moves so much throughout all the centuries, the New Jerusalem will come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Jerusalem is God's enlargement, as Eve was Adam's enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since God as the very substance of the New Jerusalem is embodied in Christ the Lamb and since the New Jerusalem is called the wife of the Lamb Rev 21:9 , it is absolutely right to say that the New Jerusalem is the enlargement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>GOD ENTERING INTO TIME THROUGH CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After God formed His economy and determined to create man and to have Christ, the Second of the Trinity, die an all-inclusive, vicarious death, God walked out of eternity and entered into time by means of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Creation is a matter in time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was God's first step into time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Time began with God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When God created, He created the heavens with the angels, the stars, and the heavenly bodies first.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He also created the earth with all the things upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then one of His creatures, the chief archangel, became rebellious, and God judged him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This angel became God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, in God's history which exists in time, God first had an enemy due to a rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because there was a rebellion, the heavens and the earth were polluted, and therefore God judged not only Satan but also the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The heavens and the earth became devastated, and the whole universe became darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is what is mentioned in Genesis 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 1 concerns the preadamic age, but our age begins in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Genesis 1:2 says, "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word and at the beginning of verse 2 indicates that verse 2 is an additional event.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not mean that verse 2 is an explanation of verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 1 includes all the matters that we have covered in the previous messages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then after verse 1 more things happened: "And the earth was without form, and void."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A better translation of the word was here is became: "And the earth became waste and void."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Isaiah 45:18 says that God did not create the earth as a waste, but here in Genesis 1:2 we read that the earth became waste and void.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates that after the earth was created, it was judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The judgment came because of Satan's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Genesis 1:2 also says that darkness was upon the face of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The deep indicates deep water; hence, darkness was upon the deep water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Bible darkness and death frequently go together Job 10:21-22; Isa 9:2; Luke 1:79 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may even say that darkness is a sign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was the situation of our earth under God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It became waste and void, and darkness, implying death, was upon the deep water.</S>
