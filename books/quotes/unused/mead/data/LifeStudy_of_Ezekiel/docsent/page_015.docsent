   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GLOWING ELECTRUM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s intention is not simply to burn us and turn us into ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is a good God with a good purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is His purpose in blowing upon us as the wind, in covering us as the cloud, and in consuming us as the fire?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The answer to this question is that out of the fire appears the glowing electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The burning of the divine fire is for the manifestation of the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Hebrew word for electrum is very difficult to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In his note on Ezekiel 1:4 in his New Translation, J. N. Darby says that the Hebrew word denotes an unknown substance; some think a mixture of gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One Jewish version uses the word electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Electrum is an alloy of gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Gold signifies the nature of God, and silver signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The King James Version renders the Hebrew word as amber because the color of this shining metal is the color of amber, which is somewhat like the color of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Electrum is not merely gold nor merely silver but gold mixed with silver.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the book of Revelation we can see the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Revelation 22:1 speaks of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The One on the throne is not just God and not just the Lamb but the Lamb-God, the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Genesis 1 God was solely God, but in Revelation 22 He is our redeeming God, our Lamb-God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Revelation 4:3 God, the One on the throne, was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jasper, which is dark green, signifies God as the God of glory in His rich life, and sardius, which is red, signifies God as the God of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fact that the appearance of God on the throne is like a jasper stone and a sardius indicates that God is no longer just God but also our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These illustrations from Revelation 22 and 4 help us to understand the significance of the electrum in Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our God is not merely the divine Being signified by the gold; He is also the redeeming God, signified by the silver.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No longer is He just gold He is electrum, gold mingled with silver.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we experience the blowing wind, we enjoy the covering cloud and then we pass through the burning, consuming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The result is the glowing electrum, something shining, lovely, precious, and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the electrum, the Lord Jesus is the One who has redeemed us and who is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is our God, our Lamb, our Redeemer, our jasper, and our sardius.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we consider our spiritual experience, we will realize that the One who dwells within us today is the Lamb-God, the One signified by the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the sight of God, before we were saved, we were base and wicked, having nothing that was honorable or glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord that He saved us and regenerated us!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His wind, His cloud, and His burning fire have made it possible for us to have Him, the redeeming God, within us as the glowing electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we have Him as the treasure in the earthen vessel 2 Cor 4:7 , and we have thereby become a people of honor and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to consider how precious and honorable is the Christ who is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the electrum within us, He is the treasure of incomparable worth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This treasure is the issue of the wind, the cloud, and the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we pass through the wind, the cloud, and the fire, the more the electrum is constituted into our being, making us a people who are filled with the Triune God and who manifest His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all need to experience more of the spiritual wind, the overshadowing cloud, the burning fire, and the glowing electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By passing through this kind of experience, we become the vision of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In our experience we have the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then whenever we meet together, we are the vision of the glory of the electrum, having a precious treasure that is shining and glowing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE BASIC EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What we have been considering in this message is the first vision seen by the prophet Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This vision portrays the most basic experience among all the spiritual experiences of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are various categories of spiritual experience, but this experience is the first, and basic, category the category of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not experience the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the contrary, this experience is a cycle which should be repeated again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today we may experience the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, and then after a period of time the wind comes again, followed by the cloud, the fire, and the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This cycle should be repeated again and again throughout our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From this we see that, in a sense, we Christians have no rest in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have been a Christian for over forty-five years, and I have never had any rest from this cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, there has been a continual experience of the blowing wind, the covering cloud, the burning fire, and the glowing electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every time this cycle is repeated, more of the electrum is brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It would be awful for this cycle to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our experience the cycle of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum should never stop.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more we experience this cycle, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It would be wonderful if we daily experienced the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the real experience of the inner life, and this will bring in the growth in life.</S>
