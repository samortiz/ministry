   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NIMROD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nimrod was a mighty hunter before the Lord Gen 10:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was a mighty one in the earth, a person who was absolutely independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He built a kingdom for himself, and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although many Christians know that mankind constructed the tower and city of Babel, few realize that the kingdom of Babel was formed by Nimrod.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first kingdom in human history was probably the kingdom of Babel formed by Nimrod, who also built the great city of Nineveh in Assyria.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His building was a sign that mankind was completely independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Abraham, on the contrary, did not build anything but a little altar.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He dwelt in a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Noah likewise did not build anything except the ark and an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The people who put their trust in God do not engage in much building activity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we place our confidence in God, the less independent building we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only the giant workers those who are independent of God will construct their high towers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE PEOPLE AT BABEL</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The people at Babel held a council Gen 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They did not pray nor ask the Lord what they should do or where they should go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Human history is a history of councils.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After World War I the League of Nations was formed, and this league was actually a council.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the end of World War II the League of Nations was changed into the United Nations, which has a huge building in New York where council is held nearly every day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such human councils are utterly independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The result of the council at Babel was the construction of a high tower for man's name and the formation of a city for his possession Gen 11:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>LOT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although Lot was a saved person, he drifted away from the line of life by making a choice according to his own sight Gen 13:10-11; cf. vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Lot separated himself from Abraham, he lifted up his eyes, looked at the plain of the Jordan, and made a decision according to his own sight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not pray, "Lord, I do not know what I should do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lord have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Take Your choice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I want to take Your choice."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lot did not pray in this way, but made a choice according to the sight of his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, he moved toward the evil city of Sodom Gen 13:12-13; cf. v. 18 . Whenever you take a course in independence of God, be assured that your way will be downward.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Your way will be in the direction of the sinful city of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>V. ESAU</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we read the history of Esau, we find that, ethically speaking, he did nothing wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jacob seemed to have been much worse.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Esau, however, was a hunter, hunting for his own satisfaction Gen 25:27, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Esau hunted independently of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, for the purpose of satisfying his appetite, he sold his birthright Gen 25:30-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the people who are independent of God have sold their human birthright, the enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since God created man in His own image to be His expression, it means that, by birth, man has the right to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, every human being has a birthright, the right by birth to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, nearly everyone has sold his birthright because of his independence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What does it mean to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Repentance means to have a change in our thinking, in our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Formerly, I was moving in a certain direction with my back turned toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After I heard the gospel I turned around.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the meaning of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To believe in the Lord Jesus means to come back to our human birthright, to come back to the enjoyment of God and to the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the meaning of repentance and belief in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Esau did not do this, but moved in the opposite direction.</S>
