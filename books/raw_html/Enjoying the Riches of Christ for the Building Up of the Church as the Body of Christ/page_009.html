<h2 class=head3>Ascension and Descension</h2><p>After resurrection is ascension. Ascension is to bring man to the throne. Then following ascension is descension. Descension is the coming down of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4). What is the work of the Lord as the Spirit today? It is to bring Christ, the Head, into His Body. How much we are built up depends upon how much Christ is wrought into us as the Head. This is the meaning of descension. Today, it is altogether a matter of working Christ into us in His descension.<h2 class=head3>Christ’s Second Coming</h2><p>God needs all the foregoing steps, but this is not yet the end. The end of the steps is Christ’s second coming, the time of the rapture. At this time Christ will be fully wrought into His Body, not in all of His believers, but at least in a group of overcomers. Christ as the Head will be wrought into this group of overcomers, and these overcomers will be the bride ready for His coming (Rev. 19:7).<h2 class=head2>Christ Bringing the Head into the Body</h2><p>We may feel that the preaching of the gospel is to make people happy and peaceful. To Christ, however, the preaching of the gospel is to bring the Head into people. As I share Christ with you, I am bringing the Head into you. Now after Pentecost, the Lord Himself as the Spirit—the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power—is constantly working on us to bring Himself as the Head into His Body, that is, to work Himself into us. Salvation is not merely for salvation; salvation is to bring the Head into the Body. Growth in life is not merely for the growth in life; it is to bring the Head more and more into the Body. To overcome our temper is also not merely to overcome our temper; this means very little. To overcome our temper is to bring Christ as the Head into the Body.<p>Today we Christians may not have this concept. We are too religious, too natural, too personal, and too selfish. We may think salvation is something only for us and that to overcome our temper and the world and to be spiritual, holy, divine, and heavenly are a personal matter. Yet all these things are for bringing the Head into the Body. If we care for bringing the Head into the Body, we will be in the heavens. If we care for this, our temper and even the world will mean nothing to us, but if we do not care for bringing the Head into the Body and only care for victory over the world, we will have a difficult job. The more we try to overcome the world, the more the world will overcome us. Likewise, if we are only for brotherly love, we will never have brotherly love. Brotherly love is for the Head to be brought into the Body. Today everything is for bringing the Head into the Body. All the gifts, including the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, are for bringing the Head into the Body. Whatever work we do and whatever we are should be for bringing the Head into the Body. If by our receiving these messages the Head works Himself more into us, that is wonderful; otherwise, these messages are in vain.<h2 class=head1>THE REVELATION OF CHRIST AND THE VISION OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>It is truly difficult to say who Christ is and what Christ is because He is too wonderful and all-inclusive. He is too much for us to comprehend. Many verses are required to make known who Christ is. What I have spoken here is not my own teaching. I am simply opening up the verses concerning Christ.<p>The church comes out of Christ’s dispensing. In the Bible both the revelation concerning Christ and the vision concerning the church are marvelous. We can never exhaust the understanding of these two items. Because many of us have been frustrated and distracted by old teachings, it is better for us to forget all these teachings. We may have thought that we knew the church and that we knew Christ. Whenever someone spoke about Christ or whenever we heard the term church, we may have said, “I know that. I know Matthew 16:16 and 18.” Actually, we did not know very much.
