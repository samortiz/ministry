21 The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior to be the people of the kingdom is represented by a leper
The kingly Savior came to save men from their rebellion and to cleanse them from their leprosy that they might become His kingdom people
91 The centurion, a Gentile, recognized the authority of the kingly Savior and realized that His word had the authority to heal
He believed not only in the kingly Savior but also in His word, asking Him not to go in person but only to speak the word
The diseases healed in the cases recorded in Matthew 8 are significant, for every disease signifies a specific spiritual sickness
The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior to be the people of the kingdom is represented by a leper
17 So that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled saying 1He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases
At that time, during the great tribulation, the Jews in the eyes of God will be 'in a fever' , 'hot' in things other than God
After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the kingly Savior will come back to this remnant of the Jews that they may be saved
161 Many who were demon possessed and all those who were ill represent all the people on earth in the millennium
The millennium is the last dispensation of the old heaven and old earth thus it is considered the evening of the old heaven and old earth
The casting out of demons and the healing of the sick in this age are only a foretaste of the extensive power of the coming age
In Matthew's record, which proves that Christ is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, the order is according to doctrine; i
In Luke's record, which reveals that Jesus is the proper man to be man's Savior, the order is according to morality
In John's record, which testifies that Christ is the Son of God and even God Himself, the order is somewhat according to history
In this age the application of this divine healing power can be only a foretaste to us; in the coming age we will experience the full taste
The temperature of the Jews today is very high in their fervency for politics, industry, agriculture, and warfare
20 And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head
In saying this, this disciple, who was not a scribe, overly considered the cost of following the King of the heavenly kingdom
If you do not expect any material enjoyment and if you will leave the dead duties to the dead, you can go on to follow Him
181 In His ministry as recorded in the four Gospels the Lord always withdrew from the crowds He did not want the curious ones to be with Him
8:24 And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves; but He was sleeping
As the Lord and the disciples were sailing across the sea something in the air and under the sea began to cause them difficulty
The King rebuked the winds and the sea because in the winds were the fallen angels of Satan and in the sea were the demons
The King called Himself the Son of Man but the demons called Him the Son of God tempting Him to deviate from His standing as the Son of Man
The King complied with the demons' entreaty to enter into the hogs because hogs are unclean in the eyes of God
As God He not only has authority over the natural environment and over demons He also has the full authority to forgive people of their sins
9 And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man sitting at the tax office, called Matthew, and He said to him, Follow Me
11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?
There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him
After being saved, Matthew was so grateful to the Lord that he opened his house and prepared a feast for Him and His disciples
In verse 12 we see the Lord's reply to the Pharisees' question: 'Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill'
In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, the King of the heavenly kingdom ministered as a Physician, not as a Judge
A judge's judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician's healing is according to mercy and grace
The Lord's word here implies that the self-righteous Pharisees did not realize that they needed Him as a Physician
14 Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?
15 And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they?
16 No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made
John the Baptist's ministry was to introduce people to Christ that Christ might become their Redeemer, their life, and their all
Some of John's disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to some of his practices, and made those practices a religion
Meanwhile, they condemned the disciples of Christ, who did not fast but had Christ with them and lived in His presence
The kingly Savior first healed His followers, and then made them the sons of the bridechamber; eventually, He will make them His bride
To sew a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment means to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth
The old garment in verse 16 signifies the good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices produced by man's old, natural life
He is the Bridegroom, the new garment, the new wine, and also the corporate vessel to contain what we enjoy of Him
These miracles are grouped together to present a meaningful doctrine; that is, they have a dispensational significance
At the end of this age salvation will come back from the Gentiles to the Jews not the scattered ones but to the Jews in the house of Israel
At that time the Jews will be sick of a fever-fervent in science, in finance, in education, and in all manner of worldly pursuits
As the Lord was feasting with all those sick ones, He revealed Himself as the Physician to heal them, not as a Judge to condemn them
18 A ruler came and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live
The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue represents the Jews, and the woman with the hemorrhage represents the Gentiles
The woman here and the centurion in 8:5-10, both representing the Gentiles, came to contact the Lord in the same way-with faith
Dumbness caused by demon possession signifies man's inability to speak for God and praise God because of his worshipping of dumb idols
331 The dumb man's speaking signifies that our speaking and praising ability is recovered by our being filled with the Lord in the spirit
36 And seeing the crowds He was moved with compassion for them because they were 1harassed and cast away like 2sheep not having a 2shepherd
The continuation of the King's ministry in chapter nine enabled Him to reveal Himself as the Shepherd and as the Lord of the harvest
The King of the heavenly kingdom considered Himself not only the Shepherd of the sheep but also the Lord of the harvest
In verse 38 the Lord told us to beseech the Lord of the harvest that He may thrust out workers into His harvest
In His economy, God has a plan to accomplish; then there is the need for His people to beseech Him, to pray to Him, concerning it
From now on, whenever you sense the need for workers, you must first pray to the Lord of the harvest, saying, 'Lord, here is Your harvest
The twelve disciples prayed for the Lord of the harvest to send out reapers, and the Lord answered their prayer by sending them out
14 And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet
It is not an insignificant matter to be sent by the Lord, for as sent ones, we become the Lord's representatives
Rejecting the Lord's apostles and their words will bring more punishment than will the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah
17 And beware of men, for they will deliver you up to sanhedrins, and in their synagogues they will scourge you
21 And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death
It is very significant that the Lord exposed the Sanhedrin and the synagogues as being opposed to God's economy
The King's authority deals with the unclean spirits and diseases; the Father's Spirit deals with the opposers' persecution
We should learn to face persecution not in ourselves, but learn to turn to our spirit and trust in the indwelling Spirit
Verse 25 says, 'It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master
It was changed contemptuously by the Jews to Beelzebul, which means the lord of the dunghill, and was used for the ruler of the demons
Because the heavenly King is establishing His kingdom on earth, warfare between these two kingdoms is inevitable
The fighting instigated by the usurping Satan against the heavenly King's called ones is waged even in their own household
He asked to take their cross and follow after Him, that is, to take the will of God by putting themselves aside
Verse 39 says, 'He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
After that, John was put into prison , where he waited, expecting that Christ would do something to deliver him
In the Lord's answer to John mentioned the blind's receiving of sight, because there had been no such miracle in the Old Testament
Implies that John the Baptist might have been stumbled because the Lord did not act on his behalf according to his way
All the prophets prior to John prophesied only that Christ was coming, but John testified that Christ had come
Although John saw the incarnated Christ and introduced Him to people, he did not have the resurrected Christ indwelling him
The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue represents the Jews, and the woman with the hemorrhage represents the Gentiles
In 10:1-15 we have the appointment of the twelve apostles and the way to spread the gospel of the kingdom to the house of Israel
Those sent by the heavenly King shall be opposed by today's religious organizations just as Judaism opposed the apostles
17 And say, We have 1played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have 1sung a dirge, and you did not mourn
19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners
When John the Baptist was conceived, it was said that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah
The kingdom people are the children of wisdom, who justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom
231 Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament , is the place where the souls and spirits of the dead are kept
The Lord was the first party, the cities were the second party, and the Father, who was with Him, was the third party
He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself
2 But the Pharisees, seeing this, said to Him, Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath
5 Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?
Just as David and his followers were not held guilty, so Christ and His disciples should not have been condemned
Now the coming of Christ changed the dispensation again, this time from the age of the law to the age of grace, in which Christ is above all
In this case, a case concerning the priests, there was a turn from the temple to a person who is greater than the temple
In the first case the king broke the Levitical regulation; in the second case the priests broke the sabbatical regulation
In verse 8 the Lord indicated the third turn, a right- asserting change from the Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath
20 A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory
22 Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb, and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw
24 But the Pharisees, hearing this, said, This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons
29 Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man?
Now we must see that in order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established there is the need of a spiritual battle of spiritual fighting
According to verse 24, they said, 'This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons'
He has his authority and his angels , who are his subordinates as rulers, authorities, and worldrulers of the darkness of this world
By the Lords word here we see that the battle fought for the kingdom is not fought by just a man himself but by a man with the Spirit of God
An idle word is a nonworking word an inoperative word a word that has no positive function and is useless unprofitable unfruitful and barren
In verse 37 the Lord concludes, 'For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned'
The establishment of the Kings rejection is continued in verses 9 through 14 with His kingly salvation to turn from the Jews to the Gentiles
Today many of His followers have become bruised reeds that can no longer give a musical song and many no longer burn as a bright light
According to verse 36, 'Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment'
The heart of the earth is called 'the lower parts of the earth' and Hades , where the Lord went after His death
Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections, the section of torment and the section of comfort
According to doctrine, first Christ had to die and be resurrected; then He would build the church and speak the word of wisdom
43 When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it
45 Then it goes and takes along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter in and settle down there
Since a demon cannot find rest in dry places, it returns into the human body that it originally possessed and settles down there
After this, as the Lord Jesus was speaking to the crowds, His mother and His brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to Him
Whoever does the will of His Father is a brother who helps Him, a sister who sympathizes with Him, and a mother who tenderly loves Him
12 For whoever has it shall be given to him and he will abound but whoever does not have even that which he has shall be taken away from him
At the end of chapter twelve, the heavenly King, having been fully rejected by the leaders of the Jewish religion, made a break with them
The boat, which was in the sea but not of the sea, signifies the church, which is in the world but not of the world
If you do, then you must leave the house and not stand on the seashore, but get into the boat close to the Lord
The one who does not have is the opposing and rejecting Jew, from whom what the heavenly King has spoken and done will be taken away
5 And others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much earth, and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of earth
8 But others fell on the good earth and yielded fruit, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold
Three things are interrelated: the word of the kingdom, the sons of the kingdom, and Christ Himself as the life within the seed
The wayside signifies the heart that is hardened by worldly traffic and cannot open to understand, to comprehend, the word of the kingdom
The birds signify the evil one, Satan, who comes and snatches away the word of the kingdom sown in the hardened heart
The rocky places that do not have much earth signify the heart that is shallow in receiving the word of the kingdom
The heat of the sun is for the growth and ripening of the crop, which take place once the seed has been deeply rooted
Because of the seed's lack of root, the sun's heat, which should cause growth and ripening, becomes a death blow to the seed
Such a heart gives every inch of its ground to receive the word that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold
In this parable, , we see that the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens is absolutely a matter of growth in life
Because many Christian workers have not seen this, they still think that the church is built up by work and labor
In the past we have pointed out that our heart is not the receiving organ but the loving organ, and that our receiving organ is our spirit
As long as you are either the wayside, the soil with hidden rocks, or the soil with thorns, the kingdom cannot grow in you
24 Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field
When the King's slaves wanted to collect the tares , He said, 'No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them'
The church is not to tolerate the false believers, but both the false and the true are allowed to grow together in the world
In Galatians 2:4 and 2 Corinthians 11:26 Paul mentioned false brothers, saying that he was damaged by the false brothers
The judgment upon the tares will be so serious because they have been confusing, frustrating, and damaging God's economy
That person was like a vacant house which the Lord described with three words: unoccupied, swept, and decorated
The heavenly King went out of the house and gave the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom beside the sea
The first type of soil, the wayside-because of much worldly traffic-corresponds to those who are not poor in spirit and pure in heart
The second, the rocky places, corresponds to those who still have their temper, lust, sin, self, and flesh beneath the surface
The third type of soil, the thorns, is difficult for the seed to grow in because of anxiety and the deceitfulness of riches
The kingdom of the heavens began with the second parable and began to be established when the church was built on the day of Pentecost
39 And the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are the angels
40 Therefore just as the tares are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the consummation of the age
She taught us the stories of the Bible; however, at that time, although she was for Christianity, she herself definitely had not been saved
Among both the Methodists and the Presbyterians, modernistic missionaries taught the people that the Bible was a book of fairy tales
The third aspect of the kingdom, the manifestation, is in the heavenly part, the upper part, of the millennium
There are four classes of people: the normal believers, the abnormal believers, the false believers, and the worldly people
We want to be real and normal believers, real sons of the kingdom who grow Christ by living a life according to the constitution
We have the parable of the sower, who sows the seed to bring forth the constituents of the kingdom of the heavens
The fruit of the wheat in the first two parables and the fruit of the mustard seed here in the third parable are for food
The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth
The birds refer to the evil one and to evil persons, evil matters, and evil things-in short to all evil pertaining to the evil one
The church as the practical kingdom of the heavens with Christ the unleavened fine flour as its content must be a loaf of unleavened bread
Such leavening is absolutely against the Scriptures, which strongly forbid putting any leaven into the meal offering
After the papal system had been established, the many pagan practices which had been brought in were confirmed by that system
In , building up the church, and spreading the Lord's testimony, the only way is to pray and to minister the pure Word
Many of us can testify that we were hungry for years, but that once we came into the church, we were satisfied
In the first four parables in Matthew we have the life growing, and in the next parable we have the treasure hidden in the field
The treasure hidden in the field must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem
Based upon the same principle, the sea also signifies the Gentile world, for the Gentiles are the people corrupted by Satan
After finding it in 16:18 and 18:17, He went to the cross and sold all that He had and bought it for the kingdom
If among us there is no gossip or criticism, but Christ, the church, and transformation, this is a sign that we are the new earth
In God's eyes these overcomers are likened to the treasure hidden in the field and to the pearl out of the sea
In the Lord's recovery the quantity is small, but the quality is higher and more solid, because here we have the treasure and the pearl
48 Which, when it was filled, they brought onto the shore, and sat down and collected the good into vessels; but the foul they cast out
The sea into which this net is cast signifies the Gentile world, and every species signifies all the nations, all the Gentiles
According to Matthew 25 , the King will judge the nations according to the way they have treated His little brothers during the tribulation
The goats , will be cast into eternal fire, but the sheep , will be transferred to the millennium to be the citizens on the earth
Formerly he was a scholar of the Old Testament dispensation, but now he has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens
The enemy in his subtlety caused the mustard seed to grow into a huge tree-a lodging place for birds-that is no longer good for food
Christ redeemed the God-created earth because within the earth, the field, there was the kingdom, the treasure
The net here signifies the eternal gospel which will be preached to the Gentile world during the great tribulation
