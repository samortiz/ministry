   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 With Christ as His Unique Seed</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's blessing of Abraham eventually issues in Christ as the unique seed in whom all the nations of the earth shall be blessed v. 18; Gal 3:16 . In Galatians 3:16 Paul speaks of only one seed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all are included in this one seed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Are we not all in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you know the true significance of the short phrase "in Christ"?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This phrase is used many times in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Christ we have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Christ we are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Christ we have the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything concerning us is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah, we are in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are actually a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ultimately, all the heavenly stars and the earthly sand will be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we have pointed out in the past, the New Jerusalem will be a great, corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the four Gospels we have the individual Christ, but at the end of Revelation we have the corporate Christ including all true believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this one seed, Christ, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have not the United States, Germany, Japan, China, and Great Britain been blessed?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May we all expect that the blessing which we shall receive of God will be the multiplication that will issue in Christ, the unique seed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The multiplication that will spread to Europe, Africa, and throughout the earth must simply be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the churches on earth will just be the multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>f Christ Revealed in Three Ways</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Genesis 22 Christ is revealed in three ways: as the angel of the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>11-12, 15-18; Exo 3:2-6 , as the ram v. 13; John 1:29 , and as the seed of Abraham v. 18; Gal 3:16 . When Abraham stretched forth his hand to kill Isaac, the angel of the Lord prevented him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then Abraham saw a ram and killed it, offering it in Isaac's place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Afterward, it became a blessing in multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This multiplication issues in Christ as the unique seed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we see the angel of the Lord stopping, the ram replacing, and the seed bringing the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All three are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is too mysterious because Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ was the One who told Abraham not to kill his son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then He immediately became the ram caught in a thicket to replace his son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the crucifixion, He became his unique seed in God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The angel of the Lord, who was Christ, provided the ram, a type of Christ, which eventually issued in the seed, who is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not have a small, limited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have a great and unlimited Christ who is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord!</S>
