   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY-FIVE BEING BROKEN c.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Broken</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 32:22-32 relates a crucial experience in the life of Jacob, God's chosen one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is truly an extraordinary portion of the Holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is unique, and there is no other passage in the Bible that is similar to it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, due to the lack of experience, most Christians have not paid adequate attention to this part of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the Lord's mercy, in this message we must consider this vital experience in Jacob's life and be helped by it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jacob's experience in this chapter is very practical, personal, and intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What could be more intimate than wrestling with someone for at least half a night?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord in the form of man wrestled with Jacob "until the breaking of the day" v. 24 . The Lord God would never wrestle with a stranger or with an unbelieving sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Notice that we are not told that the man "came" to wrestle with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no verse which says, "While Jacob remained there alone considering his trouble, the Lord came to wrestle with him."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No, it simply says, "There wrestled a man with him," indicating that the man was already there and that there was no need for him to come.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This reveals that the Lord had been with Jacob all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why did the Lord suddenly begin to wrestle with Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There certainly must have been a reason for it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was due to Jacob's background.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As he was returning to his father's land, he had two problems Laban behind him and Esau in front of him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having been released from the usurping hand of Laban, he was now desperate as he faced the coming confrontation with his brother, Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was at this time that the wrestling took place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jacob's messengers had returned with the report that Esau was coming to meet Jacob with four hundred men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Jacob heard this report, he was terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Jacob's understanding, if Esau was coming to welcome him, there would have been no need of the four hundred men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seemed to him that Esau was like a captain coming with an army.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Undoubtedly, Jacob thought that Esau was coming to smite him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Believing this, Jacob was forced to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After praying an excellent prayer, he divided his gift of cattle for Esau into nine droves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But he had no peace, because his problem was still directly in front of him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, as verses 22 and 23 say, "He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After doing all this, Jacob was alone and was probably considering the situation further and wondering what to do in case Esau would attack him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jacob's burden was heavy, his situation was serious, and he was desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible gives no indication that Jacob prayed when he was alone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times, when you are not troubled, you pray, but when you are deeply troubled, you do not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more you are troubled, the less you pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because the trouble is difficult and the situation serious, you simply cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because you have not yet been knocked down.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No matter how serious the problem is, you have not been knocked down.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Like Jacob, on the one hand we cannot go on, but on the other hand we do not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we remain there and ponder the situation, asking ourselves what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While Jacob was considering how to cope with his problem, much to his surprise, a man began to wrestle with him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I say again that we are not told that the man came and wrestled with him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The text simply says, "There wrestled a man with him."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we read this portion of the Word today, we immediately realize that this man was the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But at the beginning of the wrestling, Jacob did not realize that the man was God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He might have thought that his assailant was one of Esau's four hundred men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When this man began to wrestle with him, Jacob refused to let him prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps Jacob said to himself, "This man has come to arrest me, but I will not let him do it."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At this point we need to ask four questions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, why did the Lord as a man wrestle with Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What was the need of this?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Lord appeared to Abraham, He did so as the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But here we do not see that the Lord appeared to Jacob, but that He wrestled with him as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Second, why could the Lord, who is the Almighty, not prevail against Jacob, a little man?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Third, why did the Lord wait so long before touching the hollow of Jacob's thigh?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why did He not do it at the very beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord must have wrestled with Jacob for at least six hours, perhaps beginning at midnight and continuing until dawn.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why did the Lord tolerate this wrestling for so long?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And fourth, why did the Lord refuse to tell Jacob His name?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On many other occasions, the Lord revealed His name to people, telling them who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But here, after being asked by Jacob to reveal His name, He declined to tell him, keeping His name a secret.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although I do not claim to be able to give a complete answer to all these questions, we can, through our experience, at least partially answer them.</S>
