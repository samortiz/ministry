   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Difference between Salvation and Victory</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some Christians did not know the difference between salvation and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was another cause of uncertainty regarding their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the moment we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, our salvation is secured.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Victory, however, is a matter of overcoming sin, the world, the flesh, the self, and all other negative things in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our eternal destiny as children of God is forever secured by simple faith in Jesus Christ for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But victory is a matter of our daily life and is related to dispensational reward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Difference between Salvation and Reward</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Any Christian who is not clear about the difference between salvation and reward will have difficulty being assured of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This distinction was fully revealed to Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Salvation is by grace through faith Eph 2:8 , whereas reward is the result of working according to the Lord's will Matt 16:27; 1 Cor 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Difference between</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>the Kingdom of the Heavens and Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some Christians hesitated to say that they were saved, because the difference between having eternal life and entering into the kingdom of the heavens was not clear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a person believes in the Lord Jesus for his salvation, he receives eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, one must live his daily life under heaven's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a living is an exercise in this church age and qualifies us to participate in the Lord's millennial rule in the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such participation is a reward for living a life under the heavenly rule and is not a matter of eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Watchman Nee received a thorough and clear revelation concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Kingdom Truths</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Watchman Nee also saw the New Testament truth of the kingdom in its full scope.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He saw that the New Testament distinguishes between the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The kingdom of God includes the entire reign of God from eternity in the past to eternity in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the kingdom of the heavens is a smaller sphere within the kingdom of God; it is the heavenly ruling among the believers in the present church age Matt 5:3, 10 and a reward in the coming kingdom age Matt 5:20; 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All regenerated believers are in the kingdom of God John 3:5 , but only those who live a life under the heavenly rule will inherit the kingdom age as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The kingdom of God is related to salvation, whereas the kingdom of the heavens is related to reward.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rapture</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Along with the revelation of the kingdom, the Lord also gave Watchman Nee revelation concerning rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to current fundamental theology, Christians are told that as long as they are saved, at the Lord's return they will all participate together in a general rapture with the whole church before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But Watchman Nee came to see that not all believers will be raptured at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some believers will become matured overcomers before the tribulation; therefore, they will be raptured first.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The majority of the believers, however, will mature later, so they will be raptured later.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The kingdom is a matter of reward, and rapture is a matter of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The rapture can be compared to a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A crop is not harvested and taken into the barn when it is still green.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It must first ripen into maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All Christians must ripen in life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When they are ripe, the Lord will harvest them and bring them into the heavenly barn.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These two points must be kept clearly in mind: 1 the kingdom is a reward to the overcoming believers, and 2 rapture requires the maturity of the overcomers.</S>
