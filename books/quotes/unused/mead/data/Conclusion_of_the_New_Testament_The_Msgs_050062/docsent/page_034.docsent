   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Head of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Christ is Head of the church, being Himself the Savior of the Body" Eph 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition to being the Savior of the Body, Christ is also the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Savior is a matter of love, whereas the Head is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We love Christ as our Savior, but we must also be subject to Him as our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the Head of the church, His Body, Christ certainly is joined to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as in one's physical body the head and the body are one, so Christ, the Head, and the church, His Body, are joined and therefore are one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Body is one with the Head in the divine life and in the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All that Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained as the Head is not only for the Body but also to the Body Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that what the Head has gained now belongs to the Body, for it is transmitted to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Body, therefore, comes into existence from the transmission of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever Christ has passed through, obtained, and attained is now being transmitted into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Colossians 1:18 says, "He is the Head of the Body, the church; who is the beginning, Firstborn from among the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that Christ is the Firstborn from among the dead indicates that He is the Head of the Body in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before His resurrection, Christ was not yet the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 1 indicates that after His resurrection and ascension, Christ was made the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, Christ's headship is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Christ's headship is in resurrection, the enjoyment of Christ spontaneously brings us into resurrection and saves us from our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because Christ is the Head of the Body, we need to hold the Head so that the Body may grow with the growth of God Col 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For the Body to hold the Head means that the Body does not allow itself to be separated from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we truly hold Christ as the Head, we shall not be separated from Him by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We shall remain in Him without any insulation between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The growth of the Body depends on what comes out of Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not receive the supply that comes from Christ as the Head, the Body cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when the Body is supplied by holding the Head, the Body grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Body grows out from the Head, for all the supply comes from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Body</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians 12:12 reveals that in the church Christ is not only the Head but also the Body: "As the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ here is not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Greek "Christ" in this verse is "the Christ," referring to the corporate Christ, composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as its members.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the believers of Christ are organically united with Him and constituted of His life and element to become His Body, an organism, to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, He is not only the Head but also the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As our physical body has many members yet is one, so is this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a vine includes not only the stock but also the branches, so the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, includes not only Christ Himself but also the members of Christ's Body, who are the members of Christ, parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to our natural constitution, we cannot be members of Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ Himself is the element, the factor, that makes us parts of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, in order to be parts of Christ as members of His Body, we must have Christ wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to become the Body, even the Body-Christ, Christ had to pass through the steps of a process.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First He, the very God, became flesh for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to come into us and work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way He becomes the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now in the church life we enjoy not only God, the Redeemer, and the life-giving Spirit but also the Christ who is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we come together, we share Christ with one another, and the corporate Christ comes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The coming forth of the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, depends on our speaking Him forth in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we speak Christ, Christ comes forth in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we all speak forth Christ, then the corporate Christ will come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the practicality of Christ as the Body.</S>
