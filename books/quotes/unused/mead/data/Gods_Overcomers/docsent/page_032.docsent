   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISCOVERY OF GOD S TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us consider the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This century saw a full revival.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we will consider John Nelson Darby and the revival that he represented.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1827 a group of people were raised up in Dublin, Ireland.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Among them were men like Edward Cronin and Anthony Norris Groves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They saw that many things in the church were dead, lifeless, and formal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They began to ask the Lord to show them the church according to the biblical revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through prayer and fellowship, they felt that they should rise up and meet according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, they began to break bread at a brother s home.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A short while later, a former Anglican minister, John Nelson Darby, began to join their meeting and to expound the Bible among them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Gradually, more and more expositors were raised up among them, such as William Kelly, C. H. Mackintosh, B. W. Newton, and J. G. Bellett.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through reading their books, I received light to see the error of denominational organizations and to realize that there is only one Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church should not be formed by human opinions but should be under the direct leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we consider the present-day church organizations, we see many human traditions and opinions and little direct leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not according to God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God s will, the church should not be under man s control; it should be directed only by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All those who belong to the Lord should learn to be led by the Holy Spirit and should not follow man s direction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are all truths discovered by the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition, the Brethren made many discoveries concerning the millennium, the question of rapture, and the prophecies in Daniel and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were the most prominent expositors of the various types in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The commentary on the Pentateuch by C. H. Mackintosh is the authority in its category.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The evangelist D. L. Moody highly recommended it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Brethren also made a clear separation between the biblical prophecies concerning the Jews and those concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A hundred years ago, many people confused the prophecies concerning the Jews with those for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They considered that the prophecies concerning the Jews were already fulfilled in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In addition to these matters, the Brethren also produced many other writings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During this period, many spiritual brothers were being raised up in England.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition to those named above, there were brothers like Charles Stanley and George Cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The latter wrote a little book called Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It tells people that they can have the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This book has already been translated into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The truths concerning the gospel were fully recovered through these brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Besides these brothers there was Robert Govett who saw the matter of Christian reward.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He discovered that while it is true that a man is saved by faith, he is rewarded according to his works before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Salvation is a matter of life, while reward is a matter of living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>C. H. Spurgeon once said that Govett was a hundred years ahead of his time because his teachings were so profound.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Govett told people that there is the possibility that Christians will be excluded from the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, a believer must be faithful and diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, he taught that not all believers will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only those overcoming and faithful believers will participate in this rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Expositors were raised up one after another during this period.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Another very spiritual brother of great renown was G. H. Pember.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He wrote many commentaries.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There were others also such as D. M. Panton and Hudson Taylor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The latter wrote a book Union and Communion, which speaks of some profound experiences in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The above-mentioned truths were all great discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although these different truths of God were recovered, they cannot be considered God s most central truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Afterward God raised up George M ller in England.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He learned many excellent lessons concerning prayer and concerning faith in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He taught that man should claim God s promises through prayer, and he testified of his way of living by faith in relation to financial needs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the United States there was the Christian and Missionary Alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The prominent ones among them were A. B. Simpson, A. J. Gordon, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They were all very influential.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even Hudson Taylor in England was affected by them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They saw that believers should return to the experience of the apostolic age when men lived by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was a tremendous revelation at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Of course, this truth has become widely known among us today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Gordon and Simpson also discovered the truth concerning divine healing and began to experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This matter spread quickly and was much publicized, and many were attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, Simpson emphasized that it was not the healing but the resurrection life that overcame the weaknesses of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He taught that one can triumph over sickness through knowing Christ as the power and the Deliverer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the same time another group of people were raised up who paid attention to the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>About sixty years ago, God gained a porcelain merchant by the name of Robert Pearsall Smith.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He saw that sanctification comes through consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This kind of sanctification is quite different from the sanctification that Wesley spoke of.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Smith s kind of sanctification came through consecration and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The sanctification that Wesley preached was a life that one gradually attains to after consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Actually, both teachings are of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After the line of Smith, there was Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith who wrote the book The Christian s Secret of a Happy Life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There were also others like Stocknell ?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>, Evan Hopkins, and Andrew Murray.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They continued the line of truth concerning self-denial preached by ones like Madame Guyon two hundred years earlier in the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>These believers began to conduct conferences in Germany, England, and other places.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>These conferences were the beginning of what we know today as the Keswick Convention.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The main speaker at these conventions was Evan Hopkins.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He received help both from Smith and from others like Madame Guyon and exerted a definite spiritual influence in that period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although the truth released by Madame Guyon has never been popular throughout church history, it has exercised a profound spiritual influence upon many people.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even Wesley received help from her.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>John Wesley once said that he wished every believer would read the messages of Madame Guyon and that he owed much grace to her.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God gained such a woman in the seventeenth century and through her brought in the main current of the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In addition to Hopkins, there was H. C. Trumbull who released the truth on the overcoming life at the Keswick Convention.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>These messages brought in a great recovery concerning the knowledge of the overcoming life and the way for believers to experience this overcoming life in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After Hopkins, God gained another sister, Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This sister was very weak physically during the early stages of her life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>She was always bedridden.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>While sick in bed, she read the writings of Madame Guyon and embraced them as her bedside companion.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>She, however, could not believe that the kind of total self-denial, faith, and love described in these writings could ever be practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>One day while disputing and arguing with God, she sought desperately for the Lord to bring her into these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Lord heard her prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>From that time on, she was raised up by the Lord to preach the truth of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Brother Holden, an ex-missionary of the China Inland Mission, came to know the meaning of the cross through reading Mrs. Penn-Lewis s books.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis was one who truly bore the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Through her experiences, many believers were attracted to pursue the truth concerning the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Through these men and women, God led many to realize that the centrality of God s work is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The cross is the foundation for all spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Without the work of the cross, a person will not know what is death and what is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Many spiritual persons received great help through her.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Through the messages she preached, God granted deliverance to many.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We can see that the discovery of God s truth is progressive; the more it advances, the more complete it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>By the end of the nineteenth century, almost all of the truths had been recovered.</S>
