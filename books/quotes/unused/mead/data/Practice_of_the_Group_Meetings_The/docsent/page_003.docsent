   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the old way of meeting, we came together in the meeting hall to listen to a brother who was knowledgeable in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since then we may have divided the large meeting into several group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, in these group meetings some of the new ones may ask questions that we are not able to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are not able to answer the new ones questions in a practical way, this indicates that we do not know how to meet in the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know that we should not return to the old way of meeting, so we may eventually compromise by inviting a knowledgeable brother to come to our group meeting to take care of its needs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This brother then becomes the Bible teacher, the pastor, of the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the one hand, we do have the group meetings, but on the other hand, we may still be in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although we may no longer meet under one roof but in several homes, we may still not be in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may appear to be in the new way but may still be practicing the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To carry out the group meetings we need to learn how to have a practical fellowship, a mutual prayer, the care for one another, and the shepherding of the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first thing we need to care for is a practical fellowship among the attendants related to their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fellowship in the small groups should include such practical matters as the health and circumstances of the saints in the group.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the matters related to the practical life of all the persons meeting in the group should be covered in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of fellowship will spontaneously issue in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the need, we can intercede for each other.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This prayer need not be after the fellowship is over but should be mingled with the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, we must practically care for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not merely pray in spiritual terms; we must also be sent by the Lord to the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we pray that the Lord would do something, we may be sent by Him to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord is omnipotent, but if we do not do something practically to help the brother or sister for whom we pray, our prayer may not be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may pray that the Lord meet the need of a brother who is in need of money, but the Lord may tell us that we must first meet his need from our own resources.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The New Testament tells us that we need to love in practicality and not merely in word 1 John 3:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must have practical fellowship with practical prayer and practical care.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Following this, some can go to visit the person for whom they have prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must go to visit those who are in any suffering and participate in their suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is to shepherd one another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our group meetings should be like this every time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regardless of how strong, rich, or knowledgeable one is, he still desires help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some saints feel lonely but are afraid to seek out fellowship with stronger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is in the group meeting that we can render an adequate, sufficient care for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is in the group meeting that every saint s current situation can be made known.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the attendants of a proper group meeting will be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the practical building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without the group meetings, we may talk about building up but never experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The practical fellowship, prayer, care, and shepherding are the basic factors of the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not practice these, we will have no way to take care of every saint s need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It would take twenty honest, diligent, knowledgeable, and capable elders to shepherd a church of two hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they went out every day to visit and shepherd the saints, the church would be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, it is not practical to have this many full-time elders.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, to care for the saints in this way is against the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Body consists of all the members, and the members take care of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot hire others to take care of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every member should share in the care of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hebrews 10:25 says, Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The phrase the assembling of ourselves together indicates that the meeting spoken of in this verse is our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not forsake the group meetings, which are our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The small group meetings are the meetings of the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without a proper practice of the group meetings, it is not possible to care for and shepherd all the saints.</S>
