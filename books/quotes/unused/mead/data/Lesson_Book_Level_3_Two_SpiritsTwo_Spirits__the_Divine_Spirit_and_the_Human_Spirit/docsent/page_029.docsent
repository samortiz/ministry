   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Before Justification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Peter 1:1-2 says that we were chosen "according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peter says that sanctification comes after the Father's selection and before Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to this verse, the sanctification of the Spirit is unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Surely, this indicates that the sanctification of the Spirit precedes the redemption of Christ....</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In eternity past God selected us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But how could this selection be applied to us?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for it to be applied, there is the need of the Spirit's application.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all can testify of this from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were wandering on earth, perhaps as those who never had a thought concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But one day the "wind" of the Spirit "blew" us to a place where we heard the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While we were listening to the preaching of the gospel, faith was infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way God's selection was applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The next thing to be applied was the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this sense the sanctification of the Spirit preceded our experience of Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I can use my own experience to illustrate this aspect of the Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was born into the religion of Christianity, but, of course, I was not born into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a young person, I became quite rebellious, having seen some things in Christianity that I did not agree with.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But one day, at the age of nineteen, I was arrested by the sanctifying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A young woman evangelist came to our town, and out of curiosity I went to listen to her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As I sat in the meeting, the Spirit asked me, "What are you doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have been pursuing you for a long time, and now is the time for Me to catch you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was indeed caught for the Lord at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I repented and I began to obey Christ and accept what He did.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No doubt, at the same time I received the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, and I experienced the first aspect of the sanctifying work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From that time onward, the Spirit has been continually sanctifying me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even now this sanctifying work, the second aspect of the Spirit's sanctification, is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sanctifying work of the Spirit began before God's justification and it continues afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before justification, we are separated unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>B. After Justification 1.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Positional Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order for us to be holy, we first need to be separated unto God positionally.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With respect to our family, neighbors, colleagues, and friends, we need to be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This does not necessarily mean to be separated physically, but it means that we are different in the way we think, the things we speak, and the things we do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 6:19 says, "I speak humanly because of the weakness of your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians, however, are saved, but not separated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Normally, once a person is saved, he should also be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reason a believer is called a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consider the majority of Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are virtually the same as the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With them, there is no separation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many of their relatives and friends do not even know that they are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But to be holy is to be separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This, of course, is a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Admittedly, separation is not a very deep matter; it is merely positional.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But do not think that position is unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It means a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have a position as saints, as separated ones, and we need to keep it.</S>
