These talks were given more than ten years after the publication of the messages contained in the book entitled Concerning Our Missions
It affirms that the ground of the church is of two basic things-the authority of the Spirit and the boundary of locality
There is considerable emphasis today on the authority of the Spirit, but almost a complete neglect of the boundary of locality
It points out to us that the genuine unity of the church is the unity of the whole Body of Christ expressed in genuine local churches
In summary, the first four chapters tell us clearly, emphatically, and frankly that the denominations are wrong and the churches are local
A church must be local, standing upon the ground of unity, ready to receive all God's children and willing to include all scriptural things
These talks are the faithful words of one who 'kept back nothing that was profitable unto the church' and never 'sought to please men'
Whether or not a so-called 'church' is really the church is very important, because God has committed so many spiritual things to the church
If a brother or a sister comes to visit, the same kind of glass slide that you use every day cannot be used to serve him a beverage
The glass slide has an important use in the laboratory, but it is useless for serving a brother or a sister a cup of water
Many times it is very difficult for individuals to resist the enemy, but as soon as the church appears, Satan is defeated
As soon as a person departs from the way of the church, his blessing is limited and God's presence with him is limited
What they have already obtained has gradually declined, and what they think they have cannot be preserved intact
Do not presume that five hundred people gathered together are the church, or a thousand people gathered together are the church
The New Testament clearly shows us two basic requirements: first, the authority of the Holy Spirit; and second, the boundary of locality
The church is absolutely not Witness Lee, Chang Yu-zhi, or Yu Cheng-hwa; the church must only be the Holy Spirit
In other words, the church from beginning to end can only have one authority, one power, and one life, which is the Holy Spirit
There is only one life of the Holy Spirit, only one power of the Holy Spirit, and only one authority of the Holy Spirit
As the Lord used the body given to Him by Mary when He was on this earth, so He in the Holy Spirit uses the church today
The elders do not have authority, the elderly brothers do not have authority, and the spiritual ones also do not have authority
Its harmony does not result in consciousness of any of its parts; rather, because of its harmony, it does not seem to feel its existence
In order for the Holy Spirit to have complete authority in the church, the whole Body must move freely without any hindrance
When everyone can be used by the Holy Spirit, then the Holy Spirit has authority and everything is very natural and spontaneous
It is not a matter of sixteen hundred people raising their hands to pass a resolution, and then there is the church
It is not a matter of these sixteen hundred people, but a matter of whether or not the authority of the Holy Spirit has been executed
If we live to be a hundred years old and have followed the Lord for those hundred years, we should not think that we can give some proposals
When the whole church is under the authority of the Holy Spirit it is like the Lords own body given to Him by Mary when He was on this earth
His body cooperated with Him to such an extent that it was as if such a body did not exist at all and that the Lord Himself was acting alone
The church likewise can reach such a level that it is as if it does not exist at all and that Christ is acting alone
It can be in such harmony, such oneness, and such spontaneity that it is as if the Lord is not passing through it at all
Whenever the Holy Spirit cannot move, whenever individuals stand out, there is some problem and the church is damaged
They do not know how much mans opinions decisions methods organizations names and traditions are in the groups that use the name of the Lord
Anything that is brought into the church which is not of the Holy Spirit will ruin the church ground, and then there is no more church
In Shanghai many people can establish an evangelistic mission, seminary, Bible institute, or Bible study class
Regardless of whether we are a believer or an unbeliever, whether we have the life of God or not, we cannot establish a church
We must submit ourselves to the mighty power of the Holy Spirit and put ourselves under the authority which operates according to God
The heavenly part concerns the authority of the Holy Spirit; the earthly part concerns the boundary of locality
They must stand on the ground of the Holy Spirit and also on the ground of Shanghai because Shanghai is the locality in which they live
The same is true of Galatia, which was a province consisting of many localities; therefore, Galatians 1:2 says, 'The churches of Galatia'
There is one thing we must all notice: The world does not have a church; therefore, the Roman Catholic Church is wrong
In the Bible only the smallest administrative unit is related to the church-only a locality or a city has a church
When the church in Corinth was about to divide itself into four parts, Paul immediately rebuked them for being divisive and fleshy
They did not have the ground, and they were not qualified to establish a church, because a church must be matched with a locality
In Shanghai the church does not stand on denominationalism, sectarianism, or any other ground, but on the ground of Shanghai
Today in Bijie in Kweichow province, no one has taken the standing of establishing a church on the ground of locality
If anyone desires to establish a church, it is all right for him to go to Bijie because in one locality there can only be one local church
Division is to be without the ground, and to be without the ground is to be divisive, and is something condemned by God
In these things there is no difference at all, but in Bijie there is a church, while there is a division at North Szechuan Road
When a woman marries a single man, she is his wife; if she marries a man who is already married, she is not his wife
In regard to the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the first thing He would argue is that the place where we are meeting is wrong
Consequently, we violate and offend the first limitation of the Holy Spirit, and we have no ground on which to stand
Saying that we have the Holy Spirit is not enough we must also pay attention to the boundary of locality which is set up by the Holy Spirit
If they do, they will be clear about the standing of the so-called denominations, churches, groups, and organizations
The Bible also shows us that just having the Holy Spirit is not enough; we also need the match of the ground of locality
If man had submitted to God's authority, neither Catholicism nor Protestantism could ever have been established
During the Ching Dynasty, Shanghai was Shanghai; during the Republic, Shanghai was still Shanghai; even now Shanghai remains Shanghai
During the Sino-Japanese War when the country almost became part of another country, the locality remained the same
For many years we have been standing on this ground, rejecting all that is not in keeping with this ground, rejecting all other labels
If there is no authority of the Holy Spirit within and no boundary of locality without, there is not the church
In these recent years and in particular during the past one or two years, we have seen God blessing the church ground
Many brothers and sisters have begun to see the difference between the way of individualism and the ground of the church
The church in Taipei expected Brother Witness to be responsible for their gospel campaign during the Chinese New Year
Brother Witness said to them, 'To have Witness is just to have one more brother; to lose Witness is just to lose one brother'
If there is a church in Taipei, having or losing Brother Witness is just a matter of having or losing one brother
Some of the brothers who you would think could not preach the gospel preached the gospel contrary to expectation
If several thousand people suddenly filled our meeting place, we would immediately see that we would not be able to absorb them all
We now have about fifteen to sixteen hundred brothers and sisters among us; our fellowship is not adequately covered already
If God blessed us by giving us three thousand and then two thousand disappeared after two days, this would not be the church
If we do not know when people come and when people go, or how many have been added or how many have been lost, this is not the church
When all the brothers and sisters obey the Holy Spirit, they will all rise up to serve and receive the blessing
For the authority of the Holy Spirit to come in means that every person learns to reject his own ideas and submit to God's authority
Once we submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit immediately will direct and instruct everyone to serve
On the negative side, do not bring in your own ideas; on the positive side, let the Holy Spirit direct everyone to serve
The authority of the Holy Spirit means that the Holy Spirit can pass through everyone, the Holy Spirit can direct everyone
We should not hope that people will migrate to Nanchang in the future, yet expect the church in Nanchang to train them for us
Question: Concerning the ground of the church, we have said that there should be only one church in a city, because there is only one unit
Some people, however, speak of 'the church in a house,' quoting the Scriptures as their basis, as being an additional unit to the locality
Answer: The New Testament has a total of four passages which refer to 'the church in a house,' that is, in a home
The church in Rome, like hundreds and thousands of other local churches, first started in the house of a brother
At the same time, there were not many members in the church; therefore, they used this brother's house for their meeting place
The book of Romans does not present clearly in writing one greeting to the church in Rome and another greeting to the church in the house
Although many of Narcissus's household were believers, the believers in his house could not become an independent church
The household of Aquila, the household of Aristobulus, and the household of Narcissus all belonged to the church in Rome
Paul told us that there was only one church in the city of Rome and that was the one in the house of Prisca and Aquila
The church in Ephesus was meeting in their house; it was therefore called 'the church, which is in their house'
Paul called the church in Laodicea the church which was in Nymphas's house, that is, the church in Laodicea in the house of Nymphas
Although both are of the same group, after Paul had greeted the brothers , he especially singled out Nymphas and greeted him personally
Although the church in his house includes Nymphas, Paul still says, 'Greet Nymphas and the church, which is in his house'
Paul does not stop with greeting 'the brothers in Laodicea,' he goes on to greet a particular brother by the name of 'Nymphas'
Since the meeting of the church is in Nymphas's house, Paul therefore goes on to greet 'the church, which is in his house'
Question: What is the relationship between 'the church, which is in his house' in verse 15 and 'the church of the Laodiceans' in verse 16?
By reading these two verses carefully, you will see that the church in Nymphas's house in Laodicea is the very church of the Laodiceans
The church in Colossae met in his house; consequently, the phrase 'to the church, which is in your house,' indicates the church in Colossae
Theotorian said that until the fifth century, whenever visitors toured Colossae, they would visit the house of Philemon as a historical site
The church in the house of Philemon was the church in Colossae, for the church in Colossae met in the house of Philemon
We must see whether or not the house is the unit for the jurisdiction of a church by examining this matter from another angle
If God did not take locality as the basic unit of church jurisdiction, there would not have been seven churches in these seven localities
They were seven churches in Asia, not the church in Asia; they were churches, not the church; they were the ekklesiae, not the ekklesia
Some people teach that although Rome is one locality, there can be two churches in Rome-one on a street and one in a house
You must take note that the house spoken of in the Bible and the house proposed by some people are entirely different
Now the question is: In the Bible, is there a unit smaller than the locality for the boundary, the jurisdiction, of the church?
The most obvious example was the church in Jerusalem, which at that time was the church with the greatest number of members
History shows us that among all the other churches, Jerusalem had the greatest number of members and the greatest number of home meetings
We also can compare Acts 14:23 with Titus 1:5: ' appointed elders for them in every church' and ' appoint elders in every city'
They want to unite many churches in different localities and make them one big church, that is, bigger than a locality
All of God's children must understand that in the Scriptures there is not a united church that is greater than a locality
Even if we put two churches in two different localities together, they cannot be one church; they are still two churches
God's children must discriminate between the house spoken of in the Bible and the house as it is conceived in human thought
When the 'church' in a certain person's house is smaller than the church in his locality, it cannot be called a church
From this we can see that God has never made this type of 'house' a unit for the boundary, the jurisdiction, of the church
There must have been over ten thousand brothers in Jerusalem, and they might have been divided into one hundred houses for meetings
We must be very clear that the standard unit for the boundary of the church in the Bible is the city or locality
When the house is smaller than the locality, we can add one plus one, but the total is not two; it is still one
May the Lord cause His children to see that all those who have left the denominations have not necessarily left the sects
On the other hand, those who have contact with them must demonstrate firm and unchanging love so that the Lord could gain back these ones
They cannot distinguish when the house is the same as the locality and when the house is different from the locality
When the house is different from the locality, the two cannot be the boundary, the unit, of the church at the same time
If a foot is one unit of measure, then an inch is not sufficient to be the unit, because it is less than a full unit
If the house is the unit, then there is one church with one house, and there are one hundred churches with one hundred houses
If the house is the unit, then 1) the united church is still wrong, but 2) the divisions in each locality are justified
According to the Bible, the boundary, the jurisdiction, of the church is the locality, just as our salvation is by grace
If we maintain this kind of teaching how many more divisions will result in a locality divisions under the name of socalled house churches
Is this something that a person who has consecrated himself to the Lord and who loves the Lord would want to see?
As long as a locality is a place where people gather and dwell together, it is the boundary of the church according to the Bible
In the Bible the only kind of distinction that does not touch upon the nature of the church is the distinction of locality
Once we see that the ground of the church is local, there will be no more reason for the existence of any sects
Any reason to divide the church damages the nature of the church; that is, it turns the unity of the church into disunity
God also ordained that in one locality there should be only one church to express the unity of the heavenly church
Once we see this, we will know whether or not the present-day principle of separating the church by houses is of God
It has nothing to do with physical limitations, geographical reasons, or the inconvenience of coming together from great distances
Dividing people into many churches because of such an underlying reason is harmful to the nature of the church
Separations that are not based on geographical or physical demand are spiritual in nature; they touch the spiritual unity
Any division that is not for a geographical or physical reason is an intrinsic, real, basic, and spiritual division
Since there are no geographical and physical factors to divide us, is not this the time to show that we are one church?
Why at such an opportune time for us to show our oneness should this different teaching related to a 'house' church come into being?
Those who do not desire to listen to the church but desire to establish their own churches value this kind of 'doctrine'
Being correct in name is a very important matter, but being correct in name does not necessarily mean that there is no problem
If a church is really standing on the ground of locality as set forth in the Bible, she must receive all whom the Lord has received
We cannot say that we receive those who are the same as us, while we do not receive those who are not the same as us
God already has received him without regard for his strength or weakness; therefore, we must receive him as well
The universal church receives all whom God has received in the whole world; a local church receives all whom God has received in a locality
A local church-we must be very clear about this-must take the life of Christ and faith in God as the basis for receiving believers
A church in a locality must not only receive all whom Christ has received in that locality, but must also exercise church discipline
If the Lord puts a certain one into the world, yet we put him into the church, we open a door to the world in the church
As a result, there will be no boundary between the church and the world; the wall between them will be torn down by us
The command in 1 Corinthians 5 does not say that we must put a brother away from among us as soon as he has sinned
The Bible reveals that the church executes discipline in regard to not only moral issues but also doctrinal issues
There is a kind of doctrine which we must defend by all means, and that is the doctrine concerning the person of the Lord Jesus
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!
If someone preaches a different teaching about the person of the Lord, do not receive him into your house and do not say to him, Rejoice
Moral confusion is wrong and not allowed by the church, and doctrinal confusion is also wrong and not allowed by the church
If the church deals with ordinary doctrines as it deals with such confusion, the whole church will be cut up and divided into pieces
If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile'
The Lord's teaching in chapter eighteen is regarding the local church because it refers to a place in which we can 'tell'
If the church in a locality is standing in the position of the church, she must not shrink from declaring the perfect, complete will of God
If we exclude those who believe in the certain truths which we shrink from, then we are not able to include all of God's children
The relationship of the church to Christ is like the body to life; it is not exactly like clothing to the body
If there is anything that we cannot accept, the portion of Christ within that very thing will be excluded from us
If the church does not have all that His life has, the church cannot express the complete Christ and cannot be called the church
We say that we are the church in Shanghai, but suppose that brothers in Shanghai do not believe in spiritual gifts
The church cannot say that it does not believe in spiritual gifts, because there are spiritual gifts in the Bible
Our refusal to believe in spiritual gifts causes us not to be inclusive and makes us exclusive to some brothers
If it does not, these one hundred brothers will eventually form a church that sells all to follow the Lord, bringing forth one more sect
Ordinary denominations do not require everyone to sell all, but the 'family' does require this; therefore, they also are not the church
Andrew Murray once said, 'We who are the Lord's servants sooner or later will have to preach words which we are unable to fulfill'
The church in a locality must have this kind of broad-mindedness in order to stand in the position of the church
Paul's walk was in accord with everything he preached, but people like us still have to preach even if we are not able to go on accordingly
We must not go to the other extreme, insisting on not seeing a doctor or not taking medicine like the former 'Mount Zion Church'
Basically, our attitude should be to not bring in what is not permitted in the Bible, but to include whatever is permitted in the Bible
Regarding the matter of holiness, many of God's children believe that once they believe in the Lord they are perfect
In the Bible some were made perfect once they were blessed, but some also were blessed a second or third time before they touched perfection
We preach both the doctrine of perfection by being blessed once and the doctrine of perfection by receiving a second blessing
We can lead people to be made perfect by being blessed once, and we also can lead people to be liberated by receiving a second blessing
Whether or not we will bring forth more sects in the future depends upon whether or not we have reserved a place for all of God's children
If some have not seen the matter of head covering, the church can only say that they will be received in spite of their weak faith
If a sister covers her head and the church does not receive her, she will feel that the church is not hers and she will leave
If we stand in the position of not favoring head covering and do not allow the sisters to cover their heads, we are not a church
With any command of the Bible, whenever the church does not stand on the positive side to maintain what is in the Bible, a sect is created
Concerning the matter of breaking of bread, the Bible speaks of remembering the Lord on the first day of every week
If certain churches do not practice this according to the Bible, those who want to remember the Lord this way can only leave
Among God's children, some stress teaching, others stress deeper life, and still others stress gospel preaching
If the church only believes in teaching by expounding the Scriptures, those who believe in inspiration will not be able to tolerate it
Please remember, the church is managed according to the Lord's will, not according to our ideas, because we are too small
There are always some brothers better than us in certain aspects; we cannot say that we are superior to all the brothers
Even if we have received special mercy of the Lord, we can only equal a portion; we cannot equal all the brothers
If the church wants to observe these occasions, we can immediately conclude that the church is not going on properly
Otherwise, those who follow the Lord faithfully will leave when they see the church practicing what is not in the Bible
We should allow people the freedom for whatever the Bible allows people freedom for, such as observing the Lord's Day or the Sabbath day
We must heed one thing: When a believer receives the life of God, he has the disposition to serve God; his nature wants to serve God
Many people want to serve God, but because they have no way to get through, they seek another way and become a sect
There are three portions in the Scripture that show us that the Body of Christ has a special relationship with service
Paul showed us that no matter what kind of gift we have, we should only function to the extent that our gift allows
Every brother and sister must be given the opportunity to serve God just as we have the opportunity to serve God
Means in the Lord's mind 'not all,' for there should be apostles, teachers, those who help others, those who administrate, etc
All the brothers who are workers, those who are leaders in the churches, must let every brother have the opportunity to serve
The leading brothers in every place must remember that if they are busy while the brothers and sisters are not then they are failing greatly
If you think that you can build up the Body of Christ by doing well on your own, then you will simply go on as before
When we are in Chungking, we are the church in Chungking; when we are in Tsingtao, we are the church in Tsingtao
When the two meetings in Sian were combined, there was difficulty over who would become the leading ones, who would take the responsibility
Leading ones are not determined by the length of time in the work of God, but by the measure of spiritual experience
The meeting of group A had a history of twenty years, and the meeting of group B had a history of only five months
The leading ones must be those who have a longer history before the Lord, not those who have a longer history of meetings
When the two meetings were combined, the leading brothers in group A should have let the leading brothers in group B take the lead
If they have really seen that locality is the ground fixed by the Bible, they should not establish another meeting under any circumstances
Under no circumstances should we feel that joining others is shameful, but that setting up a church is glorious
Once we have received him, we may have to listen to him on many matters because his personal maturity is not related to his denomination
Today when God's children speak about the church, they always speak of the 'church of God,' not about the 'churches of God'
In our concept, we always consolidate the churches into one church; therefore, we speak of 'the church' rather than 'the churches'
The apostles did not unite the churches on earth into one church; otherwise, this phrase 'the churches of God' would not have existed
Remember that 1 Corinthians 11 and 14 always speak of 'the churches,' which means that the churches of God on earth are local
The churches in big cities were inclined to absorb churches in smaller cities and villages so that they became satellites
Later, a head elder was designated out of the big church, who naturally became the head elder of the satellite churches
He not only became the head of the elders within the entire empire but also more particularly the head of the bishops of the various regions
From that day on, 'the churches of God' as mentioned in the Bible no longer existed and no longer were mentioned
The churches of the saints as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1433 also no longer were heard of no longer were mentioned and no longer existed
They all became part of the one church of Rome, and all the churches throughout the world became branches of Rome
They knew of the heresies and they knew of the idols; moreover, they hated the heresies and they hated the idols
They simply avoided the heresies and idols; they dared not evoke any word, message, or action that might ruin the unity
For a period of one thousand one hundred years no one made any move; they continued to keep the unity of the church
At the beginning his thought was to improve the Roman Catholic Church; the idea of forming another church was not in his mind
That is the reason, during the long history of Rome, that the children of God basically forgot that the 'churches' were plural in the Bible
The unity that was upheld is something manifested in one church-the international, worldwide, universal church
We must study the Scriptures carefully and accurately before God to ascertain whether or not the church on earth is one church
According to numbers the Church of Rome is the largest according to history it is the oldest church and according to organization it is one
He believed that there was only one church in the world, so he started a movement in the Anglican Church to return to Rome
Of course, he was unsuccessful, because Revelation 2 and 3 clearly show that Sardis cannot go back to Thyatira
He thought that it was logical to leave the Anglican Church and join the Roman Church since there was only one church
After being received as a member of the Roman Church, he was promoted to the position of cardinal over England
One should not confess that the church is one and be a pastor in the Anglican Church or an elder in the Presbyterian Church
When the Bible speaks of the churches of Judea, it does not say the church in Judea, but 'the churches' in Judea
If there was a provincial church, it would have been recorded as the church in Judea, not as the churches in Judea
We can see that all the important churches were in Asia: Ephesus was in Asia, Colossae was in Asia, and Laodicea was in Asia
We should not consider that Laodicea was not so good because the Bible did not give it a good report in Revelation
In order for God to do something, He must first accomplish two works: The doctrine must be preached, and the apostles must work it out
The Lord wanted the apostles to be completely obedient; He would not let them have their own opinions and act by themselves
Everything done by the apostles was done in obedience to the Lord; therefore, they were qualified to be apostles
There is a second kind of unity today which can be found throughout the world, and it is called 'spiritual' unity
In other words, once a person is born as a subject of a nation, he becomes a member of the religion of that nation
Formerly, the members of the church only equaled the number of those who through repentance had been regenerated and baptized
As long as one was born in the country and his father was a Roman, he was qualified to become a member of the Roman religion
The Kaiser could have been the greatest imperialist, but he could do nothing against the pope; the pope ruled over him
When Luther rose up to reform the church, these kings realized that there was a way for them to separate themselves from Rome
There were many kings and princes who waited for Luther to go ahead and who were willing to support him with force
Now Germany had its own Lutheran Church, Holland had its own Dutch Reformed Church, and England had its own Anglican Church
Members of these private churches were called 'dissenters,' which means that they dissented from the state church
They were originally in the state church, but when they wanted to come out they first had to leave the state church in order to join another
Since both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church were state churches, they naturally contained many unsaved people
The doctrine of the spiritual church, that is, the doctrine of a visible and an invisible church, was brought in just as we have mentioned
The Scriptures teach that the church is the Body of Christ and Christ is the Head of the church; thus, only believers can be the church
Supporters of this doctrine quoted the Scripture where it says that Satan sowed tares after the Lord sowed the seed
These ones said that the invisible and spiritual church consists of those who are born again, among whom not one is false
They did not realize that such evil can never be covered up by the doctrine of the visible and invisible churches
Consequently, the only way to explain the church was to say that there is a church with form and a church without form
Today, the church is spoken of not in relation to putting a lamp under a bushel, but of shining forth invisible light from a lampstand!
Because some insist on calling it a church, they explain that there is another church within this outward church
The problem today is that there are many brothers and sisters who think that the unity among Christians is a 'spiritual' unity
Because the condition of the church is murky and the boundary of the church is ill-defined, there is the need of 'spiritual' fellowship
If the church is proper, the invisible would become visible, and there would be no need for invisible fellowship
The Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Wesleyan Church, the Quaker Church, and later several thousand groups, arose
In the Russian Empire, the state church was called the Russian Orthodox Church, and the rest were called sects
In the third and fourth generations, however, the arguing subsided, and there was not much difference between them
Some of the people in the United Christian Church, however, believed in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues
According to the apostle Paul, the doctrines which men have argued most strongly about were not major problems
Paul said none of these should pose any problem; we should receive those whom the Lord has received because God has received them
As to his behavior as a Christian we should help him with the teachings of the Bible but we cannot refuse him and put him outside the church
Regardless of whether baptism is by immersion or by rubbing on water, we can only ask, Have these brothers been received by God?
In other words, he has received the same life; therefore, regardless of his preference, we have to receive him
We must help those who are weak in the faith with the teachings of the Bible, not separate from them by forming another church
These are not the work of the Lord but the result of man's ideas which have divided the children of God into so many denominations
In Corinth there is only one church, in Ephesus there is only one church, and in Shanghai there should be only one church
With many difficulties there are many lessons, but with more difficulties, there also is the need for more love for one another
We must overcome the carnal by the spiritual, conquer all differences by love, and cover all difficulties by grace
Although we have met much opposition from the beginning and are still meeting some today, the opposition is getting weaker and weaker
God's purpose is that all should be united as one cup, but they have made the mistake of dividing themselves into many cups
Spiritual' fellowship is a stretching out of our hands over our cups to hold each others' hand 'across the fence'
Today there are brothers who want to keep the denominations, even though their consciences bother them that there is no fellowship
If we want to serve God and feel that all God's children should have fellowship, we must tear down all the fences to have fellowship
If we want to support the denominations on the one hand and try to break them down on the other, what could we hope to accomplish?
If the denominations are right, you must build the fences higher, so that no one can cross over, and so that everyone is clearly divided
When his father tilled the soil in the Garden of Eden, he brought the produce of the land and offered it to God
Suppose that at eight o'clock each evening a child wants his mother to prepare a snack for him before he goes to bed
His offering acknowledged that he had sinned and that his present situation was different from what it had been in the past
What if a man sins against you, steals many things from you, speaks against you, and then behaves as if nothing has happened?
What matters is that if we feel they are right, we must support them, but if we feel they are wrong, we have to tear them down
They are afraid that this will create some kind of partition between them and many of God's children who are in the denominations
Consequently, they allow the denominations to exist and advocate a 'spiritual' unity, a 'spiritual' fellowship
The real significance of what they call 'spiritual' unity is a reluctance to be absolute toward God or to follow His Word
The Scriptures also show us that God through the Holy Spirit dwells in the church and that the Holy Spirit is one Spirit
If we only consider it as God's people, again it may not matter whether or not there is some division here and there
The Roman Catholic Church tells us that since the Body of Christ is one, we should only organize one church on the earth
Since the Scriptures speak of 'churches,' we know that God has no intention of uniting all the churches on the earth into one church
One worldwide church is only the opinion of the Roman Catholic Church; the unity of Roman Catholicism is manmade, not scriptural
By the outward appearance alone, it may not be easy to understand whether the church on the earth should be many churches or one church
These seven churches were in seven different localities: Ephesus was a locality, Smyrna was a locality, Pergamos was a locality, etc
If it were God's will to unify all the churches on earth into one church, then God in heaven would have only one lampstand, not seven
If we would just think a little, we would realize that if the Lord has only one church on earth, He would have only one lampstand in heaven
In the Old Testament one lampstand with seven branches was placed before God, signifying that all the Israelites were united as one nation
The division between the nations of Judah and Israel was not pleasing to God, because before God they were one
In other words, God's original thought concerning the church is to have the respective churches standing before Him independently
In spiritual reality there are seven different lampstands before God, not seven lampstands united as one lampstand
In other words, God's ordained will concerning the nation of Israel is different from that concerning the church
The unity that God desires is not that the churches should be combined into one big church and formed into one great unity
Does the unity of the Body of Christ refer to the 'spiritual' unity as advocated by the brothers in the denominations today?
The Bible clearly shows us that God's children should not be divided, but the denominations are obviously divisions
Today, even if all the Christians throughout the whole world are united together, they would still not be the Body of Christ
Even if all the children of God who are on this earth were gathered together, they would not be sufficient to become the Body of Christ
Spacewise it would be sufficient, but timewise it would be wrong to say that it is the Body, because many generations have passed away
All the believers of past generations, all the believers of the present, and all the believers of the future are the Body of Christ
It is impossible to maintain a church with Paul as an elder and Peter as a pastor, because they have passed away
We see one thing: If the unity of the Body spoken of in the Bible is not expressed in a locality, it is not practical
The children of God are one, including Paul and all those who are not yet born, except a few brothers here in Shanghai'!
Neither would it be right if Paul had applied these words to the brothers in Antioch, because they had not said them
The Lord gives us the light for the most basic form of unity; that is, the believers in Corinth must be one at least in Corinth
Of course, we all will love one another in the 'heaven' in the future, but the problem is whether or not we love one another today
We all will have fellowship in the 'heaven' in the future, but the problem is whether or not we have fellowship today
Let us see how Paul rebuked them And I brothers was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men but as to fleshy as to infants in Christ
For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man'?
The expression of spirituality is in the unity of the church, and the manifestation of the flesh is in the divisions of the church
For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man'?
The unity of the Holy Spirit and of the Body has a minimum boundary requirement; that is, this unity must be expressed within a local church
We have just seen the negative view of division; now let us see the positive view of unity as is demanded in the Bible
In other words, the Body of Christ that the brothers at Corinth should express must at least be expressed at Corinth
When the brothers and sisters gathered together, a loaf was displayed before them, with all the saints gathered around it
It does not mean that the brothers at Corinth are the Body of Christ, while the brothers at Ephesus are not the Body of Christ
The Body of Christ is the universal church, the church which is in all places and throughout all generations both in space and in time
The brothers in a locality must at least stand in the same position, applying the same principle to express the same fact
The head in 1 Corinthians 12 is but a member, the position of which is different from that of the Head in Ephesians
The Head in Ephesians is absolutely Christ, while the head in 1 Corinthians 12 is one among the brothers who acts as a head
Paul showed them that having divisions in the locality of Corinth was the same as having divisions in the Body of Christ
Today a certain kind of condition prevails in the church: People preach the doctrine of loving one another, but they forget about locality
Brothers, it is easy to be idealistic when we preach about loving one another but to forget the matter of locality
The brothers in Shanghai feel this way; the brothers in Nanking also feel that the brothers are good except for the ones in Nanking
God also says to the brothers in Nanking: Love the brothers in Nanking first and the brothers in Shanghai later
The brothers in Corinth needed to love the brothers in Corinth first and then they could ascend into heaven to see the Body of Christ
They needed to descend to see the Body of Christ in 1 Corinthians before they could ascend to see it in Ephesians
The apostle John said, 'He who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen'
Today we need to add one more word: 'If we cannot love the brothers whom we see, we cannot love the brothers whom we cannot see'
In Philippians 2:2 Paul exhorted, 'Think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing'
It is useless for them to think the same thing as the brothers in the church in Shanghai or the brothers in the church in Lanchow
The countries on the earth are divided into cities; the church of God on the earth today is also divided into cities
In the world there are the localities of Sian and Lanchow; hence, there is the church in Sian and the church in Lanchow before God
The Lord Jesus preached the gospel in every city and in every village ; therefore, the unit of locality is the city or village
The way to fulfill the part that should exist is that there should be spiritual fellowship between one local church and another local church
Fellowship among the churches does not mean that a locality neglects its own affairs and takes care of the affairs of another locality
It does not mean that the brothers in Tiensui take care of the affairs of Pingliang but not the affairs in Tiensui
Gradually, however, they degraded until there was only one church in the whole world, the Roman Catholic Church
Subsequent to this breaking apart, the international church became national churches with state churches in different nations
There was some improvement some advancement at this stage with the churches being somewhat closer to the likeness of those in the beginning
In addition to the place being dedicated, the person preaching the message had to be ordained; no ordinary person was allowed to preach
For the state churches, preaching was serious, location was serious, and setting up new churches was even more serious
The international church had evolved into national churches, and the national churches had evolved into independent churches
Many children of God among them in their reading of the Bible saw that the churches were all independent of one another
From the time of the independent churches, the church went to another extreme of taking a congregation as the unit
The Lord desires that we love one another, receive one another, and avoid envy, strife, and divisions in the same local church
If we have seen that unity is a matter of locality, we could only go and set up a church in another city, not another one in Shanghai
It means that there can be several congregations within each locality, each having a unity within itself and each independent of the others
They may have one assembly on one street and another assembly on another street, each having nothing to do with the other
We must see clearly before God that in the Bible there is one locality with one church, or in short, one locality, one church
If we study the matter of the church, we must be able to understand this principle of one locality, one church
When it swings to one side, it is wrong because it causes three or four localities to have one church or the whole world to have one church
When it swings to the opposite side, it is also wrong because it causes one locality to have several or many churches
There is something abnormal in connection with the locality, or there is something abnormal in connection with the church
We have seen clearly that the Roman Catholic Church has swung to one side with the principle of having one church with many localities
If we are clear that there is one locality, one church, then we will be clear about Roman Catholicism and congregationalism
If congregationalism exists for a period of eleven hundred years, there may be hundreds and thousands of churches
If the principle is wrong difficulties will follow once a disagreement occurs you will set up a table and another will set up another table
The Lord has shown us that one locality should have only one church, and one locality should have only one administration
The unity of the Roman Catholic Church is against the Scriptures, and 'spiritual' unity has come short of the Lord's goal
These ones' thought of rallying brothers together from a few denominations in a locality will only please a few churches
You may deal with the past and deal with it quite well with your cleverness, but what will you do with the future?
We may get by with five congregations today, but there will be some difficulty in the future, and with it a sixth congregation will appear
On the other hand, He will not allow a church to become several churches in one locality; otherwise, future contentions will be endless
If we see this accurately before the Lord, we could say a very precise word to the brothers in the denominations
Show them the Bible, regardless of which verse you use about the church, and ask them whether or not the church is local
If this could be so, then not only would there have been seven churches in Asia, but there could have been four churches in Corinth
There could be seven churches in Asia because Asia was a province but there could not be four churches in Corinth because Corinth was a city
If we do not pay attention to the unity in the locality, then other kinds of unity are vain words because they are not found in the Bible
Those in the Roman Catholic Church have learned something about the church, but they have applied it incorrectly
Everyone in the Roman Catholic Church has seen that the church is one, but they are mistaken about the boundary
Since they have seen that the church is one, they feel that they would be sinning against the Lord if they brought forth divisions
When we move to a locality, we may have the liberty to found a school, a hospital, a seminary, a corporation, or a factory
We can found anything, but we must never establish a church in this manner because this involves the problem of the Body of Christ
If there is a local church, we cannot set up another one under the pretense of helping it, even though we see some faults in it
They presume that this is a very simple matter and that they can immediately set up a church after discussing it with three or four others
Brothers who are somewhat gifted, who have some scriptural knowledge, and who are capable in preaching, think that they can set up a church
Brothers, we must be brought to the place today that we would never commit the sin of dividing the Body of Christ
The booklet The Urgent Cry speaks of the unity in Christ that exists for one week every year at the Keswick Convention in England
If we can only be united for a week, while being divided for the rest of the year, we would rather stay at Keswick every day and never leave
The churches may also spread to foreign countries, to turn back to the Western world from where the gospel came
There are two points in which we cannot compromise: 1) Denominations are sin; hence, we cannot compromise in this
If they do not condemn the denominationalism as sin, even though they have come out of it, trouble will arise in the future
We can tell these ones that we have been walking in this way for thirty years and that we hope they also will walk together with us
On the other hand, it is all right for us to consider ourselves as not having walked in this way and starting all over again
If we reject the denominations and they reject the denominations, then we can unite together to become the local church
We can say that they are not the church and that we are not the church, but that tomorrow we all will be the church
We will give up anything that can be given up, but the Lord's Word cannot be given up; we cannot relinquish it
Elders are ordained for every church, and the city is the boundary for the elders' administration in the church
Many brothers and sisters think that having unity with us is only a spiritual matter and that their administration will still be independent
The service of the church is a spiritual coordination, a coordination of the saints in life and in the Holy Spirit
If in a church only a minority or a part are serving, there is something wrong with that church; it is still weak
The Lord grants the members different kinds of gifts and ministries for the purpose of supplying the need of the whole Body
As the human body needs all the members, so the church needs the different kinds of gifts and ministries for its spiritual service
As long as you are a Christian you are a member of the Body of Christ and as a member in the Body you must have your own service before God
Another matter which requires special attention in the Body is that both the grace and the gift that everyone receives are different
The passage in Romans 12, in addition to speaking of the ministry of the word, includes ministries of other services in the church as well
Whether ones gift is big or small whether it is five talents two talents or one talent he should exercise what he has and serve accordingly
If all the one-talented ones will rise up to serve, they will be more effective than the few who have five talents
If all the brothers and sisters are working and laboring, it will be the church serving and the Body functioning
Everyone who has the 'mina' should realize that the handkerchief is for wiping sweat, not for wrapping up his mina
With regard to the practical affairs of the church, the brothers and sisters must be very concerned and very clear
When a person serves God, there is the priestly work on the one hand, and there is the Levitical work on the other hand
On the one hand, you participate in the spiritual service, and on the other hand, you should also take care of the practical affairs
The responsible ones can tell them that there are two sisters among us who can help them do the laundry two hours every week
At the time of the apostles, the widows of the Hellenists were not adequately being cared for, and there were murmurings
Every week they could go to another brother's or sister's house to help for an hour or two, doing some miscellaneous things for them
It befits them as Christians to go to the homes of poor brothers and sisters and do things with their own hands
If you can use only the two-talented ones and cannot use the one-talented ones in every place, you have failed completely
The church is all the one-talented ones coming forth to partake of the church service on the practical side and on the spiritual side
In the Lord's house there is not one servant without a gift; everyone has at least one talent and cannot have less than one talent
We must know the grace of God so thoroughly that when God calls someone His servant, we would never stand up to say that he is not
Our problem today is that we have inherited the priestly system of Roman Catholicism and the pastoral system of Protestantism
If the Lord can really break through in our midst the way we have taken for the past ten twenty or thirty years will be completely reversed
If God has the assurance to call them to be servants, you too should have the assurance to call them to be servants
We need to use all our thought and all our strength so that all the brothers and sisters may rise up and serve
While we saw the light concerning the church quite clearly in the past, we did not see the light concerning the work so well
We saw that the churches are local, a matter which is much clearer today than throughout the history of the church
By reading many books, we certainly can realize that the local character of the church has never been as clear as it is today
When we were in Hankow, we surveyed the entire book of Acts, but we were not able to take Jerusalem into account
Starting from chapter thirteen, the book of Acts lined up with our work, and our work lined up with the book of Acts
Now, however, we have definitely seen it, and it can be stated in just two phrases: The churches are local, and the work is regional
In other words, the church is local, but the work is regional, being composed of many localities combined together to form a region
Peter, John, and their group worked in one region, while Paul, Silas, Timothy, and Barnabas worked in another region
Just as Peter and John were in the region around Jerusalem, Paul and Timothy were in another region around Antioch
Today we cannot speak too much, but it is more than clear that the work is regional and the churches are local
The highest place a church can appeal to is its own locality; there is no district council or headquarters for the church
In the book of Acts we can say that Jerusalem was a center in one region, while Antioch was a center in another region
Today, we see clearly that the church in Antioch is one thing, while Antioch as a center for the work is another
God's command was that there would be witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth
If the Lord desired that Peter and John leave Jerusalem, He could have caused persecution to fall upon Peter and John, not upon the church
The Lord said that the world would hate us because we are not of the world, and that if the world persecuted Him, it would also persecute us
Having a worker rule over a church in a locality is a Protestant thought; it is not the thought of the Scriptures
We cannot decide which locality is 'Jerusalem' through our own discussion, because God wants to do that Himself
Either they go out and travel a large circuit and then return like Paul, or they go out and immediately return like Peter-both are right
Now we will see the third matter, that is, how the work of God is carried forward and how the gospel is preached
Paul and Barnabas, Paul and Timothy, or Paul and Silas went to one place after another to preach the gospel and then returned to Antioch
When he came back to Jerusalem and went to see James and all the elders, he was told of many thousands of Jews there who had believed
For two thousand years the church has tried to make Jerusalem fit into the whole picture, but it has never been made to fit correctly
Before God we need to have much prayer and clear light concerning which locality can be used as the center for the work in a region
It has to be a place where a group of co-workers, both brothers and sisters, may dwell together and establish a center
The responsibility of the rest of the localities in this region should be left to the brothers of their own locality
We should encourage twenty people to move to Nan-Ping, thirty to Putien, thirty to Amoy, thirty to Taipei, and thirty also to Tainan
Regardless of whether they are peddlers, rickshaw coolies or domestic servants, they all must be sent out to preach the gospel
If the many who are sent forth become a problem and the local churches cannot deal with them, what good is this?
The brothers and sisters need to be properly trained in order to be prepared to go out as missionaries group by group
The locality which is the center first must be set up in good order before the saints can be trained and sent out
Now we come to the fourth point, that is, the need for all the brothers and sisters to receive the same training
If some come into our midst, regardless of which week they join, they will finish the whole training in one year
Advise them that when they migrate to a place they should try their best to save souls in the locality where they live
If only the evangelists do the preaching, they can never complete the preaching of the gospel throughout China in their lifetime
Today all the brothers and sisters acknowledge that when the church preaches the gospel there is always more fruit
Recently, a group of brothers went to Kutien to preach the gospel, and a total of more than fifty were saved and baptized
Brother Chen returned and said that when he left he did not know what the result of the church's preaching of the gospel would be
Our brothers wrote and said that since they discovered this way, they would give their lives for it and not turn in any other direction
The co-workers should always bear the responsibility of the work in the center, but they also should go out and return again and again
For this reason, during the conferences in both Shanghai and Foochow, we paid much attention to the matter of coordination
If the brothers in other localities are also faithful and learn to take this way, they will also be able to take over their places
There will be no problem with the ministry of the word if the local ones are the ones that are taking care of the matter themselves
In the future we will bring all the good, prospective ones from all the churches here to receive some training
If this becomes confused, everything will be confused, and we will revert back to the situation before our gathering in Hankow
If we have the right people and the mercy of the Lord is with us, within a few years the gospel will be spread all over China
Today there is a requirement not only for the co-workers to be coordinated but for the leading ones to be coordinated as well
