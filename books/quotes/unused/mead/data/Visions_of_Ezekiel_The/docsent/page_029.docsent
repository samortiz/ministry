   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIVING CREATURES TRANSMITTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE THRONE TO THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The living creatures are still on this earth, but through them the throne in the heavens is transmitted to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With them and through them, the heavens with the throne are opened up to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The throne in the heavens becomes one with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is like the transmission of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Electricity is in the generator at the plant far from the city, but it is transmitted to us by the electrical lines.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The living creatures are the heavenly electrical lines.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is through them and by them and with them that the heavenly throne is transmitted to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Wherever they are, there is the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wherever they go, the throne follows them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes you may go to a dear saint who is gentle, mild, and meek, yet in his presence you have the sensation that something is weighty and powerful and is ruling over the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may be a very loose and sloppy person, but when you get into his presence something rules over you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is that?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Or you may say that is the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether you call it the Lord's presence or the throne, it is the transmission of the heavenly throne to this earth through that dear saint.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may also visit a local church where the saints are gentle, nice, and happy, yet you sense something weighty and powerful, something of authority, something ruling over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is that?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That, too, is the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AUTHORITY NOT BEING HUMAN AND NATURAL</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the church we should not speak of authority in a human, natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the church there is no human authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The authority in the church is the throne above the clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose the leading brothers or the elders in a local church are not under a clear sky, yet they would exercise authority based upon their position.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They may speak something, but there will be no weight, no ruling, because there is no throne in the clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if the elders in a local church are day and night under a clear sky, having a conscience that is pure and void of offense under the heavenly throne, with them there will be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There will be no need for them to claim authority over the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you must claim authority over the saints, it means you have lost your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you need to claim to have authority, it means you have no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you are living under a clear sky with a throne above it, you do not need to claim to have authority, but the authority is simply there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Never try to bring people under your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is a hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not try to rule over the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, bow down and humble yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Get yourself under a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is shameful for someone to claim to be the authority in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no such thing!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the church there is no human authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus said that whoever among you would like to be great must serve the others Matt 23:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the way to have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The authority is not mine nor yours nor others'.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The authority is only the throne above a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can assure you that if we are under a clear sky with a throne above it, no opposition and no persecution can shake us or defeat us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the heaven above us is clear and the throne is with us, we will have the authority and we will have the weight.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The words out of one brother's mouth may have power and the same words out of another brother's mouth may have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because one is under the clear sky with the throne but the other is under the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is easy to learn to repeat others' words, to quote others' words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the words out of our mouth must have some weight.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It all depends upon our being under a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It depends upon being subject to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the proper church life and this is the proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I must repeat to all the dear ones who bear responsibility: Never exercise your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You do not have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>None of us has any authority; the authority is the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the people of Israel rebelled against Moses, he never exercised his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moses and Aaron simply bowed down and called upon the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then the Lord Himself came to vindicate Num 20:2-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is a big mistake to exercise authority over others in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nothing is more shameful than this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To exercise authority over the saints is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not glorious; it is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The authority is not you and not me; the authority is the Man upon the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must have the Man on the throne in our clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need a clear sky with a heavenly throne.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today the Lord needs such a church life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord needs such a group of coordinated living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>While they are standing or walking on the earth, the heavens are opened to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Through them the heavenly throne is transmitted to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Don't take a human way to exercise any kind of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even if people come to you trying to recognize you as a kind of authority you must refuse it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You must tell them you are not that kind of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Authority does not mean that.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The proper authority means a throne above a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is not a human matter of organization and hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must have a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is shameful for us to intend that others should listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is shameful to have power among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is shameful to be the authority among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We always consider Paul to be a great apostle, but he considered himself as less than the least of the saints Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>His very name means "little."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Paul would say, "You give me too great a title.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I am not worthy of that."</S>
