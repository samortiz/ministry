<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FIRST OF THE THREE ROUNDS IN THE DEBATES<br>BETWEEN JOB AND HIS THREE FRIENDS<br>CHAPTERS 4&#151;11</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JOB'S UNYIELDINGNESS<br>AND<br>ZOPHAR'S BLIND ARGUMENT</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Job 9&#151;11</H1><P>In this message we will consider Job's unyieldingness and Zophar's blind argument. Whereas Job was very strong in character and was not easily subdued, Zophar was foolish, not clear in the divine revelation concerning God's economy of dispensing Himself into His people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JOB'S UNYIELDINGNESS</H2><P>Job's unyieldingness is fully shown in chapters nine and ten.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Boasting in Knowing What His Friends Knew</H2><P>Job boasted in knowing what his friends knew, saying, "I do indeed know that it is so" (9:2a). Job was saying that he already knew what his friends were talking about and that they did not need to speak any more about it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Admitting That He Could Not<br>Contend with God and Resist Him</H2><P>Job admitted that he could not contend with God and resist Him, because He is wise and mighty (vv. 3-12). In verses 5 through 9 Job alluded to God's judgment upon the preadamic universe. After asking how a man can be righteous before God, Job said, "If he is pleased to contend with Him,/He cannot answer Him one thing in a thousand./He is wise in heart and mighty in strength&#151;/Who has ever resisted Him and come through whole?" (vv. 3-4). No one can stop God or say to Him, "What are You doing?" (v. 12).</P>
