   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRIUNE GOD AND THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to go on to see the difference between the Triune God and the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Triune God mainly refers to God Himself, and the divine Trinity mainly refers to God s being Triune, which is the main attribute of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is more correct to refer the divine dispensing to the divine Trinity rather than to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Triune God refers to God the Person, while the divine Trinity refers to the main attribute of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, saying that someone is a faithful person is different from saying that he is faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A faithful person refers to the man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His faithfulness refers to his being faithful, his virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a general way God is dispensing Himself into us, but in a particular, actual, and practical way God is dispensing His Trinity into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Testament reveals that the Father is in us, the Son is in us, the Spirit is in us, and God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 4:6 shows us that the Father is in us: One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 14:23 also shows us that the Father is in the believer: If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second Corinthians 13:5 is one verse which reveals that the Son is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 8:9 shows us that the Spirit dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The strongest verse showing us that God is in us is Philippians 2:13: For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should never forget Philippians 2:13.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is not only in us, but He is also operating or working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is in us as the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Triune God being in us, however, may be merely terminology to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may not have the practical experience of the Trinity of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are not only experiencing God but we are also experiencing the Trinity of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Father is in us, the Son is in us, and the Spirit is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are not three persons, but these are the Trinity of the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, this divine Trinity is the strongest attribute of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His faithfulness, His love, His kindness, and other attributes are not above this attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The top attribute of the divine Person is His Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His Trinity is constituted solely with His Person, and His Person is in the Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why the ancient theologians used a word to describe the very substance of the Trinity hypostasis.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This word comes from Greek, hupo meaning under and stasis meaning something substantial supporting from beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hypostasis is singular and hypostases is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This anglicized Greek word means the supporting or substantial essence from beneath, and refers to the constitution of the Triune Godhead being the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In theology the denotation of the word hypostases was gradually changed to persons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why one of the meanings for hypostasis in Webster s dictionary is person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a theological definition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must see, however, that the divine Trinity is the constitution of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The divine dispensing of the divine Trinity means to dispense the constitution of our Triune God into our being to make His constitution ours.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A WORD OF LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because some brothers understanding of the things concerning the Lord and His interest was too superficial, I nearly had no way to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1967 in Elden hall there was a lot of talk about the way to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I stood up to tell the saints that I had been practicing the church life for years and years and that I knew what I was doing here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I said, I don t like to argue with you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you feel your way is right, go to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Don t make the church in Los Angeles a lab for you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We don t need a lab here in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have practiced the church life for many years and have established many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In every church, I had a success.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have the full assurance that what we are doing is right and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We don t need a lab.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you want to do lab work, go to another place to practice your lab.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you will be successful, come back to me and I will be the first one to follow you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But I assure you that if you go, you will have a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is my word of love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is up to you whether you take it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That talk to the church stopped all the different talks.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I must testify that I am not afraid of today s opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If some person says that 2 2 is 4 no one can defeat him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even if another person says that 2 2 is 3.9999999, he still is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What I have been teaching to you I have studied thoroughly for over fifty years, not only according to the pure Word of God but also by checking with my own and others experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You do not know how much time I have spent day and night to study.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through our fellowship in this training I want to assure you that there is no need to be doubtful concerning what you have received through this ministry concerning the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You should not be affected by others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you take this way, you will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you do not take this way, you will miss the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is up to you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you feel you are right, go ahead and take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The years will test your way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You will come back either to repent or you will remain in that failure.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Through the years we have seen some who have left and who are still remaining in their failure.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is a sad thing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I love them, but just cannot help them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some of the opposers take my words and say that I threaten people.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I say strongly that I do not threaten people and that I never threaten people.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I love people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For example, the proper gospel preaching is always a word of love.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If someone preaching the gospel says, If you do not repent, you will go to hell, is this a kind of threatening?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is not a threat, but a loving word to help the sinners to turn from their wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must realize that the recovery today is in 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In 1922 the recovery was in an experimental stage, but today it is no longer that much an experimental operation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The work in the United States is my fifth factory.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The past four factories were all successful, so I have the full assurance that this is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I sent out an urgent notice to call such an urgent gathering to present to you the New Testament ministry, the vision of the Lord s recovery, and the way to carry out the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is my word of love.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you like to consider this as threatening, it is up to you.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I do not like to pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I do not like to be so mild outwardly, yet inwardly another way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I am what I am inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I have no intention of threatening you or of warning you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I say this out of my love.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I love you brothers, and even more I love the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I have sacrificed my entire life with my future for this.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I would not like to see the recovery cut into pieces and damaged.</S>
