   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE THREE THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 14:19; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21; Rom 6:4-5; 11:24 THE REVELATION OF LIVING CHRIST IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament, there are four main verses two in the Gospels and two in the Epistles which reveal the matter of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first verse, John 6:57, says, "As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the first verse in the New Testament that directly touches the matter of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second verse is also in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 14:19 says, "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The phrase "because I live" means that Christ lives in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Yet a little while" indicates His death and that He will live again in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The clause "because I live, you shall live also" indicates that because He lives in resurrection, we also shall live with Him and by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the New Testament, John 6:57 and 14:19 are the most basic verses in unveiling to us how we can live because of Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The third verse, perhaps the best in the Epistles concerning our living because of Christ and with Christ, is Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fourth verse is Philippians 1:21 which says, "For to me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>LIVING BECAUSE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By these four verses, we can learn how to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this matter, I do not use the phrase live by Christ because the word by does not convey the proper thought.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In John 6:57 the word "because" implies that there is a factor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word by used in the KJV , however, indicates an instrument, not a factor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To walk by Christ implies that Christ is the instrument for walking, as a cane is used for walking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To walk because of Him indicates that He is the factor of our walking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This understanding is also the meaning in the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 14:19 reveals that we live Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After His resurrection He lives, and we live also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not merely live by Him but because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not live by Christ, taking Christ as our instrument; rather, we live because of Christ, taking Christ as a factor of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The food that we eat is not an instrument, but a supplying factor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We live not by food but because of the food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Food supplies us so that we can live because of its supply.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In using a cane as an instrument to walk, there is no need to eat the cane; but to live because of food, we must eat the food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without eating, food cannot become a factor of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We live Christ in His resurrection, and we live Christ by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eating brings in a factor to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we eat a good breakfast in the morning, the nourishment we receive energizes us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The energizing element of Christ is a supply, a factor, for us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Galatians 2:20 says, "It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ has been eaten by us, and now He is within us, living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While He is living within us, He is being digested by us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The way Christ lives in us is by being digested by us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He now has become the supply, the very factor, with which we live.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We live with Christ as the supplying factor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The clause "it is no longer I who live" means that we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet the later clause "the life which I now live" indicates that we continue to live.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to describe this experience, we may say, "Christ lives for me."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, it is better to say that Christ lives within us to be the factor for us to live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Galatians 2:20, there seems to be two who live.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are two subjects, "Christ" and "I," and these two subjects act on one predicate live.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"I live" and "Christ lives."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to describe one living with two lives, Paul used the illustration of grafting Rom 11:24; 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The uncultivated branch has been cut off from the uncultivated tree, and this uncultivated branch is grafted into the cultivated tree, the good tree.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The uncultivated branch is cut off from the original tree, and the cultivated tree is cut open.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These two cuts are put together and grafting takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These two now become one, yet the branch is still the branch, and the tree is still the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are two things, yet they live together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The branch and the tree live, but the two live together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The living of the branch and the tree is a mingled living.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Their living is a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To say that the grafted branch lives by the cultivated tree is not very accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The grafted branch lives in the cultivated tree and with the cultivated tree.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, the cultivated tree lives, and the grafted branch lives in the cultivated tree's living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some have mistakenly said that we Christians live an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to this concept, we exchange our poor life for a good life from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This, however, is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If our Christian life is an exchanged life, then our poor life is finished after being exchanged with the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although the Bible does say that we have been crucified, it also says that we still live Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When the Bible says that we have been crucified, this means that we have been cut off from Adam, the uncultivated tree.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through crucifixion we have been cut off from Adam, and in resurrection we have been grafted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have been crucified, cut off, from Adam, and we have been put into the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, we are not finished; we are still living.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, we are not living in ourselves, we are living in Christ, with Christ, and because of Christ, taking Christ as the factor for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When He lives, we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our living is within His living; thus, our living and His living are mingled together as one living.</S>
