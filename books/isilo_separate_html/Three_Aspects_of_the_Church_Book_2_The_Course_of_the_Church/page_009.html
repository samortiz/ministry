<p>The church in Antioch was also part of the story of the church&rsquo;s spreading (Acts 13:1). In Antioch there were five prophets and teachers, of whom the first was Barnabas, a Levite. The Levites were not ordinary Jews but the Jews of the Jews, because the Jewish religion was in their hands. The Levites served God exclusively.</p>
<p>The second person was Simeon, who was called Niger. <em>Niger</em> means &ldquo;black&rdquo; and denotes a man of the black race, probably of African origin. Among those five prophets and teachers, there was a black man. The third was Lucius the Cyrenian. Cyrene is in northern Africa, so Lucius was an African; however, he was not necessarily a black man. The fourth was Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch; Manaen was a noble, and not necessarily a Jew.</p>
<p>The last one was Paul, who was a Pharisee trained at the feet of Gamaliel and who zealously kept all the ordinances in Judaism (22:3); therefore, his Jewish concept was very strong. Even though Barnabas was a Levite, Paul&rsquo;s original Jewish concept may have been deeper than that of Barnabas.</p>
<p>In the church in Antioch there were no distinctions; all these people were not merely in the church but were leaders in the church. Among them were Jews and Gentiles and people of different races; the church in Antioch was a church without divisions. This is something that only the Holy Spirit could have accomplished. The church in Antioch was more fully formed than the situation in the house of Cornelius. The church in Jerusalem is not the pattern; the church in Antioch is the real pattern. The church in Antioch had completely left all the Jewish influence behind. Through such a church the Holy Spirit was able to move forward to spread without any limitations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Cyprus</h2>
<p>The good situation in Antioch, however, was still not enough, so the Holy Spirit came and sent forth Barnabas and Paul to the work; their goal was the spreading of the church (13:2-12). We can see the spread of the church by tracing the footsteps of these apostles.</p>
<p>After being sent out by the Holy Spirit, the apostles went to Seleucia and from there they sailed to the island of Cyprus. This Cyprus is the island of Cyprus today. Then they went to Asia Minor, which was a place of the Gentiles. Even though Cyprus was a Gentile place, the apostles used Jewish synagogues to preach the word when they first arrived (v. 5). The presence of these synagogues shows God&rsquo;s preparation. Before the Lord Jesus was born, God scattered Jews all over the earth, and in every place that there were Jews, they built social organizations. Their social organization was centered around the synagogues, just as it centered around the temple in Jerusalem. Every Sabbath there would be people in the synagogues studying the Bible; the Jews also brought Gentiles to hear the name of God and to meet the true God, the Creator of all things. &ldquo;Those who fear God,&rdquo; as spoken of in Acts 13:16, were Gentiles who were seeking God. God prepared all of this ahead of time.</p>
<p>When the apostles went out to the Gentile lands, they would go first to the Jewish synagogues and use them to preach the gospel to God&rsquo;s Old Testament elect; then they would turn from the Jews to the Gentiles. At this time, the spread of the church was very strong. When we read the book of Acts, we should draw a map, and whenever we come to a place, we should fill in its name and note on which trip the apostle visited it; furthermore, we should study the spiritual characteristics of each place. This will be a big help to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Asia Minor</h2>
<p>On the apostle Paul&rsquo;s first trip to preach the gospel to the Gentiles and to establish churches among them, he went to Cyprus. He did not stay there long before continuing on to Asia Minor, which is modern-day Turkey. In Asia Minor he established many local churches, which represents a further step in the spread of the church (Acts 13&mdash;14).</p>
<p>In the beginning, even though the apostles preached the gospel to the Gentiles, they were still among the Jews; therefore, at the end of Acts 13 it says that they turned to the Gentiles (v. 46). This shows that even though they were in Gentile lands in Asia Minor, they were still preaching to the Jews. Beginning in chapter 13, the apostles shook off the dust of their feet (v. 51) as a formal sign that they were turning to the Gentiles in the Gentile land. Therefore, the church did not only spread in Gentile lands but also to Gentile people. In chapter 14 the universal church finally was fully formed.</p>
<p>If we read Acts carefully, we can see the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s intention to spread the church, not only geographically but also to different races. After the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to Taiwan and churches were established, we spontaneously hoped that the gospel would be preached among the local people. This is the spreading of the church. On the one hand, the church spread from the Jewish lands to Gentile regions, and on the other hand, it spread from the Jewish people to the Gentile people.</p>
<p>At the time of Paul&rsquo;s first ministry journey, the spreading of the church was very strong. Furthermore, the spreading in the Gentile regions laid the foundation for the church throughout history. The last portion of the Bible speaks of seven epistles to the seven churches in Asia Minor (Rev. 1:4). These seven churches represent the church throughout the generations. Later, the apostles returned to Antioch, and at that time there were no problems in the church in Antioch. They could only declare the things that God had done with them and that God had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles (Acts 14:26-27).</p>
<p>The church spread, many walls were broken down, and the church became universal. In the matter of geography, the church is universal; in the matter of race, the church is also universal. However, Jerusalem was still a problem, and some came from Jerusalem with the intention of making the church into a church of the Jews; they wanted to bring Jewish things into the church (15:1-2). If people limit the way of the church or the spread of the church, they will miss a great blessing. In contrast, any person or place that allows the church to have a way will receive a special blessing from God. We must be saved from all the problems within us to allow the church to spread continually without any limitations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Europe</h2>
<p>After Paul separated from Barnabas (vv. 35-39), he went out on his second ministry journey. Paul originally thought that he would work in the region of Asia Minor, but the Holy Spirit gave him a vision and wanted him to go to Macedonia, which is in Europe. Therefore, he established several local churches in Macedonia (16:6&mdash;18:22).</p>
<p>The first church that Paul established in Macedonia was in Philippi (16:12). Of all the churches in Macedonia, Philippi was the healthiest and the best; the next best was the church in Thessalonica (17:1). Although the church in Ephesus was good, it did not compare with the churches in Philippi and Thessalonica. After Thessalonica, the apostle Paul went on to Berea (v. 10), to Athens (v. 15), and then to Corinth (18:1). Thus, the gospel was preached to Europe, and several local churches were established there. Paul then passed through Ephesus (v. 19) on his way back to Antioch (v. 22).</p>
<p>Paul remained in Antioch for some time and then went out a third time to preach the word. In principle, there was not much spreading on his third ministry journey, after which he went to Jerusalem. He may have wanted to go to Antioch, but before he was able to make the trip, he was arrested by the Jews in Jerusalem (22:27-30).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
