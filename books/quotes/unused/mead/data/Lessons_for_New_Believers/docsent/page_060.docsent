   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON FIFTEEN THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ and the house of God, the vessel through which God can be expressed in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The expression of the Body of Christ, the house of God, is local, and there is only one expression in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, the administration of each church is local; on the other hand, all the churches are one with regard to their move, having the common goal of upholding God s testimony on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not sufficient for us to realize only this; we need to know the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The oneness of the church is also the unity of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we do not like to use the term unity because the church is one from the beginning; there is no need for the church to be united.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we use the word unity, we are implying that there was a time when the church was not one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we prefer to use the term oneness to describe the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word oneness can be applied to something that is produced out of one source, one origin, and according to one principle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, it is not only permissible, but it is appropriate to say that the church is one because the source, origin, nature, and principle of the church are all one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is truly something that is one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church cannot be two and cannot be divided; once the church is divided, it is through.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must preserve the nature of the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will consider the oneness of the church in the following six points.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE SOURCE, PRODUCING, NATURE, PRINCIPLE,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>EXISTENCE, ADMINISTRATION, FELLOWSHIP, TESTIMONY,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND EVERY ASPECT OF THE CHURCH BEING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything that is related to the church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever the church loses the oneness, it immediately is divided and falls apart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church comes out of the Triune God; hence, the source of the church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is produced by the Triune God entering into man to be his life; hence, the producing of the church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The nature of the church is the Triune God coming into man as life; hence, the nature of the church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The principle that is produced out of this nature must also be one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The administration of the church is one regardless of where the church is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the universe the church has only one fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The testimony of the church is also one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every aspect of the church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the church is altogether a matter of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE CHURCH RECEIVING ONE SPIRIT, ONE LORD, AND</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>ONE GOD THROUGH ONE FAITH AND ONE BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TO BECOME ONE BODY AND HAVE ONE HOPE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 4:3-6 speaks of seven ones: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These seven ones are all concerning the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Body is the focus of the seven ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Body is produced from people who have one faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through this faith, the content of what we believe, we receive the Lord and eternal life, and we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Gospel of John this is the faith through which we believe into the Son and receive eternal life 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the book of Romans it is the faith by which we are justified 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This faith does not refer to whether we believe in pre-tribulation rapture or post-tribulation rapture or whether we should keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These things are not the faith; they are merely views and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One person may believe in the pre-tribulation rapture, and another person believes in the post-tribulation rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One person may believe in keeping the Sabbath, but another person may not believe in keeping the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These are merely views and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is only one faith that causes man to be justified and saved and to receive God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the Bible calls it one faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as a person is saved, this faith is in him regardless of whether he believes in a pre-tribulation or post-tribulation rapture or whether he believes in keeping the Lord s Day or the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Body is also the result of one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This baptism is not a matter of being immersed or sprinkled but of being baptized into the name of the Lord and being buried together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through baptism, those who have believed into the Lord have died, been buried, and resurrected with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, they have been delivered from everything that is of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through one faith we enter into the new creation, and through one baptism we are delivered out of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through one faith we become the new creation in Christ, and through one baptism the old creation in Adam is terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Through one faith and one baptism we are transferred out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we receive the Lord and are put into Him through one faith and one baptism, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord, the Spirit, and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, we receive the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit enters into us John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we receive the Spirit, we receive the Son who is in the Spirit, and we also receive the Father who is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With regard to order, the Father comes first, the Spirit comes last, and the Son is in the middle.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>With regard to the Triune God s reaching us, the Spirit comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we receive the Spirit, we receive the Son, and when we receive the Son, we have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Through one faith and one baptism, we have received one Spirit, one Lord, and one God, and this produces the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The one Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church is produced in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The one faith and one baptism are the history of the one Body; they are accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, the Body is not something merely from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Body also has a glorious future, that is, a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This one hope is to enter into glory, to be the same as the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, our hope is also one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Each of the seven ones is indispensable to every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Believing in a pre-tribulation rapture or post-tribulation rapture or keeping the Sabbath or the Lord s Day does not matter because they do not affect our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, if we lack any of the seven ones, we are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must have the faith that causes us to be saved and the baptism that delivers us from the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must receive the Spirit, the Lord, and God who make us part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must also recognize this Body and admit that the future of the Body is the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we are short in any one of these seven points, there is a problem with our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>These seven ones are the very elements that constitute the church: one faith, one baptism, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one Body, and one hope, to enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The elements that constitute the church are all one.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Its history is one, and its future is one.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Its inner life is one, and its outer form is one.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Since everything concerning the church is one, the church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we see this, we will understand why we should never do anything that would cause the church to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whenever the church is divided, the church is destroyed.</S>
