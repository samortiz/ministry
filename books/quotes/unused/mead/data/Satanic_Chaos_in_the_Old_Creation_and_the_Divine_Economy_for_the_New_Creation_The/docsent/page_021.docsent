   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now let us consider verses 27 through 29.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These verses say, "As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Abraham has only one seed, Christ v. 16 . Hence, to be Abraham's seed we must be of Christ, be a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because we are one with Christ, we too are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God's promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, through faith we, the believers, are Abraham's seed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that our race has been changed from the Adamic race to the Abrahamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we, all the believers in Christ white, black, yellow, brown, and red are of the same race, the Abrahamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have a further confirmation of this in Galatians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 10 says, "So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do what is good toward all, but especially toward those of the household of the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who are those of the household of the faith?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are the spiritual descendants of Abraham, including all the believing Jews and believing Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No matter what our color may be, we all have faith, and we all are members of the household of the faith, members of the same family.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the believers in Christ together constitute a universal household, the great family of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whereas in verse 10 we have the household of the faith, in verses 15 and 16 we have the new creation and the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The household of the faith is the new creation, and the new creation is the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that these three terms household of the faith, new creation, and Israel of God are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As real Jews, as Abraham's spiritual descendants, we are first the household of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, we are a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation" 2 Cor 5:17a .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Finally, we are the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone who believes in Christ is a member of the household of the faith, a new creation, and a part of the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What a wonderful people we are in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, we are a new creation; on the other hand, we are still troubled by chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes we may wonder why God does not simply eliminate the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The infinite, eternal God accomplished the miracle of becoming incarnated; He remained in Mary's womb for nine months, and then He was born to be the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since He could do such a miracle, why did He not destroy those who opposed Him when He was on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not long after the Lord Jesus was born, Herod tried to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why did God not immediately do away with Herod?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Herodians conspired to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why did God not remove all of them?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, why did God not rid the earth of chaos?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our opinion, God should come in to clear away all the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may say to Him, "Lord, why is the chaos still here?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why do You not take it away?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If You would eliminate the chaos, a lot of time would be saved, and there would be no more problems."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Probably we all have had this kind of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today we still experience chaos in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the morning we may have a pleasant time with the Lord enjoying the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, not long afterward we may be troubled by our spouse or by one of our children.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suddenly instead of economy there is chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have chaos not only in our family life but even in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some might say that the church life is a paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yes, in a sense the church life may be a kind of paradise, but this does not mean that there will never be turmoil in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the thirty years that the Lord's recovery has been in the United States, we have seen turmoil after turmoil, chaos after chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When there is turmoil in the church life, we may be bothered and ask, "Is this the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is this the recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is the difference between this and the denominations?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order that we all may be comforted, I am burdened to point out the record in the Bible of the satanic chaos in the old creation and the divine economy for the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I also have been bothered by the turmoil, but one day the Lord showed me from the New Testament how much the Lord Jesus Himself was troubled by chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When He was a baby, Herod tried to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, telling him to take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt Matt 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Later Joseph was instructed in a dream to return to the land of Israel and to settle in the city of Nazareth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God did not clear away all the chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although God sent His recovery to this country, He has not removed the chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the contrary, we have been troubled by chaos both from the outside and from the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Certain opposers on the outside wrote evil books to slander and defame us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Certain of those who were once on the inside have caused turmoil, saying falsely that, since 1984, the recovery has changed in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One person even went so far as to say that the training in Taipei should be dismantled.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Others have accused me of no longer caring for life but only for numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These accusations were made by those who were formerly on the inside, including some who had been intimately related to me and who had been under my training for twenty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such accusations and the turmoil caused by them are surely something chaotic.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>During the years I was with Brother Nee, there was chaos again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I observed that the chaos came in cycles.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every eight or ten years was a cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since I was Brother Nee's helper, the chaos was directed not at me but at him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was the "umbrella" upon which the "rain" would fall, and I was under him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After I was sent out of mainland China, to some extent I became the umbrella, and throughout the years the rain has been falling on me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, I can testify that actually the chaos does not hurt us or damage us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On the contrary, the chaos helps the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For this reason, even in the midst of the chaos, I am comforted, I praise the Lord, and I rejoice in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The New Testament is full not only of the divine economy but also of the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Let us now consider the record in the New Testament concerning the divine economy and the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After this, we will see the ending of the satanic chaos and the consummation of the divine economy.</S>
