God cares only for one thing&#151;for being worked into us. God does not have any intention to make someone a great professor. There are flocks of scholars and professors on earth already. God's intention is not to build up a world full of professors. God's intention is to build up His kingdom. All who are in His kingdom must be those who give God the full ground and the full opportunity to work Himself into them. This is why Paul said in Romans 8:28 that all things work together for good to those who love God. What is the "good" about which Paul is speaking here? Is this "good" a high degree or a promotion?</P><P>If we love God, He will cause all things to work together for our good, but the good is not what we may want or expect. The good is what God intends to work out according to Romans 8. The good is for us to be conformed to the image of His firstborn Son (v. 29). God's heart's desire is not related to whether we get a good job or get promoted. He is not concerned about whether we make a lot of money or lose money. In fact, God may use all things to cause a person to lose money. If this person made money, God would have no chance to work Himself into that person. When a person loses money, he may complain to God, but God is taking this opportunity to dispense Himself into this person.</P><P>Many of us think we know how to pray, but actually we do not know how to pray in a fitting way. Paul indicated that the best prayer is to groan (Rom. 8:26, 23). We do not know how to pray, but the Spirit teaches us how to pray. The Spirit teaches us to groan. This sister wondered why she lost all her money. She trusted in the Lord so much, but the Lord did not lead her to the right person. Then she did not know how to pray. When we do not know how to pray, we groan. That is the best way to pray.</P><P>We have seen that in many of the psalms, David was clear about how to pray, and he even instructed God to fight against his enemies with weapons (Psa. 35:1-3). Of course, this kind of prayer is not according to God's way. We surely should not instruct God in our prayer. Especially, we should not tell Him to deal with our enemies, because this is against the teaching of the New Testament (Matt. 5:44).</P><P>We have seen in our life-study of the Psalms that the title of Psalm 34 says that David wrote this psalm after he had disguised himself in hypocrisy before Abimelech (see message sixteen of Life-study of the Psalms). David disguised himself to make Abimelech think that he was insane, and then he blessed and praised God for delivering him. Actually, he delivered himself by disguising himself, and then he gave God the credit.</P><P>Instead, David should have said, "Lord, what shall I pray?" If David had prayed in this way, he would have been spiritual. But David was so bold to bless and praise Jehovah for hearing him and delivering him. Actually, David practiced falsehood to cheat that king. Was that God's answering him? I am saying this to help us realize that when we are so clear about how to pray, this means we are natural and in ourselves. The best prayer many times is to say, "Lord, I don't know how or what to pray." We do not know the kind of prayer God desires, and we are not clear how to pray; hence we groan. In our groaning, the Spirit groans also, interceding for us. God the Father answers when the Spirit intercedes for us, and He arranges our circumstances, causing all things to work together for good to us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_102.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_104.html">Next</a> </body></html>
