<h2 class="head2">Learning to Be Rich before the Lord</h2><p>Third, we have to learn to be rich before the Lord. He wants us to sell our all, but He does not want us to be in poverty. He wants us to learn to be rich in Him. As Christians, we are rich men, depending on the ground upon which we stand. In 1926 or 1927 I heard a pastor who said, "Today is New Year's Day. Everyone likes to greet others with the words, `Wishing you prosperity.' While a believer should not be prosperous, he should at least be modestly well-off." Actually, according to the Bible God wants us all to be rich before Him and poor before the world. Only those who are poor on earth can be rich before God. When we are asked to sell our all, we are not being asked to spend all of our money, but to transfer it from our earthly bank to the heavenly bank. We are being asked to change our deposit from one place to another. Selling our all is making a transfer and depositing our money in heaven. Christians can be foolish indeed. When God asks, "Do you believe that it is safe to keep your mammon in the Bank of Shanghai?", we will answer, "Yes." When God asks, "Do you believe in the heavenly bank?", we will answer, "No." We do not deposit our money in the heavenly bank simply because the interest is higher there. God does not attract us with interest. Our Father, the rich One, is able to pay us one hundred dollars interest for every dollar we deposit. Our heavenly bank has an interest rate of ten thousand percent. There is a profit of ten thousand percent. Today it would be sensational if a bank offered three percent interest for any deposit. However, God is asking whether we have faith. He offers a profit of ten thousand percent. Our money has been in the earthly bank. We can invest in an earthly bank, but will we invest in God's eternal bank? Do we want to deposit our money in an eternal account? We are here to serve God! If we see this, we will give our all for this. In the past we gave our all to mammon; we served it. Now we have to put everything on God's side and serve Him. We have to be those who are rich in God.</p><h2 class="head2">Selling One's All to Give to the Poor</h2><p>Fourth, in the Gospels the Lord dealt with mammon by ordering it to be given to the poor. During Pentecost the poor referred to those who were in the church, the household of the faith. When believers sell their all, they should lay the proceeds at the feet of the elders and the apostles, rather than give it immediately to the poor. On the one hand, we should distribute our wealth to the poor outside the church, and on the other hand, we should distribute it to those in the church. There is much benefit in taking care of the unbelieving poor; this can expand our heart's capacity. Today we have the church, and there are two distinct advantages to practicing giving in the church. First, the givers become men who are delivered from mammon. Second, the receivers are believing brothers and sisters. The Lord told men to sell their all because He did not want men to fall into the bondage of mammon. He wanted men to serve Him. The Lord did not say to keep the proceeds that one had received from selling his all in a safe place for two years because there would be no inflation in two years. The Lord cannot wait for two years. A Christian should never accumulate mammon. We have to consider mammon as a venomous snake; it is not simply a bug or an ant. We have to shake off mammon like Paul shook off the viper. It is for our own good that we sell our all.</p><p>The twelve apostles sold their all and gave up everything. At Pentecost, Peter did not give a message on giving one's all, but when the three thousand saw the twelve who had sold their all, they did the same thing. In Acts 4 another five thousand came in. They saw the three thousand who had sold their all, and they did the same thing. Those in the succeeding generation take their example from the previous generation. The five thousand followed the example of the three thousand, the three thousand followed the example of the twelve, and the twelve followed the example of Christ. What we hear can never match what we see. When men come to the church, we want them to see love and oneness, but they should also see that we have sold our all. If we do not set the standard right, the next generation will have no way to go on. Whatever we want our next generation to be, we have to be this in our generation. Today we are in the recovery; we are here to bear the responsibility of the recovery. May we be those who take the way of voluntary poverty. We hope that when the next generation meets again, there will be no need for them to discuss such things as buying land or building houses. Strictly speaking, there is no need to preach about selling one's all. We preach it today because such a practice was lost after Pentecost. We hope that we will not need to speak too much about this in the future. Of course, if the brothers and sisters will not sell their all, we will have to continue preaching this.</p>
