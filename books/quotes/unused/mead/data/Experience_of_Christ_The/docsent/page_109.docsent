   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO COOPERATING WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to our need to cooperate with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we pointed out in the last message, we must die in order to live.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The proper and genuine Christian life is a life of dying, yet living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, if you do not allow a seed to die by sowing it into the ground, it cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if it falls into the ground and dies, it will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, it grows by dying.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without dying, the life in the seed cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life is there, but it is not living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order for the life in the seed to be living, the seed must die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How mysterious this is!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although it is a mystery, this principle operates throughout the universe, in the plant life, in the animal life, in the human life, and even in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God became a man to die so that He might live out God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus said, "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a grain of wheat does not fall into the ground and die, there will be no growing, no living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if it dies, it will produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we see the principle of life growing through death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where death is, there life is growing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This principle applies not only to the plant and animal life, but also to the human life and even the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE PILOT AND THE CO-PILOT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the process of dying, we need to cooperate with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On many airplanes there are a pilot and a co-pilot.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The co-pilot must cooperate with the pilot.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we are dying, we should not operate, but cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a terrible thing for us to operate, to try to do something, as we are dying.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, a brother may pray, "Lord, my wife is giving me a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I must overcome this problem."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you do this, you are wrong, because you are operating instead of cooperating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word "cooperate" implies that there is someone better than you who is operating.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, the pilot is better than the co-pilot, for he is first and the co-pilot is second.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sorry to say, most of the time you pilot your own life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result is misery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The reason your family life is miserable is that you are the pilot instead of the co-pilot.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our pilot is Christ as the wonderful life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we have Him as the Pilot within us, we often do not honor Him, respect Him, or care for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, we prefer to be the pilot.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some Christians may think that as long as Christ is the Pilot, everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No, everything is not necessarily fine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although Christ is the Pilot, you need to be the co-pilot.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our practice is either to be the pilot or to be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many Christians realize the truth of Galatians 2:20, that they have been crucified with Christ, that they live no longer, and that Christ lives in them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This, however, is just half of the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse also speaks of "the life which I now live in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many Christians either pilot their own life or neglect everything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, we should do neither of these and avoid both extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our Pilot needs us to be the co-pilot.</S>
