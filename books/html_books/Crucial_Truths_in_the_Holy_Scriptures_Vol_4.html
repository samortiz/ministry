 <h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
 <p><em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures</em> was originally published in Chinese as a six-volume set containing sixty topics of basic truths in the Bible. The topics and verses were selected and arranged by Witness Lee, and these books were greatly used by the Lord in the early spread of the local churches throughout the Far East. Volume 4 contains topics 34 through 46. These messages have been translated from the Chinese.</p>
 <h1 class="title">PREFACE TO THE CHINESE EDITION</h1> 
 <p>In order for the children of God, especially new believers, to receive a greater supply of the Word, we, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, wish to present some crucial truths in the Holy Scriptures so that the children of God may receive a foundation in the Word of God.</p>
 <p>These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo. Later, in the autumn of 1949, Brother Lee studied them again with the brothers and sisters in Taipei and added eighteen topics for a total of sixty topics in all. Chapters 1 through 16 cover the condition of a sinner to the time of knowing his salvation. Chapters 17 through 60 examine various matters a believer should know and pursue after his salvation, with chapters 17 through 26 specifically covering ten matters a believer should practice after his salvation.</p> 
 <p>The purpose of these crucial truths is to make the matters of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation clear to those who lack an understanding of their salvation. Furthermore, they lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation. The purpose is specific, but the messages are diverse.</p>
 <p>The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God. We look to the Lord to inspire every brother and sister to read and study these notes carefully. We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible.</p>

<h1 class="title">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD</h1>
<p>The topics in chapters 17 through 33 cover matters to practice after believing in the Lord. In this volume we begin to examine matters that a believer should know and pursue after being saved. The first matter relates to the knowledge of God. We need to see and know some crucial points concerning various aspects of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING REVEALED HIMSELF</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:20; see also Psa. 14:1; 19:1-2; 53:1; Acts 14:15-17; 17:26-27; Heb. 11:6).</p>
<p>God has revealed Himself in the universe through His creation. Since the creation of the world, God&rsquo;s eternal power and divine characteristics have been manifested to men. Although men cannot see God, they can know Him through His creation. Therefore, creation is a proof of a creating God: &ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God, / And the expanse proclaims the work of His hands&rdquo; (Psa. 19:1). All creation is a proof of the Creator. The order in the universe and the regulation of all things is a proof of the manifestation of God. Even the existence of human beings is a proof of God. When we consider the existence of all things and the regulation of the universe, we should realize that there is a God who created and governs the universe. When we consider the things related to ourselves and to our origin, this should also cause us to &ldquo;seek God...grope for Him and find Him&rdquo; (Acts 17:27). With such proof and evidence, a man will say, &ldquo;There is no God,&rdquo; only out of stubbornness (Psa. 14:1; 53:1). Every reasonable man should confess and believe that there is a God when he sees the things in the universe and the order in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING SPOKEN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:1-2; see also 2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21; Matt. 22:31).</p>
<p>God not only reveals Himself through His creation in the universe, but He also explains and reveals Himself through His speaking. When a person speaks, his speaking reveals his inner thoughts so that others may know him. If I stood in front of you without speaking, you would not be able to know or understand me. If God only created the universe but did not speak, we would be able to know of His existence, but we would not be able to know Him or the things in Him. But God has spoken. His Word reveals Himself, His heart&rsquo;s desire, and everything within Him. In ancient times He spoke in the prophets; in the last of these days He has spoken in the Son (Heb. 1:1-2). Everything that He has spoken through the prophets and the Son is recorded in the Bible. Therefore, the Bible is the word He has spoken. He inspired the Bible; that is, He moved people to speak His word through His Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21). Everything that we need to know about God has been included in the Bible. We do not need to conduct research or guess concerning these matters, because He has clearly revealed them to us through the Bible. Just as the creation is a proof of God&rsquo;s existence, the Bible is a revelation of God Himself. We can know Him by the creation, and we can know and understand Him by the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING COME FORTH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 3:16).</p>
<p>God has not only revealed Himself in the creation of the universe and in His speaking, but He has also come through His incarnation. He created all things to demonstrate His existence, He inspired the Bible to reveal and explain Himself, and He was incarnated as a man to manifest Himself. Although He revealed Himself through His creation and His speaking, He manifested Himself through incarnation. His creation pointed man to His existence, and His speaking enabled man to understand Him. However, His incarnation enabled man to see Him and meet Him. Thank the Lord that God has not only created and spoken but also manifested Himself in the flesh. The God who revealed Himself through His creation and His speaking has manifested Himself through His incarnation. Prior to His incarnation He revealed Himself to man, but through His incarnation He has manifested Himself to man. Jesus Christ was the manifestation of God in the flesh. This great mystery in the universe, the mystery of godliness, manifested God so that man could see God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:18, see also vv. 1, 4; 5:18-19, 23; 10:30; 12:44-45; 13:20; 14:9-10; Phil. 2:6-7; Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:15; 2:9).</p>
<p>God has been manifested to man through the only begotten Son. Before God was manifested in the Son, no one had ever seen God. The Son is the manifestation of God among men through incarnation. When men saw the Son, they saw God. To believe in the Son is to believe in God, to receive the Son is to receive God, and to honor the Son is to honor God because God is in the Son, and the Son is in God. The Father and the Son are one. The Son is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of His substance. He has the form of God, and He is the image of God. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily. The Son declared God among men even though He was in the likeness of a man and in the form of a slave.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING ENTERED</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:16-17).</p>
<p>God was incarnated in the Son. Although God was manifested among men, He could not enter into man. Although He could live among men, He could not abide in man. Therefore, when the Son was on the earth, He manifested God among men, and after He returned to the heavens, the Spirit was given so that God could enter into man and be with man. God was incarnated in the Son to be manifested among men, seen by men, and received by men. Following the death and resurrection of Christ, He came as the Spirit to enter into man, mingle with man, and be obtained by man. He went through this process in order to have a close, personal relationship with man and to be man&rsquo;s life, salvation, and everything.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;We know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:24; see also 4:13; 1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19; Rom. 8:9-10).</p>
<p>The Spirit&rsquo;s abiding in us is God&rsquo;s abiding in us. Just as Christ is the embodiment of God, the Spirit is the realization of God. God was embodied in Christ and came among men. God is realized as the Spirit and enters into man. The Spirit has been given to us, and as His temple, God now dwells in us. This is God&rsquo;s coming to dwell in us.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the transfiguration of God because He is the transfiguration of Christ. Christ was the embodiment of God. After Christ died, rose, and ascended, He descended as the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ, the transfiguration of God. This is the reason that the Spirit is called <em>the Spirit of God</em> and <em>the Spirit of Christ.</em> The Spirit is the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ. Thus, the Spirit&rsquo;s dwelling in man is God&rsquo;s dwelling in man and Christ&rsquo;s dwelling in man. This is the true situation of all those who are saved and who belong to Christ. If a person does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Christ who lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20; see also 4:19; 2 Cor. 13:5; Col. 1:27; John 14:19-20; 17:21, 23, 26).</p>
<p>Christ is in everyone who believes in Him. Christ not only is in us, but He also wants to live in us and to grow and be formed in us so that we may be conformed to His glorious image (Rom. 8:29). Today He is in us as our hope of glory. In the future He will be our glory. As He lives in us and is joined with us, God is in us, and we are in God. Thus, the Triune God and we and we and the Triune God are one.</p>
<p>We must see and remember the four steps that God took in order for us to know of Him, to know Him and receive Him, to obtain Him, and to be one with Him. These four steps are (1) the creation of all things, (2) the revelation in the Bible, (3) incarnation, and (4) transfiguration as the Spirit. The creation of all things shows man that there is a God. The revelation in the Bible explains God to man. The incarnation manifested God to man, and His transfiguration as the Spirit allows God to enter into man and be obtained by man. Thus, He is revealed by the creation, explained by the Bible, manifested by incarnation, and made available as the Spirit. If we want to know Him, we must know these four major steps. This is basic knowledge concerning God. We must know the creation, the Bible, Christ, and the Holy Spirit in order to know God. We must have a clear understanding concerning creation, the Bible, Christ, and the Holy Spirit in order to have a thorough knowledge of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING TRIUNE</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, God is triune. The word <em>triune</em> is more appropriate than the term <em>three-in-one.</em> Although we cannot find the word <em>triune</em> in the Bible, the fact that God is triune is revealed in the Bible (Matt. 28:19). Many people wonder how God can be three and also one. This matter is difficult to understand because our mind is limited. It is not possible to completely understand the matter of God being triune, just as we cannot completely understand how we are a tripartite being with a spirit, soul, and body. There are many things in the universe that our limited mentality cannot understand. We can apprehend their existence, but we cannot understand or explain them. If we lack understanding of such matters, it should not be a surprise that we cannot understand such a mysterious person as God. In regard to the matter of God being triune, the Bible clearly speaks of this, even though it does not provide details concerning how this is possible.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There is one God&rdquo;; &ldquo;There is no God but one&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 2:5; 1 Cor. 8:4, see also v. 6; Rom. 3:30).</p>
<p>These portions of the Bible clearly and definitely state that there is only one God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;In the beginning God [plural] created [singular] the heavens and the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 1:1).</p>
<p>The Bible clearly says that there is only one God, but in this verse in the Hebrew language the word <em>God</em> is plural. This tells us that although there is one God, there is a particular characteristic&mdash;a plural aspect&mdash;in His person. This may cause some to think that there are separate persons who are God; however, the singular verb <em>create</em> in the Hebrew language counters such an understanding. The subject <em>God</em> is plural, but the verb <em>create</em> is singular. This proves that God is both plural and singular. According to the record of the Bible, the plural references to God point to the number three, and the singular references, to the number one. From the very first verse of the Bible, the revelation of God implies that He is triune.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;God [plural] said, Let Us make man in Our image [singular], according to Our likeness&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 1:26; see also 3:22; 11:6-7; Isa. 6:8).</p>
<p>At the end of the first chapter of Genesis, the Bible not only uses the plural word in Hebrew for God, but it clearly includes God&rsquo;s reference to Himself as &ldquo;Us.&rdquo; This is one of many portions in the Bible that refers to God in the plural form. However, in Genesis 1:26 the word for <em>image</em> is in the singular form of the Hebrew language. Although the word <em>God</em> and God&rsquo;s reference to Himself, <em>Us,</em> are both plural, the word <em>image</em> is singular. <em>Us</em> is plural, but the image of Us is singular. There is only one image. This proves that God is triune.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;As We are one&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:22, see also v. 11).</p>
<p>Although the Lord&rsquo;s word to the Father clearly contains the plural pronoun <em>We,</em> it also clearly indicates that the &ldquo;We&rdquo; are one. This again shows that God is triune.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Into the name [singular] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<p>Although the Lord speaks of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in this verse, the word <em>name</em> in the original Greek is singular. Although the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three, there is only one name. Thus, the Bible shows that the God who has been revealed is three and one; He is triune. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father&rdquo;; &ldquo;Of the Son, &lsquo;Your throne, O God&rsquo;&rdquo;; &ldquo;Why has Satan filled your heart to deceive the Holy Spirit...You have not lied to men but to God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:2; Heb. 1:8; Acts 5:3-4; see also Eph. 1:17; John 1:1; 2 Cor. 3:17-18).</p>
<p>In these verses the Bible clearly reveals that the Father, Son, and Spirit are all God. Based on the record of other portions of the Bible, this does not mean that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three separate Gods but that the Father, Son, and Spirit are triune.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord; and there are distinction of operations, but the same God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ&rdquo;; &ldquo;The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:14; 1 Cor. 12:4-6; 1 Pet. 1:2; Eph. 1:17).</p>
<p>These portions of the Bible, which speak of the apostle&rsquo;s blessing for the believers, God&rsquo;s inspiration of the believers, God&rsquo;s choosing of the saints, and God&rsquo;s revelation of Himself to the saints, all refer to God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. This shows that God is triune.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Jehovah bless you and keep you; Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you; Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace&rdquo;</strong> (Num. 6:24-26).</p>
<p>God commanded the Old Testament priests to speak the name <em>Jehovah</em> three times in succession when they blessed the children of Israel. They were not charged to say &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo; two times or even four times; God charged them to speak the name three times. This is very meaningful because the God who blesses is triune. The first reference to Jehovah involves His blessing and keeping. These are actions of God the Father. The second reference to Jehovah involves His shining and being gracious. These are actions of God the Son. The third reference to Jehovah involves His lifting up His countenance and giving peace. These, undoubtedly, are actions of God the Spirit. Therefore, this blessing involves the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;the Triune God&mdash;blessing, giving grace, and giving peace to His chosen people.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 6:3, see also v. 8).</p>
<p>According to the Old Testament, the priests referred to Jehovah three times in succession when they blessed the people. In a similar fashion, the seraphim in the heavens say &ldquo;holy&rdquo; three times in succession when they praise God. When they praise God, they say, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy,&rdquo; because the God whom they praise is triune. In verse 8 the God whom they praise refers to Himself in the plural with the word <em>Us.</em></p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:9-10).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the priests were charged to say the name of Jehovah three times when they blessed the people, and in the New Testament the Lord charged the believers to refer to God three times with the word <em>Your</em> when they prayed. This is because the God to whom the Lord wanted the believers to pray is triune. The first <em>Your</em> is associated with the name of God, which is related mainly to the Father. The second <em>Your</em> is associated with the kingdom of God, which is related to Christ. And the third <em>Your</em> is associated with the will of God, which is related to the Spirit. The name of God the Father, the kingdom of God the Son, and the will of God the Spirit can be seen in other portions of the Bible as well (John 17:5-6, 11; 1 Cor. 15:24-25; Eph. 5:5; Col. 1:13; Acts 13:2; 1 Cor. 1:1; Eph. 1:1). Consequently, the prayer that the Lord charged the New Testament believers to pray also proves that God is triune.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 4:8).</p>
<p>Just as there are verses in the Old Testament that refer to the name <em>Jehovah</em> and to the word <em>holy</em> three times in succession, there are verses in the New Testament that refer to <em>Your</em> and to the word <em>holy</em> three times in succession. In the Old Testament the priests on earth blessed the people in the name of Jehovah three times, and the seraphim in the heavens praised God three times, referring to Him as holy each time. In the New Testament the believers on earth refer to God as &ldquo;Your&rdquo; three times in their prayer, and the four living creatures in the heavens praise God three times, referring to Him as &ldquo;holy&rdquo; each time. This is revealed because the God to whom we petition, pray, and praise is triune.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that God is the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;the Triune God. The Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation of God to man, and the Spirit is the realization of God, the entrance of God into man. God the Father dwells in the heavens in unapproachable light, God the Son is manifested among men, and God the Spirit enters into and is realized by man.</p>
<p>As the Father is in the Son and is one with the Son, the Son is also in the Spirit and is one with the Spirit. The Son is the manifestation of the Father, and the Spirit is the realization, the entrance, of the Son. The Father is manifested among men in the Son, and the Son enters into man as the Spirit. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit. The Father, Son, and Spirit are three yet at the same time one.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
ACCORDING TO THE PURE WORD IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Being Unique</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You alone are God&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 86:10).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I am Jehovah...; besides Me there is no God&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 45:5; see also Eph. 4:6; 1 Tim. 2:5).</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;There is no God but one&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 8:4).</p>
<p>Both the Old and New Testaments clearly and definitely speak of God as one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Being Triune</h2>
<h2 class="head3">I and Us, Me and We</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 6:8; see also Gen. 1:26; 3:22; 11:7).</p>
<p>In this verse God refers to Himself as both &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Us.&rdquo; Although we cannot say how He is both &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Us,&rdquo; we know that He is both. In the New Testament there are verses in which God refers to Himself with both singular and plural pronouns.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:23).</p>
<p>When the Lord, who is God, referred to Himself in this verse, He used the pronouns <em>Me</em> and <em>My,</em> but when He referred to God the Father, He used the pronoun <em>We.</em> Both <em>Me</em> and <em>We</em> refer to only one God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:11).</p>
<p>In this verse the Lord referred to Himself and to the Father using the word <em>We.</em> This is a mystery that is beyond human language and understanding.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Father, Son, and Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Baptizing them into the name [singular] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<p>This verse clearly says that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have one name. There are three, but there is only one name. This is God being triune.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Three All Being God</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Father Being God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:2).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:17).</p>
<p>Many places in the New Testament speak of God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Son Being God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;But of the Son, &lsquo;Your throne, O God&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:8).</p>
<p>The Son is called God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:1).</p>
<p>The Word is Christ, the Son. Since the Word is God, the Son is God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 9:5).</p>
<p>Christ is not only God but the God who is over all.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Spirit Being God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to deceive the Holy Spirit...You have not lied to men but to God&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 5:3-4).</p>
<p>In verse 3, Peter told Ananias that he had deceived the Holy Spirit, and in the following verse he equated this with lying to God. Thus, these two verses indicate that the Holy Spirit is God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Three Being Eternal</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Father Being Eternal</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Eternal Father&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 9:6).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of the Mighty God as being the Eternal Father. Thus, the Father is eternal.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Son Being Eternal</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You are the same, and Your years will not fail&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:12).</p>
<p>According to this verse, the years of the Lord will not fail, that is, will not end. This is confirmed in Hebrews 7:3, which says that He is without beginning of days or end of life. Thus, He is eternal.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Spirit Being Eternal</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The eternal Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:14).</p>
<p>According to this verse Christ offered Himself without blemish to God through the eternal Spirit. Thus, according to the Bible, we must proclaim that the Father, Son, and Spirit are all eternal.</p><h2 class="head3">The Three Co-existing</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:16-17; see also Eph. 3:14-17).</p>
<p>In these two verses the Son prayed to the Father to give the Spirit. Thus, the Father, Son, and Spirit all co-exist. In Ephesians 3:14-17 Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us through His Spirit into our inner man so that Christ could make His home in our heart. In both portions the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are mentioned. The three co-exist. According to Ephesians 3:14-17, the Father hears our prayer, the Spirit strengthens the believers, and Christ the Son makes His home in their hearts. This clearly shows that the Father, Son, and Spirit co-exist.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:14; see also 1 Cor. 12:4-6).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of the grace of Christ the Son, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship, or flowing, of the Holy Spirit, showing that the three co-exist. First Corinthians 12:4-6 speaks of the gifts of the Spirit, the ministries of the Lord, and the operations of God. Here we can see the Spirit, the Lord, and God. Once more this reveals that the Spirit, the Son, and the Father co-exist and work simultaneously. The Spirit gives gifts, the Lord ministers, and the Father operates.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Three Being One</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Son Being the Father</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 9:6).</p>
<p>The baby named Jesus, who was born in a manger in Bethlehem, was called Mighty God. If we believe that the child born to us is the Mighty God, we must also believe that the Son given to us is the Eternal Father. The Son is the Father. This is based on the pure Word of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us. Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Son and the Father Being One</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:30).</p>
<p>This word clearly shows that the Son and the Father are one.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Last Adam Becoming a Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:45).</p>
<p>Jesus is the last Adam, and the life-giving Spirit is the Holy Spirit. Apart from the Holy Spirit, there is no other Spirit who can give life, yet this verse clearly indicates that Jesus, who is called the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Lord (the Son) Being the Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p><em>Lord</em> in this verse refers to Jesus, and <em>Spirit</em> refers to the Holy Spirit. To say that the Lord Jesus is the Spirit is absolutely according to the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head3">All Three Being in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:6).</p>
<p>This verse clearly says that the Father is in us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am...in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:20).</p>
<p>The Son is also in us.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory&rdquo;</strong>(Col. 1:27).</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you?&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:5).</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...shall be in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:17).</p>
<p>The Spirit is also in us.</p>
<p>The Father is in us, the Son is in us, and the Spirit is in us. This is very clear. According to our experience, however, these three are one because the Father, Son, and Spirit are one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Triune God Being a Mystery</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:1).</p>
<p>This is a mystery. Are the Word and God one, or are They two? They are both.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>In this verse the Lord and the Spirit are spoken of as being one because the Lord is the Spirit, but later in the same verse the Spirit of the Lord is mentioned. This indicates that there is an aspect of distinction. Are the Lord and the Spirit one, or are They two? This is a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;But of the Son, &ldquo;&lsquo;Your throne, O God...Therefore, God, Your God, has anointed You&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:8-9).</p>
<p>In verse 8 the Son is called God, but verse 9 speaks of God as being His God. It is not possible to explain this mysterious matter.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Seven Spirits&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).</p>
<p>The one Spirit of God in Ephesians 4:4 is called the seven Spirits in the book of Revelation. This is another mystery.</p>
<p>Because the Triune God is a mystery, our limited mentality cannot completely understand the Triune God as a doctrine. The Triune God is for our experience and enjoyment. God being triune is for His economy. He is triune to dispense Himself into us and to become our life and our everything. The Triune God is for our experience and enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HEART OF GOD&mdash;LOVE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God so loved the world&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s heart is love, so He loves the world.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who desires all men to be saved&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 2:4; see also Matt. 23:37; 8:3; Ezek. 18:23; 33:11; Isa. 49:15; Jer. 3:1).</p>
<p>God desires all men to be saved because He loves man. Because His heart is love, He desires to save men, He is willing to save men, and He does not want men to perish. His love is greater than a mother&rsquo;s love for her children and greater than a husband&rsquo;s love for his wife.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ACTIONS OF GOD&mdash;RIGHTEOUS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justly?&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 18:25; see also Deut. 32:4).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s actions are righteous. He is the Judge of all the earth, so He cannot act unrighteously. Everything He does is absolutely righteous.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You may be declared righteous in Your words&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:4).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s righteousness is manifested and declared even in His judgment and rebuke of men.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;With a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:26; see also 1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>God justifies those who are of the faith of Jesus because He is righteous. His justification demonstrates His righteousness; that is, it shows that He is righteous. We were sinful and unrighteous and could not be justified according to God&rsquo;s standard of righteousness. Therefore, God caused Jesus, who was without sin, to receive His righteous punishment on our behalf (1 Pet. 3:18). For our sake, He judged the Lord Jesus according to His standard of righteousness to satisfy His righteous requirement. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, receive Him, and are joined to Him, God must justify us according to His righteousness. He can no longer righteously condemn us. The Lord Jesus, who shed His blood for our sins according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, bore our punishment. Now when one believes in the Lord Jesus, God forgives his sins because He is righteous. He cannot be unrighteous and refuse to forgive those who believe in the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>We must know the salvation of God not only according to His love but also according to His righteousness. Madame Guyon once said that even if God wanted to change His mind regarding her salvation, He could not do it, because He had already judged her on the cross. This truly is a word of one who knew God&rsquo;s salvation, and it truly is a word of one who knew God. Because of His righteousness, God has to save those who believe in the Lord. If God&rsquo;s salvation was based only on His love, our salvation would not be firm, because He could cease to love us, and if our salvation was based only on love, God would not be wrong or unrighteous if He ceased to love us. Thankfully, our salvation is based on both His love and His righteousness. Because He is righteous, our salvation is firm. His righteousness requires Him to save us when we believe in the Lord Jesus. In this regard, our salvation does not rest upon His love but rather upon the fulfillment of His legal responsibility according to His righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD&mdash;FAITHFUL</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Nor will I be false to My own faithfulness. / I will not profane My covenant, / Nor will I change what has gone forth from My lips&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 89:33-34; see also Heb. 6:18; 10:23; Psa. 119:89; Isa. 40:8; Matt. 24:35).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s actions are righteous, and His word is faithful. In God&rsquo;s salvation His word strengthens His actions. God&rsquo;s actions accomplish His salvation, and His word, which is according to His faithfulness, confirms and establishes His actions as being beyond change. Because of His faithfulness, He cannot nullify the words that have gone forth from His lips. This is true not only of God but of any faithful person; once a word leaves the mouth of a faithful person, it cannot be nullified.</p>
<p>God cannot lie, so the word that He speaks to us is completely faithful and reliable. It cannot be changed or nullified. His word is established in the heavens. The grass will wither, the flowers will fade, but His word is eternally established. Even if the heavens and earth pass away, His word cannot pass away.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the words that God speaks to us in the Bible are not ordinary words or promises; they are a covenant He has established with us. The words of the Bible are a covenant that God established with us according to His faithfulness. The words in the Bible are a testament; consequently, the Bible is composed of the Old and New Testaments. God&rsquo;s word will not change, and He will keep His covenant. He is bound by His word and by His covenant.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NATURE OF GOD&mdash;HOLY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You shall be holy because I am holy&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:16; see also Lev. 11:44-45; 20:7; Heb. 12:14).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s nature is not only holy; it is holiness itself. In chapter 8 we saw that to be holy is to be separated from everything. To say God&rsquo;s nature is holy is to say God&rsquo;s nature&mdash;God&rsquo;s essence&mdash;is separated from everything else. Because God&rsquo;s nature, His essence, is holy, He wants us to be holy, to be separated from everything other than Him. If we are not holy as He is holy, we cannot see Him or come near to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPRESSION OF GOD&mdash;GLORY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The glory of Jehovah settled on Mount Sinai&rdquo;</strong> (Exo. 24:16; see also Ezek. 1:28; 3:23).</p>
<p>God Himself is glory. There is always an appearance of glory when God manifests Himself to man. The glory of God is equal to the God of glory. Moses and the children of Israel saw the glory of God settling on Mount Sinai, and Ezekiel saw the glory of God. When they saw the glory of God, they saw God Himself. When they were before the glory of God, they were before God Himself.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;They exchanged their glory / For an image of an ox that eats grass&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 106:20; see also Jer. 2:11; Rom. 1:23; John 12:41; Acts 7:55; Heb. 1:3).</p>
<p>Jeremiah 2 says that the God of Israel was the glory of Israel. Man replaced God with idols, but Psalm 106:20 and Romans 1:23 both say that man replaced God&rsquo;s glory with idols. Therefore, these few portions show that the glory of God is God Himself. The glory of God is God Himself, especially when He appears to man (John 12:41; Acts 7:55). The Lord Jesus is the expression of God, so He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory (Heb. 1:3). Every person, event, or object that manifests God expresses God&rsquo;s glory. The phrase <em>give glory to God</em> means to express God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NAMES OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In the Old Testament (Hebrew)</h2>
<h2 class="head3">God</h2>
<p>This is the first name in the Bible. It has the following variations.</p>
<h2 class="head4">El</h2>
<p><em>El</em> is translated into English as &ldquo;God.&rdquo; It is singular and denotes God the Mighty One. It is first used in Genesis 14:18.</p>

<h2 class="head3">Jehovah</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah</em> means &ldquo;He who is, who was, and who is coming,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the One who existed, exists, and will exist eternally.&rdquo; It means that God eternally is and will not change; He has existed from eternity. He eternally exists, and He will not cease to exist (Exo. 3:14-15; Rev. 1:8). In the New Testament the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am&rdquo; (John 8:24, 28, 58), which refers to the name <em>Jehovah.</em> The name <em>Jehovah</em> is included in the following ten compound names.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-&lsquo;osenu</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-&lsquo;osenu</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah our Maker&rdquo; (Psa. 95:6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-jireh</h2>

<p><em>Jehovah-shalom</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is peace&rdquo; (Judg. 6:24).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-ro&lsquo;i</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-ro&lsquo;i</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is my Shepherd&rdquo; (Psa. 23:1).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-tsidqenu</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-tsidqenu</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah our righteousness&rdquo; (Jer. 23:6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-shammah</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-shammah</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah Is There&rdquo; (Ezek. 48:35).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-tsebaot, or Jehovah-sabaoth</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-sabaoth</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah of hosts&rdquo; (1 Sam. 1:3; Jer. 2:19).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Lord</h2>

<h2 class="head4">Adonai</h2>
<p>This is the plural form of the name <em>adon,</em> and it also means &ldquo;master.&rdquo; It is first used in Genesis 15:2.</p>
<p>In general three different names are used in the Old Testament to refer to God. The first is <em>God,</em> the second is <em>Jehovah,</em> and the third is <em>Lord. God</em> emphasizes His power, especially in creation, and <em>Jehovah</em> emphasizes His relationship with man. <em>Jehovah</em> is first used in Genesis 2:4 where it speaks of God in relation to man. The compound names based on Jehovah show further aspects of His relationship with man. The simple meaning of this name is &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; He is everything to man. Whatever man needs, He is. In His name, it is as if there is a blank after &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; which can be filled in by faith with whatever man needs. If a man needs healing, Jehovah can be his healing. If man needs peace, Jehovah can be his peace. Whatever man needs, Jehovah can provide. He is like a blank check that can be filled in with whatever man needs. This name is so precious and sweet to us!</p><h2 class="head2">In the New Testament (Greek)</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Theos</h2>
<p><em>Theos</em> is &ldquo;God&rdquo; in English. It is equivalent to the Old Testament Hebrew names of <em>El, Eloah,</em> and <em>Elohim.</em> It is often used to refer to the Triune God. In the New Testament it is used to refer to the Father (1 Pet. 1:2), to the Son (Heb. 1:8), and to the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Pater</h2>
<p><em>Pater</em> is &ldquo;Father&rdquo; in English. It is a name that specially reveals Him (John 20:17; 1 John 3:1). In the New Testament an Aramaic (Chaldean) word is also used, <em>abba,</em> in relation to God the Father. <em>Abba</em> is a transliteration that means &ldquo;father&rdquo; (Mark 14:36; Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Despotes</h2>
<p><em>Despotes</em> is &ldquo;Sovereign Master,&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;Master&rdquo; in English. It means &ldquo;the Ruler.&rdquo; The New Testament uses it to refer to God (Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; Rev. 6:10) and to the Lord Jesus (2 Pet. 2:1; Jude 4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Kurios</h2>
<p><em>Kurios</em> is &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; in English, and it is equivalent to the Old Testament Hebrew names <em>adon</em> and <em>adonai</em> (Matt. 1:20; Mark 12:29). When the New Testament quotes verses from the Old Testament, it often replaces the name <em>Jehovah</em> with <em>kurios.</em> This is the name that is used when the Lord Jesus is referred to as God (John 20:28; 1 Cor. 12:3; 5:4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Jesus</h2>
<p><em>Jesus</em> in Greek is equivalent to the Hebrew name <em>Joshua</em> (Num. 13:16); it means &ldquo;Jehovah Savior&rdquo; or &ldquo;the salvation of Jehovah.&rdquo; Thus, the Lord Jesus is Jehovah who is in a relationship with man, who comes to be man&rsquo;s Savior, and who becomes man&rsquo;s salvation. This name is used for the Lord Jesus as a man (Luke 1:31; Matt. 1:21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christos</h2>
<p>This name is Greek and is simply transliterated as &ldquo;Christ.&rdquo; The Hebrew word is <em>Messiah</em> (John 1:41), which means &ldquo;the anointed&rdquo; (Dan. 9:25-26). In the Old Testament when a person became a king, priest, or prophet, he was anointed with oil. The Lord Jesus was anointed by God with the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:18). He is the anointed One of God, God&rsquo;s Christ. Therefore, this name refers to the ministry of the Lord Jesus (Matt. 1:16; Luke 2:26; Acts 2:36).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Hagion Pneuma</h2>
<p><em>Hagion pneuma</em> is &ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo; in English. The New Testament uses it to refer to the Spirit as a person (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Importance of Knowing God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Rendering vengeance to those who do not know God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 1:8).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus comes again in the future, some will receive His vengeance, punishment, and eternal destruction and will depart from His presence and from the glory of His strength because they do not know God. This shows how crucial it is for us to know God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I delight in...the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings&rdquo;</strong> (Hosea 6:6).</p>
<p>Although God delights in man&rsquo;s sacrifices to Him, He delights in man&rsquo;s knowing Him even more. Our knowledge of God is more important than our service to God. We cannot merely serve God without pursuing knowledge of Him. Our service to God should be based on our knowledge of Him. If we serve God but do not know Him, we will not be acceptable to God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The people who know their God will show strength and take action&rdquo;</strong> (Dan. 11:32).</p>
<p>Knowing God can strengthen us. Many times we are weak because we do not know God. Our strength depends on the degree of our knowledge of God. Only those who know God will show strength and take action. <em>To take action</em> means &ldquo;to expand.&rdquo; Those who know God will be strong to expand their horizons and extend their boundaries and break new ground for God. On the earth today God needs those who would know Him in this way.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;To know Him&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:10).</p>
<p>Christ is the embodiment of God; the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily for us to gain and enjoy (Col. 2:9). Not only are God&rsquo;s life and power in Christ, but His wisdom and knowledge are also hidden in Christ (v. 3). We must know Christ in order to enjoy everything of God. Christ is the embodiment of God. To know Christ is to know God. This causes us to gain God and to enjoy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">How to Know God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:28).</p>
<p>If we want to know God, we must approve of holding God in our full knowledge. Most people confess that there is a God, but very few know Him, because they do not approve of knowing Him. They approve of earning money, entertainment, and many other things of the human life, but they do not approve of knowing God. Worldly people are not the only ones who are like this; many Christians do not approve of knowing God in their full knowledge. Some approve of getting an education. Some approve of doing business. Some approve of their family. Some approve of their clothing and appearance. Some approve of recreation and entertainment. They approve of many things, but they do not approve of knowing God. Consequently, they cannot know Him. They cannot know God, because they do not want Him or love Him. Only those who want and love God, and who want and love God to the extent of being captured by Him, can know God. Whenever such a person thinks about God, he approves Him. When he hears God&rsquo;s name, he senses its sweetness. Only this kind of person can know God. We must ask the Lord to give us a heart that approves Him so that we can leave everything that is apart from Him, loving Him singly and pursuing Him as the approved One so that we may know God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:3).</p>
<p>Knowing God and knowing Christ bring eternal life, and knowing God and knowing Christ are eternal life. Eternal life is the life of God. We obtain and possess this life by knowing God and Christ, and this life enables us to know God and Christ. God&rsquo;s life is in us, causing us to know and sense what God likes and wants and what He does not like or want. If we live and act according to the inward feeling that comes from the life of God, we will know God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them...All will know Me from the little one to the great one among them&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 8:10-11).</p>
<p>Every life is a law. God&rsquo;s life within us also is an inward law that causes us to know God; this knowing is possible whether we have been saved for a long time or have just been recently saved. A newborn child spits out bitter things that are put into his mouth, and he will eat sweet things that are put into his mouth. He can differentiate between what is bitter and what is sweet by the function of life, not by knowledge that comes from teaching. This function of life comes from the law of life. Knowing God is a matter of life, not of outward knowledge. Knowing God is based not on outward letters of the law, ordinances, or rituals but on the inward law of life. Our knowledge of God is related to life. It is according to inward life, not outward mentality. It is God&rsquo;s life as the law of life in us, expressing its function so that we may know God inwardly. If we want to know God, we must know the inward law of life and follow the inward sense of life.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Therefore let us know, let us pursue knowing Jehovah&rdquo;</strong> (Hosea 6:3).</p>
<p>Even though we have the life of God that enables us to know God, we still must pursue knowing God. This will enable the life of God to manifest its function and cause us to know God.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;If you receive my words...then you will...find the knowledge of God&rdquo;</strong> (Prov. 2:1-5).</p>
<p>We cannot know God according to our concept or by our feeling, because our feeling can be wrong. Even our physical sense of hot and cold can be inaccurate when we are sick. Our heart and spirit can also be affected by &ldquo;sicknesses&rdquo; that cause our feelings to be wrong. Therefore, we must regard the word of God as our spiritual thermometer and let God&rsquo;s word be the deciding factor in knowing God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;That...God...may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:17).</p>
<p>If we want to know God, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Revelation enables us to see; wisdom enables us to understand. If we only see but cannot understand, we still cannot know, so we must have revelation and wisdom. This is something only God can give, so we must petition God for it.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;On account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things...that I may gain Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:8).</p>
<p>We must also pay a price to know God. If we count the knowledge of God and of the Lord as something excellent, we must be willing to suffer the loss of all things for it. The extent of the loss that we suffer is the extent to which we can know God and gain the Lord. Our knowledge of God is related to our suffering the loss of all things.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FAITHFULNESS OF GOD<br />
AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</h1>
<p>The Bible frequently speaks of the faithfulness of God and the righteousness of God. Furthermore, it often speaks of them in relationship to each other (1 John 1:9; Psa. 143:1; Isa. 11:5; Rom. 3:3-5). The faithfulness of God is related to His word; the righteousness of God is related to His actions. Both the word of God and the actions of God are related to man. If we want to know God, we must know His word and His actions. If we want to know His word and His actions, we must know His faithfulness and His righteousness.</p>
<p>Many know only that God is loving and gracious. They have not seen that God is also faithful and righteous. Love and grace speak of God&rsquo;s heart and God&rsquo;s favor. God&rsquo;s heart is love, and His favor is grace. God&rsquo;s heart and favor toward man speak of love and grace. Although the love and grace of God are sweet, they do not contain an intrinsic guarantee that the love and grace of God must be provided. The love and grace of God do not place any responsibility or restrictions upon God in relation to a believer. If He wants to love us, He can love us. If He does not want to love us, He is not required to love us. If He wants to grace us, He can grace us. If He does not want to grace us, He is not required to grace us. In matters related to love and grace, God is under no obligation. His love and His grace come to us based only on His heart and His favor. Consequently, while He loves and gives grace willingly, He is under no obligation to do so. Even though His love and grace will not cease, God could, legally speaking, stop loving and gracing us. Legally speaking, He is not required to love and grace us. If He did not love and grace us, He would not be wrong as a matter of law. However, God&rsquo;s faithfulness and righteousness are matters related to law. His faithfulness restricts Him, and His righteousness requires Him to act in a legal manner. His faithfulness requires Him to not go against His word, and His righteousness requires Him to not be unrighteous in His actions. His faithfulness requires Him to act according to His word, and His righteousness requires Him to do things according to a legal standard. We need to know not only His love and grace but also His faithfulness and righteousness. Those who know His faithfulness believe His word, and those who know His righteousness treasure His actions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FAITHFULNESS OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Faithfulness of God Being Reliable</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In the heavens themselves You will establish Your faithfulness&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 89:2).</p>
<p>When Psalm 89 speaks of God making a covenant with David, it speaks of the love of God and the faithfulness of God (vv. 1-2, 24, 33, 49). God loved David, and because of His love, God was gracious to David. However, in order to give David and his seed the evidence and assurance that His love was reliable and unchangeable, God made a covenant with David based on His faithfulness. Therefore, the faithfulness of God is the guarantee of His love. The love of God is related to His heart; the faithfulness of God is related to His word. It is difficult for man to grasp with assurance the love that is in God&rsquo;s heart, but he can grasp God&rsquo;s faithfulness through His word. By His word God expresses His heart to man so that man can know it, and by His faithfulness God guarantees His love toward man so that man can believe it. His faithfulness is established in the heavens; nothing on earth can touch it or change it. Therefore, it is reliable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Faithfulness of God<br />
Making God Incapable of Being Unfaithful</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Nor will I be false to own My faithfulness. / I will not profane My covenant, / Nor will I change what has gone forth from My lips&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 89:33-34).</p>
<p>Since the faithfulness of God is established in the heavens, God will not be false to His faithfulness. God will not be unfaithful or break His covenant with man. He cannot alter the word that He has spoken to man.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Shall their unbelief annul the faithfulness of God? Absolutely not!&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:3-4).</p>
<p>We cannot influence the faithfulness of God. Even if we do not believe, our unbelief cannot annul the faithfulness of God or cause God to be unfaithful. Our lack of faithfulness has no impact on God, who is eternally faithful.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:13).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s faithfulness is established upon Himself. God Himself is the support for His faithfulness. The faithfulness of God can be established without change because God Himself does not change. Our faithfulness is determined by our person. If we are bankrupt, our faithfulness will be bankrupt. In contrast to us, however, God is never bankrupt and never changes; consequently, His faithfulness is eternally reliable. Even if we are faithless, He remains faithful because He cannot deny Himself.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;It was impossible for God to lie&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 6:18).</p>
<p>Although this word is not very deep, it is very beautiful. God cannot lie! God cannot lie because He cannot be unfaithful. His faithfulness requires Him to bear responsibility for His word. He will accomplish what He speaks.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;God is not a man, that He should lie&rdquo;</strong> (Num. 23:19).</p>
<p>Man is not faithful, and man lies. But God is not man. He is different from man; He is faithful. He would never lie or be unfaithful.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;God, who cannot lie&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 1:2).</p>
<p>This description is very sweet! Since God is the God who cannot lie, He can never be unfaithful and will never be unfaithful.</p><h2 class="head2">The Faithfulness of God<br />
Being the Guarantee of the Covenant and<br />
the Promises of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You swore to David in Your faithfulness&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 89:49).</p>
<p>When a man speaks an important word, he must point to and base his word on something in order for people to have confidence in his oath. When God speaks an important word to man, He also makes an oath. His oath points to His faithfulness. He swears by His faithfulness, which is established upon Himself. The base of God&rsquo;s oath is His eternally unchanging being; hence, it is eternally reliable.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who has promised is faithful&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:23; see also 11:11).</p>
<p>God is faithful; therefore, the word of His promise is faithful and reliable. His faithfulness is the guarantee of His promise.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;God is faithful...For as many promises of God as there are, in Him is the Yes; therefore also through Him is the Amen to God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 1:18, 20).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s promises are all Yes and Amen in Christ because the God who promises is faithful. His faithfulness ensures that none of His promises are empty.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;God, the faithful God who keeps covenant&rdquo;</strong> (Deut. 7:9).</p>
<p>God is faithful, so He keeps His covenant. His faithfulness causes Him to keep His covenant and to be restricted by His word. His faithfulness is the guarantee of His covenant. It guarantees that He will never forsake the word of the covenant that He established with man.</p>
<p>A covenant is a word that goes further than an ordinary word. A covenant is a guaranteed word. The word that God spoke to us in the Bible is a covenant. It is not ordinary; it is guaranteed. It is a covenant. Therefore, the Bible is called the Old and New Testaments. God is the guarantee of this covenant. His faithfulness cannot be eradicated or changed. It causes Him to be restricted by His word in the Bible and to guarantee that the word is reliable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Faithfulness of God<br />
Causing the Believers to Receive Forgiveness</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>If we confess our sins, God must forgive us our sins because of the blood of the Lord Jesus. He has spoken this word to us, and He has established it as a covenant with us based upon the redemption accomplished by the Lord Jesus. His faithfulness causes Him to be restricted by this word. According to this word, when we confess our sins to Him, His faithfulness forces Him to forgive us of our sins. If He did not forgive us, He would be unfaithful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Faithfulness of God<br />
Causing the Believers to Be Preserved</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He who calls you, who also will do it&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:23-24).</p>
<p>God promises to preserve us. His faithfulness forces Him to accomplish this promise. Therefore, His faithfulness also causes us to be preserved.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 3:3).</p>
<p>The Lord must guard us from the evil one, Satan, according to His promise, because He is faithful.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;God is faithful, who will not allow that you be tempted beyond what you are able, but will, with the temptation, also make the way out, that you may be able to endure it&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:13).</p>
<p>According to His promise, God&rsquo;s faithfulness causes Him to make a way out for us when we are tempted so that we may endure lest we be tempted beyond what we are able.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Faithfulness of God<br />
Being Food to the Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Trust in Jehovah, and do good; / Dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 37:3).</p>
<p>Food causes people to be full, satisfied, and strong. The faithfulness of God functions as food to those who believe His word based on His faithfulness. If we believe in God because of His faithfulness and grasp the word of God, we will be filled, satisfied, and strong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Offending the Faithfulness of God<br />
by Not Believing the Word of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:10).</p>
<p>If we do not believe the word that God has spoken in the Bible, we make God a liar and offend the faithfulness of God. This is the greatest offense to God. When we speak the truth to someone and he does not believe, this is an insult and an offense to us. In the same way, if we do not believe God&rsquo;s word, this is an insult and offense to Him. Therefore, we must be careful not to offend the faithfulness of God by not believing His word.</p>
<p>If we believe God, we should also believe His word. God has given us His faithful word, and it pleases Him when we believe His word and hold Him accountable to it. There is an old saying that speaks of &ldquo;catching&rdquo; a man with his word in order to gain a bargaining advantage. If we can hold a man, who is faithful to his word, accountable for his word, we should expect even more to hold God, who is more faithful than man, accountable for His word. God is not afraid of being &ldquo;caught&rdquo; by His word. In fact, our use of His word in this way manifests His faithfulness and glorifies Him. Our unwillingness to hold Him accountable is a despising of His faithfulness, and it is an insult to Him. He abhors this to the uttermost!</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;We make Him a liar, and His word is not in us&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:10).</p>
<p>If we do not believe the word of God, we make Him a liar and trample the faithfulness of God. Thus, there is no way for us to obtain His word, and His word will have no place in us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Righteousness of God<br />
Being the Foundation of God&rsquo;s Throne</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 89:14).</p>
<p>The faithfulness of God is supported by God Himself, and like God Himself, it cannot change. The righteousness of God is the foundation of His throne, and like God&rsquo;s throne, it cannot be shaken. In relation to Himself, God cannot be unfaithful; in relation to His throne, God cannot be unrighteous. God&rsquo;s being is related to His word and is a matter of faithfulness; God&rsquo;s throne is related to His actions and is a matter of righteousness. God speaks to man according to the faithfulness of His inner being. He cannot contradict Himself because He cannot be unfaithful. God rules on His throne according to the righteousness of His inner being. His throne cannot be shaken because He cannot be unrighteous.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Righteousness of God<br />
Making God Incapable of Being Unrighteous</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justly?&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 18:25).</p>
<p>From His throne God governs the universe. He is the Lord who judges all the earth. He cannot be unrighteous. If He were unrighteous, the foundation of His throne would be overturned, and everything in the universe would be in chaos.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Does God pervert justice? / Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?&rdquo;</strong> (Job 8:3).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s position and laws require righteousness. He cannot pervert justice and righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Righteousness of God<br />
Being Fulfilled by the Death of Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<p>We are sinners before God. God&rsquo;s righteous requirement condemned us and required us to be punished. Nevertheless, God desires to save, so He caused the Lord Jesus to receive His righteous punishment on our behalf in order to satisfy His righteous requirement. The Lord Jesus did not know sin, so according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, He did not have to receive God&rsquo;s punishment. On our behalf, however, the Lord Jesus offered Himself up as a substitutionary sacrifice for us. He bore our sins and also was made sin on our behalf. Thus, in His righteousness, God judged Him. According to the righteousness of God, God&rsquo;s judgment was carried out because of the sins that Christ bore and because He was made sin. Because the Lord Jesus received the righteous judgment of God on our behalf, He also satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement for us. Now the righteousness of God requires God to forgive and justify us. We have become the righteousness of God in the Lord Jesus because He fulfilled God&rsquo;s righteousness. Since He fulfilled God&rsquo;s righteousness on our behalf, God must justify us in Him. Therefore, the righteousness of God is manifested in those who are in Christ. In Christ we have become the righteousness of God. Just as Christ became sin for us, we have become the righteousness of God in Him. He was joined to us and made sin so that we might be joined to Him to become the righteousness of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Righteousness of God<br />
Empowering the Gospel of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The gospel...is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes...For the righteousness of God is revealed in it&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:16-17).</p>
<p>The gospel of God is powerful and can save everyone who believes it because the gospel is based on the righteousness of God. This does not depend on man&rsquo;s righteousness. Since the righteousness of God allowed the Lord Jesus to be our Substitute, judging us and our sins in Him, God must forgive our sins and justify us when we believe in the Lord Jesus. This righteousness of God is the base of the gospel, and it is revealed in the gospel. The gospel is powerful because it requires God to save us; He must forgive us and justify us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Righteousness of God<br />
Giving Authority to the Grace of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Grace might reign through righteousness&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:21).</p>
</h2>
<p>The grace of God reigns through righteousness. To reign is to rule with authority. Thus, the righteousness of God gives authority to the grace of God. The grace of God can come to us with authority because it has passed through the procedure of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Since God&rsquo;s righteousness has justified us and enables us to meet the standard of His righteous requirement, the grace of God cannot be withheld; rather, it comes to us because we have the right to enjoy God and all that He is and has.</p><h2 class="head2">The Righteousness of God<br />
Causing Believers to Be Forgiven</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>According to the righteousness of God, the Lord Jesus was judged on our behalf. When we confess our sins, God is required to forgive us our sins because of the blood that the Lord Jesus shed while being judged according to God&rsquo;s righteousness. According to God&rsquo;s word in the Bible, He must forgive us because of His faithfulness. According to God&rsquo;s act in righteously judging the Lord Jesus on our behalf, He must forgive us because of His righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Righteousness of God<br />
Causing Believers to Be Cleansed</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>Just as the righteousness of God requires Him to forgive us because of the redemption of the Lord Jesus, it also requires Him to cleanse us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Righteousness of God<br />
Causing Believers to Be Justified</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:25-26).</p>
<p>God has judged the sins of the saved ones in the ages of the Old Testament and the New Testament according to His righteousness through the Lord Jesus. In the Old Testament age God&rsquo;s righteousness caused Him to pass over sins, and in the New Testament age God&rsquo;s righteousness causes Him to justify those who are of the faith of Jesus. He exercised forbearance under the old covenant and justifies the believers under the new covenant because He is righteous. Both His forbearance and His justification manifest His righteousness. Man needs only to believe in the blood that has been shed by the Lord Jesus for him, according to God&rsquo;s righteousness. In the Old Testament age the blood of the sacrifices was a type of the blood of Jesus Christ. God&rsquo;s righteousness also requires God to justify those who are of the faith of Jesus, enabling man to obtain God through the Lord Jesus and causing God to be propitiatory toward man. Whether in His forbearing of man under the old testament or His justifying of man under the new testament, He is propitiatory toward man because of His righteousness and according to the requirement of His righteousness. His being propitiatory toward man matches the requirements of His righteousness. The vicarious death of the Lord Jesus satisfied every demand and fulfilled every requirement that God&rsquo;s righteousness placed on us. His righteousness has resulted in our being accepted and justified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Righteousness of God<br />
Causing Believers to Gain Eternal Life</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;So also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:21).</p>
<p>We who believe in the Lord Jesus receive not only forgiveness, cleansing, and justification through the righteousness of God but even eternal life, the eternal life of God. Although our receiving of the eternal life of God is out of God&rsquo;s grace, it is through His righteousness. Without the righteousness of God, we could not receive the eternal life of God as grace. God would have no way to give us grace. His righteousness opens the way for His grace to reign and for His life to be given to us legally. The grace of God gives us the living water of eternal life for our enjoyment, but the righteousness of God is the pipe that enables this living water to flow into us. We must be justified in order to receive eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Righteousness of God<br />
Being Obtained by Faith</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:22; see also 1:17).</p>
<p>The righteousness of God is given to all those who believe through the faith of Jesus Christ; it is obtained by man through faith.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Righteousness...which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:9).</p>
<p>The righteousness that we receive through faith in Christ is the righteousness of God. This righteousness is obtained by faith.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have laid hold of righteousness, but a righteousness which is out of faith&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 9:30).</p>
<p>Although the Gentiles did not pursue the righteousness of the law, they obtained the righteousness of God by faith in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Because they were ignorant of God&rsquo;s righteousness and sought to establish their own righteousness, they were not subject to the righteousness of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 10:3).</p>
<p>If man despises the righteousness of God and seeks to establish his own righteousness, he is not subject to the righteousness of God and will not obtain it. This is the situation of the Jews.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;If righteousness is through law, then Christ has died for nothing&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:21).</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s righteousness before God is not obtained by keeping the law but by faith in the death of Christ.</p>
<p>Both the faithfulness and the righteousness of God are eternally reliable. All the responsibility for our standing before God rests upon these two matters; they are like two hands that bear us before God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SELECTION AND PREDESTINATION OF GOD</h1>
<p>Those who have been graced by God should know about God&rsquo;s selection and predestination. Both the selection and predestination of God are marvelous works of God&rsquo;s grace to us. Selection and predestination are different but related to each other. We will consider them in the following seven points.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TIME OF GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION AND PREDESTINATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Even as He chose us...before the foundation of the world&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:4).</p>
<p>God chose us before the foundation of the world. This is far beyond our comprehension. Before the beginning of time, before the creation of the heavens and earth, God chose us in eternity past. This is a tremendous matter of grace. This is such a sweet thought. We should thank Him from our heart! Moreover, we should bow down in worship.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;God predestined before the ages for our glory&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 2:7).</p>
<p>God not only chose us before the foundation of the world; He also predestinated us before the ages. After God chose us, He predestinated us. These two matters were accomplished by God in eternity past before the foundation of the world and before the ages. Therefore, according to God&rsquo;s selection and predestination, we were graced long before the foundation of the world. We may say that in God&rsquo;s eyes we were saved long before the ages. Furthermore, we should also realize that none of us has been saved by accident or chance. Every believer was predestinated for salvation long ago by God, and at His appointed time, God arranged the time of our life, the place of our living, the state of our human affairs, and the sphere of our environment to cause us to be saved. When we see God&rsquo;s marvelous work in this area and consider His unfathomable grace, we can only thank Him for His grace and praise Him for His works!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REALM OF GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION AND PREDESTINATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He chose us in Him&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:4).</p>
<p>God chose us in Christ. <em>In Christ</em> refers to a realm and a base. For eternity this realm and base will not change. God chose us in this eternally unchanging realm and base.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:2; Rom. 8:29).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s selection and predestination are based on His foreknowledge. His foreknowledge is based on His foresight. He foresees clearly, so He has the ability to foreknow. He chose and predestinated us according to His foresight and based on His foreknowledge.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Predestinating us...according to the good pleasure of His will&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:5).</p>
<p>God selected and predestinated us according to the good pleasure of His will. This is to say that God selected and predestinated us according to His will and good pleasure, not according to anything else. He has a will and a taste that are according to His good pleasure, and He chose us according to His will and His taste.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Predestinated according to the purpose of the One&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:11).</p>
<p>God selected and predestinated us according to the good pleasure of His will. This was not done loosely; rather, He had a purpose, a plan. He chose and predestinated us according to this plan. He has spent much time and effort on us, and now we should respond to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIS OF GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION AND PREDESTINATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In love, predestinating us&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:4-5; see also 1 Thes. 1:4).</p>
<p>God selected and predestinated us in love. Love is not based on reason. God simply loved us; therefore, He chose and predestinated us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works but of Him who calls&rdquo;; &ldquo;He has mercy on whom He wills&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 9:11, 18).</p>
<p>God chose us according to His purpose. His purpose according to selection is not of man&rsquo;s works but of Him who chooses. This is seen in the case of Esau and Jacob, two brothers who were twins. When Esau and Jacob were in their mother&rsquo;s womb and had not yet done anything good or bad, God told their mother that He had chosen the younger, Jacob, not the older, Esau. This proves that God&rsquo;s selection of Jacob was not because of Jacob&rsquo;s good works, and God&rsquo;s rejection of Esau was not because of Esau&rsquo;s bad works. Before they were born, they had not done anything good or bad. Some may think that God chose Jacob because He knew that Jacob would be better than his brother Esau, but this is wrong. After they were born, Jacob was worse than his brother. He was crafty and loved to fight. He took advantage of everyone he knew. He cheated his brother, his father, and his uncle. No one who contacted him was spared from his cheating. God chose him even though he was quite bad. This proves that God&rsquo;s selection is not at all according to man&rsquo;s works. It is completely according to and based on God Himself and His mercy. He has mercy on whom He wills; He chooses whom He wills. This is completely a matter of His heart&rsquo;s desire. When we see and consider this, we should humble ourselves in worship and give thanks and praise to Him.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The selection of grace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 11:5).</p>
<p>Because of His love and mercy God selected us according to His grace, not our works. His selection of grace came to us out of His love and through His mercy. His love first caused Him to look upon us and like us. It caused Him to consider us as desirable objects of His heart and to want to give us His grace. In spite of His heart&rsquo;s desire, our condition made us unworthy to receive His grace. If His selection were only according to love and grace, and not of mercy as well, His love and grace would only be able to reach those who matched Him. His love and grace would be unable to reach those like us who are so low and do not match Him. But thank and praise Him, He not only has love and grace but also mercy. His mercy reaches further than His love and grace. His mercy causes Him to care for those who are low and unworthy so that His love and grace can reach us. His mercy reaches us, raises us up from our position of unworthiness, and makes us worthy to enjoy His love and receive His grace. Oh, the raising up of His mercy and the adorning of His grace cause us to enjoy His love! His selection is out of love and through mercy; consequently, it is a selection of grace.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION AND PREDESTINATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<p>God selected and predestinated us according to His foreknowledge in order to conform us to the image of His Son so that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers. God wants His Son, our Lord Jesus, to gain many brothers that He might be the Firstborn among them. Therefore, God selected and predestinated us. He selected and predestinated us for the high goal of being the brothers and companions of His Son. He did not select and predestinate us to go to heaven or to enjoy eternal blessings. Only ordinary people would seek such low goals.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:5-6).</p>
<p>Since God predestinated us to be the brothers of His Son, He also predestinated us unto sonship through His Son. We are God&rsquo;s sons together with His Son, and thus, we can receive His inheritance. His predestinating of us brings us into Himself and joins us with Him in life. Thus, He is expressed through us, the many sons, which is to the praise of the glory of His grace. This grace is simply Himself making us His sons by our partaking of Him. It is also our gaining of Him in His Son. This is the goal of God&rsquo;s selection and predestination.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Appointed to eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:48).</p>
<p>Since God predestinated us to be His sons, He has predestinated us to gain His life, the eternal life. Once we are born of Him, we have His life, and we are His sons.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Predestined before the ages for our glory&rdquo;; &ldquo;In order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 2:7; Rom. 9:23).</p>
<p>God not only predestinated us to gain His life and to be His sons but also to gain His glory and express Him. Glory is God expressed. When God is expressed, there is glory. God predestinated us so that we could gain His life and glory to express His glorious being. This will be completely fulfilled in us when the Lord Jesus returns and in the coming new heavens and new earth (2 Pet. 3:13).</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:9-10).</p>
<p>God predestinated us to know the mystery of His will, which is according to His economy, His administrative arrangement, so that all things in the heavens and on earth would be headed up in Christ that the glory of Christ, which is His glory in Christ, would be expressed in all things. Now He is making known the mystery of His will, and in the future, He will bring us into His glory, which will be the fulfillment of the mystery of His will.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;You are a chosen race...so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:9).</p>
<p>God selected us so that we might declare His virtues in the world today.</p>
<p>The preceding six points underscore the importance of the goal of God&rsquo;s selection and predestination.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PEOPLE OF GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION<br />
AND PREDESTINATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Consider your calling, brothers, that there are not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many wellborn. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world that He might shame those who are wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world that He might shame the things that are strong, and the lowborn things of the world and the despised things God has chosen, things which are not, that He might bring to nought the things which are, so that no flesh may boast before God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:26-29).</p>
<p>God mainly selects those who are foolish, weak, lowborn, despised, and of no account so that no flesh may boast before Him. This does not mean, however, that He never selects someone who is wise, powerful, or highborn. In every age God has chosen every kind of person; however, those who are chosen all realize that they have nothing to boast of in themselves and would rather boast in God, even if it means being foolish, weak, and despised in the eyes of others. In contrast, it is difficult for anyone who continually boasts in himself to be selected by God. God does not select those who boast in themselves but those who boast in God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?&rdquo;</strong> (James 2:5).</p>
<p>Those selected by God are usually poor so that He might make them rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him. This is not to say that God does not select rich people, but generally speaking, it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God (Luke 18:25). Although it is difficult, in every age there are some rich people who are willing to become poor out of their love for God. This proves that God has truly chosen them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROOF OF GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION<br />
AND PREDESTINATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;As many as were appointed to eternal life believed&rdquo;; &ldquo;Since you thrust [the word of God] away and do not judge yourselves worthy of eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:48, 46).</p>
<p>The proof of one&rsquo;s predestination is his willingness to believe and receive the gospel of God when he hears it. A student, who heard D. L. Moody&rsquo;s teaching on predestination in class, was impressed but did not dare to preach the gospel, because he had a problem. He said to Moody, &ldquo;I dare not preach the gospel now.&rdquo; Moody asked him why, and he said, &ldquo;When I am preaching, I look at a person and consider whether he is predestinated; I look at another and consider whether he is chosen. If God has not chosen and predestinated these ones, and they are eventually persuaded by me to believe in the Lord, will I not be making a big mistake?&rdquo; Moody then replied, &ldquo;Brother, just do your best to persuade him. As long as we can persuade someone to believe in the Lord, he has been chosen and predestinated by God.&rdquo; A person&rsquo;s willingness to believe proves that he has been graced by God and has been chosen by Him. If a person rejects the gospel of God, he judges himself unworthy of eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRMNESS OF GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION<br />
AND PREDESTINATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;With whom is no variation or shadow cast by turning&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:17).</p>
<p>God has no variation; therefore, He does not cast a shadow by turning. Consequently, His selection of us is also without the slightest variation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:16).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s choosing of us did not come from ourselves but from Him. If our choosing were from us, it could change. But since our choosing is from Him, it will not change.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I know whom I have chosen&rdquo;</strong> (John 13:18; see also 2 Tim. 2:19).</p>
<p>The Lord knows whom He has chosen. When He chose us, He knew us. He knew what our condition would be today. He will not change even if He sees that our condition is not so good.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The calling of God...irrevocable&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 11:29).</p>
<p>God has no regrets in calling us; therefore, He will not revoke His selection of us.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Who shall bring a charge against God&rsquo;s chosen ones?&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:33).</p>
<p>No one, not even the devil, can bring a charge against God&rsquo;s chosen ones, because God has justified us. Therefore, God&rsquo;s selection of us will not change.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Be the more diligent to make your calling and selection firm&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 1:10).</p>
<p>Any doubts that we may have concerning the gracious calling and selection of God come from our lack of pursuing the Lord. If we are diligent to pursue the Lord, we will feel that God&rsquo;s gracious calling and selection are very firm.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE UNION OF GOD AND MAN</h1>
<p>The union of God and man is a very mysterious matter. It is a matter of God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire from eternity past, and it is the goal of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages. This is not only an important topic in the Bible but also a central thought in the Word of God. We should spend much time to examine this matter in detail. In this chapter we will cover four points concerning this matter because we have spoken about this on other occasions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness...And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 1:26-27).</p>
<p>The first time the Bible speaks of man, it speaks of man being created in God&rsquo;s image and according to His likeness. This indicates that in God&rsquo;s creation, God desires to have a special relationship with man. God created man in His own image and according to His likeness because He wanted man to be like Him so that He could be joined in union with man. Socially speaking, we make friends and group together with those who are like us. It is difficult to be friendly or united with those who are completely different from us. Humans act toward one another in this way, and in principle God is the same. He cannot be joined to creatures who are completely different from Him. Consequently, He created man in His own image and likeness so that man would be like Him in order to be joined to Him.</p>
<p><em>Image</em> speaks of something inward, whereas <em>likeness</em> refers to something outward. God wanted man to be like Him not only according to outward likeness but also according to inward image, especially in mind, emotion, and will. God wanted man to be the same as He is inwardly and outwardly because man is the object of His union. Therefore, God created man in His image and according to His likeness as a preparation for Him to be in union with man. After this preparation, God made a way for Him to be joined with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BECOMING A MAN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Word was God&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:1, 14).</p>
<p>God not only created man in His image and likeness; He also became a man in time. The Word of God became flesh, a man, and tabernacled among us. God originally created man according to His image and likeness, and then He became a man to be the same as we are so that He might be joined with us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 3:16).</p>
<p>God became flesh and was manifested in the flesh not only to manifest Himself to man but also to join Himself with man, to enter into man, and to become one with man. This is the mystery of godliness. This mystery is great because it involves God and man being joined together, and it is related to godliness because this mystery makes man like God, the same as God in life and nature. Man can be the same as God because God became a man; God has been joined with man to be one with man.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;&lsquo;They shall call His name Emmanuel&rsquo; (which is translated, God with us)&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 1:23; see also 18:20; 28:20).</p>
<p>God became a man to join Himself with man and to be with man. Therefore, He is called Emmanuel, which means &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo; The God who became a man and was with man is the Lord Jesus. He not only was with the disciples in the flesh, but He became the Spirit to be with us, and He will be with us until the end of this age when He will appear. God is with us because He joined Himself to humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD LIVING IN MAN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality,...because He abides with you and shall be in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:16-17).</p>
<p>Through His incarnation God was joined with man, but at that time God was joined only to Jesus of Nazareth. He could not enter into others while He was on the earth following His incarnation. Even though God was joined with man in the person of Jesus Christ, He could not enter into other men and be joined with them. He could be among the disciples and contact them, but He could not enter into them and be joined to them. Consequently, He went through death and resurrection to become the Spirit in order to enter into them. Through His coming back as another Comforter, He can be joined with others. As the Spirit, He can enter into the believers and be joined with them.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:19; see also 3:16).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit of God comes from God, and our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within us. This indicates that God and the believers have been joined. God is the indwelling One in us, and we are God&rsquo;s dwelling place, His temple.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;He [abides] in him. And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:24).</p>
<p>God abides in us through the Spirit. The Spirit is the transfiguration of God, just as the Lord Jesus is the transfiguration of God. As the transfiguration of God, the Lord Jesus came <em>among</em> men, and as the transfiguration of God, the Spirit enters <em>into</em> man. Just as God was among men during the human living of the Lord Jesus, God is in us as the Spirit today. God abides in us through the Spirit whom He gave to us and who lives in us.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 4:13; see also Rom. 8:9-11).</p>
<p>Since God abides in us through the Spirit, we also abide in Him through the Spirit. In the Holy Spirit of God, God and we, we and God, are completely joined. Furthermore, since the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, Christ, who became the Spirit, is abiding in us and is joined with us.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 4:15).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Son of God, and He is God Himself. When we confess Him and receive Him, we gain God through the Holy Spirit who abides in us and is joined with us. He also causes us to abide in Him and be joined with Him through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Christ who lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20; see also 2 Cor. 13:5).</p>
<p>Christ is within every believer, and He lives in every believer. Christ is the embodiment of God, so His living in us is God&rsquo;s living in us. This joining involves both life and living.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Christ...is powerful in you&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:3).</p>
<p>Christ is not only living in us but also powerful in us. God in us is powerful. He joins Himself to us to such an extent that His power becomes our power.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:17).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s abiding in us is God&rsquo;s abiding in us. This spiritual fact issues in a sweet feeling in our heart through faith. We can sense God abiding in us and being joined with us in our heart through faith. Oh, this sweet sense in our heart strengthens us as we follow the Lord!</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Christ is formed in you&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 4:19).</p>
<p>Christ not only abides in us, lives in us, and is powerful in us, but He also wants to be formed in us. He wants to be joined with us to such an extent that He is formed within us according to the fullness of His image. When we reach this point, our experience of being joined to Him is at a mature level. This is a glorious matter. God and we can be joined to such an extent that He is formed in us, causing us to have His full image. This should cause us to be so consecrated, submissive, and worshipful to Him.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:13).</p>
<p>God is in us and joined to us as our life and power not only to be our living and for us to have His image but also to operate both the inward willing and the outward working of His good pleasure. He wants us not only to express Him as we live on the earth but also to accomplish His will. On the one hand, He lives in us to cause us to live out His image, and on the other, He operates in us to cause us to fulfill His good pleasure. Both our living and the working out of His good pleasure are the issue of being inwardly joined to God.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;God...doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 13:20-21).</p>
<p>God does in us what is well pleasing in His sight. By being joined with us, He operates in us to work out the things that are pleasing to Him.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:19).</p>
<p>The result of God being in us and being joined to us is that we are filled unto all the fullness of God. All that He is becomes ours, making us completely one with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD ABIDING IN MAN FOREVER IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A new heaven and a new earth...New Jerusalem...the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:1-3).</p>
<p>In eternity future, in the new heaven and new earth, the tabernacle, or the dwelling place of God, will be among men. Furthermore, He will be joined with us, the redeemed ones from all the ages, to abide in us forever on a grand and open scale. At this time His eternal heart&rsquo;s desire will be fulfilled, and the goal of His work throughout the ages will be attained.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple...for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:22-23; see also 22:5).</p>
<p>Throughout eternity future, the almighty God and the Lamb, Christ, are the center of the New Jerusalem as the temple of God. They abide with and are joined to all the redeemed ones throughout the ages. The glory of God will be the light of the New Jerusalem, and the Lamb will be the lamp. Thus, the light of God, that is, God Himself, will shine forth from within the Lamb, who is the glorious lamp, and it will shine through the holy city, which is also all the redeemed ones from throughout the ages. At that time, God in Christ will be completely and thoroughly joined in oneness with us forever and ever. Oh, that will be such a glorious and blessed time! May that day come quickly!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>In this chapter and the next we will cover two topics concerning Christ&mdash;the person of Christ and the precious blood of Christ. The person of Christ relates to who Christ is, and the precious blood relates to what He has done. If we want to know Christ, we must know His person and the preciousness of His blood.</p>
<p>Christ is our glorious Savior. No believer should be ignorant in regard to His person. Many believers have some knowledge of what He accomplished in His work, but they do not have a clear understanding of His person. When we ask about the person of our glorious, precious, and lovely Lord, many are not able to give a clear answer. In the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, as we remember the Lord, we often thank Him for His work of grace, but we have little praise for His glorious person. We are short of praises related to the Lord&rsquo;s glorious person in our table meeting because we have a lack of knowledge concerning the Lord&rsquo;s person. In the table meeting, most of our thanks and praise to the Lord are based on the grace that we have received from the Lord; they are rarely based on our knowledge of the Lord. Our thanks rarely originate from our appreciation of who the Lord is. Our knowledge of the Lord is lacking because we do not know the person of the Lord. Therefore, we should spend some time to know the person of the Lord from the Word.</p>
<p>Various aspects of the person of the Lord can be seen quite clearly in relation to time. Since there is a progression in time, we will look at His person in progressive periods of time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN ETERNITY PAST</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:1-2).</p>
<p>Christ is the Word who was in the beginning. He is the Word who was with God in the beginning, and as the Word He is God. <em>In the beginning</em> refers to eternity past before the beginning of time. This is different from the beginning of time spoken of in Genesis 1:1. Our Lord Jesus was God in eternity past. Before the beginning of time, before anything was created, He was God in eternity. He is the eternal God.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of His designation as <em>the Word</em>? A word is an expression of the speaker. If I stood before you, but did not speak, you would not understand anything about me. I must speak in order to express myself. The Lord Jesus is the Word of God, which means that He is the expression of God. He expresses God (John 1:18). Everything about Him is an expression of God. If He were not the expression of God, there would be no God. Apart from Him, we cannot know God. Since He is the expression of God, He is God. We see God in Him and find God in Him. His expression of God, however, is unrelated to time. Eternally, He is the Word of God, the expression of God, even God Himself.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity&rdquo;</strong> (Micah 5:2).</p>
<p>The goings forth of the Lord Jesus are from ancient times, from the days of eternity. He is the eternal God, the God from eternity. He did not become God at some point in time, and His status as God is not dependent upon His being our Savior. He did not become God because He is our Savior. He is God coming to be our Savior. He is God from ancient times, from the days of eternity.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Mighty God, / Eternal Father&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 9:6).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father. Although He became a man in the flesh in time, He was God in eternity past. Although He was manifested as the Son in time, He was the Father in eternity.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Being equal with God&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:6).</p>
<p>In eternity the Lord Jesus was equal with God because He is God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN CREATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:3).</p>
<p>In eternity the Lord Jesus was the eternal God. At the time of creation He was the Creator. All things came into being through Him. Apart from Him not one thing has come into being.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;In Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:16).</p>
<p>Everything in the universe has been created by and through the Lord Jesus. He is the Creator of everything in the universe and the Lord of all in the universe.</p><h2 class="head1">IN INCARNATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Word became flesh&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:14).</p>
<p>Although the Lord Jesus is the eternal God and the Creator in time, He became flesh; that is, He became a man through human birth. The eternal Word, the eternal God, was born as a man in time; He became flesh. In eternity He could not be seen or contacted as God, but in time, when He became flesh, He could be seen and contacted. His incarnation was His manifestation to man so that man could know Him and contact Him practically. This is like a tape-recorded message that is more concrete than just a word released into the air. The Lord Jesus, the Word, is the incarnated God. He is God, the Word, on &ldquo;tape.&rdquo; What He is in eternity was manifested in time so that we could touch and contact Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Emmanuel...God with us&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 1:23; see also Isa. 7:14).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is God, and He became a man. Therefore, He also is God with man. This is the meaning of His name <em>Emmanuel.</em> In Him, there is God and there is man. God and man are mingled in Him. He is God and He is man because He is God become man.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;A child is born to us, / ...And His name will be called / ...Mighty God&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 9:6).</p>
<p>Even though the Lord Jesus was born as a child, He was the Mighty God. Being a child means that He truly became a man with the likeness and nature of man. Being the Mighty God means that He is the very God with the glory and authority of God. Isaiah 9:6 tells us that even when the Lord Jesus was born as a man, He was still God. He was God, and He was man. On the one hand, He was a small man, and on the other hand, He was the Mighty God.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;A Son is given to us; / ...And His name will be called / ...Eternal Father&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 9:6).</p>
<p>Isaiah 9:6 tells us that when the Lord Jesus was born as a man, He was both the Son given to us and the Eternal Father. The Father is the source, and the Son is the manifestation. On the one hand, the Lord is God the source, and on the other hand, He is God the manifestation. In eternity He is the Father as the source. In time He is the Son as the manifestation. He, the Son, manifested in time is the Eternal Father. Therefore, He is the Son, and at the same time, He is the Father.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?...You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 16:13, 16).</p>
<p>On the one hand, when the Lord was on earth, He was the Son of Man born of man, and on the other hand, He was the Son of God. As the Son of Man, He represents man before God. As the Son of God, He manifests God before man. He is the Son of Man to bear our sins and to defeat Satan. He is the Son of God so that we may gain God&rsquo;s life and all that is of God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Who, existing in the form of God...but...taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:6-7; see also Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3).</p>
<p>Our Lord is God, so He existed in the form of God. When He was born on earth as a man, He became in the likeness of men and took the form of a human slave. Although He became flesh, put on the likeness of men, and had the form of a human slave, He was the image of God, the impress of the substance of God, and the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory. In Him there is the image of God and the image of man because He is God who came to be a man.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;His goings forth are... / From the days of eternity&rdquo;; &ldquo;My time&rdquo;</strong> (Micah 5:2; John 7:6)</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was in eternity, and He came to be in time. He was God in eternity, and He came to be a man in time.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:13).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was incarnated to be a man, He was in heaven even when He was on earth. Although He was a man on the earth, He was still God in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:30).</p>
<p>The incarnated Lord Jesus was one with the Father. He was a man, and at the same time, He was God.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;The only begotten Son...has declared Him&rdquo;; &ldquo;He gave His only begotten Son&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:18; 3:16).</p>
<p>When the Lord came to the earth, He came as the only begotten Son of God. He was the unique manifestation of God. Apart from Him, man could not see God, because only the Lord manifested God.</p><h2 class="head1">IN RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power&rdquo;; &ldquo;Designated the Son of God in power...out of the resurrection of the dead&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 26:64; Rom. 1:4; see also Acts 7:56).</p>
<p>Following the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection from the dead, He was still the Son of Man, even though He was also designated the Son of God in power. When He was judged by the Jewish Sanhedrin, the high priest asked Him whether He was the Son of God. The Lord responded, &ldquo;You have said rightly&rdquo; (Matt. 26:64), but then He said that they would see Him as the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power. This indicates that He was still a man after He ascended into heaven. When Stephen was martyred after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, he saw Him as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God (Acts 7:56). <em>Hymns,</em> #113 affirms this truth, saying, &ldquo;&lsquo;He wears our nature on the throne.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The man Christ Jesus&rdquo;; &ldquo;My Lord and my God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 2:5; John 20:28).</p>
<p>After the Lord rose from the dead, He was still a man in His manifestation of God. Today He is in the heavens as both God and man, just as He was both man and God while He was on earth. When a piece of white cloth falls into a vat of colored dye, the color cannot be removed. Similarly, even though He was God, He was &ldquo;dyed&rdquo; with humanity in incarnation. From that moment forward, humanity has always been a part of His person; it can never be removed. Therefore, in His resurrection and ascension, He still has the human nature. However, His humanity was brought into the glory of God through resurrection. In His incarnation He brought God into man and man&rsquo;s situation. In His resurrection and ascension He brought man into God and God&rsquo;s glory. As God He came into man, and as man He went into God. He understands the things of God and the things of man. He knows man&rsquo;s situation and the things of God. He is a God-man. He is such a mysterious Savior. He truly is worthy of our love, praise, and worship.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The Firstborn among many brothers&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:29; see also Heb. 1:6; 2:10-12).</p>
<p>The Lord was the only begotten Son of God. Through His resurrection from the dead, He dispensed His life as the Son of God into us to regenerate us (1 Pet. 1:3), and we became the many sons of God who are His many brothers. In this way the only begotten Son of God became the Firstborn among many brothers. From the time of His resurrection, He is no longer just the only begotten Son of God; He is also the Firstborn among many brothers, the many sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN HIS SECOND COMING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Awaiting...the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Son of Man... coming&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 2:13; Matt. 26:64).</p>
<p>When Jesus Christ comes again, He will appear as the great God, but He will still be the Son of Man. This is affirmed by the apostle Paul and by the Lord&rsquo;s word to the Jewish Sanhedrin when He was being judged.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN ETERNITY FUTURE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb&rdquo;; &ldquo;The throne of God and of the Lamb&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:22; 22:3).</p>
<p>In eternity the one temple and the one throne are identified with God and the Lamb, signifying the complete oneness of God and the Lamb, who was incarnated in humanity and slain in His humanity for our redemption.</p>
<p>Our Lord, the eternal God, became a man in time, even a God-man. When He died and resurrected, He entered into God&rsquo;s glory with His humanity to become the man-God. Now He is God yet man and man yet God. His mysterious person will be fully manifested in His second coming and then manifested throughout eternity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRECIOUS BLOOD OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>The person of Christ speaks of who He is, whereas the blood of Christ speaks of His work. The blood is the foundation upon which we receive all grace and blessing; therefore, it occupies an important position in the Bible. According to the Bible, the blood of Christ functions in at least twelve ways in relation to the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUNDATION OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;This is My blood of the covenant&rdquo;; &ldquo;The new covenant established in My blood&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20).</p>
<p>Establishing a covenant is the same as making a contract that explains and guarantees the actions of two parties. God made a covenant with us so that we could be graced in Him. Through His covenant He not only explained but also guaranteed His grace to us. We are sinners, and God&rsquo;s righteousness places demands upon sinners. In order for the righteous God to grace us, He had to satisfy the demands of His righteousness. The redemption of Christ accomplished this on our behalf. Christ received God&rsquo;s punishment on our behalf and satisfied the righteous requirement that God placed on us as sinners. The blood shed through the death of Christ paid the price required by God&rsquo;s righteousness; consequently, God can legally and righteously grace us. He established the new covenant with us by the blood of Christ, just as He established the old covenant with the children of Israel by the blood of calves and goats (Heb. 9:18-20). The blood of Christ is the foundation of the new covenant that God established with us, and it is eternally effective. Under the new covenant God must grace us and keep His word of promise to us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The blood of the covenant&rdquo;; &ldquo;The blood of an eternal covenant&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:29; 13:20).</p>
<p>The blood of the Lord not only redeems us from our sins, but it also establishes a covenant with us that requires God to forgive our sins, grace us, and accomplish all His promises to us. Thus, the blood of the Lord is not only redeeming blood but also the blood of the covenant. The Lord&rsquo;s blood established a new covenant for us, an eternal covenant. Therefore, this blood is called the blood of an eternal covenant. The new covenant cannot be annulled because the Lord&rsquo;s blood is eternally efficacious; it is not a temporary covenant established by the blood of calves and goats, which was effective only in type for a time.</p>
<p>All the grace and blessings given to us by God are included in the new covenant and are given to us in the execution of the new covenant. This new covenant has been established and is efficacious because the Lord shed His blood through death, fully satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. This means that God must grace us. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s blood established a new covenant for us and made this new covenant efficacious.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRICE OF REDEMPTION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In whom we have redemption through His blood&rdquo;; &ldquo;You were redeemed...with precious blood...the blood of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18-19).</p>
<p>We were under the law of God because of sin. However, the Lord died for us according to God&rsquo;s righteousness and satisfied the requirement of God&rsquo;s law. Consequently, the blood that He shed for us has redeemed us out from under the condemnation of the law. Therefore, we have been redeemed before God by the Lord&rsquo;s blood. The Lord&rsquo;s blood is so efficacious, so valuable, that the Bible calls His blood &ldquo;precious blood.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s precious blood was the price paid for our redemption.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The church of God, which He obtained through His own blood&rdquo;; &ldquo;You...have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 20:28; Rev. 5:9; see also 1 Cor. 6:20; 7:23).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s blood redeemed us, that is, purchased us back, to God. The Lord&rsquo;s blood is precious blood. God used this precious blood to purchase us back to Him as His important treasure, the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUNDATION OF FORGIVENESS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:22).</p>
<p>The righteousness of God does not tolerate sin. It cannot leave sin unpunished nor forgive sin without satisfying His requirement for punishment. If the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness is not satisfied, sin cannot be forgiven. Therefore, there must be an offering to bear the punishment associated with God&rsquo;s righteousness so that sinners can receive forgiveness according to God&rsquo;s righteousness. If blood is not shed, sins cannot be forgiven. When the Lord was crucified on our behalf, shedding His blood, He bore the righteous punishment of God and satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. Through the shedding of His blood, our sins have been forgiven by God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins&rdquo;; &ldquo;Redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 26:28; Eph. 1:7).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s shed blood causes our sins and offenses to be forgiven. Therefore, it is the foundation upon which we receive forgiveness of sins. Only the Lord&rsquo;s blood can cause our sins and offenses to be forgiven.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANS FOR CLEANSING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Washed us from our sins in his own blood&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 1:5, KJV).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s blood causes sins not only to be forgiven but also to be cleansed. The Lord&rsquo;s blood is not only the foundation of our forgiveness but also the means for us to be cleansed.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;How much more will the blood of Christ...purify our conscience?&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:14).</p>
<p>When we were sinners before God, our conscience condemned us. Since the Lord&rsquo;s blood has taken away our sins before God, our conscience no longer condemns us. The Lord&rsquo;s blood purifies our conscience from all feelings of condemnation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s blood does not wash us only of the sins we committed before we were saved. When we confess the sins that we commit after being saved, the blood washes us also of these sins.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 7:14).</p>
<p><em>Robes</em> refers to righteous acts after being saved (19:8). Even after we are saved, it is hard to avoid being defiled in our conduct. When we are defiled in any way, we can be washed from these defilements by the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUNDATION FOR SANCTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;That He might sanctify the people through His own blood&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 13:12).</p>
<p>To be sanctified is to be separated unto God. Since the Lord&rsquo;s blood causes us to turn from sin and purchases us back to God, it separates us and sanctifies us. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s blood is the foundation of our sanctification.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:29).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s blood is not only for redemption from sin but also for sanctification. We are sanctified through the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUNDATION FOR JUSTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Having now been justified in His blood&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:9; see also 3:25-26).</p>
<p>The Lord died and shed His blood to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirement for us. Now God is required not only to forgive our sins but also to justify us according to His righteousness. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s blood causes us to be justified by God. God justifies us because of the Lord&rsquo;s blood, and we receive God&rsquo;s justification by the Lord&rsquo;s blood. The Lord&rsquo;s blood is the foundation of our justification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUNDATION FOR RECONCILIATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross&mdash;through Him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:20).</p>
<p>Because of man&rsquo;s sin, nothing, including man, was properly related to God. When the Lord&rsquo;s blood took away our sins before God, the Lord made peace with us and with all things, reconciling us and all things to God. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s blood is the foundation of reconciliation between God and all things, including us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANS FOR RECEIVING ETERNAL LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jesus therefore said...He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 6:53-54).</p>
<p>Because the Lord&rsquo;s blood washed us of our sins, it enabled us to obtain God&rsquo;s holy life, which is God Himself as the eternal life. God gives us His eternal life because the Lord shed His blood for us. The Lord&rsquo;s blood is the means for us to receive God&rsquo;s eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANS FOR COMING NEAR TO GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:13).</p>
<p>Once we were far from God. When the Lord&rsquo;s blood dealt with our sins, our position changed, and we have come near to God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Having...boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:19).</p>
<p>Originally, our sins made us unable and afraid to come to God. The Lord&rsquo;s blood takes away our sin before God and cleanses our conscience from all feelings of condemnation, enabling us to come near to God and to boldly enter the Holy of Holies to fellowship with Him. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s blood is also the means for us to come near to God. Every time we come to God, we must come in the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BETTER ADVOCATE FOR THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:24).</p>
<p>In ancient times the blood of Abel cried out to God from the ground, asking God to avenge him (Gen. 4:10); thus, his blood asked God to condemn. Now, however, the blood of the Lord Jesus speaks on our behalf before God as our advocate, asking God to forgive us according to His righteousness. Therefore, the blood of the Lord speaks something better than that of Abel&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>The law of God condemns us because of our sins, and even the devil can condemn us before God because of our sins. However, since the Lord&rsquo;s blood has satisfied the righteous requirement of God&rsquo;s law and redeemed us from our sins before God, His blood speaks for us before God. It defends us so that the law of God cannot condemn us and so that the devil&rsquo;s condemnation is ineffective. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s blood is a better advocate before God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIS FOR THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ?&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:16).</p>
<p>Believers break bread together and fellowship with one another because we all have received the redemption of the Lord&rsquo;s blood. We fellowship together in the Lord&rsquo;s blood. This is the story told by the cup that we bless during the Lord&rsquo;s table. The Lord&rsquo;s blood is the basis of our fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WEAPON FOR OVERCOMING THE ENEMY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:11).</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s blood we overcome our enemy, the devil, who accuses us. When we cast out demons and fight spiritual battles, we need to rely on the Lord&rsquo;s blood to overcome Satan&rsquo;s authority of darkness. The Lord&rsquo;s blood is our weapon to overcome Satan.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s blood enables us to obtain life and maintain our living before God; therefore, in the Bible God ordained that we not eat any blood (Gen. 9:4; Lev. 17:10, 14; Deut. 12:16, 23-25; Acts 15:20, 29). This signifies that no blood can enable us to obtain life or live before God other than the Lord&rsquo;s blood. We may eat only the Lord&rsquo;s blood because only His blood enables us to receive life and live before God (John 6:54-55).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAW AND GRACE</h1>
<p>The law and grace are two great matters in the Bible. If we want to know God and how He deals with man, we must know the law and grace. We will examine the law and grace briefly here, but we must spend much time to examine these matters further.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Nature of the Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:12, see also v. 16).</p>
<p>The law was given by God. It is out of God and matches God&rsquo;s holy nature. Therefore, it is holy. It also matches God&rsquo;s righteousness and goodness, so it is righteous and good. Every requirement of the law on us and every demand on us is according to God&rsquo;s holy nature, righteousness, and goodness because the law is holy, righteous, and good.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The law is spiritual&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:14).</p>
<p>God is Spirit, and the law is spiritual because the law comes out of God. Every command of the law upon man is spiritual in nature. Although the law places demands upon man&rsquo;s flesh, the requirements upon man are spiritual. Therefore, these requirements cannot be fulfilled by man&rsquo;s flesh. Man cannot fulfill the law or keep the commandments of the law, because he is fleshly, and the law and its commandments are spiritual.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The law is good&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 1:8).</p>
<p>Since the law is spiritual and holy, it is good. Although man&rsquo;s misuse of the law is not good, the law itself is good.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Entrance and Giving of the Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The law entered in alongside&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:20).</p>
<p>According to this verse, the law entered in alongside. In the beginning the law was not part of God&rsquo;s original ordination for man, that is, something according to God&rsquo;s eternal heart&rsquo;s desire. It entered in alongside; that is, it was added later. God never intended to deal with man according to the law; the law was added on the way to the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s desire because of the need discussed in the following sections. Knowing this, we can avoid inaccurate views concerning the law, such as those of the Seventh-day Adventists who still live under the law even though the law is over.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The law, having come four hundred and thirty years after&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:17).</p>
<p>Following the creation of man, man fell repeatedly, reaching the lowest point of degradation with mankind&rsquo;s complete rebellion against God in the construction of the tower of Babel. God then called Abraham out of rebellious mankind and promised to bless him by dealing with him according to grace (Gen. 12:1-5). Four hundred and thirty years later, God gave the law to man in order to temporarily deal with man according to the law. This shows that the law was not God&rsquo;s original desire for man; God&rsquo;s original desire for man was to grace him through the promise. The law was added along the way as a temporary measure.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The law was given through Moses&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:17).</p>
<p>The law was not given until Moses brought the Israelites to Mount Sinai. This was about two thousand five hundred years after the creation of Adam, around 1500 B.C.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Until the law...from Adam until Moses&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:13-14).</p>
<p>Before Moses there was no law. God did not use the law to deal with man from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, a period of about two thousand five hundred years. God began to use the law to deal temporarily with man at the time of Moses. This lasted for about one thousand five hundred years, until John the Baptist came to preach. The law ended with the coming of the Lord Jesus, which was the beginning of the age of grace and the end of the law (Matt. 11:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Means for Giving the Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Received the law as ordinances of angels&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 7:53; see also Gal. 3:19; Heb. 2:2).</p>
</h2>
<p>The law was given through angels. God did not give it directly to man, because the law was not God&rsquo;s original desire for man. This shows that in the giving of the law to man, God did not feel as if it was a dear and sweet thing for man. If He had felt that the law was a dear and sweet thing for man, He would have given it to man Himself.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The law was given through Moses&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:17; see also 7:19; Exo. 24:3).</p>
<p>The law was given not only through angels but also through Moses. Therefore, the law was established through the hand of angels and man. These two points show that the law was not given to man by God Himself.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;All the people witnessed the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people witnessed it, they trembled and stood at a distance. And they said to Moses, You speak with us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak with us, so we do not die&rdquo;</strong> (Exo. 20:18-19; see also 19:9-25; 20:20-21; Heb. 12:18-21).</p>
<p>When God gave the law at Mount Sinai, He descended in fire. This situation was truly frightening. The Israelites were frightened by the thunder, flashes of lightning, the sound of the trumpet, flames, thick clouds, and the mountain shaking. They trembled and stood at a distance, afraid to come closer. They even asked Moses to not let God speak to them directly so that they would not die. This shows that the law keeps man far from God. It cannot bring man close to God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Purpose for Giving the Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Why then the law? It was added because of the transgressions&rdquo;; &ldquo;The law entered in alongside that the offense might abound&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:19; Rom. 5:20).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s way of dealing with man, the law was added along the way because of man&rsquo;s transgressions so that man&rsquo;s offense might abound. The law was given to expose man&rsquo;s transgressions and to cause man to know that he is sinful. Only in this way could man know his condition. God originally wanted&mdash;and still wants&mdash;to deal with man according to grace, but man did not know himself, so he did not see his need for the grace of God. When God saved the Israelites out of Egypt and brought them to Mount Sinai, He told them that He had brought them out of Egypt like an eagle, carrying them on its wings. This was a word of grace to let them know that He was full of grace toward them. If they had known their sinful condition, they would have received His grace and asked Him to continue dealing with them according to grace to bear all their responsibilities. But they did not know themselves, so they did not value or depend on God&rsquo;s grace. Instead, they thought that they could carry out all that God commanded. They did not know themselves. They really thought that they could keep the commandments of God. Therefore, God&rsquo;s attitude changed, and He gave the law to show that they could not keep His commandments.</p>
<p>God originally dealt with them according to grace. He was near and dear to them, carrying them like an eagle carries its young. But eventually He had to deal with them according to the law because they did not know themselves, and He came to them in smoke and flames that were awesome and terrible. God changed the way that He dealt with them because He wanted to expose their transgressions through the law; thus, they would know that they could not keep His commandments, because they were utterly fallen.</p>
<p>God did not give the law in order for the children of Israel to keep it; rather, He gave it because He knew that they would break it. In fact, when God was on Mount Sinai giving Moses the law, the children of Israel were at the foot of the mountain making a golden calf and worshipping idols, which broke the first three commandments. After Moses received the law from God and brought down two stone tablets, upon which the law was written, from the top of Mount Sinai, he saw that they were worshipping idols, and he broke the two tablets. Even while the law was being given and even before it was received by the children of Israel, they were trespassing and breaking it. God gave the law so that when it was broken their transgressions would be exposed. God added the law along the way to expose the transgressions of man. This is the purpose of the law. The law is like a mirror that shows people what they are really like so that they can know themselves. It does not make people evil; it reflects the evil that is already in them.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Through the law is the clear knowledge of sin&rdquo;; &ldquo;I did not know sin except through the law&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:20; 7:7).</p>
<p>The law was added to expose man&rsquo;s transgressions, so the function of the law is to give man the knowledge of sin. Without the law, man would not know what sin is, but with the law, man knows not only what sin is but also what sins he has committed. The law causes man to know sin and to know that he is a sinner.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Condemnation&rdquo;; &ldquo;The law...speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:9; Rom. 3:19; see also James 2:9).</p>
<p>Because the law causes man to know sin, it also condemns man. Since the law exposes man&rsquo;s sin, it stops man&rsquo;s mouth, making him unable to say anything, and it makes him submit to the judgment of God. With the law, man is willing to condemn himself and confess that he is a sinner who should receive God&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The law has become our child-conductor unto Christ that we might be justified out of faith&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:24).</p>
<p>God wanted to deal with man through grace in Christ. However, man did not look to the grace of God, because he did not know himself, and because he did not know that he was a sinner, he had no reason to believe in Christ. Therefore, God came in and gave the law to expose man&rsquo;s transgressions so that man would know that he is a sinner and thus know himself. Since the law causes man to know that he is a sinner, it causes man to look to God for His grace and to believe in Christ. When a mirror shows a person that his face is dirty, it shows him his need to be cleansed. Thus, the law is our child-conductor unto Christ so that we might be justified out of faith. It causes us to look to God for His grace in Christ and to receive His salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">The Principle of the Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The law is not of faith, yet, &lsquo;He who does them shall live because of them&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:12; see also Rom. 10:5; Lev. 18:5).</p>
<p>The law is not of faith but of works. The principle of the law is not faith but works. The law is not based on faith or on the principle of faith but on works and the principle of works. Under the law we must be those who <em>do</em> in order to live. This is a principle of the law.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;As many as are of the works of law are under a curse; for it is written, &lsquo;Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things written in the book of the law to do them&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:10).</p>
<p>According to the principle of the law, only those who do the works of the law can live and be blessed, and since no one can do the works of the law, there is only death and the curse. This is the principle and the declaration of the law.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Whoever keeps the whole law yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all&rdquo;</strong> (James 2:10).</p>
<p>The law requires perfection in the keeping of the law. There cannot be the slightest deviation. If one keeps the whole law but eventually stumbles on only one point, it is as if he has broken the whole law. If a link in a chain is broken, the entire chain is broken. If there is only a small break in the filament of a light bulb, the entire light bulb is useless. In order to be approved according to the law, the entire law must be kept completely. This is a definite principle of the law and a clear declaration of the law.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Weakness of the Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:3).</p>
<p>Although the law is spiritual, holy, righteous, and good, it is weak and even impotent because of the flesh. The law was given because man does not know the flesh yet still relies on it. The law places demands on the flesh to expose the corruption and impotence of the flesh so that man can know the flesh. The flesh is corrupted and impotent. It cannot fulfill even the smallest of the law&rsquo;s demands, so the flesh makes the law weak and impotent.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:20; see also Gal. 2:16; 3:11; Acts 13:39).</p>
<p>No one can be justified by God out of the works of the law. Man is corrupt and weak, and no one can keep the law because of the flesh. Thus, the law is weak in man.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;There is...the setting aside of the preceding commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness (for the law perfected nothing)&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 7:18-19).</p>
<p>Since the law is weak and impotent through man&rsquo;s flesh, it perfected nothing in man. Although the law can cause man to know sin and to know himself, it has only this function on the negative side. On the positive side, the law cannot cause man to forsake sin or be justified by God in order to please God; therefore, it can accomplish nothing. Since it accomplishes nothing, it is unprofitable.</p>
<p>According to the preceding passages of the Bible, we should know that God has no intention for man to keep the law. God gave the law to man because He wanted the law to expose man so that he would know himself. Because of the influence of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man thought that God wanted him to keep the law. Furthermore, because he did not know himself, man thought that he could keep the law by his own strength. Since God knew that man did not have the strength to keep the law, He never intended for man to keep the law. God wanted man to know his own corruption and impotence through the law and then receive the grace of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Nature of Grace</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The kindness and the love...of our Savior God appeared&rdquo;; &ldquo;God so loved...that He gave&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:4; John 3:16).</p>
<p>The law is according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and goodness. Grace is according to God&rsquo;s love. The manifestation of God&rsquo;s love is grace. Love is God&rsquo;s heart toward us, and grace is God&rsquo;s action toward us. The action of God&rsquo;s grace comes out of God&rsquo;s heart of love. God is involved in actions toward us because He loves us. In His actions toward us, He gave His only begotten Son to accomplish redemption. All of God&rsquo;s actions toward us are according to grace. Grace comes out of His love. Therefore, grace is the manifestation of God&rsquo;s love. When God&rsquo;s love is manifested, it is grace.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:7).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s grace is His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. Kindness comes out of love. The love of God causes Him to be kind toward us. When this kindness reaches us, it is grace.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 4:4-5).</p>
<p>God gives grace to us freely because of His love. We do not need to do anything. If we needed to do anything, what we received would be according to wages, to work, not grace. Wages are earned by working; they are not free. Grace is gained freely through faith. We do not need to work or exert any effort. Whatever is obtained through effort is not according to grace. We do not need to pay a price for grace, because it is given to us freely by God.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;If by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 11:6).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s grace has no connection to man&rsquo;s works or actions. Whatever is by grace is not out of works. Works cannot be mixed with grace. Once something is out of works, that is, once works are involved, grace is no longer grace. Since grace is given freely by God, it cannot be earned by works or actions.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain...I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:10).</p>
<p>The grace of God made the apostle Paul a special person, one who could labor more abundantly than all of them. His labor was not something out of himself but rather out of the grace of God which was with him. Paul&rsquo;s word shows that the grace of God is not something lifeless, but something living. This living gift is the powerful life of God; in other words, it is God Himself. Grace could make Paul into an apostle and could enable him to do things that others could not, because it is the powerful life of God. Paul obtained the powerful life of God, God Himself. The highest grace that God gives to man, the highest grace that man receives from God, is the life of God Himself.</p>
<p>When John 1:14 and 17; Romans 5:17 and 21; Philippians 4:23, and many other passages in the New Testament speak of grace, they actually refer to the life of God and to God Himself. The grace that we obtain is the life of God and God Himself. This is the reality of grace.</p><h2 class="head2">The Existence and Giving of Grace</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;His grace,...which He caused to abound to us... according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:6, 8-9).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s grace is given to us according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself. According to the context of these verses, <em>good pleasure</em> refers to what God purposed before the foundation the world (v. 4). God purposed to give us grace before the foundation of the world. His intention was not an accident, nor is it temporary. Before the foundation of the world, God determined to give us grace. Grace was not added alongside, like the law. The law was added along the way; grace has always existed. God deals with us by grace because this is according to His original intention in eternity. Grace is not like the law, which God used only along the way in time.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:9).</p>
<p>The grace of God was given to us before the times of the ages, that is, in eternity. We received the grace of God before the times of the ages even began.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;When the kindness and the love to man of our Savior God appeared&rdquo;; &ldquo;Grace...now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:4; 2 Tim. 1:9-10).</p>
<p>Although the grace of God was given to us in eternity, it was manifested in time when our Lord Jesus came to accomplish redemption, enabling us to know, obtain, and enjoy grace.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The grace of God...has appeared&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 2:11).</p>
<p>The grace of God appeared when the Lord Jesus came through incarnation to accomplish redemption. Now man can gain and enjoy grace in reality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Means for Giving Grace</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:9; see also Eph. 1:6).</p>
<p>The grace of God was given to us in Christ Jesus, unlike the law, which was given to man apart from Christ. The law was added by God apart from Christ. Grace was planned by God in Christ and was given by God in Christ. God&rsquo;s giving of grace in eternity and our obtaining of grace in time were both accomplished in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Grace...came through Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:17).</p>
<p>The law was given through Moses, but grace came through Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus is God who became a man, so grace came through God Himself when He became a man. Since the law is not God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire for us, it is not of central importance to Him. Consequently, He gave it to man through angels and a man, Moses. However, grace is fully related to God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, and He considers it to be very important. Consequently, He came Himself to give it to us.</p>
<p>God expended great effort to bring the grace which He purposed to give. He was incarnated, born as a man, went to the cross to die for man, resurrected from the dead, and became the Spirit to enter into man so that grace could be realized, obtained, and enjoyed by man. This was His purpose in coming in the person of Jesus Christ. Grace came when Jesus Christ came to man.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;His grace, which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:7-9).</p>
<p>God gives grace to us in all wisdom and prudence. He considered, planned, and arranged. In order to give Himself to us as grace, God made a plan which He accomplished through creation and redemption, and then arranged a proper environment for us, including people and events, so that grace would abound to us. God did everything for us according to His wisdom and prudence so that His grace would abound to us. His giving of grace was according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself. This is quite different from His giving of the law to man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Purpose for Giving Grace</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God so loved&rdquo;; &ldquo;In love&rdquo;; &ldquo;His great love with which He loved us&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16; Eph. 1:4; 2:4).</p>
<p>God gives us grace because He loves us. This fulfills the desire of His heart and brings us to the goal of His love for us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Making known to us the mystery of His will...unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:9-10; see also 3:9-11).</p>
<p>God has given us grace in order to accomplish the mystery of His will to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, so that Christ would be the center and Head expressing God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom and shaming Satan and his angels.</p><h2 class="head2">The Principle of Grace</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 4:4-5).</p>
<p>Grace does not require works or actions; grace is based on faith. We do not need to work or act; we only need to believe. This is the principle of grace and the declaration of grace.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 11:6).</p>
<p>The law is completely a matter of works; grace is completely apart from works. Once we pay attention to works, we are not under grace but under the law. The law is out of works and under the principle of works; grace is out of faith and under the principle of faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Power of Grace</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The grace of God, bringing salvation to all men&rdquo;; &ldquo;Saved us...according to His own purpose and grace&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 2:11; 2 Tim. 1:9; see also Eph. 2:8).</p>
<p>The law is weak and impotent. It could not accomplish anything because of the weakness of the flesh. Grace is strong and powerful; it accomplishes everything for us. The initial accomplishment of grace is to save us. We are all saved by grace.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:7).</p>
<p>Grace also causes us to be redeemed and our sins to be forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Justified by His grace&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:7; see also Rom. 3:24).</p>
<p>God cannot justify us based on any of our works of the law. Through grace, He justifies us. Grace is stronger than the law. It can do what the law cannot in relation to our justification.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:6).</p>
<p>The law cannot result in our being graced in God. Only grace can cause us to be graced in the Beloved, that is, to be graced in our Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;By His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:7).</p>
<p>Because of grace, we are no longer enemies of God; instead, we are heirs of God, inheriting the eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Into this grace in which we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:2).</p>
<p>Grace enables us to leave sadness and hopelessness behind and to be boastful in the hope of obtaining God&rsquo;s glory. We are boasting and hopeful, not sorrowful and hopeless, because grace brings us into the glory of God so that we can become glorious people.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who have been sanctified&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 20:32).</p>
<p>Grace not only saves us but also builds us up so that we would gain God&rsquo;s glorious inheritance with all His sanctified ones.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:14).</p>
<p>We can be freed from the authority of sin because of the work of grace in us. Grace causes us to be released from the authority of sin so that we are no longer slaves to sin.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 4:16).</p>
<p>We can come forward to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace for timely help. <em>Timely help</em> can also be translated as &ldquo;constant help.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ&rdquo;; &ldquo;So also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:17, 21).</p>
<p>The grace within us is strong, and it causes us to reign in the life of God. Its strength to overcome is not limited. With its strength, which comes from God&rsquo;s life, grace exercises authority and rules over everything, causing everything to be in subjection to us.</p>
<p>The grace that we receive is Jesus Christ our Lord, who is living and powerful. Grace reigns over everything in order that we might abundantly obtain God&rsquo;s eternal life, the life of God in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 12:9).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s grace is sufficient for us. This sufficient grace is His powerful resurrection life within us, which is able to bear all our responsibilities and bring us through any environment.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:10).</p>
<p>The grace of God can increase our human capacity, as it did in Paul. He says, &ldquo;By the grace of God I am what I am&rdquo; and &ldquo;I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.&rdquo; If we compare his words <em>yet not I but the grace of God</em> with his words in Galatians 2:20, <em>it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ,</em> we can realize that the grace of God is just Christ. This confirms the definition of grace. The grace of God in truth is just Christ, who is God Himself. Grace is the powerful life of God within us. Therefore, the grace of God is as strong as Christ, and the grace of God is as powerful as God and the life of God. The grace of God enables us to do what others cannot because of its strength and power.</p><h2 class="head1">A COMPARISON OF THE LAW AND GRACE</h2>

<h2 class="head1">BELIEVERS NOT BEING UNDER LAW<br />
BUT UNDER GRACE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You are not under the law but under grace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:14).</p>
<p>New Testament believers are not under law but under grace. Therefore, we should not return to the law to live under the law and to keep the letter of the ordinances of the law. We should live under grace, following God and His life within us to live and act.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;We have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:6, see also v. 4; Gal. 2:19).</p>
<p>We have died through Christ to the law, so we have been discharged from the law to serve the Lord in newness of spirit, not in oldness of letter. If we serve the Lord in oldness of letter, we are living under the law. We must serve the Lord according to the Spirit and the life in our spirit to live under grace. Thus, we should not care for the letter of the law but only for the Spirit and life in the Spirit. We live to God in spirit because we have died to the law.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;We are no longer under a child-conductor&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:25).</p>
<p>The law is a child-conductor to lead us to Christ so that we may live under grace. Since we have entered into Christ and are under grace, we are no longer under the child-conductor, so we should not live under the law. Therefore, any thought or action of returning to live under the law is a great mistake. In the New Testament age any teaching that tells people to live under the law is a confusion of the truth and is heresy. Believers should not receive such teachings.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;We have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:2).</p>
<p>We have entered into grace by faith, so we should not return to the law. We should stand in grace and continuously live in grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 8:10; see also 10:16).</p>
<p>Although believers are not under the law, this does not mean that they are not under any restrictions and can be completely lawless. Although God&rsquo;s salvation frees believers from an outward observation of the law of letters, He puts the law of life into the believers and inscribes it on their hearts. The outward law of letters is composed of ordinances apart from God and separate from God. Thus, it is dead, weak, and impotent. The inward law of life is spiritual; it is in God and cannot be separated from God. Therefore, it is living, strong, and powerful. The outward law of letters depends on the strength of man&rsquo;s natural self. The inward law of life is fulfilled by living in God, and it relies on the power of His life. God does not want us to live under the law of letters; He wants us to live according to the law of life. The law of life in us regulates us in every matter, giving us an inward knowledge of what God wants to do and what He does not want to do. While we do not have any responsibility to follow the outward law of letters, we must be responsive to the inward law of life.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>The law that God puts into the believers is His life. This life is in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit enters into us and brings God&rsquo;s life into us as an inward law. Since this life is in the Holy Spirit, the law of this life is also in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the law of life is the law of the Spirit of life. This inward law is active and keen; it has the capacity to regulate us in everything. It causes us to know God&rsquo;s will and enables us to live out God&rsquo;s will in a living and strong way. This is the law that we should follow and pursue today.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;According to the spirit...The mind set on the spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:4, 6; see also Gal. 5:16).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit in us is a living law. We need to follow Him and set our mind on Him and live.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Follow in His steps&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:21; see also 1 John 2:6; John 13:15).</p>
<p>Today we not only have the Holy Spirit inwardly as our law, but we also have the Lord&rsquo;s steps as our model. We should follow the Holy Spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s steps in our actions. We should do things according to the Lord&rsquo;s pattern.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Be therefore imitators of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:1; Matt. 5:48).</p>
<p>Our highest law and principle is God Himself. He wants us to be perfect as He is perfect. We are His children with His life. Based on His life, our living can match Him.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:31).</p>
<p>Whatever we do must be to the glory of God. This is a law and a principle in our living. Whatever we do must glorify God.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;I am not without law to God but within law to Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 9:21).</p>
<p>Although we have left the law of letters, we are not without law before God. In Christ, we have a greater, higher law, which is the life of God, the Holy Spirit of God, God Himself, and the glory of God as our law. Anything that causes us to touch the presence of God and to fellowship with God is permissible according to the law of life. Anything that does not bring us to God is not permissible according to the law of life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</p>
<h1 class="title">IN ADAM AND IN CHRIST</h1>
<p>There are two special phrases in the Bible that speak of a basic truth concerning God&rsquo;s salvation: <em>in Adam</em> and <em>in Christ.</em> If we want to know God&rsquo;s salvation, we must know the matters related to being in Adam and in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN GOD&rsquo;S EYES THERE BEING ONLY TWO MEN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Adam Being the First Man, the First Adam</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The first man, Adam&rdquo;; &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:45, 47).</p>
<p>Although there are millions of people in the world, in God&rsquo;s eyes there are only two men. The first man is Adam. The Bible calls him the first man and the first Adam. He is out of the earth, so he is earthy. He is the beginning of man. He is the first man and the first Adam because before him there was no man. All the people in the world are his descendants, and everyone is out of him; thus, everyone is in him. Although his descendants number in the millions, in God&rsquo;s view Adam and we as his descendants are just one man because we are out of him and in him.</p>
<p>Every person in the world is one with Adam. Everyone has come out of Adam and is a part of Adam. When a watermelon is cut into many slices, the slices are still a part of the watermelon, and the slices equal only one watermelon. Every person in the world is a &ldquo;slice&rdquo; of Adam, a part of Adam. Everyone together equals Adam. Although every person is an individual, every person is Adam because everyone is a part of Adam. Strictly speaking, our name is Adam because we are out of Adam and in Adam. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s eyes Adam and his descendants are one man, Adam. As the first man, Adam is the first Adam.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Second Man, the Last Adam</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The second man is out of heaven&rdquo;; &ldquo;The last Adam&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:47, 45).</p>
<p>The Bible speaks of Christ as the second man. This may seem a little peculiar because, according to our thought, Cain was the second man. However, the Bible says that the second man is Christ. This is God&rsquo;s view. In God&rsquo;s eyes the only man after Adam is Christ because there was only one man before Christ. Apart from Adam, there was no other man before Christ. Thus, in God&rsquo;s eyes Adam is the first man, and Christ is the second man.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15 Christ is called not only the second man but also the last Adam, or the last man. This tells us that in God&rsquo;s eyes, Christ is not only the second man but also the last man. After Christ there is no other man. Although there is one man before Christ, there is not another man after Christ. Adam is the first man; Christ is the second man. In God&rsquo;s eyes, just as there was no man before Adam, there is no man after Christ. Furthermore, there is no man between Adam and Christ. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s view there are only two men in the universe&mdash;Adam and Christ.</p>
<p>If we want to thoroughly know and accurately experience God&rsquo;s way of salvation, we must see that there are only two men in the universe&mdash;Adam and Christ. Apart from these two men, there is not another man. In God&rsquo;s eyes every person in the world is either in Adam or in Christ. If we are not in Adam, we are in Christ because there is not a third man. This is God&rsquo;s vision. This is God&rsquo;s point of view. We must have God&rsquo;s vision and God&rsquo;s point of view to thoroughly know and to accurately experience His way of salvation. May the Lord open our eyes to see this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN ADAM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Being in Adam</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He made from one every nation of men&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 17:26).</p>
<p>Some ancient manuscripts use the phrase <em>one man</em> instead of <em>one</em> in this verse. The one man is Adam. God made myriads of nations out of one man, or out of one. The nations are all out of Adam, and they are all in Adam. The people of the world are all descendants of Adam and out of Adam because they have been born in Adam. Strictly speaking, before we were born, we were in Adam. We are born in Adam because we were in Adam and are people of Adam.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Inheritance in Adam</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:19).</p>
<p>The first thing that man has received from Adam is sin. Through Adam sin has come to every man. We are not sinful because we have committed sins; we were constituted sinners in Adam. Before we even committed a sin, we had a sinful nature. Because of the disobedience of Adam, we have sin, and we have been constituted as sinners. Adam became a sinner through disobedience, and since we are in him, we have sin and are sinners. We do not need to commit a sin in order to be a sinner, because we were born as sinners.</p>
<p>After Korea was defeated by Japan, the children who were born in Korea were also defeated because their country was no longer their own. They lost their country because their forefathers lost their country. Before they were even born, they were in a country that their fathers and grandfathers had lost. Thus, they were born as people without their own country. Similarly, we are descendants of Adam, and as his descendants, we are sinners because of his disobedience. It does not matter whether or not we have committed sins ourselves, we are sinners because we are in Adam. As long as we are in Adam and born of Adam, we are sinners.</p>
<p>In Adam we are sinners. We do not become sinners when we sin; that is, we do not become sinners because we have sinned. First, we are sinners, and then we commit sins. We commit sins because we are sinners. We are sinners, so we commit sins. We spontaneously sin because we are sinners; there is no exception to this fact. It would be an exception if we did not sin. An orange tree spontaneously bears oranges. If it did not bear oranges, it would be strange. Furthermore, it does not become an orange tree after it bears oranges; it is an orange tree before it bears fruit. It bears oranges because it is an orange tree. In the same way, we commit sins because we are sinners. We inherited our status as sinners. We commit sins because of what we received from Adam.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;It was through one offense unto condemnation to all men&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:18).</p>
<p>Since we all are sinners in Adam, we also deserve to be condemned because we share in his condemnation. We were included in his one offense in the garden because we were in him. When he sinned in the garden, we also sinned. When he sinned, we were included in him. When Abraham offered a tithe to Melchizedek, his descendant, Levi, also offered a tithe to Melchizedek because he was included in Abraham (Heb. 7:9-10). When the ancestor of the Chinese people, Huang Ti, crossed over the Pamir Plateau toward the east, all Chinese people crossed over the plateau in him. The Chinese people may not feel as if they crossed over the plateau, but when he came, they came in him and with him because they were included in him. Similarly, when Adam sinned in the garden, we were in him. His sinning was our sinning because we were in him. Thus, his one offense was unto condemnation to all men. If we see this, we will understand the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 3:18: &ldquo;He who does not believe has been condemned already.&rdquo; We are in Adam, and when Adam was condemned, we were condemned. So just as we obtained sin in Adam, we also inherited condemnation in Adam. Being in Adam causes us to partake of condemnation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;In Adam all die&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:22).</p>
<p>In Adam we first inherit sin, then condemnation, and finally death. This order is automatic. Where there is sin, there is condemnation, and where there is condemnation, there must be death. The result of sin and condemnation is death. Our death in Adam has several aspects. The first aspect involves the deadening of our human spirit, in which fellowship with God was broken, and the human spirit lost this function. The second aspect involves the death of our body, in which our body will lose its life and return to dust. The third aspect involves the death of the soul, in which the soul is tormented in Hades (Luke 16:22-25). The fourth aspect is the second death, in which the spirit, soul, and body of those who do not believe are cast into the lake of fire to suffer (Rev. 20:15; 21:8). The spirit of an unbeliever is dead toward God. One day his body will die, and his soul will go to Hades to suffer. On the day of judgment at the great white throne (20:11-14), he will be raised, and his spirit, soul, and body will be cast into the lake of fire to suffer eternally. This is the final death and the eternal death. These are all aspects of death, and they are our common inheritance in Adam. In Adam we have three terrible things: sin, condemnation, and death.</p><h2 class="head1">IN CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers Being in Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16).</p>
<p>How can a person be in Christ? This is a mysterious spiritual matter. A person enters into Christ by believing into Him, not by being physically born. We are not physically born into Christ. We believe into Christ. The Greek preposition <em>into</em> in this verse is the same preposition that is used in Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 in relation to baptism, but here it refers to believing. Just as a person must be baptized into Christ, he also must believe into Christ. We are related to Christ by believing. We believe into Christ. When a person believes into Christ, he enters into Christ and begins a relationship with Christ in spirit. He has a spiritual union with Christ. This is similar to a light bulb that is connected to an electrical power plant by electricity. It is related to the electrical power plant because of the electricity. Once we believe in Christ, His Spirit enters us, joins us to Christ, and causes us to be one with Christ in spirit. From the time of our believing, we are in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:27; see also Rom. 6:3).</p>
<p>Both believing and baptism speak of our entrance into Christ, our putting on of Christ. By believing, we enter into Christ in reality in spirit; by being baptized, our entrance into Christ becomes practical in a manifest way by our going into the water. When we believe, we enter into Christ. Then we confess, declare, and manifest this fact through baptism. Through believing and being baptized, we are able to fully enter into Christ. Being in Christ requires these two things.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>We enter into Christ through believing and being baptized. These are matters that involve our response; however, putting the Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ into us are matters that depend upon God. When we receive Christ and enter into Him through believing and being baptized, God puts the Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ into our spirit, causing us to be joined to Him. This is not something that we can do ourselves; it is completely a matter of God&rsquo;s doing. Thus, in reality it is of God that we are in Christ. God puts us into Christ. God puts the Spirit and the life of Christ into our spirit, causing us to be one with Christ in spirit. This is God&rsquo;s response to our believing and being baptized.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers&rsquo; Inheritance in Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:19).</p>
<p>In Adam we have sin, but in Christ we have righteousness. Adam gives us sin, but Christ gives us righteousness. Just as Adam&rsquo;s disobedience resulted in the many being constituted sinners, Christ&rsquo;s obedience resulted in the many being constituted righteous. Just as we are not sinners because we have sinned, we are not righteous because we have done some righteous works. In Adam we are already sinful, and in Christ we are already righteous. Because we are in Adam, we are sinners, and because we are in Christ, we are righteous. We are sinners because we are in Adam, and we are righteous because we are in Christ. In Adam we inherit sin and are sinners. In Christ we inherit righteousness and are righteous.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;It was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:18).</p>
<p>Just as the sin that we have in Adam causes us to be condemned in him, the righteousness that we have in Christ causes us to be justified in Him. Adam&rsquo;s one offense in the garden of Eden caused everyone in him to be condemned. In the same way, Christ&rsquo;s one righteous act at Golgotha caused everyone in Him to be justified. Just as we were condemned before God because of Adam&rsquo;s one offense, we are justified before God because of Christ&rsquo;s one righteous act. We do not need to sin in order to be condemned by God; instead, because of Adam&rsquo;s one offense, we are condemned because we are in him. In the same way, we do not need to do righteous acts in order to be justified by God; instead, because of Christ&rsquo;s one righteous act, we are justified because we are in Him. Just as our condemnation before God is unrelated to our sinful works, our justification before God is unrelated to any works of righteousness which we have done (Titus 3:5).</p>
<p>Just as the sin and condemnation that we inherited in Adam bring in death, the righteousness and justification that we received in Christ bring in life. Just as we were condemned because of Adam&rsquo;s sin and inherited death, we were justified because of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness and inherited life. The death that we received because of Adam&rsquo;s sin is out of Satan, but the life that we received because of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness is out of God. Just as death entered into us because of Adam&rsquo;s sin and defiled our whole being&mdash;our spirit, soul, and body&mdash;the life of God entered into us because of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness to enliven our entire being&mdash;our spirit, soul, and body&mdash;by swallowing up every element of death in us. Just as the death from Adam&rsquo;s sin deadened our spirit and then spread to our soul and body, the life of God from Christ&rsquo;s righteousness enlivens our spirit and then spreads to our soul and body. This life enters our deadened spirit through the Holy Spirit because of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness and enlivens our deadened spirit. Then this life spreads from our spirit to our soul, swallowing up death and the elements of death in our inward parts until life transfigures our body. Even though our body has been attacked and damaged by death, the life of God will make our body the same as the resurrected body of our glorious Lord. The divine life causes every part of our being to be saturated with the life of God and to enter into God&rsquo;s life of glory.</p>
<p>In summary, we obtain three items in Adam: sin, condemnation, and death; and we obtain three items in Christ: righteousness, justification, and life. The items that we inherited from Adam have been taken care of by the death and resurrection of Christ, which also gave us righteousness, justification, and life. Christ&rsquo;s death dealt with our sin and condemnation in Adam, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection dealt with the death that we received in Adam. Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection dealt with our sin, condemnation, and death in Adam on the negative side. On the positive side, Christ&rsquo;s death caused us to obtain righteousness and justification. His resurrection also caused us to obtain life on the positive side. Christ&rsquo;s death freed us from sin and condemnation in Adam and gave us righteousness and justification in Christ. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection freed us from death in Adam and gave us life in Christ. Adam gave us sin and death; Christ died and rose to give us righteousness and life. Christ&rsquo;s death dealt with Adam&rsquo;s sin so that we could receive God&rsquo;s righteousness in Him, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection dealt with Adam&rsquo;s death so that we could receive God&rsquo;s life in Him. Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection solved the problems of sin and death and brought us righteousness and life.</p>
<p>In Adam we have sin, condemnation, and death, and in Christ we have righteousness, justification, and life. As long as we are in Adam, we experience sin, condemnation, and death, and as long as we are in Christ, we experience righteousness, justification, and life. When we partake of Adam, we partake of sin and death. When we partake of Christ, we partake of righteousness and life. When we touch Adam, we touch sin and death. When we touch Christ, we touch righteousness and life. When we contact Adam, we encounter sin and death. When we contact Christ, we encounter righteousness and life. If we remain in Adam, we will surely taste sin and death, but if we abide in Christ, we will surely enjoy righteousness and life. May God show us that sin and death are in Adam, whereas righteousness and life are in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:3).</p>
<p>In Christ we not only have righteousness, justification, and life, but we also obtain every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies. Specifically, we obtain the Father&rsquo;s selection, the Son&rsquo;s redemption, and the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s sealing in Christ. We also obtain all the blessings in Christ that are mentioned in the subsequent verses in Ephesians.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;He chose us&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:4).</p>
<p>The first blessing that God gives is His selection of us before the foundation of the world. This blessing of selection was given to us in Christ by God because He chose us in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Predestinating&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:5).</p>
<p>God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, predestinating us unto sonship to be sons together with His Son (Rom. 8:29) and to be the object of His love and grace in the Son. He has predestinated us in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Redemption, the forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:14).</p>
<p>God chose us in eternity, predestinated us, and came in time to redeem us, that is, to deal with our sin in order that we could be forgiven. God has given us His forgiveness in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Sanctified&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:2).</p>
<p>To be sanctified is to be separated from everything of the world and to return to God (see chapter 8, &ldquo;Sanctification&rdquo;). God has saved us and sanctified us to Himself. God has sanctified us in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;The righteousness of God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<p>God accomplished redemption for us according to His righteousness. God also has forgiven and justified us according to His righteousness. God saved us according to His righteousness (see chapter 9, &ldquo;Justification,&rdquo; and chapter 35, &ldquo;The Faithfulness of God and the Righteousness of God&rdquo;). God worked His righteousness into us in His salvation. Therefore, people can see God&rsquo;s righteousness in us. The righteousness of God is manifested in us, so we become the righteousness of God. This is something that God perfects in us in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Wisdom...righteousness and sanctification and redemption&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>This verse refers to four items. Of these items wisdom can be considered as a summary, whereas the other three&mdash;righteousness, sanctification, and redemption&mdash;are the details. This can be seen in the structure of the original Greek. Everything that God gives us in Christ is related to wisdom and even is wisdom. Wisdom includes three items: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Righteousness causes us to be saved by being justified by God. This occurred in the past. Sanctification causes us to live a holy life and to overcome. This occurs in the present. Redemption causes our body to be redeemed and us to be transfigured. This will occur in the future. All these items are given to us by God in Christ, and they are even Christ Himself as wisdom. In Christ God has given us salvation in the past, overcoming today, and transfiguration in the future.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:6).</p>
<p>Being graced by God means that we become the object of God&rsquo;s grace. It is a great blessing for us to be graced by God. This is something that God gives to us in His Beloved Son.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Sonship&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:5).</p>
<p>Sonship includes being a son of God with the life, position, authority, blessing and glory of a son of God. It is also to be a son of God with His Son our Lord Jesus. This blessing is truly great, and it will take eternity to be manifested to us. Sonship has been given to us by God in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;In Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>The believers are God&rsquo;s new creation. In us, everything of the old creation has passed away and become new. This is glorious! Although we have not fully experienced this glorious fact, there will be a day in the future when this glorious fact will be manifested in us. This is something God is doing in us in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;Circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:11).</p>
<p>The circumcision of Christ causes people to put off the lusts of the flesh. The circumcision of the Israelites in the Old Testament was a symbol of the real circumcision in the New Testament. The reality of circumcision of the New Testament is Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion of the flesh through the cross, which enables us to be freed from the lusts of the flesh. We receive the reality of crucifixion because we have been joined to Him.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;Raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:6).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s salvation we were raised together with Christ, and we have left everything related to death behind us. Furthermore, we have been seated together with Him in the heavenlies; everything of the earth and everything in the air that belong to Satan are behind us. We have been raised and seated together with Christ because we are in Christ and are one with Him.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;Fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:6).</p>
<p>We were apart from the nation of Israel and strangers to the promises of God (2:11-12), but in God&rsquo;s salvation we are fellow heirs with Israel, fellow members of the Body of Christ, and fellow partakers of the promises of God. We receive these blessings because we partake of Christ and are in Him.</p>
<p><strong>16. &ldquo;Many are one Body&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:5).</p>
<p>The believers have become one in Christ&rsquo;s universal, mysterious Body. We have become one Body because we have the life of Christ inwardly. Being one Body is a matter in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>17. &ldquo;Inheritance&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:11).</p>
<p>In His salvation God not only redeems, forgives, enlivens, and causes us to become a new creation by crucifying the old creation with the flesh and by joining us to the Body of Christ, He also gives us a heavenly inheritance, which is incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading as our eternal enjoyment (1 Pet. 1:4). The inheritance that God has given us is in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>18. &ldquo;Made full&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:10).</p>
<p>We are made full with the fullness of God Himself. All the fullness of God dwells in Christ bodily. When we partake of Christ, we partake of and obtain all the fullness of God. Therefore, we obtain God&rsquo;s fullness in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>19. &ldquo;The love of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:39).</p>
<p>The love of God is not only sweet but also strong. Nothing can separate us from the love of God because this love is in Christ, and it has been given to us by God in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>20. &ldquo;Empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:1).</p>
<p>The manifestation of God&rsquo;s love is grace. The love of God causes Him to give Himself and His life in the Son as grace. Therefore, grace is God Himself as life to us. Grace not only saves us but also empowers us because it is God Himself as life. This grace is in Christ, and it is given to us in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>21. &ldquo;No condemnation&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:1).</p>
<p><em>No condemnation</em> does not refer merely to being freed from the condemnation related to our sinful condition when we were saved but even more to being freed from condemnation related to our experience of overcoming. God has not only forgiven us and no longer condemns us, but He has also freed us in Christ from the control of sin and from self-condemnation.</p>
<p><strong>22. &ldquo;Freed...from the law of sin and of death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>We have been freed from condemnation because we have been freed from the law of sin and of death. We receive this freedom in Christ Jesus according to the law of the Spirit of life.</p>
<p><strong>23. &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:4).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation grants us complete freedom. We are freed from the law and every form of bondage. This freedom is obtained in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>24. &ldquo;Faith and love&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 1:14).</p>
<p>Faith causes us to believe in the Lord and to receive His salvation. Love causes us to love the Lord and to live out His salvation. We obtain both faith and love in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>25. &ldquo;Peace&rdquo;</strong> (John 16:33).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s salvation we obtain peace. This peace cannot be disturbed by anything.</p>
<p><strong>26. &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord always&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:4).</p>
<p>Rejoicing is a sweet blessing given to us in God&rsquo;s salvation. Our rejoicing is a matter in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>27. &ldquo;Hope&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:12).</p>
<p>Before being saved, we were without hope in the world. After being saved, we have hope, especially the hope of the redemption of our bodies and of entering into God&rsquo;s glory (Rom. 8:23-24; 5:2). This hope is in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>28. &ldquo;Encouragement&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:1).</p>
<p>As followers of Christ, we need to encourage one another with the encouragement that we have in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>29. &ldquo;Faithful&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:1).</p>
<p>Our faithfulness toward the Lord is something we obtain in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>30. &ldquo;Stand firm in the Lord&rdquo;; &ldquo;Empowered in the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:1; Eph. 6:10).</p>
<p>Standing firm and being empowered are needed for our spiritual life. We obtain these matters in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>31. &ldquo;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:13).</p>
<p>The Lord can empower us in all things and even empower us to do all things. We receive this power from the Lord&rsquo;s life in us. Therefore, we obtain our empowering in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>32. &ldquo;Triumph&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 2:14).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s grace enables us not only to overcome but also to triumph. Our triumph is in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>33. &ldquo;Made alive&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:22).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation not only enlivens our spirit today; it will also enliven our body in the future, bringing our entire being into resurrection. This is something that we obtain in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>34. &ldquo;Head up&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:10).</p>
<p>In the fullness of the times God will head up all things in the heavens and on the earth in Christ, including all the believers. This is a great thing that God will accomplish in Christ.</p>
<p>We inherit God&rsquo;s grace and blessings in Christ. Apart from Christ, we have nothing; in Christ, we obtain everything. We receive redemption, forgiveness, justification, sanctification, life, peace, hope, joy, release, freedom, power, and strength from God in His salvation, which can be experienced and enjoyed by us only in Christ. When we touch Christ, we touch everything of God. May we see this!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TWO NATURES OF THE BELIEVERS</h1>
<p>Every believer has two natures, and if we desire to grow in the divine life, we must have a clear knowledge of these two natures. Every brother and sister, especially the younger ones, must pay attention to this crucial truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OLD MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Origin of the Old Man</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 2:7).</p>
<p>Every believer has two natures because every believer is related to two men. While a believer is in Adam of the old creation and also in Christ of the new creation, an unbeliever is only in Adam. Consequently, an unbeliever has but one nature. However, every believer has two natures because every believer is also part of the new man with its new nature. Every believer has two natures&mdash;one that is old and one that is new. God, however, did not create the old man. The old man came into being only after the man formed by God became fallen and corrupted.</p>
<p>In the beginning the man in God&rsquo;s creation was good and upright (Gen. 1:31; Eccl. 7:29). He became the old man due to the corruption of the fall (Gen 3:1-7). When the man of God&rsquo;s creation was corrupted by the fall, he became the old man. Although man was created by God, God did not create the old man; rather, the man of God&rsquo;s creation became old through the corruption of the fall.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You are of your father the devil&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:44; see also 1 John 3:10).</p>
<p>In the beginning Satan, the devil, tempted man with his speaking and with the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He injected his life and nature into man. When man received Satan&rsquo;s speaking and ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan&rsquo;s life was injected into him. Thus, the good and upright man whom God originally formed became the corrupt and evil man of the old creation, the creation made old by the injection of Satan&rsquo;s life and nature into it. In the beginning man was pure and clean, but through the fall Satan and his life were injected into man, making him something of mixture and corruption. Thus, man became the old man. The man who was created by God has the life of Satan because of the fall. He belongs to Satan, and every descendant of Adam has the life and nature of Satan. This is the reason that the Bible speaks of the devil as being the father of corrupted man. All of fallen humanity are of the devil and are his children. The corrupted man is the old man, and the old man is of the devil. Everyone in the world is part of the old man.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;In Adam&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:22, see also vv. 45-48).</p>
<p>Adam was formed by God in the beginning. After his fall and corruption, he became the old man. Furthermore, since the life and nature of the devil were injected into Adam, the old man who comes out of Adam is also corrupted with his evil life. As descendants of Adam, we are related not only to Satan but also to Adam, the old man. Since we are born in Adam, we are in Adam and of Adam.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45-48 says that Adam was a living soul, soulish, and earthy and that those who are out of Adam are the same as Adam. Since the old man is in Adam and of Adam, the old man is the same as Adam. The old man is soulish and earthy, not spiritual and heavenly. This is the reason that those who are in Adam cannot understand spiritual and heavenly matters.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Born of the flesh&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:6).</p>
<p>When man was in the garden of Eden, he lived before God according to his spirit. The spirit with its capacity for fellowship with God directed the body through the soul in relation to man&rsquo;s living and actions. At that time man&rsquo;s body was pure; it did not have any corrupting element in it. However, Satan&rsquo;s life with its element of sin was injected into man&rsquo;s body after man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This corrupted his body with sin (Rom. 7:23). When man followed the desires of the soul according to the lust of his corrupted flesh, his soul came under the control and direction of the flesh to such an extent that the old man is altogether flesh in God&rsquo;s eyes. Thus, our old man is of the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Out of the earth&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:47).</p>
<p>Adam was formed out of dust, so he is out of the earth. Since Adam is out of the earth, the old man is out of the earth. Therefore, the old man is also out of the earth and earthy.</p>
<p>There are five matters related to the origin of the old man: (1) the old man comes from the old creation, (2) the old man is out of the devil, (3) the old man is in Adam, (4) the old man is born of the flesh, and (5) the old man is out of the earth. The old man is of the old creation, the devil, Adam, and the flesh, and it is earthy.</p><h2 class="head2">The Condition of the Old Man</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Of the devil&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:8).</p>
<p>Since the old man is of the devil, the old man has the devil&rsquo;s life and nature. When we live according to the old man, we are living according to the devil&rsquo;s life and nature, so we are living out the devil&rsquo;s life and manifesting his nature. When a person sins and does evil, he is living a devilish life and often manifesting a devilish appearance. Look at the people who are dancing in a dance hall, gambling in a gambling den, smoking opium in an opium parlor, or drinking wildly in a bar. Are they not living a devilish life? Do they not have a devilish appearance? When the Chinese refer to these evil habits, they call them &ldquo;lifestyles of devilish confusion,&rdquo; and they refer to the people involved in these evil habits as &ldquo;little devils.&rdquo; If a person does not have the lifestyle of a &ldquo;little dancing devil&rdquo; or a &ldquo;little gambling devil,&rdquo; he may have the lifestyle of a &ldquo;little opium devil&rdquo; or a &ldquo;little wine devil.&rdquo; Even a person who loses his temper looks like a little devil. If a person who is in the midst of a terrible fit of temper would look in a mirror, he would see that his appearance is devilish. People living by the old man spontaneously manifest a devilish appearance because their old man is constituted with the devilish life.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was incarnated in the likeness of a man, in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and in this likeness, He was crucified on the cross. This matter is typified in the Old Testament by the bronze serpent in Numbers 21. Whereas the serpent is the embodiment of the devil (Rev. 12:9), the bronze serpent had only the outward form of the devil, not his sinful content. Although the Lord was in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), He did not have the sin of the flesh. Instead, He was without sin (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). In contrast, the flesh of man is the issue of a mixture of the human life and nature and the devil&rsquo;s life and nature. In God&rsquo;s eyes man not only has the form of the devil, but his flesh is a mixture of the human life and nature with the devil&rsquo;s sinful life and nature. With such a mixture, the old man is of the devil and has the devil&rsquo;s life and nature. This is man&rsquo;s true condition. The old man is a &ldquo;devil-man.&rdquo; The old man is evil and corrupted because the old man is of the devil and has the devil&rsquo;s life and nature.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;According to...the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:2).</p>
<p>In this verse the word <em>spirit</em> refers to the aggregate of all the evil angelic authorities in the air, over whom Satan is the ruler. On the one hand, Satan is ruling in the air, controlling this dark world, and on the other hand, he is operating in man&rsquo;s heart, causing man to follow him in disobeying God. Since he is personified in man as sin (Rom. 7:17), he easily and conveniently operates in man&rsquo;s heart. Given this mixture of sin, the old man spontaneously follows Satan&rsquo;s operation and obeys him. The thoughts, words, and actions of the old man all come from Satan&rsquo;s operation in us and from our obedience to Satan&rsquo;s operation in our heart related to our thinking, speaking, and doing. The old man obeys Satan because the old man is of Satan.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;In sin did my mother conceive me&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 51:5).</p>
<p>The old man was born of fallen Adam in whom there is sin. Consequently, the old man was conceived in sin and has a sinful nature. The old man not only contains the element of the devil&rsquo;s life but also the element of sin. The old man commits sins because the old man is born in sin and is of sin, and since the old man is of sin and has the element of sin, he spontaneously sins. Whenever we live by the old man, we spontaneously commit sins. The old man cannot be separated from sin because the old man is of sin.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 17:9).</p>
<p>In this verse the word <em>heart</em> refers to the heart of the old man. The heart of the old man is deceitful above all things, and it is incurable. <em>Deceitful above all things</em> means that the heart is the most deceitful thing: Nothing is more deceitful than our heart. <em>Incurable</em> means that our heart is in the worst possible condition. <em>It is incurable</em> can be translated &ldquo;it is exceedingly wicked.&rdquo; This means that the heart of the old man is wicked to the extent that it cannot be cured. Since our heart is wicked to this extent, the old man is wicked to this extent, and since the heart is deceitful above all things, the old man is deceitful above all things. The old man is deceitful and evil because he has the devil&rsquo;s life and nature with its element of sin. Since the devil is personified in the old man as sin and since the old man is conceived in sin, he is corrupt beyond compare.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;In me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:18; see also Mark 7:20-23).</p>
<p>In our flesh nothing good dwells. Nothing good dwells in our flesh since we are of the devil, conceived in sin, and incurably evil. Every sin that we commit comes from living by our flesh because our old man is full of sin. Even if we do not commit a particular sin, we still are inwardly full of sin because we have the flesh which is inwardly full of sin.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be. And those who are in the flesh cannot please God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:7-8).</p>
<p>These verses speak of our condition when we set our mind on the flesh. To set our mind on the flesh is to live by the flesh. In such a condition, there is enmity against God, and our mind is not subject to the law of God. In such a condition, it is not possible to be subject to the law of God even if we wanted to be subject to His law. Consequently, we cannot please God in our flesh. The flesh is of the devil, so it is enmity against God and not subject to the law of God. Furthermore, being conceived in sin, the flesh cannot be subject to the law of God. It is evil to the uttermost and full of sin, so it cannot please God. We must know the condition of the flesh. It is at enmity with God, it is not subject to God, it cannot be subject to God, and it cannot please God. If we have such a knowledge of the flesh, we will hate and reject it in order to not live by it.</p><h2 class="head2">The Destiny of the Old Man</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>Since our old man is exceedingly evil and corrupt, God deals with it by death. The destiny of the old man is death. Since our flesh is evil to the uttermost and incurable, and since it is at enmity with God and cannot be subject to God, God can only put the flesh to death, using the cross of Christ to crucify our old man. Our old man was crucified with Christ and terminated. Therefore, we should no longer live by our old man. We must see that our old man is dead. We should confess that the cross of Christ has crucified our old man. We should apply the crucifixion of the old man in our living in order to terminate his life and power in our practical living.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>The old man is what we are in our self; the old man is our fallen self. Therefore, the crucifixion of our old man with Christ is the crucifixion of the fallen self. For this reason, we should no longer live according to &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the old man, because the old man has been crucified with Christ.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:24).</p>
<p>The flesh and the old man are related. The inward constitution of the flesh is the old man, and the living out of our old man is manifested as the flesh. The living out of the old man is manifested as the flesh. Consequently, since the old man has been crucified with Christ, the flesh also has been crucified with Christ. While the crucifixion of the old man was accomplished by Christ on the cross, the crucifixion of the flesh is carried out by the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s application of Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments on the cross to us. Since our old man has been crucified with Christ, we can crucify our flesh with its passions and lusts by allowing the Holy Spirit to apply the death of Christ on the cross to our flesh in our practical living. God&rsquo;s destiny for the old man and the way that He deals with him is death by crucifixion. God has no desire that our old man would improve, and since our flesh is incurable, there is no way that the old man can be improved. God&rsquo;s only action toward our old man is to terminate him through the death of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Origin of the New Man</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The new man, which was created according to God&rdquo;; &ldquo;He is a new creation&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:24; 2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>In addition to being related to the old man, every believer is related to the new man. Nevertheless, the new man does not originate from the improvement of the old man; the new man was created by God and according to God. The new man has nothing of the old creation; the new man is something completely new. Just as our old man is old, our new man is new. The old man and the new man belong to two different creations, having different origins, one that is old and one that is new. The old man is of the old creation. The new man is of the new creation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Begotten...of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:13; see also 1 John 3:9).</p>
<p>When God formed man out of the dust of the ground, He did not impart His divine life, but when He created the new man, He imparted His divine life. Since the new man was created with the life of God, the new man was begotten of God. To be begotten of God is to be regenerated. The new man was produced through regeneration with the life of God. Just as the old man is out of Satan and has Satan&rsquo;s life and nature, the new man is out of God and has God&rsquo;s life and nature. Satan injected his life into man through craftiness, but God begot the new man with His life in righteousness. The new man is a matter utterly related to the mingling of God&rsquo;s life with redeemed humanity, and the new man has no connection to the old man, which is the issue of God&rsquo;s creation being mixed with the satanic life and nature.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;In Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:22, see also vv. 45-48).</p>
<p>God regenerates us with His life, which is in Christ, to make us a new creation. Therefore, the new man not only is begotten of God but also is in Christ. Just as the old man is in Adam, the new man is in Christ. Just as the old man in Adam possesses the things of Adam, the new man in Christ possesses the things of Christ. Adam was soulish and earthy, and the old man in Adam is soulish and earthy. Christ, as the life-giving Spirit, is spiritual and heavenly, so the new man in Christ is spiritual and heavenly. Just as the old man in Adam is of the soul and the earth, the new man in Christ is of the Spirit and the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Born of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:6, 8).</p>
<p>God regenerates us with His life, making us a new creation. He accomplishes this in Christ through the Holy Spirit. His Holy Spirit enters into our spirit and regenerates us with His life, making us part of the new man. Therefore, the new man is in Christ and is born of the Spirit. Just as the old man in Adam was born of the flesh, came out of the flesh, and is of the flesh, the new man in Christ is born of the Holy Spirit, comes out of the Holy Spirit, and is of the Holy Spirit. Since the new man is born of the Holy Spirit and is out of the Holy Spirit, the nature of the new man is spiritual.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Out of heaven&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:47).</p>
<p>God is in the heavens, Christ is out of heaven, and the Holy Spirit descends from heaven, so our new man, who is from God, in Christ, and born of the Holy Spirit, is also out of heaven. Just as the old man in Adam is out of the earth because Adam is out of the earth, the new man in Christ is out of heaven because Christ is out of heaven. Because the new man is out of heaven, the nature of the new man is heavenly.</p>
<p>The origin of the old man is related to five points, and the origin of our new man is related to five points. The five points related to the new man are the exact opposite of the five points related to the old man. The old man is of the old creation, but the new man is of the new creation. The old man is out of the devil, but the new man is out of God. The old man is in Adam, but the new man is in Christ. The old man is born of the flesh, but the new man is born of the Holy Spirit. The old man is earthy, but the new man is heavenly. Each of these five points, as they relate to both the old man and the new man, are true of every believer because every believer is related to both the old man and the new man. Both the elements of the old creation and the new creation are in us. Both the life of Satan and the life of God are in us, and both the things in Adam and the things in Christ, the things of the flesh and the things of the Spirit, and the things of the earth and things of the heavens are in us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Condition of the New Man</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Partakers of the divine nature&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 1:4).</p>
<p>Our old man is of the devil and has the devilish nature. Our new man is born of God and has the divine nature. Just as the old man with his devilish nature lives according to the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts (Eph. 2:3), the new man with his divine nature proves what is well pleasing to the Lord (5:10). When we live by the new man, we spontaneously know God&rsquo;s preferences, inclinations, and tendencies, and our living has the flavor of God. The new man is out of God and partakes of God&rsquo;s divine nature, so he can live out God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Led by the Spirit of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:14).</p>
<p>Whereas the old man obeys the aggregate evil spirit that is now operating in the sons of disobedience, the new man is led by the Spirit of God through the inward abiding of the Holy Spirit. Just as the aggregate evil spirit operates within the realm of the old man, causing the old man to follow Satan, the Holy Spirit operates in the realm of the new man, causing the new man to follow God. When we live by our old man, our living is the result of the operation of the aggregate evil spirit, over which Satan is the ruler (Eph. 2:2). Similarly, when we live by our new man, our living works out God&rsquo;s good pleasure according to the operation of the Holy Spirit (Phil. 2:13). Just as the old man obeys the aggregate evil spirit and fulfills the evil will of Satan, the new man follows the leading of the Holy Spirit and fulfills the good will of God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Does not practice sin...and he cannot sin&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:9).</p>
<p>The old man is born in sin, so the old man commits sin spontaneously. In contrast, the new man is born of God, so the new man does not practice sin and cannot sin. The old man is capable of sinning, but the new man is not. According to the nature of the new man, the new man does not sin and cannot sin. Therefore, if we desire to be freed from sins, we must reject the old man and live by the new man. The new man is out of God, not out of sin. Consequently, the new man is not capable of sin and can enable those who live by the life which is out of God to not sin.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;In righteousness and holiness of the reality&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:24).</p>
<p>The old man is deceitful above all things and is evil to the uttermost, but the new man is according to the righteousness and holiness of the reality. The old man is deceitful, but the new man is real, that is, true. The Greek word for <em>reality</em> contains the meaning of both &ldquo;real&rdquo; and &ldquo;true.&rdquo; The old man is evil to the uttermost, but the new man is righteous and holy. Strictly speaking, reality is God Himself, since only God is real (Rom. 3:4). Righteousness refers to God&rsquo;s ways and to the principles of His working. Holiness refers to God&rsquo;s nature, to God Himself. Righteousness and holiness belong to God&rsquo;s reality; consequently, the Bible speaks of &ldquo;righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; In the new man there is the reality of God, or the God of reality. In the new man there is righteousness according to the reality of God, which refers to His ways, and holiness according to the reality of God, which refers to His nature. Since the new man was created not only with God&rsquo;s life but also according to God Himself, the new man has the righteousness and holiness of His reality. Thus, if we want the reality of God and the righteousness and holiness of this reality, we must live by the new man.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;My laws into their mind, and on their hearts&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 8:10; see also 10:16).</p>
<p>In the old man there is nothing good. On the contrary, he is full of every kind of sin. In the new man, however, there is righteousness and holiness and the law of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and goodness. This law is the law of the Spirit of life, which is in us as an all-powerful living law of life (Rom. 8:2). This law does not consist of dead letters; it is strong and powerful, not weak and impotent. Therefore, when we live by the new man, the law of life frees us from the law of sin and of death.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;We love God&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:2).</p>
<p>The old man is at enmity with God, but the new man loves God. The old man is of the devil and obeys the aggregate evil spirit, so the old man is at enmity with God, but the new man is out of God and follows the Holy Spirit, so the new man loves God. We love God only when we live by the new man.</p>
<p>The condition of the new man and the condition of the old man are in utter contrast. The old man is of the devil and has the devil&rsquo;s nature, but the new man is out of God and has God&rsquo;s nature. The old man obeys the aggregate evil spirit, but the new man is led by the Holy Spirit. The old man is born in sin, belongs to sin, and cannot help but sin, but the new man is born of God, does not sin, and cannot sin. The old man is deceitful above all things and evil to the uttermost, but the new man has the righteousness and holiness of the reality. There is nothing good in the old man, but the good, righteous, and holy law of God&rsquo;s life is in the new man. Finally, the old man is at enmity with God, but the new man loves God.</p><h2 class="head2">The New Man Being Christ Abiding in the Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Christ in you&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:27; see also Rom. 8:10; 2 Cor. 13:5).</p>
<p>The old man is out of Adam and in Adam, so the old man is just Adam. Similarly, the new man is out of Christ and in Christ, so the new man is just Christ. The old man is Adam in us, and the new man is Christ in us. Just as the old man in us is Adam, the new man in us is Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:4).</p>
<p>Just as Adam is the life of the old man, Christ is the life of the new man. When we live by the old man, we live by Adam and live out the life of Adam, which is Adam himself, but when we live by the new man, we live by Christ and live out the life of Christ, which is Christ Himself.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Christ who lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>Just as Adam lives in the old man and lives himself out, Christ lives in the new man and lives Himself out. Just as God used the cross to put the old man to death to destroy Adam and the life of Adam within us, God makes the new man alive through Christ to live out Christ and the life of Christ within us. Therefore, the new man living within us is just Christ living within us. When we live in the new man, we live in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS IN CHRIST HAVING<br />
ALREADY PUT OFF THE OLD MAN AND PUT ON CHRIST</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You have put off the old man&rdquo;; &ldquo;The putting off of the body of the flesh&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:9; 2:11).</p>
<p>The believers in Christ have put off the old man because our death with Christ has freed us from the old man, who was crucified with Christ. In Christ we were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, which is the old man. God regards Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross as a circumcision that put off the old man and freed us from our flesh. This circumcision was accomplished by Christ on the cross through His death. It is an accomplished fact. We participate in this fact by faith. When we believed in the Lord and were saved, the Holy Spirit applied this fact to us in Christ. Therefore, we have put off the old man in Christ. May we see this fact. May we see that Christ has freed us from the old man through His death on the cross and that we no longer have to live by the old man. Brothers and sisters, we do not have to live by the old man, because Christ has freed us from the old man.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Have put on the new man&rdquo;; &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:10; Gal. 3:27).</p>
<p>In Christ we not only have been freed from the old man, but we also have put on the new man. Not only has Christ freed us from the old man through death; He also enables us to put on the new man through resurrection. We were included in Christ&rsquo;s death, and we were included in His resurrection as well. We died together with Him, and we resurrected together with Him. His death freed us from the old creation, and His resurrection brought us into the new creation. These are accomplished facts related to His death and resurrection, and because we are in Him, we can partake of these facts. When we received Him as our Savior, the Holy Spirit applied these facts to us in Him. Now His history is our history. Therefore, we have put off the old man and put on the new man. Through our baptism into Him, we have put off the old man in Adam and put on the new man in Christ. Now we can live by the new man instead of the old man. We can live out Christ, not Adam. May God open our eyes to show us this glorious fact that we have received so that we may live by the new man, not by the old man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BATTLE OF THE TWO NATURES</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:17).</p>
<p>The flesh here is the expression of the old man in our fallen being, and the Spirit is the realization of the new man in our regenerated spirit. The Holy Spirit, who is mingled with our regenerated human spirit, is one with the new man. Therefore, the opposition in us between the flesh and the Spirit is equal to a battle between the old man and the new man. Our two natures can be called the old man and the new man. Thus, this verse indicates that there is a battle within us between our two natures, the old and the new. Our two natures oppose each other so that we would not do the things we desire and so that we could obey God, follow God&rsquo;s will, and do the things that are pleasing to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO OVERCOME</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:11).</p>
<p>If we want our new nature to win the battle, we must stand in the fact of our co-death and co-resurrection with Christ by faith in Christ and reckon ourselves dead to sin but living to God. This is to believe and confess the fact of our co-death and co-resurrection with Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;Live by the Spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;Walk... according to the spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;The mind set on the spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4, 6).</p>
<p>It is not enough to believe and confess the fact of our co-death and co-resurrection with Christ; we must walk by the Spirit, live by the Spirit, walk according to the spirit in all things, and set our mind on the spirit. This is to live by the new man and to set our mind on the sense of the new man.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;By the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body&rdquo;; &ldquo;Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:13; Col. 3:5; see also 1 Pet. 2:11; Rom. 13:14).</p>
<p>We must continually put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit through the application of the cross of Christ to our sinning members. This applies the death of Christ to the lusts of our flesh so that we would not live by the old man but by the new man. In this way we can overcome through our living according to our new nature.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THREE KINDS OF LIFE AND FOUR LAWS</h1>
<p>This topic may be unfamiliar to many, but it is based on the clear word of the Bible, and our experience also confirms it. If we want to experience the spiritual life, understand the operation of God&rsquo;s life within us, and live an overcoming life free from sin, we must realize that there are three kinds of life and four laws that affect our living. This is a very important truth in the Bible, but we can only cover it briefly in this chapter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE PARTS OF MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Spirit&mdash;Including the Conscience,<br />
Intuition, and Fellowship;<br />
Soul&mdash;Including the Mind, Emotion, and Will;<br />
Body&mdash;Including All Its Members</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:23).</p>
<p>The Bible clearly states that man has three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body. This verse does not say &ldquo;spirit-soul&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;spirit and soul.&rdquo; This shows that our spirit and soul are distinct from each other. In God&rsquo;s eyes a complete man has a spirit and soul and body. All three parts&mdash;our spirit, soul, and body&mdash;need to be preserved so that our whole being can be sanctified.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 4:12).</p>
<p>The soul and spirit are distinct because the Bible clearly says that they can be divided. A footnote in Darby&rsquo;s translation says that <em>dividing</em> refers to &ldquo;the sense of dividing between each pair of objects and not of dividing each of the things by itself.&rdquo; In addition to speaking of the soul and spirit in Hebrews 4:12, Paul also refers to joints and marrow. Joints and marrow are related to the body. Therefore, this verse confirms that man has three parts&mdash;spirit and soul and body.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 2:7).</p>
<p>In the beginning, when God formed man, He made man with three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body. God formed a physical body for man out of the dust of the ground. Then He breathed the breath of life into man&rsquo;s nostrils. When the breath of life entered into man&rsquo;s body, the spirit of man was formed within him (Zech. 12:1). As a result of this breathing, man became a living soul. Therefore, in the beginning God created a tripartite being with a spirit, soul, and body.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might&rdquo;</strong> (Deut. 6:5).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of loving God with our whole being. If man loves God wholly, he needs to love God with all his heart, all his soul, and all his might. <em>Heart</em> is related to the spirit, <em>soul</em> is related to the soul, and <em>might</em> is related to the body. Loving God with all our heart, all our soul, and all our might means to love God with our spirit, soul, and body. Loving God with our spirit, soul, and body is the way to love God with our whole being, because our spirit, soul, and body represent the totality of our being. Thus, this verse shows that our whole being consists of spirit, soul, and body.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 1:46-47).</p>
<p>Our soul magnifies the Lord, and our spirit exults in God. Our soul magnifies the Lord because our spirit exults in God. This verse also shows that our soul and spirit are distinct. According to the Bible, our spirit is our most inward part. It is the means by which we contact God and touch the spiritual realm. Our spirit involves the functions of conscience, intuition, and fellowship. Conscience is related to knowing what is right and wrong according to God. It reveals the things that God approves and disapproves of; it supports what God justifies, and it exposes what He condemns. Intuition is related to a direct sense of God&rsquo;s will. We do not have to rely upon outward circumstances in order to know God&rsquo;s will because of the function of the intuition. Fellowship is related to contacting God. The body, our outermost part, is related to outward actions and to contacting things in the physical realm. The soul, the inward part between our spirit and our body, is the place of our personality, or self. It is the organ for us to contact the psychological realm. It includes the mind, emotion, and will. The mind is related to thinking and reasoning; the emotion is related to feelings, such as happiness, anger, sadness, and joy; and the will is related to planning and deciding. The mind, emotion, and will are functions of our soul. According to human psychology, the soul is the metaphysical aspect of man, the invisible, essential part of man, and the body is the physical aspect of man, the visible, material part of man. Consequently, psychology divides man into only two parts, a metaphysical part, which is the soul, and a physical part, which is the body. However, the Bible reveals that there is another part of man in addition to the soul and the body. This part is our spirit. Although the soul is an inward part of man, there is another part, an innermost part, which is the spirit. The spirit is man&rsquo;s innermost part, the body is man&rsquo;s outermost part, and the soul is situated between the body and the spirit. Man is a being with a spirit, soul, and body.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE KINDS OF LIFE IN THE GARDEN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Adam&mdash;Representing Man;<br />
the Tree of Life&mdash;Referring to God;<br />
and the Tree of the Knowledge<br />
of Good and Evil&mdash;Referring to Satan</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden...and there He put the man...the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 2:8-9).</p>
<p>After God formed Adam out of the dust of the ground, He placed him before two trees in the garden of Eden. One tree was the tree of life, and the other was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. According to the Bible, these two trees have symbolic meaning. The tree of life refers to God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil refers to Satan. Adam represents man. Therefore, the picture of Adam and the two trees symbolizes that man stands before both God and Satan. In the garden there was man, God, and Satan, and even in the universe now, there is man, God, and Satan. In the garden the created life of man was good, the uncreated life of God was divine, and the fallen life of Satan was corrupted. The Bible speaks of Satan as God&rsquo;s enemy, and it reveals that there is a struggle between Satan and God over man. Both Satan and God want to gain man. God wants to gain man to accomplish His purpose, and Satan wants to gain man to destroy God&rsquo;s purpose. God gains man by giving him His uncreated, divine life, causing man to be one with Him. Satan gains man by injecting his fallen, corrupted life into man, causing man to be fallen and corrupted.</p>
<p>Man has three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body, and in the universe there are three kinds of life&mdash;the good created life of man, the uncreated divine life of God, and the fallen corrupted life of Satan. God desires to impart His uncreated life into man, and Satan wants to inject his fallen life into man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE GREAT EVENTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Creation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God created man in His own image&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 1:27).</p>
<p>Every believer is related to three great events. The first event is creation. Every man has been created by God in His image and according to His likeness. Apart from God&rsquo;s creation, man would not exist. God&rsquo;s creation is the first great event in the history of man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Fall</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Through one man sin entered into the world&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:12).</p>
<p>The second great event in the history of man is the fall. Man was created but he became fallen. With Adam there was a great fall, and sin entered into the world and into all of mankind through Adam. Every man has sin because every man is in Adam. When Adam fell, we fell. We were created by God, but we became fallen through Adam.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:19).</p>
<p>Through the disobedience of one man, Adam, the many, that is, all mankind, fell and became sinners. We do not need to commit a sin in order to be a sinner. We became sinners when we fell in Adam long ago.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Through one offense unto condemnation to all men&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:18).</p>
<p>All of mankind has been condemned because of Adam&rsquo;s one offense in the garden of Eden. We have not been condemned because of the sins we have committed but because of the one offense of Adam. As men in Adam, we share in his fall and in his condemnation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Salvation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:19).</p>
<p>The third great event in the history of man is salvation. Every believer is related not only to God&rsquo;s creation and to Adam&rsquo;s fall but also to Christ&rsquo;s salvation. Although we were created and then fell, we were also saved. After being created by God, we became fallen in Adam, but then we were joined to Christ through His salvation. From God we passed through Adam into Christ. By passing through Adam we became fallen, and by entering into Christ we were saved. Just as the disobedience of Adam made all who are in him sinners, the obedience of Christ made all who are in Him righteous. Just as we fell in Adam, we were saved in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:18).</p>
<p>We were condemned to death in Adam because of his one offense in the garden, and we have been justified unto life in Christ because of His one righteous act on the cross. Just as Adam&rsquo;s one offense caused all men to be condemned to death as sinners, Christ&rsquo;s one righteous act caused all men in Him to be justified to life as righteous. We fell in Adam, and we were saved in Christ. Salvation is the third great event in the history of a believer.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE KINDS OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Life of Man, Received through Creation, Being Good and Upright</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Everything that He had made...was very good&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 1:31).</p>
<p>In each of the three great events in the history of a believer&mdash;creation, the fall, and salvation&mdash;a different life was received. Each event is related to a different life.</p>
<p>At the time of creation, man received a life that was good and upright. Following His creation, God saw that everything He had made, including man, was very good. Therefore, the created life that we received from God was good. It was not corrupted or evil.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;God made man upright&rdquo;</strong> (Eccl. 7:29).</p>
<p>Since God made man upright, the created life of man was certainly upright. When man was created, the life that he received from God was upright, not crooked. This created life, however, is not the same as the uncreated life of God; it is only the good and upright life that God had created.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Life of Satan, Received through the Fall, Being Corrupt and Evil</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:44).</p>
<p>Through the fall we received the satanic life, which is the fallen life of Satan. This life is the same in element as Satan. It is corrupted, evil, and full of every kind of sin. It includes the seed of corruption and the element of sin.</p>
<p>In Adam&rsquo;s fall, the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil entered into his being. Since the tree of the knowledge of good and evil refers to Satan, the life of Satan entered into man. The indwelling life of the devil has been within man from the time that Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Consequently, everyone who has been born in Adam also has the devil&rsquo;s life. For this reason the Lord said that they were of the devil and that the devil was their father. The Lord&rsquo;s word to the Jews indicates that we are all fallen human beings who have been born of the devil. With the devil&rsquo;s life, every human being wants to do the desires of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning&rdquo;; &ldquo;Children of the devil&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:8, 10).</p>
<p>Fallen people sin, and this proves that they are of the devil, have the life of the devil, and are one in nature with the devil because the devil is the one who has sinned from the beginning. We have the devil&rsquo;s life because we are born of the devil. We are children of the devil, and the devil is our father. Just as children have the life and nature of their father, fallen man has the life and nature of the devil. We like what the devil likes and want to do the desires of the devil because we have the devil&rsquo;s life and nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Life of God, Received through Salvation, Being Divine and Eternal</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:15, see also v. 36).</p>
<p>Through salvation we have received the uncreated life of God. Since unbelievers are related only to the history of the creation and the fall, they have only the created human life and the corrupt satanic life. However, believers have a history of salvation in addition to creation and the fall. Therefore, we not only have the created human life and the fallen satanic life but also the uncreated divine life. When we believed into and received the Lord, we obtained God&rsquo;s uncreated life because the Holy Spirit brings God&rsquo;s life into us. This life is divine and eternal. All the riches of God&rsquo;s fullness are in this life because it is the life of God Himself. Everyone who believes into the Lord and is saved obtains the divine, eternal life of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:12).</p>
<p>In His Son God&rsquo;s life can be received and obtained by man. When man receives the Son of God, he receives the life of God. Therefore, he who has the Son of God has the life, which is the uncreated life of God. This life is in addition to the human life, which we received through creation, and the satanic life, which we obtained through the fall. We received another life when we received the Son of God by faith. Now there are three kinds of life within us.</p>
<p>The Bible clearly shows that at the time of man&rsquo;s creation, he had only one kind of life, the created human life. He was simple and did not know sin, and he had no feeling of shame. He was naive. But after the fall, Satan&rsquo;s fallen, corrupted life entered into him. This brought in a great complication because the corrupted satanic life was added to his good created life. Therefore, man not only has a good and proper nature but also a corrupted and evil nature. This can be compared to adding poison to a glass of pure water, which corrupts the original element of the pure water.</p>
<p>Every person is complicated in this way. On the one hand, man desires to be good and upright, but on the other hand, he does things that are corrupt and evil. He wants to be good, but at the same time he has evil desires. People have at least two different kinds of life within them: the good, created human life and the corrupted, fallen satanic life.</p>
<p>After the fall, every human being has two different kinds of life with two different natures&mdash;one that is essentially good and the other that is essentially evil. Throughout the centuries some have realized that there is an element of good within man, and they have emphasized this aspect of man&rsquo;s nature. At the same time others have realized that there is an element of evil within man, and they speak of this aspect of man&rsquo;s nature. From ancient times until today there has been considerable debate over whether man&rsquo;s nature is good or evil. There is no need to debate this question, because there is both a good nature and an evil nature within fallen man. Every man has two natures because he has received two kinds of life&mdash;the created human life and the fallen satanic life.</p>
<p>When we fell, the life of Satan entered into us, and his life was mixed with our human life. Through this event, Satan acted upon his evil desire to destroy God&rsquo;s purpose for humanity. He injected himself into man, causing man to be corrupted through the mixture of his evil life with man&rsquo;s human life. What is in Satan is in man as well. Man&rsquo;s corrupt and evil nature expresses Satan&rsquo;s corrupt and evil nature. Therefore, man has become complicated through a change in his constitution. We not only have the human element, but we also have the satanic element. In this regard, every human being has been infected with a devilish element. It is possible to see this devilish element in every human being. Even though we have the outward appearance of a man, we also have the flavor of the devil. While the gentleness of a man can express his good nature, his gentleness can easily be overcome by his temper, which expresses the devil. Man also commits every kind of sin, exposing the devilish element in his being. When a man acts uprightly, his good human nature is expressed, but when he sins, his corrupted devilish nature is revealed.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a person who sins and lives a devilish life does not act this way willingly. Those who lose their temper, dance, gamble, smoke, and drink all act against their will. The devilish life within them works mischief and causes them to follow these evil desires. They have a devilish living because they have the devil&rsquo;s life. However, it is also possible for them to live a proper human life because they have the good and upright created human life. Because man has both the human life and the satanic life, his living can express the good elements of the created human life and also express the corrupted elements of the fallen satanic life.</p>
<p>As a believer, however, we should praise and thank God that we have the divine life in addition to the human life and the satanic life. Just as Satan injected his life into us through his corruption, God imparted His life into us through His salvation. The entrance of Satan&rsquo;s life into us was the entrance of Satan into us, along with his evil and vile nature, to accomplish his evil intention of damaging us. In contrast, the entrance of God&rsquo;s life into us was the entrance of God Himself into us, which imparted His holiness and goodness, to accomplish His good intention of gaining us. Today we not only have Satan&rsquo;s life and nature, but we also have God&rsquo;s life and nature.</p>
<p>Consequently, our inward constitution is even more complicated than that of an unbeliever. We have three kinds of life within us&mdash;the human life, the satanic life, and the divine life. This means that we can express man, Satan, and God. Our condition is no different from the condition of Adam in the garden of Eden. It is as if our being is a small garden of Eden in which man, God, and Satan are present. Thus, the struggle between God and Satan over man in the garden of Eden continues in us today. Satan is working in us to fulfill his evil intention to destroy our usefulness to God, and God is also working in us to cause us to cooperate with Him to accomplish His purpose. If we live according to the life of Satan within us, we will express his corrupt and evil life and cause his evil intention toward us to be fulfilled. If we live according to the divine life within us, we will express God&rsquo;s holy and righteous life and cause His will to be accomplished in us. Although it may seem as if we are living merely according to our human life with no influence from Satan&rsquo;s life or God&rsquo;s life, this is not true. We cannot live the human life independent from these two other lives because our human flesh has been mixed with the satanic life, and our human spirit has been mingled with the divine life. Consequently, if we are not living our human life by God&rsquo;s life, we are living it by Satan&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>A Christian experientially knows that he has three different kinds of life. In the morning a brother can be nice and express the capacity that man has for good. At noon, however, he can lose his temper with his wife and express the satanic life. But after praying in the evening, he may be enlightened about his offense, confess to God, apologize to his wife, and thus express the divine life of God. In just one day he can express each of the three kinds of life within him. When he is nice in the morning, he is like a man; when he loses his temper at noon, he is like a devil; and when he deals with his sin in the evening, he manifests the likeness of God. In one day he has expressed the life and nature of his created humanity, Satan, and God. This is possible because the life of all three&mdash;man, Satan, and God&mdash;are in him. When he lives by the human life, he has the appearance of a man. When he acts by the satanic life, he has the appearance of a devil, and when he moves by the divine life, he manifests the appearance of God.</p>
<p>We must see that there are three different kinds of life within every believer: the created human life, the fallen satanic life, and the uncreated divine life. Even though we obtained these three kinds of life at different times and through different means, these three kinds of life are in us. We obtained the human life at the time of creation through God&rsquo;s creation. We obtained the satanic life at the time of the fall through Adam&rsquo;s contact with Satan and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We obtained the divine life at the time of our salvation by believing into and receiving the Son of God. Through these three great events&mdash;creation, the fall, and salvation&mdash;we have three different kinds of life&mdash;the life of man, of Satan, and of God. If we see and know this, we can be clear about the way of life. The lives of man, Satan, and God are in us, and our living is a matter of which life is the source of our living&mdash;the human life, the satanic life, or the divine life. Even though the life that we live determines the kind of living that we express, the way of the divine life is available to us as believers.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR LAWS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Law of God&mdash;the Law of the Old Testament</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The law of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:22, 25).</p>
<p>Romans 7 and 8 speak of four different laws. The first law is the law of God, which is the law of the Old Testament. This is the law written by God on the stone tablets that were given to Moses. It enables man to know what God justifies and what He condemns.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I did not know sin except through the law&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:7, see also v. 12).</p>
<p>The law of God causes us to know sin. Without the outward law of God, we would not know what is sin in God&rsquo;s eyes. The law of God is holy, righteous, and good. When we act against the holy, righteous, and good demands of the law, it condemns us and causes us to know sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Law of Good in Our Mind&mdash;<br />
Being Related to the Human Life and<br />
Being in Man&rsquo;s Soul</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The law with me who wills to do the good...the law of my mind&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:21, 23).</p>
<p>In addition to speaking of the law of God, Romans 7 and 8 speak of three additional laws. These three laws are within us because they are related to the three kinds of life that we have within us. Every life operates according to a law. While there are many laws that are not related to life, every life has a law. Since there are three different kinds of life in us, there are three different laws operating in us. Each of these laws corresponds to one of the kinds of life within us.</p>
<p>The law of good is related to our good, created human life. Romans 7:23 refers to this law as &ldquo;the law of my mind.&rdquo; This law is related to our soul because our mind is a part of the soul. This law is good because it comes out of the good and upright human life that God created. It operates through our mind and causes us to will to do good.</p>
<p>The law of good in our mind is not something that is received through salvation. Since this law comes out of our created human life, every person is born with this law. This is proven by human experience. Before we even believed in the Lord, we had the thought and desire to do good. For example, we had the desire to honor our parents and to be kind to others. When we failed, we would be sad and resolve to improve ourselves. Every thought related to doing good and to improving ourselves comes from the law of good which operates in our mind. Therefore, this law is the law of our created life, not a gift in God&rsquo;s plan of salvation.</p>
<p>According to Romans 7:18, which begins with the phrase <em>I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells,</em> some teach that there is nothing good in us, either before or after our salvation. They say this because they do not see that this law is related to our original created life. If we read this phrase carefully, however, we will see that this interpretation is not accurate. According to the truth, the part of our being in which nothing good dwells is our flesh, not our mind, which is part of the soul. According to the context of the word in verse 18 and the general context of verses 21 through 24, <em>flesh</em> refers to our fallen and transmuted body. In our flesh, that is, in our fallen and transmuted body, there is nothing good. Nevertheless, this does not mean that there is nothing good related to fallen human beings. On the contrary, verses 21 though 23 clearly indicate that even fallen human beings have a desire and a will to do good according to the law of good in their mind. Both our desire and our thoughts are related to the soul. Although there is nothing good in our fallen and transmuted body, there is still an element of good in us which is proven by our soul&rsquo;s desire and the thought of good in our mind after the fall. This element of good is related to our good created life. Thus, the law of good in our mind comes out of our good created life, which we received when we were born.</p>
<p>Some say that our good created life was corrupted by the fall to the point that there is no longer any element of good in it. This concept is inaccurate. Although our good created life was corrupted through the fall, even to the point that it cannot be healed, this is the most that can be said in this regard. Even though our good element was corrupted and stained, it still exists. According to Romans 7, there is still an element of good in our mind and in our desires. Moreover, after the fall, there is an element of good in our conscience, even if it is very weak. Our condition can be compared to a glass of sugar water that has been corrupted with a sour ingredient. Although the sweet taste has been corrupted, the element of sugar still exists and still provides a trace of sweetness. Although the fall has corrupted the element of good in our mind, this element has not been eliminated. There is still a tendency toward good, according to the law of good in our mind. This tendency still exists even if it is not strong. This tendency is within every created and fallen human being. Our conscience corresponds to the law of good, which is expressed through our mind as the desire to do good. According to Chinese philosophers, this tendency in man has been associated with the terms <em>bright virtue, the knowledge of good,</em> and the <em>bright innerheart.</em> The considerations of the Chinese philosophers related to the element of good in our human nature fit the true condition of our human nature.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;With the mind I myself serve the law of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:25).</p>
<p>We serve the law of God with our mind because the law of good in our mind causes us to desire to be according to the outward law that is good. The law of God is compatible with the law of good in our mind. The outward law of God places good demands upon us, and the law of good in our mind responds to the outward law by causing us to desire to do good. Thus, our mind serves the outward law of God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Law of Sin in Our Members&mdash;<br />
Being Related to the Satanic Life and<br />
Being in Man&rsquo;s Body</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me...I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:21, 23).</p>
<p>If we had only the law of good in our mind, we would be able to successfully serve the law of God. However, we have another law within us that is contrary to the law of good in our mind. This law is in our members, that is, in our body. This law steadfastly opposes the law of good in our mind and prevents us from doing good in accord with the law of good in our mind. Rather than doing good, this stronger law causes us to follow the evil lusts in our members. This law is related to Satan&rsquo;s fallen, evil life.</p>
<p>When man fell, the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was taken into the human body. Thus, the fallen, evil life of Satan entered into man&rsquo;s body, becoming &ldquo;the evil&rdquo; that operates as the law of sin in his members. Although the evil life of Satan entered the body, it spontaneously invaded the soul and affected the human spirit. The body is the base of the operation of Satan&rsquo;s evil life, but this life also damaged the other parts of man&rsquo;s being. The life of Satan corrupts man by moving from the outermost part (the body) toward the innermost part (the spirit). However, the life of God saves man by spreading from the innermost part (the spirit) to the outermost part (the body). Every incident of sinning begins with the operation of the law of sin in our members, our body. Whenever the law of good in our mind causes us to desire to do good, the law of sin in our members wars against this law of good and makes us captive to the law of sin. When we desire to do good, the evil that is present with us prevents us from doing the good that we desire. Consequently, rather than doing good, we do evil.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells...If what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:18, 20).</p>
<p>The human body that God created was pure and without sin. When the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was taken into man&rsquo;s body, Satan&rsquo;s evil life was mixed with man&rsquo;s body, and it became evil and sin in man&rsquo;s body. This transmuted man&rsquo;s body into the flesh. According to its narrowest definition, <em>flesh</em> refers to our fallen and transmuted body. However, the Bible also refers to fallen humanity itself as flesh (3:20; Gal. 2:16). Humanity is referred to as flesh because all of humanity is controlled by the flesh and is completely of the flesh. Our body contains the evil life of Satan, which is a sinful life and even sin itself. Therefore, in our flesh, our transmuted body, nothing good dwells; instead, there is only the evil element of Satan&rsquo;s life. The evil life of Satan is a law that causes us to sin. It originates from the flesh of our transmuted body, and it has an automatic corrupting power, which captures us and makes us do what we do not will to do.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;With the flesh, the law of sin&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:25).</p>
<p>Because the flesh was formed by the transmutation of our body though its mixture with the evil life of Satan, our flesh spontaneously serves the law that is related to this evil satanic life. This law is called the law of sin. The evil satanic life was mixed with the human life in our body, making it the flesh and corrupting it with a law that makes us sin. Consequently, our flesh serves this law and practices sin.</p>
<p>There are two opposing laws within every fallen human being. The first law is related to man&rsquo;s good created life, and it operates in the mind of our soul and creates a desire within us to match the outward law of God. The second law is related to the evil, fallen satanic life that operates in the members of our body and causes us to sin. The desires of our mind and the actions of our members are in opposition to each other because they are related to opposing laws. Our mind serves the good law of God, but our flesh serves the evil law of sin. These laws are in opposition to each other because they are related to two different laws which come out of two different kinds of life. Of these two laws, one is good and the other is evil; thus, the relationship of one toward the other is a relationship of opposition and even war. The good human life has a tendency toward good and constantly desires to do good. The fallen satanic life has a tendency toward evil and constantly causes us to do evil. The fallen satanic life always defeats the desires of our good human life. As a result, we do not do the good that we desire but instead practice the evil that we do not will to do.</p>
<p>Chinese philosophers call the struggle between these two laws the battle between reason and lust. They equate the element of good in our created life with reason, and the sin that dwells in our fallen body is equated with the lust of our flesh. The reasonings that either accuse and excuse are reflections of our conscience (2:15), but they operate through our mind. Thus, the good that our mind desires to work out passes through the faculty of reason. The lust that is related to our fallen nature is in our members; it operates in our body, working out the evil that comes from lust. A person with a strong faculty of reason tends more toward what is good, whereas a person who is easily influenced by his lust tends more toward what is evil. Every good action of man is supported by the reasoning faculty of his mind, and every evil action of man is instigated by the lusts in his members. When the reason in man&rsquo;s mind temporarily prevails, it causes man to do good, but when the lust in man&rsquo;s flesh ultimately wins, it causes man to do evil.</p>
<p>This battle between reason and lust is the basis of the warfare between the law of good and the law of sin that is mentioned in Romans 7. No person can escape this warfare; it is a consequence of our human birth. The warfare between the evil, fallen satanic life and the good created life in us did not begin only after we were saved, and it is not the struggle between the flesh and the spirit that is spoken of in Galatians 5. This inner warfare is present in all people, even those who are not saved. This struggle between good and evil is the common experience of all people.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, the reasonings in our mind directed our desires toward what is good, but the lust in our members conquered these reasonings, making us unable to work out the good and causing us instead to do the evil that is disapproved of in our mind. This is the condition of every person in the world. Even though a man&rsquo;s reasoning clearly warns him of the dangers of gambling, his lusts override his good reasonings, and he continues to gamble. This lust, which causes people to disobey the reason in their minds, is particularly evident among opium smokers. Every person who smokes opium at some point has no desire to smoke opium and even determines to not smoke opium, but the lust in his members, which is the addiction to opium in his body, causes him to disobey his reasonings and to continue to satisfy his craving for opium. It is rare for an opium addict to pass up an opportunity to smoke opium. It is almost impossible for an addict to obey the reasonings in his mind and overcome the power of his addiction. As a result, the lust in his members is victorious. We do evil things that go against reason and that are contrary to our will because there is a law of sin in our members in addition to the law of good in our mind. We can desire to do good and even decide to do good because the law of good operates in our mind. However, we often go against our will because there is a law of sin operating in our members. Consequently, even though we will to do good, we cannot practice the good that we will.</p><h2 class="head2">The Law of the Spirit of Life in Our Spirit&mdash;<br />
Being Related to the Divine Life and<br />
Being in Man&rsquo;s Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>Unbelievers only know the law of good and the law of sin because they have only the good, created human life and the evil, fallen satanic life. However, every believer also has the uncreated, divine life of God. Therefore, there is another law in us that comes out of the divine life of God. This third law is the law of the Spirit of life spoken of in Romans 8:2.</p>
<p>This law is called the law of the Spirit of life because this law comes out of the Spirit of God, who is life. The Spirit of life is equal to the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God is the Spirit of life because the life of God cannot be separated from the Spirit. Therefore, this law is related to the Spirit of God, who is life. It is not only related to God&rsquo;s Spirit but also to God&rsquo;s life. Since this law is related to God&rsquo;s Spirit, it is also the law of the Spirit of life. This law of life is a spiritual law.</p>
<p>The Spirit of life imparts God&rsquo;s life into us and also abides in our spirit. The law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit, not in our soul like the law of good or in our body like the law of sin. The law that is related to the Spirit of God is in our human spirit. Its source is the Spirit, and its location is our spirit. Thus, its operation is fully a matter of being in spirit.</p>
<p>In its divine and eternal aspects, the life of God is the only life in the universe that can truly be counted as life. Therefore, the Bible says that if man does not have the life of God, he does not have life (1 John 5:12; John 6:53). Furthermore, the Bible also speaks of the life of God as the unique life (1:4). These verses prove that only the life of God is really life. Only the life of God truly has the nature of life. The nature of every other life cannot truly be counted as life. Therefore, the life that is contained in the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit comes out of the life of God, and its nature is life. It is not like the life that is good according to our created human nature or the life that is evil according to our fallen satanic nature.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to this matter. The nature of the life that produces the law of the Spirit of life is life. According to the teaching of the Bible, life and good are different. Although life is good, good is not life. Although what comes out of life is good, what is good is not necessarily out of life. The difference between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden adequately manifests this point. The tree of life stood apart from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This indicates that life is not only separate from evil but also different from good. Just as life is apart from evil, it is apart from good. Therefore, the Bible shows that life, good, and evil are three different things. Each stands alone.</p>
<p>Just as there is a distinction between the life of God and the life of man, there is a distinction between the good of God and the good of man. The good of God comes out of God&rsquo;s life, but the good of man comes out of man&rsquo;s life. The good that is spoken of in Ephesians 2:10 and 2 Timothy 2:21 is the good that comes from living out the life of God. It is the good that comes out of the life of God. In contrast, the good that is spoken of in Matthew 12:35, Romans 7:18-21, and 9:11 is the good that comes out of man&rsquo;s human life. The good that comes out of our human life is according to our human nature, which does not have the true nature of life, that is, God&rsquo;s life. Only the good that comes out of God&rsquo;s life is the good of God because only this good has the nature and element of God&rsquo;s life. Therefore, the good of God and the good of man are not the same. Man&rsquo;s good comes out of man&rsquo;s life and does not have the nature of the divine life. God&rsquo;s good comes out God&rsquo;s life and has the nature of God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>In the universe there is good, evil, and life. Good is related to the good created humanity. Evil is related to the evil one, Satan, and life is related to God, who is the unique source of life. When we speak of good throughout the remainder of this section, however, we are speaking of the good that is associated with created man. When we speak of evil, we are speaking of the evil one, Satan; when we speak of life, we are speaking of the God of life.</p>
<p>Man, Satan, and God, respectively, are good, evil, and life. Therefore, the nature of the life of man, Satan, and God, respectively, is good, evil, and life. Since the nature of each of these lives is different, each life has a law and the function of each law is different. The function of each law is based on its nature. The law that is related to our good human nature causes us to desire to do good. The law that is related to our evil satanic nature causes us to do evil and to sin. The law that is related to God&rsquo;s eternal divine nature causes us to live out the life of God.</p>
<p>Every believer has the nature of man (good), Satan (evil), and God (life). Within each of these three natures, there is a different kind of life, each with a different law. We have three kinds of life with three kinds of natures and three kinds of law. We have the law of good, which comes out of the good nature of our human life, the law of sin, which comes out of the evil nature of the satanic life, and the law of the Spirit of life, which comes out of the divine nature of God&rsquo;s eternal life. Moreover, we have the capacity to express the good that is present in the human life, the evil that is present in the satanic life, and the life that is present in God&rsquo;s life. Each of these different kind of lives, natures, and laws correspond to one of the three parts of our being&mdash;our spirit, soul, and body. The law of good is present in our soul, the law of sin is present in our body, and the law of the Spirit of life is present in our spirit.</p>
<p>There are three different persons, three different lives, three different laws, and three different natures&mdash;life, good, and evil&mdash;within the spirit, soul, and body of a believer. Each part of our tripartite being is related to a different person, life, law, and nature. As a consequence, there is a different set of motivations in each part of our being and a possibility of expressing three different kinds of people, each of whom can live out a different nature. A believer who lives according to his soul can express the things of his good human nature. A believer who follows the lusts of his flesh can express the things of his fallen satanic nature, and a believer who walks by the spirit can express the things of God&rsquo;s divine nature as a God-man who lives out God. Thus, if we live according to our soul, that is, according to our mind and the faculty of reason in our mind, the most we can be is a person who desires to do good. If we live according to our body, that is, according to our flesh and its lusts, we will be a person who does evil. But if we live according to our spirit, that is, according to the Holy Spirit and according to God, we will be a God-man who is full of life and who lives out the life of God.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, most people think that it is sufficient to be good, that is, to live according to the good reasonings of our mind, rather than to be evil, that is, to live according to the lusts of the flesh. They think that it is sufficient to be good rather than evil. However, God wants something more. God wants us to be a person of life, a God-man, who lives out God as life. It is not enough to be a good person. It is not enough to refrain from evil and do good. We must be a God-man. The proper standard of our living is to live out the life of God. In order to do this, we cannot live by our flesh or our soul; we must live by the Spirit. Similarly, our goal should not be focused on avoiding evil or even on doing good; our goal should be focused on living the life of God. We can be a God-man, living according to the Spirit of life only if we live according to the Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>Chinese philosophers promote the development of one&rsquo;s &ldquo;bright virtue&rdquo; by using &ldquo;knowledge of the good&rdquo; as a means to improve one&rsquo;s condition. Even though these efforts have some usefulness in a human sense, they are not compatible with God&rsquo;s way of salvation. God&rsquo;s way of salvation is much higher. God&rsquo;s way of salvation does not involve self-improvement based on developing the good element in our human nature in order to live out our human goodness. Instead, God&rsquo;s salvation involves the impartation of His Spirit of life into our spirit, enabling our innermost part to respond to the law of the Spirit of life so that we can live by God&rsquo;s life and become God-men who flow out God&rsquo;s life because we are full of God&rsquo;s life. Although God&rsquo;s way of salvation will eventually renew every part of our spirit and soul&mdash;our conscience, intuition, and fellowship and our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;it begins with the impartation of His Spirit of life into our spirit and gradually renews every part of our soul. This process of renewal does not involve improving our good but corrupted, human nature; rather, it involves living according to the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit, which frees us from Satan&rsquo;s evil life in order to live out God&rsquo;s life. This is not a work of human improvement but a salvation in life. Human work can only be focused on improving our natural goodness; it cannot bring God&rsquo;s life into us for our salvation. At the most, human improvement can brighten our &ldquo;bright virtue,&rdquo; improve our &ldquo;knowledge of the good,&rdquo; and expand the &ldquo;brightness of our inner heart.&rdquo; Even if we could attain to the highest peak of human goodness, it would not compare to the standard of God&rsquo;s holy nature. God&rsquo;s way of salvation does not employ works to enable us to live according to the standard of human goodness. Instead, it employs the operation of the law of the Spirit of life to enable us to live out His life. This is to live in God and to live Him out.</p>
<p>A law is a natural principle and a natural power. Therefore, the three laws within us involve a natural principle and a natural power. The law of good in our mind is a natural principle, and according to its natural power, it causes us to desire to do good. Since this natural law in our mind desires to do good, our will spontaneously determines to do the good that our mind desires. Neither this desire nor the determination to do good is forced upon us; they are spontaneous reactions related to our good human nature. The law of sin in our members is also a natural principle, and according to its natural power, it causes us to sin. Since this natural law in our members causes us to sin, our flesh sins spontaneously. Likewise, our sinful responses to our lustful flesh are not forced upon us; they are spontaneous reactions related to our sinful, satanic nature. Lastly, the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit is a natural principle, and according to its natural power, it causes us to live out the life of God. Since there is a natural law in our spirit, our spirit spontaneously lives out God&rsquo;s life. This living also is neither forced nor difficult. In summary, if we live according to our mind, we will spontaneously desire and decide to do good. If we live according to our flesh, we will spontaneously sin. But if we live according to our spirit, we will spontaneously live out the life of God.</p>
<p>The power of each law differs according to the strength or weakness of its respective nature. Some laws are stronger than other laws. Romans 7 and 8 show that the law of sin in our members is stronger than the law of good in our mind because the law of sin always defeats the desires and determinations of the law of good in our mind. However, the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit is stronger than the law of sin in our members because the law of the Spirit of life can free us from the law of sin. Thus, each of the laws in us is different in strength because they are related to three different kinds of life, each of which has a different level of strength. Of the three kinds of life, the human life is the weakest. Therefore, the law of good related to the human life is also the weakest law. The satanic life is stronger than the human life. Therefore, the law of sin is stronger than the law of good, and it is able to conquer the weaker law of good. However, the life of God is the strongest life. Consequently, the law of the Spirit of life is the strongest law, and it can conquer the law of sin, which is stronger than the law of good.</p>
<p>The power of a law cannot be controlled by behavior; it can be controlled only by a law of greater power. Our behavior, such as the determinations of our mind or the strivings of our will, cannot control the power of the law of sin in our members. We can conquer the law of sin only by relying on the power of the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit. If we try to control the law of sin through determinations and strivings, we may be successful for a while, but the constant operation and power of the law of sin will eventually defeat us. A more powerful law, the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit, is the only thing that can spontaneously and constantly free us from the law of sin in our members. If we strive to conquer sin according to the reasonings in our mind, we will fail and fall into a wretched condition (7:24). However, if we live in our spirit and follow the law of the Spirit of life, we will be freed from the law of sin and live according to the life of God (8:2).</p>
<p>In summary, the Bible speaks of four laws in relation to the believers. One law is outside of us, and the other three are within us. The law of God given to Moses is outside of us; the other three laws are within our soul, body, and spirit respectively. The law in our soul comes from our good created human life; this law is good and causes us to desire to do good. The law in our body comes from the evil, fallen satanic life; this law is evil and causes us to sin. The law in our spirit comes from the divine, uncreated life of God; this law is divine and causes us to live out God&rsquo;s divine life.</p>
<p>The law of God outside of us represents His holy, righteous, and good demands. When the law of good in our soul touches this holy, righteous, and good law, it places demands upon us. The law of good in our mind immediately and positively responds to this demand by determining to fulfill the law of God. But when the law of good in our soul tries to fulfill the holy demands of the law of God, the law of sin in our body opposes, resists, and conquers the law of good in our soul. Consequently, we cannot fulfill the holy, righteous, and good demands of the law of God. Instead, we break the law of God because the law of sin in our body is stronger than the law of good in our soul. However, the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit is stronger than the law of good in our soul and the law of sin in our body. When we turn to our spirit and live by the Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit frees us from the law of sin in our body and causes us to live out God&rsquo;s divine life. This law not only enables us to fulfill the holy and good demands of the outward law of God; it brings us up to the divine standard of God Himself.</p>
<p>According to the law of God, we should not covet (7:7). When the law of good in our soul considers this outward demand, it immediately responds with both the desire and the determination to no longer covet. However, the law of sin in our body immediately rises up to resist this good desire, and it causes the sin of covetousness to rise up even stronger within us so that we cannot fulfill this demand of God&rsquo;s law. No matter how much we strive, we cannot rid ourselves of the indwelling sin that produces covetousness. On the contrary, the more we strive to not covet, the more our covetousness will be manifested. Whenever the law of good in our soul responds to the demands of the outward law of God by desiring to do good, the law of sin in our body stirs up the evil within us to resist this desire to do good. The law of good in our soul is no match for the law of sin in our body. In every battle between these two laws, the law of good in our soul inevitably loses to the law of sin in our body. But thanks be to God for the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit. This law is stronger than the law of sin in our body, and it frees us from that law of sin (v. 25; 8:2). If we do not strive to do good according to the law of good in our soul but instead cooperate with the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit, we will be freed from the bondage of covetousness that is stirred up by the law of sin in our body. Thus, we fulfill the demands of the outward law of God and live out the surpassing holiness of God.</p>
<p>We should clearly see that the outward law of God places demands upon us, and that the inward law of good in our soul desires to fulfill these demands. However, the law of sin in our body comes between these two laws&mdash;the law of God outside of us and the law of good in our soul&mdash;to prevent the law of good in our soul from fulfilling the demands of the law of God. Just as our body surrounds our soul, the law of sin in our body surrounds and defeats the law of good in our soul. Therefore, it is impossible for the law of good in our soul to overcome the law of sin in our body to fulfill the demands of the law of God. However, the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit is stronger than everything. It can overcome the law of sin in our body and release us from its control so that we can fulfill and even exceed the demands of the law of God.</p>
<p>The outward law of God is like a proper man who asks a pure and simple woman to marry him. The law of good in our mind is like the woman who agrees to his proposal. However, the law of sin in our body is like an evil man who is able to influence her to not only reject the proposal of the proper man but also to follow him in his evil ways. The law of the Spirit of life in our spirit, however, is like an angel who saves the woman from the evil man so that she might accept the proposal of the proper man. In her acceptance, she also realizes that the angel corresponds with the proper man so that she now has the power to follow the proper man.</p>
<p>Although the outward law of God places demands on us, it has no power to enable us to fulfill its demands because of the weakness of our flesh (v. 3). The law of good in our mind desires to fulfill the demands of the law of God, but it has no power to overcome the law of sin. The law of sin is always lurking behind the law of good. When it sees the law of good in the mind incline toward fulfilling the demands of the law of God, it stirs up trouble in our flesh so that the law of good cannot prevail. Only the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit can prevail; it is the source of God&rsquo;s salvation. Its power comes from the life of God, and it can free us from the law of sin, enabling us to fulfill the demands of the law of God in us and live out the divine life.</p>
<p>This is God&rsquo;s way of salvation. Those who try to improve themselves have no awareness of this process. Throughout the ages, those who want to improve themselves have focused on outwardly mistreating their body in an effort to restrain its influence or by inwardly determining to do good. God&rsquo;s way of salvation does not involve dealing with the sin in our body or by strengthening our will to do good in our soul. Instead, His work of salvation begins by imparting the Spirit of life into our innermost part, our spirit, which progressively spreads to the faculties of our soul and even to our mortal body (vv. 6, 11). Our salvation is not dependent upon dealing with our sinful body or on strengthening our will; it is dependent upon living in the spirit and cooperating with the law of the Spirit of life.</p><h2 class="head1">SINS AND THE SECRET<br />
OF BEING FREED FROM SIN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Setting the Mind on the Flesh<br />
Resulting in Sins because of the Law of Sin<br />
in the Flesh</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be. And those who are in the flesh cannot please God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:7-8).</p>
<p>In each of our three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;there is a different life and a different law with a different operation. When our living comes out of a certain part, the law of the life of that part causes us to live out the nature of its life. Of our three parts, only the body is indwelt with the evil satanic life. Our body sins, and it is a body of sin because it has been mixed with Satan&rsquo;s evil life (which is sin). Consequently, the law of sin comes out of this life. Romans 6:6 clearly refers to our body as &ldquo;the body of sin.&rdquo; Furthermore, sin brings in death. Thus, Romans 7:24 also refers to our body as &ldquo;the body of this death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have mentioned previously that our body was transmuted into the flesh because of its mixture with the evil life of Satan. Therefore, if we live by the flesh, the life of Satan will cause us to sin. When we set our mind on the flesh and walk by the flesh, we spontaneously sin. This is an experiential fact. Since the sinful life of Satan dwells in the flesh and operates according to a law that causes people to sin, when we live in the flesh and set our mind on the flesh, the law of sin causes us to oppose, contradict, and offend God. According to the Bible, the mind set on the flesh is enmity with God because it is not subject to the law of God and cannot be subject to it. Furthermore, those who set their mind on the flesh, who are in the flesh, cannot please God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;That which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:3).</p>
<p>The outward law of God places demands on us to act according to God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and goodness. This law, however, is weak through our flesh; that is, it cannot help us attain to the holiness, righteousness, and goodness that it proclaims. Our flesh is full of the evil life of Satan, which frustrates us from matching the outward standard of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and goodness. Therefore, the flesh prevents the law from enabling us to reach the standard of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and goodness. If we live by the flesh, we will do things that are contrary to the holiness, righteousness, and goodness of the law, making the law weak through the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;If you live according to the flesh, you must die&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:13).</p>
<p>If we live according to the flesh, we will not only sin but also die. Sin brings in death, and death follows sin. Wherever there is sin, there will be death. Sin corrupts us, and death weakens us. The ultimate expression of weakness is death. If we live according to the flesh, we will not only be corrupted by sin but also invaded by death to the extent that we will be dirtied, weakened, condemned, and ultimately deadened. On the one hand, we will be condemned, and on the other hand, we will taste death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Setting the Mind on the Spirit<br />
Resulting in Freedom from Sin<br />
because of the Law of the Spirit of Life<br />
in the Human Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me...from the law of sin and of death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>Although the body causes us to sin because the law of sin is in our body, we also have two other parts&mdash;the soul and the spirit. However, only the operation of the law in one of these parts can free us from the power of sin. This part is our human spirit, not our soul. The life in our soul cannot free us from the life that produces sin, because the good, created human life in our soul was corrupted by Satan and stained by sin due to the fall. Although our soul still has the good element of its created human nature, it was stained and corrupted by Satan and his sinful life. Consequently, it is weak and powerless against sin. Although the law of good in our soul comes out of our good, created life, this life is weak, impotent, and incapable of freeing us from sin. Consequently, this law cannot free us from sin. The law of good in our soul is related to the weakest of the three kinds of life, the created human life, and it cannot overcome the stronger life of Satan. The law in our fallen soul, even though it is related to our good, created life, cannot free us from the power of sin.</p>
<p>Of our spirit, soul, and body, freedom from sin can come only from our human spirit because the law of the Spirit of life is in the spirit. It is divine and strong. Only it can overcome the law of sin in our body. The law of the Spirit of life comes out of God&rsquo;s life, which is the strongest and most powerful life. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s Spirit is the base and even the application of this law. This law is in our spirit. If we set our mind on the spirit and live by the spirit, this law will rule from our spirit with its power of salvation and free us from the bondage of sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:6).</p>
<p>God saves us from sin through the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of life is in our spirit and one with our spirit. Thus, if we want to be free from sin, we must set our mind on the spirit and live in the spirit. When we set our mind on the spirit and live in the spirit, the Spirit of life within us manifests its divine power, freeing us from sin and empowering us to live out God&rsquo;s divine life. Thus, we are filled with life and peace, which is to be filled with satisfaction and rest.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who...walk...according to the spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:4).</p>
<p>When we set our mind on the spirit and live according to the spirit, the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit brings us into a living that lives out the holiness, righteousness and goodness of God. This fulfills the righteous requirement that the law of God places upon us. We cannot fulfill the righteous requirement of the law if we set our mind on the flesh and live by the flesh. When we set our mind on the spirit and live according to the spirit, we are freed from sin on the negative side, and we can fulfill the righteous demands of the law of God on the positive side.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;If by the Spirit...you will live&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:13).</p>
<p>When we set our mind on the flesh and live by the flesh, we not only sin but also die. In the same way, when we set our mind on the spirit and live according to the spirit, we are righteous and also live. Just as sin brings in death, righteousness brings in life. Just as sin brings in death and weakens us, life brings in righteousness and strengthens us. When we follow the Spirit and live according to the Spirit, we are not only freed from sin and live out righteousness, but we are also kept from the weakness of death through the strength of life. We are kept from death and weakness by being freed from sin, and we gain life and strength by living out righteousness. We must follow the spirit and live by the spirit in order to obtain righteousness and life.</p>
<p>Whether we sin or enjoy freedom from sin depends on whether our mind is set on the flesh or on the spirit. If we set our mind on the flesh and live according to the flesh, the law of sin in our body will cause us to sin. If we set our mind on the spirit and live according to the spirit, the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit will free us from sin. The secret of being free from sin is to set our mind on the spirit and follow the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit. We should not focus on the law of good in our soul or even be concerned about the law of sin in our body. It is sufficient to live according to the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit. This is not a matter of striving or struggling to do good or reject evil; it requires us only to live in our spirit and to follow the spirit.</p>
<p>If our will is set on doing good and strives to reject evil, we will not be freed from sin. On the contrary, we will be hindered from living in the spirit and trapped in a pitiful condition; we will be impotent in doing good and powerless to reject evil. Therefore, we should not focus on trying to do good, just as we should not focus on rejecting things that are sinful and evil. Doing good should not be the goal of our living, just as avoiding evil should also not be the focus of our living. We should focus our attention on living in the spirit and following the spirit. We should have no other goal than God and His life. Our only desire should be to live out God and His life. This requires us to live by the life of God, not by our human life or by the satanic life in us.</p>
<p>In order to live according to God&rsquo;s life, we must not live in our soul or in our flesh. We should live in our spirit and follow the spirit because God&rsquo;s life is in our spirit. If we live in spirit and follow the Spirit, we will live out the life of God, not the life of our fallen satanic nature or the life of our good, created human nature. As a consequence, our living will not be out of either the evil life of Satan or the good life of man. Instead, we will live out the life of God. When we live out God and His life from our spirit, we are one with God and God is one with us. In this union with God, we are freed from the law of sin that binds us in our members. This is the secret to being freed from sin. This is the secret of overcoming.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Walk...according to the spirit...the mind set on the spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:4-6).</p>
<p>We need to be responsible to cooperate with God according to His way of salvation. If we do not cooperate, our experience of God&rsquo;s salvation will be incomplete. Our first responsibility is to believe in Christ and in the redemption that He accomplished for us. When we believe, the Spirit of life is imparted into our spirit; this is the initiation of our salvation. After receiving the Spirit in our spirit, we must bear the responsibility to cooperate with the Spirit to experience the reality of our salvation. We must cooperate by walking according to the spirit and setting our mind on the spirit. Since we are one in spirit with the Spirit of life, we must bear the responsibility of walking according to our spirit and setting our mind on the spirit so that the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit can spontaneously enable us to live out the life of God.</p>
<p>We must learn not to be distracted by a life that is according to the flesh or according to the soul in order to bear this responsibility. We must not be distracted by either good or evil or by striving to do good. It is true that living according to the flesh hinders us from following the spirit and setting our mind on the spirit, but living according to our soul also hinders us from following the spirit and setting our mind on the spirit. Both our tendency to do evil and our desire to do good frustrate us from walking according to the Spirit of life in our spirit. There is truly no difference between the actions of the soul and the actions of the flesh in terms of their ability to hinder us from walking according to the spirit, setting our mind on the spirit, and living according to the Spirit of life in our spirit. We must not be distracted by the determinations of our soul or the inclinations of our flesh in order to turn to the spirit and live according to the law of the Spirit of life in the spirit. We should live absolutely in spirit and follow the spirit, set our mind on the spirit, and follow every sense that comes out of the operation of the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit. This is the responsibility that we must bear in order to be freed from sin and to overcome. It is also the responsibility that we must bear in order to live a normal Christian life.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;By the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:13).</p>
<p>As we live in the spirit and follow the spirit, we must also bear the responsibility to put to death the practices of the body, which are the practices of the flesh. Since we live in the spirit, there should be no place for the practices of the body. Every practice of the body, whether good or bad, interrupts our living in spirit and makes us unable to live according to the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit; therefore, we must put these practices to death with the cross by the Holy Spirit. This is a responsibility that we must bear if we want to live an overcoming life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">UNION WITH CHRIST</h1>
<p>Although we have covered some items related to our union with Christ in other chapters, it is a very important topic that needs to be covered in more detail in this chapter. I hope we would pay adequate attention to this truth.</p>
<p>The goal of God&rsquo;s work is to work Himself into man and to work man into Himself so that we would be joined as one with Him. Our union with God is in Christ and through Christ. Therefore, when we speak of our union with God, we are also speaking of our union with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S UNION WITH US</h2>
<p>In order for us to be in union with God, He first had to be in union with us, that is, with man. He came to be in union with us through His being in Christ (2 Cor. 5:19; Col. 2:9). Christ is the manifestation of God; consequently, Christ&rsquo;s coming to be in union with us is equal to God&rsquo;s coming to be in union with us. Christ&rsquo;s union with man can be seen in four matters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In His Incarnation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:14).</p>
<p>The Word became flesh and tabernacled among men. Since the Word was God, the Word becoming flesh is God becoming flesh. God became flesh in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. Christ is God manifested in the flesh to be in union with man (1 Tim. 3:16). Since human beings are flesh, His becoming flesh means that He became one of us, that is, a man. He took on our human nature and partook of our human nature to be in union with us (Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:7-8).</p>
<p>Christ is God, and He had the form of God (v. 6), but in order to be in union with us, He emptied Himself and lowered Himself, taking the form of a human slave, becoming in the likeness of men to be found in fashion as a man. He became one with man in form and nature.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;In the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:3).</p>
<p>When Christ was incarnated to be in union with us, He did not come in the likeness of created man. Rather, He came in the likeness of fallen man, which was man in the likeness of the flesh of sin, that is, the likeness of the man who had been invaded by sin and mixed with sin. He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin. This reveals that when Christ was incarnated to be in union with man, it was with the intention of being one with fallen man. His humanity was in the likeness of fallen humanity.</p>
<p>Although the likeness that He bore was the same as our fallen likeness, we need to be clear that when Christ was incarnated, He did not have the reality of sin, even though He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin. He was incarnated in the <em>likeness</em> of the flesh of sin in order to be like us, but He did not have the reality of our sin. In His incarnation He had the likeness of the flesh of sin outwardly, but He did not have the reality of sin inwardly (Heb. 4:15). This truth is seen in the type of the bronze serpent in the Old Testament. The bronze serpent, which had the likeness of a poisonous snake outwardly but not the poison of the snake inwardly, typified Christ being in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Num. 21:6-9; John 3:14). In His incarnation, Christ was completely one with us in all things except for sin. The incarnation was the initiation of His union with us. He entered into humanity and put on humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Our Believing</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 1:15-16).</p>
<p>When we believed in and received Christ as our Savior, God revealed His Son, Christ, in us through His Spirit. Therefore, when we believed, Christ entered into a union with us personally. He entered into a union with us through the Spirit. Although He entered into union with humanity at His incarnation, He entered into a personal and practical union with us when we believed into Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Our Salvation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jesus Christ is in you&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:5; see also Rom. 8:10).</p>
<p>Christ entered into us when we believed. Through our initial salvation, He is in us. After He enters into us, He abides in us through His union with us. When He enters into us through our believing, He is joined to us and can never be separated from us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Christ...is powerful in you&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:3).</p>
<p>After we are saved, Christ not only remains in us and is joined to us, but He also wants to manifest His power so that we might experience and enjoy His power.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Christ...lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>Christ is in union with us and manifests His power in us by being our life. He remains in us as our life so that we might experience and enjoy His power. Thus, He lives in us and is in union with us to the extent that He is our life, living for us and causing us to live.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Until Christ is formed in you&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 4:19).</p>
<p>Christ is in union with us not only to live in us as our life but also to be formed in us so that He can become our inward element of life, completely changing us into His likeness.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:17).</p>
<p>There are many verses in the New Testament that speak of Christ being in us and even living in us, but this verse is the only portion that speaks of Christ making His home in our <em>hearts.</em> Christ desires to live in us and be in union with us to such an extent that our hearts would be full of His living and His love. This speaks of a deep union with Him in our love and emotion.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;I in you...I in him&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:4-5).</p>
<p>Christ is in us, and in this union He abides in us as our inward content of life and as our outward expression of life so that He might become our everything. This can be compared to the vine being everything to its branches in its union with the branches.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;We will come to him and make an abode with him&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:23).</p>
<p>This verse shows that Christ&rsquo;s abiding with us to be our everything is equal to the Father and the Son making an abode with us and being in union with us to be our everything. Since Christ is the embodiment of God and is one with God (John 10:30), He is in God and God is in Him (14:10). Therefore, His being in union with us to be our everything is God being in union with us to be our everything.</p><h2 class="head2">In Eternity</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Its lamp is the Lamb&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:23).</p>
<p>When we believed, Christ entered into us and entered into union with us. He will be in union with us for eternity in the new heaven and new earth after the millennial kingdom. In eternity future, in the eternity of the new heaven and new earth, Christ will be in union with us, and this union will attain to a most glorious peak. Revelation 21 says that the Lamb, Christ, will be the lamp of the city, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be a marvelous entity, composed of God and all the saved ones throughout the ages. As the lamp, Christ will be in union with His redeemed ones for eternity. God will be the light, and Christ will be the lamp, shining out the light of God through the believers in our union with Him. God will shine His light out through Christ, and Christ will shine His light out from us. This will be the highest peak of His glorious union with us. This union will be an eternal union that never ends.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR UNION WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>We can be in union with Christ because He is in union with us. If Christ were not in union with us, we would have no way to be in union with Him. Since He is in union with us, we can enter into union with Him. There are seven aspects of our union with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Union with Christ in His Crucifixion</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<p>Christ, who did not know sin, was made sin by God on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. <em>Him who did not know sin</em> refers to Christ, and <em>sin</em> refers to us. We are not simply sinners who commit sins, we are sin. From God&rsquo;s point of view, we are sin. We became sin because sin entered into us. Thus, our sins and wickedness are the issue of the sin that dwells in us (Rom. 7:17-20). This can be compared to tea leaves being added to water. When tea leaves are added to hot water, the water turns into tea, and when a person drinks the water, he also drinks the tea. This is illustrated also by the experience of the children of Israel when they were bitten by poisonous serpents in the wilderness. When the poisonous element of the serpents entered them, they became serpents in God&rsquo;s eyes. In His judgment of the situation, God commanded that a bronze serpent in the likeness of a serpent be hung upon a pole (Num. 21:6-9). Just as a bronze serpent was hung upon a pole to bear God&rsquo;s judgment on the children of Israel, Christ became sin for us and was hung upon a tree to bear God&rsquo;s judgment for us. Christ&rsquo;s being made sin on the cross was His full identification with us since we are sin. In doing this, He entered into union with us sinners in order to bear our judgment so that we might enter into union with Him.</p>
<p>We are sin, but Christ is righteousness, even the righteousness of God. Therefore, just as Christ became sin by entering into union with us on the cross, we become righteousness by entering into union with Christ in His crucifixion. We have even become the righteousness of God in Christ. He entered into union with us and became sin for us, bearing God&rsquo;s condemnation and judgment so that we could enter into union with Him and become the righteousness of God in Him, being justified by God and becoming pleasing to God. This is God&rsquo;s way of salvation. God&rsquo;s way of salvation is for Christ to be in union with us, to become us and even to become sin, so that we could enter into union with Christ to become the righteousness of God in Christ. This does not mean that we traded positions with Christ in God&rsquo;s salvation, that is, that Christ became sin and that we became righteousness. If this were the case, Christ and we would not be in union&mdash;nor would we need to be in union&mdash;we would merely be in different positions with respect to righteousness and sin. This is not God&rsquo;s way of salvation. His way of salvation is to join Christ to us so that we can be joined to Christ. To accomplish this, Christ entered into a union with us in order to receive God&rsquo;s judgment for our sins. Furthermore, we entered into a union with Christ in order to receive God&rsquo;s righteousness in Him. He entered into union with us in order for us to be in union with Him so that we could become one with Him. Since we are sin, He entered into a union with us on the cross when He was made sin on our behalf, and since He is the righteousness of God, we entered into union with Him in His crucifixion when we became the righteousness of God in Him.</p>
<p>Christ entered into union with us when He was made sin on our behalf, and we entered into union with Him by becoming the righteousness of God. These are the accomplishments of Christ related to the cross. Although His union with us began at His incarnation, our union with Him did not begin until after He bore our sins on the cross. His bearing of our sins was His full union with us. He entered into union with us first on the cross, and then we entered into union with Him. After He bore our sins, we were able to enter into union with Him, having been made the righteousness of God in Him, which caused us to be well accepted by God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20; see also 6:14).</p>
<p>This verse confirms that we were crucified with Christ. Therefore, we are in union with Christ in His crucifixion. Since we are in union with Him, His crucifixion is our crucifixion. When He was crucified, we were crucified.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>Our old man is the old I or our old self. When Christ was crucified, our old man, our old self, was crucified. We do not need to crucify ourselves; we have already been crucified with Christ. His crucifixion is our crucifixion because we are in union with Him. We were crucified with Him in His crucifixion.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You died with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:20).</p>
<p>Since we are in union with Christ and have been crucified with Him, we have died with Christ. When Christ died on the cross, we died on the cross with Him since we are in union with Him. According to the revelation of the Bible, our union with Christ began at His crucifixion. After Christ was crucified, we could enter into union with Him. His death is our death, and His dying is our dying.</p><h2 class="head2">Union with Christ in His Resurrection</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Raised us up together with Him&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:6; see also Col. 3:1).</p>
<p>Since we are in union with Christ in His death, we surely are in union with Him in His resurrection. Just as we died together with Him, we were raised together with Him. We died in His death, and we were made alive in His resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know...you in Me&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:19-20).</p>
<p>Christ resurrected, and just as He lives, we also live because we are in Him and are in union with Him. He is living in resurrection, and since we are in Him, we have been resurrected together with Him to live together with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Union with Christ in His Ascension</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:6).</p>
<p>Since we have died and resurrected together with Christ, we surely ascended together with Him. According to this verse, we are seated together with Him in the heavenlies. We are in union with Christ not only in His crucifixion and resurrection but also in His ascension. Because we are in union with Him, we partake not only of His death and resurrection but also of His ascension. His experiences are our history because we are in union with Him. His accomplishments are our gain: His death is our death; His resurrection is our resurrection; and His ascension is our ascension. What He has experienced, we have experienced. What He has attained, we have attained. We are seated in the heavenlies in Him because we are in union with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Union with Christ in Our Believing, Baptism,<br />
and Initial Salvation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16).</p>
<p>When Christ was crucified, resurrected, and ascended, we were in union with Him in reality, but this reality was experientially applied to us when we believed into Him. When we believed into Him, we received Him and also entered into Him. Our receiving is related to receiving Him into us. Our entering into Him is related to our being in Him. Our receiving of Him and our entrance into Him make our union experiential. Our experience of the reality of our union with Christ began when we believed into Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:27; see also Rom. 6:3).</p>
<p>Not only is our believing our entering into Christ to be in union with Him, but our baptism also is our entering into Christ to be in union with Him. Just as believing causes us to enter into Christ, baptism also causes us to enter into Him. Therefore, those who believe and have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Baptized into His death&rdquo;; &ldquo;Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:3; Col. 2:12).</p>
<p>According to spiritual reality, we died and resurrected together with Christ when He died and resurrected, but in our experience, this occurred when we were baptized. We have been baptized into Christ&rsquo;s death and buried together with Him. We also have been raised together with Him. We experienced this death and resurrection together with Christ, however, when we were baptized. When we were baptized, our baptism was a baptism into Christ and into His death. Since we have been buried together with Him, we also have been raised together with Him. We experientially entered into union with Him through our death, burial, and resurrection with Him in baptism.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Made alive together with Him&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:13; see also Eph. 2:5).</p>
<p>When we were saved, God made us alive together with Christ. In our salvation Christ as life was imparted into our spirit through the Spirit. In our salvation our deadened spirit was made alive so that we could be joined as one spirit with Christ in our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>When we were saved, God brought us into union with Christ. When we believed in Christ, God put us into Christ, causing us to partake of Christ and making Christ our wisdom. This wisdom includes righteousness, by which we obtained salvation through justification in the past, sanctification, according to which we can live a sanctified life today, and redemption, which is related to the redemption of our body in the future. When we were saved, God brought us into a union with Christ, making Christ our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. This indicates that in our union with Christ, Christ is everything to us.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>When God puts us into Christ in our salvation, we partake of Christ and enter into union with Him. Thus, we receive the element of Christ, which is the element of God and the element of the resurrection life. This element makes us a new creation in which the old things have passed away. We become a new creation because we are in Christ and are in union with Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Union with Christ in Our Continuing Salvation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Abide in Him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27, 28; see also John 15:4-7).</p>
<p>When we were saved, God put us into Christ and brought us into union with Christ. Therefore, after we are saved, we should abide in Christ to remain in the experience of our union with Him. When we were saved, we entered into union with Christ by getting into Christ. After we are saved, we need to remain in our union with Christ by abiding in Him. Abiding in Christ is to practically enjoy Christ by taking Him as our life and everything. This is related to the experience of our union with Christ in our living after we are saved.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Your life is hidden with Christ in God&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:3).</p>
<p>When we are saved, we obtain Christ as life and enter into union with Him. After we are saved, we take Christ as our life and continue in our union with Him through His life. This life is hidden with Christ in God, so in this life, we are in union with Him in God. Our spiritual living should be in the life of Christ and in our living in union with Christ in God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Union with Christ in His Return</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:4).</p>
<p>After we are saved, we should live in Christ as our life, continuously experiencing our union with Him until He is manifested in His return. Then we will be manifested with Him in glory and experience a complete and full union with Him. At that time we will not only experience our union in His life but also our union in His glory. Our union with Him will be to such an extent that we will know both His life and His glory experientially. We will flow out His life and His glory.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:20-21).</p>
<p>Our union with Christ begins in our spirit, spreads throughout our soul, and consummates in our body. When we were saved, our spirit received the life of Christ and was joined to Him. The element of Christ should saturate our soul until the day of His return. When He returns, our body will be so saturated with His element that our body will be transfigured to be conformed to the body of His glory. Thus, our union with Him will involve every part of our being&mdash;our spirit and soul and body. From the inside to the outside, our whole being will be saturated with His element and completely in union with Him in His life and glory. Oh, what a union that will be! What a complete union! What a glorious union! May this be our desire.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;If He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:2).</p>
<p>When the Lord is manifested, He will transfigure our bodies, saturating our whole being from the inside to the outside with His element, causing us to be completely in union with Him. Then we will be like Him. We will be in union with Him to the extent that we will be just like Him. When we are thus joined to Him, we will be fully one with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Union with Christ in Eternity</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The bride, the wife of the Lamb...the holy city, Jerusalem&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:9-10, see also vv. 1-2).</p>
<p>In eternity future, we will be the holy city, the New Jerusalem, which is the wife of the Lamb, Christ. We will be in union with Him forever, just as a husband and wife are one flesh (Eph. 5:31-32). In the garden of Eden, Eve was joined to Adam, and the two became one flesh. In the same way, the redeemed ones throughout the ages will be in union with Christ for eternity, and we will be a glorious entity that can never be separated (Matt. 19:6).</p>
<p>God, in His salvation, wants to work on us to such an extent that Christ becomes one with us and we become one with Christ so that Christ and we, we and Christ, would be in complete union. We must see this in order to know the high goal of God&rsquo;s salvation. This is so glorious! God desires that we would be joined to Christ not only in His life and nature but also in His glory. In life, nature, and glory, we and Christ will be completely one in union with each other for eternity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SERVICE OF THE NEW COVENANT</h1>
<p>The service of the new covenant is completely different from the service of the old covenant because of its special characteristics. Therefore, we need to look at the special characteristics of the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS<br />
OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Involving an Inner Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will impart My laws into their mind&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 8:10; see also 10:16).</p>
<p>The new covenant is according to an inner law. This is the first special characteristic. The law of the old covenant was written with letters on stone tablets outside of man, so it was outward and dead. The law of the new covenant is written with life on the tablets of our hearts, so it is inward and living. This inner living law is the life of God. Since each life has a nature and capabilities related to its nature, the nature and capability of the life of God operate within us spontaneously (2 Pet. 1:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Involving an Inner Knowing</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All will know Me&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 8:11).</p>
<p>The new covenant also involves an inner knowing. This is the second special characteristic. This knowledge of God is inward rather than outward. Since the law of the new covenant is within man, the knowledge of God related to the new covenant is also within man. In the old covenant man knew God by the outward law of letters. There was an outward knowledge of God, but it was according to dead letters. In the new covenant man knows God by the inward law of life. This knowledge is inward, and it is according to the living operation of the life of God. Knowledge from outward letters is shallow and weak because it is not related to life, but knowledge that comes from God&rsquo;s inward life is deep and strong.</p>
<p>Inward knowledge does not come out of outward knowledge; it comes out of life. A six-month-old child knows that some herbs are bitter, but sugar is sweet. This knowledge is not based on knowing outward facts but on the reactions of his inward life. Even though the child has no concept of bitter or sweet, his inward life reacts negatively to what is bitter and positively to what is sweet. Similarly, in the new covenant our knowledge of God and the things of God does not come from outward knowledge but from an inner sense of life. Any knowledge that comes from outward knowledge related to our mind will be shallow, weak, and even dead. The inner sense of life, however, will result in a knowledge of God that is deep, strong, and living. This is the kind of knowledge that is spoken of in the second half of Hebrews 8:11.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not According to Man&rsquo;s Teaching</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 8:11).</p>
<p>In the new covenant there is no need for man&rsquo;s teaching. This is the third special characteristic. In the old covenant man needed others to teach him if he wanted to know God. In the new covenant we do not need others to teach us to know God because we all have the law of life that causes us to know God. Man teaches according to outward knowledge, but the knowledge that comes from the law of life replaces and even surpasses man&rsquo;s teaching. We do not need people to teach us to know God because the law of life teaches us inwardly.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>We do not need anyone to teach us to know God, because we have the law of life within, and we also have His anointing within that teaches us concerning all things and causes us to know God. This anointing is the inward operation of the Holy Spirit who indwells us. The Holy Spirit operates as ointment to anoint us inwardly, teaching us to know God in all things. Therefore, we do not need man&rsquo;s teachings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every Believer Being a Priest</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Made us a kingdom, priests to His God&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 1:6; see also 5:10; 1 Pet. 2:9).</p>
<p>In the new covenant every believer is a priest. This is the fourth special characteristic. In the old covenant there were only a few priests among God&rsquo;s people. In the new covenant God wants every believer to be a priest. To be a priest means to serve God. God wants every believer to serve Him because He wants every believer to be a priest. In fallen Catholicism and deformed Christianity, only a few serve God because of the clergy-laity system. This system is very much against the teaching of the new covenant. In the new covenant God wants all His people to serve Him. He wants every believer to be a serving priest without any distinction based on a system of clergy and laity, that is, those who serve God and those who do not serve God. Every believer should serve God because every believer is a priest to God in the new covenant.</p><h2 class="head2">Every Believer Being a Member One of Another</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:5).</p>
<p>In the new covenant the believers are members one of another. This is the fifth special characteristic of the new covenant. Romans begins with our status as sinners and then, step by step, brings us to our status as members who serve in the Body of Christ in Romans 12. The believers who serve God are the Body of Christ, the church, and are members one of another, manifesting their function in the Body. In the old covenant the church was a hidden mystery, but in the new covenant the church has been manifested (Eph. 3:5-10). Therefore, a unique characteristic of the new covenant is that the believers are members one of another in the Body.</p>
<p>In the new covenant God wants the believers in Christ to express Christ throughout the universe as the Body of Christ, which is the church. In the new covenant God wants the members of the Body of Christ to serve Him. We are the Body of Christ and members one of another because we have received the life of Christ. The life of Christ was not available to those under the old covenant; consequently, those under the old covenant could not experience the reality of being the Body of Christ and of being members one of another. This is possible only under the new covenant; therefore, it is a special characteristic of the new covenant.</p>
<p>None of the preceding points were possible under the old covenant. They are realities only in the new covenant. If we want to know the true service of the new covenant, we must understand these five special characteristics. After seeing these five special characteristics, we can see the service of the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2>
<p>The service of the new covenant is based entirely on the special characteristics of the new covenant. With each characteristic of the new covenant, there is a corresponding aspect of service. Consequently, the special characteristics of the new covenant are also the characteristics of the service of the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being according to Ordinances<br />
but according to Life</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 7:16).</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant is not related to ordinances but to life because the law of the new covenant is not according to letters but according to life. The law of letters is dead; the law of life is living. Service according to ordinances is dead, but service according to life is living. Both the law of letters and the service according to ordinances in the old covenant are dead. In contrast, both the law of life and the service according to life in the new covenant are living. Therefore, service in the new covenant has nothing in common with service in the old covenant.</p>
<p>The service of ordinances is according to fixed ordinances. It is rigid and constant, and it does not require any leading. The service of life is according to the sense of life. It is flexible rather than systematic, and it requires the leading of the Lord. In the service of ordinances, there also is no need for fellowship with God; we need only to follow an established ordinance. But in the service of life, we must rely on God and fellowship with God in order to properly serve Him.</p>
<p>The service of ordinances is weak because it has no life. The service of life is strong because it is living. Hebrews 7:16 says that the Lord, as the Priest of the new covenant, is serving God in the new covenant. He does not serve according to weak ordinances but according to the power of an indestructible life. The Lord&rsquo;s service is strong and powerful. The Lord is our Head. Since His service is powerful according to His indestructible life, our service should be the same. Today we do not serve God according to weak and dead ordinances but according to the power of an indestructible life. Therefore, our service also is strong and powerful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being of the Letter but<br />
Being of the Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Not of the letter but of the Spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;In spirit, not in letter&rdquo;; &ldquo;In newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:6; Rom. 2:29; 7:6).</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant is not according to ordinances but according to life, and it is not of the letter but of the Spirit. Ordinances are of the letter, but life is of the Spirit. Not serving according to ordinances means not serving according to the letter. Serving according to life means serving according to the Spirit. The letter of the law is not only dead but also old. The Spirit of life is not only living but also new. Therefore, service according to the letter is dead and old, but service according to the Spirit is living and new. The service of the old covenant is dead and old because it is according to the letter, but the service of the new covenant is living and new because it is according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>The service of the old covenant is based on written regulations, and these written regulations are the letter. Those who served God under the old covenant only had to follow written regulations in order for their service to be proper. Their service according to the letter required neither the inspiration of the Spirit nor the leading of God. Therefore, there was no need to fellowship with God, because everything could be done according to written regulations.</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant is based on the living Spirit. God still wants man to serve Him under the new covenant, but He does not provide written regulations for man. Instead, He puts His Spirit into man and wants man to act according to His Spirit. Therefore, service under the new covenant must be according to the Spirit of God, not according to the letter.</p>
<p>Serving according to the letter means serving according to the regulations of the letter. Such service follows set regulations. In principle, anything that is done in a fixed way, according to rules, or is based on old practices, whether it involves prayer, preaching, or other kinds of service, will be a service that is according to letter. Such service cannot be counted as service in the new covenant. Even service that issues from the inspiration of the Spirit or is carried out in fellowship with God can become a service that is according to the letter if it is not continually carried out through the inspiration of the Spirit in fellowship with God. Any service or work that is old, formal, or ritualistic cannot be counted as new covenant service.</p>
<p>When some Christian groups worship, they read prayers that are printed in a prayer book. The prayers at their weddings, funerals, and other services all come from printed prayer books. These prayers are fully in the realm of the letter, and they cannot be considered as service in the new covenant. Some do not pray from prayer books, but they pray the same prayers every day. These prayers, which are recited like lessons, are completely according to the letter and cannot be considered as service in the new covenant. Similarly, when some preach, they use the same message or copy the words of others, often repeating their words in an old way. This type of preaching, which is set and old, is according to the letter and cannot be considered as service in the new covenant.</p>
<p>Service in the new covenant must be based on the inspiration and leading of the Lord that comes out of fellowship with Him. It must be new and living. This kind of service is not according to set texts or rituals, nor does it have an old and dead flavor. It is from the operation of the Spirit; it is new and living. It causes people to feel the presence of God and to touch God Himself. Our service in both prayer and preaching must be in this way in order to be the new covenant service.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Outward but Inward</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Not...outwardly...but...inwardly&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 2:28-29).</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant is not according to ordinances or letters but according to the power of life and the Spirit. Hence, it is not outward but inward. What is done outwardly is according to ordinances and the letter. It does not require the inward power of life and the inward operation of the Spirit. What is done inwardly is according to the power of life and the Spirit. It requires the inward power of life and the inward operation of the Spirit. Anything done according to ordinances and the letter is only an outward action because it does not require the inward power of life and the inward operation of the Spirit. Anything done according to the power of life and the Spirit is an inward action because it requires the inward power of life and the inward operation of the Spirit. Service that comes from within and is according to the inward power of life and the inward operation of the Spirit is the new covenant service. Service that is based on outward ordinances and the outward letter is not the new covenant service. In nature, such service is according to the old covenant.</p>
<p>Anything that does not require an inward burden, an inward feeling, and an inward supply of life and that does not rely on the power of the inward life, does not pass through prayer, or does not come out of fellowship with God is an outward service in the principle of the old covenant. Furthermore, anything that merely mimics or copies what others do or repeats what has been done in the past without the leading of the Lord is also in the principle of the old covenant. For example, if we pray as another brother prays, preach the gospel as another brother preaches, or even love the brothers as another brother loves the brothers, our actions will only be an outward service.</p>
<p>Inward service requires an inward burden and must come out of the inward operation and inspiration of the Spirit. It must rely on the power of the inward life and pass through prayer and fellowship with God. It must come from the Spirit within us in order to be carried out by God&rsquo;s inward life. God must be our source when we pray, preach the gospel, visit people, or do anything related to service. Only that which comes from our spirit and out of our inward life can be considered as service in the new covenant. Brothers and sisters, we must see that the new covenant service is not outward but inward. May we always remember the principle in Romans 2&mdash;not outwardly but inwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not the Service of a Few but the Service of All</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Brothers,...your reasonable service&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:1).</p>
<p>God wants every believer to serve Him as a priest in the new covenant. Therefore, service in the new covenant does not involve the service of a special few but a service of all the believers, all the brothers. In Romans 12 Paul exhorts the brothers who have received God&rsquo;s salvation to present their bodies to God to serve Him. His exhortation is not directed toward a few gifted brothers; rather, he exhorts all the brothers who have received God&rsquo;s salvation. According to the characteristics of the new covenant today, we realize that serving God is a necessary and reasonable matter for every believer. If we have received God&rsquo;s salvation, we should serve God regardless of the measure of our gift of grace. God desires service from every believer in the new covenant. In principle, service that is limited to a few is not service according to the new covenant but service according to the old covenant. Similarly, any service that does not see a need for the service of others in order to carry it out is related in principle to the old covenant, not the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not the Service of Individuals<br />
but the Service of the Body</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another. And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy...or service...or he who teaches...or he who exhorts...he who gives...he who leads...burning in spirit, serving the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:5-8, 11; see also 1 Cor. 12:4-30; Eph. 4:11-12).</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant is the service not only of all the believers but also of the Body. The believers of the new covenant are the Body of Christ and members one of another in the Body. Therefore, the service of the believers in the new covenant is not individual but corporate. It is not a movement of individuals but a serving of all in coordination. No matter what kind of gift, ministry, or service that we have, we cannot move individually but must serve in coordination with all the saints in the church, the Body of Christ. The service of the new covenant is the service of the Body, and even individually we still are members of the Body. In a physical body the members must coordinate. If a member is separated from the body, it cannot function. Similarly, we must coordinate in the church. If we are not coordinated with the saints in the Body, we should not serve because such service is not in the principle or nature of the new covenant. The service of the new covenant is a coordinated service in the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO HAVE THE SERVICE OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being in Life</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo;; &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:4; Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant is according to life, so if we want to serve according to the new covenant, we must be in life. To be in life is to live by the Lord, not by ourselves. The Lord today is living in us as our life, causing us to live by Him. Whenever we live by ourselves, whenever we live under the law, we cannot be delivered from the service of the law of ordinances. If we want to be delivered from the service of the law of ordinances, we must be delivered from ourselves. If we want to be delivered from ourselves, we must live by the life of the Lord. When we live by the Lord and His life we are delivered from the law of ordinances. When we live by the Lord and His life, we are in the service of the new covenant, which is according to the power of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living by the Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;According to the spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:5; Gal. 5:16).</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant is according to the spirit. If we want to have the service of the new covenant, we must live by the Spirit. To live by the Spirit is to follow the Spirit and to walk according to the Spirit. This cannot be separated from living in the Lord and by the Lord. If we want to live in the Lord and by the Lord, we must live by the Spirit, which is to be according to the spirit and to walk by the Spirit. We can be delivered from letters and ordinances only by living according to the spirit and walking by the Spirit. When we live by the Spirit, we will also be delivered from rigid, old, and dead forms to a fresh, living, spiritual service according to the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living according to an Inward Operation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:13).</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant comes from within, so we must live according to the inward operation of life in order to be in the new covenant service. To live inwardly is to not be according to outward ordinances or outward practices. It is to live according to the inward sense of life and to live according to the inward operation of the Spirit. Therefore, it is the same as living in life and by the Spirit. When we live by the Spirit&rsquo;s inward operation, our willing and our working are according to the operation of God in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every Believer Serving</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Brothers,...present your bodies a living sacrifice...which is your reasonable service&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:1).</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant involves the service of all the believers; therefore, every believer must serve in order for the service of the new covenant to be realized. Consequently, all the brothers and sisters must present themselves as a living sacrifice to work out their ministry as priests to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in the Body</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We who are many are one Body&rdquo;; &ldquo;The members are many, but the body one&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:20).</p>
<p>We must live in the Body in order to have the service of the new covenant because this service is the service of the Body. This requires consecration and a willingness to abandon our individual actions and coordinate with all the saints in the service.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS AND SINS</h1>
<p>Believers who desire to live an overcoming life must see the relationship between the believers and sins. There are many different views concerning this matter; however, we will consider only our relationship to sins, both before and after our salvation, according to the revelation in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STATUS OF SINS COMMITTED<br />
PRIOR TO SALVATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Dealing with Sins Committed<br />
Prior to Salvation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 53:6).</p>
<p>God caused all the sins that we committed prior to our salvation to fall on the Lord Jesus. When the Lord Jesus was judged by God on the cross, He bore all the sins of those who would believe in Him, and He took them away. Therefore, on the cross the Lord dealt with all the sins that we committed prior to our believing in Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:24).</p>
<p>The Lord bore our sins as He hung on the cross because God put our sins onto the Lord Jesus at that time. Therefore, all the sins that we committed before we believed in Christ were borne by Him on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Accounting for Sins Committed<br />
Prior to Salvation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Having forgiven us all our offenses&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:13).</p>
<p>Since God caused the Lord Jesus to bear our sins on the cross and righteously judged Him, He has forgiven us for the sins that we committed prior to our believing because His righteous requirement has been satisfied. He has erased our sins before His righteous law.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I have wiped away, like a thick cloud, your transgressions, / And like a cloud, your sins&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 44:22; see also 43:25).</p>
<p>God has not only forgiven us of our sins but also wiped away our sins because the Lord bore our sins upon the cross. Forgiving erases the record of sin; that is, it eliminates our responsibility to answer for our sins according to God&rsquo;s righteousness. Wiping away removes the trace of sin to the point that it is as if the sins never occurred. The sins that we committed prior to our salvation have been completely wiped away, even though they were like a thick cloud hanging over us. When the Lord Jesus bore our sins, God wiped them away, causing them to disappear as if they had never been committed.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall by no means remember anymore&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:17; see also Jer. 31:34).</p>
<p>Not only does God forgive and wipe away the sins that we committed prior to our salvation; He does not even remember them. Forgiving eliminates the record of sin before the law of God, wiping away removes the trace of sin upon us, and not remembering erases the impression of our sin from God&rsquo;s memory. Our sins have not only been eliminated before God&rsquo;s law and removed from us; they also have been erased from God&rsquo;s memory. God no longer remembers the sins that He has forgiven and wiped away. Now we are not only sinless before the law and sinless in our person; we are also sinless in God&rsquo;s memory. Although it is difficult for us to forget our sins, God forgives us; He does not remember our sins because His forgiving is equal to His forgetting.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;As far as the east is from the west, / So far has He removed our transgressions from us&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 103:12).</p>
<p>God forgives our sins and causes our sins to be removed from us. They are as far away from us as the east is from the west. There is no way to determine the distance between east and west on the earth, because the earth is round. Who can find a fixed starting point for east or a fixed ending point for west? This word in the Bible is marvelous! David spoke this word before people even knew that the earth was round, but even then he did not say that our sins were as far away as north is from south, because for many the earth itself is a fixed starting point. Consequently, if a line was extended north into space, the distance between north and south could be measured. Instead, the Bible says that our sins have been removed as far as the east is from the west, a distance that has no fixed points for measurement and thus cannot be measured. This means that God removes our sins from us to the point that it is impossible to connect us with them.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;You have cast behind Your back / All my sins&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 38:17).</p>
<p>God has cast all our sins behind His back. God cannot see the sins that He has forgiven, because He is a God who does not look back. If a person saw God&rsquo;s face in the Old Testament, he would die. Moses saw only God&rsquo;s back. If God had turned His head, Moses would have died (Exo. 33:20-23). But praise God, He does not turn His head. He does not look back. When He forgives our sins, He throws them behind His back where He does not look.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;He will tread our iniquities underfoot. / And You will cast into the depths of the sea / All their sins&rdquo;</strong> (Micah 7:19).</p>
<p>God treads our iniquities underfoot and casts our sins into the depths of the sea. Treading our iniquities underfoot means that they are beneath His consideration following His forgiveness, and casting them into the sea means that He is unwilling to consider them following His forgiveness. These descriptions in the Bible show that after God&rsquo;s forgiveness and removal of our sins, our previous sins have no part in His consideration of us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ATTITUDE OF BELIEVERS<br />
TOWARD SIN AFTER SALVATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Should we continue in sin that grace may abound? Absolutely not! We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it?&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:1-2).</p>
<p>After salvation, we should have no thought that it is acceptable to sin. Although the grace of God abounds because of sin, we must leave our sins behind and be dead to sin. Since we have been forgiven and saved by God&rsquo;s grace, how can we still live in sin?</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You have become well; sin no more&rdquo;; &ldquo;From now on sin no more&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:14; 8:11).</p>
<p>After our salvation, we should sin no more. This is the Lord&rsquo;s rule and commandment.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed. So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:7-8).</p>
<p>These verses were written with the background of the Passover as a type in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament the Israelites kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread after the Feast of the Passover by purging out any leaven in their environment. Leaven refers to sin and corruption. Therefore, purging out leaven was a type of purging out sin. Christ is our Passover lamb. When we received Him as our redeeming Savior, we kept the Passover, not in type, but in reality. At that time God&rsquo;s judgment and punishment passed over us, and we received God&rsquo;s forgiveness and salvation. From the time of our salvation onward, we should continue to purge out the old leaven, which is to leave the sins and corruption of our former days. We should keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread not with the leaven of malice and evil. We should only have the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. This means that we should not participate in sinful acts but live a life without sin so that we can become a new and holy lump with all the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POSSIBILITY OF BELIEVERS<br />
SINNING AFTER SALVATION</h2>
<p>There are many different views concerning this matter among Christians. Some say that it is not possible for believers to sin after their salvation, and others say that it is possible. However, the only answer that we should receive is the answer that is revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;These things I write to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins&rdquo; </strong>(1 John 2:1).</p>
<p>The first chapter of the first Epistle of John was written to us believers so that we would not sin. Therefore, John&rsquo;s word implies that we still can commit sins after being saved. If this were not possible, there would have been no need for John to write an Epistle to us about not sinning. His writings and teachings prove that we can still sin after our salvation. This is proven by the phrase <em>if anyone sins.</em> This word shows even more clearly that we can still sin after our salvation, even though it was John&rsquo;s hope and desire that we would not sin. According to his thought, it is possible for us to sin after our salvation even though this should be neither intentional nor acceptable. This can be compared to a sheep falling into a pit of mud even though this is neither the intention of the sheep nor the desire of the shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:8).</p>
<p><em>Do not have</em> in the original Greek is in the present tense and refers to our present condition. Thus, if we say that we no longer have sin and cannot sin, we are deceiving ourselves. Although we have God&rsquo;s life, which cannot sin, and His sinless nature, we still have our old sinful nature. Since we still have our sinful nature, we still can sin.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago in Shanghai there was a small group of Christians who were very strong proponents of the idea that Christians could not sin after they were saved. They further believed that those who sinned after their salvation had not been truly saved. One day five brothers from this group bought four tickets to a park. Four brothers used these four tickets and went into the park, but then one brother came out with two tickets and gave the second ticket to the brother who was still outside so that he could enter the park as well. This raised a question in the mind of one of the brothers. He thought, &ldquo;Is it not a sin to sneak a person into the park in this way? We say that believers cannot sin, but if this is not sin, what is it?&rdquo; When he asked the others, they said that it was not a sin but only a little weakness. This answer clearly showed that they were deceiving themselves. Their answer caused the brother to realize that their understanding was not according to the truth. This shows that even brothers who say that believers cannot sin after being saved can sin. Rather than admitting this, however, they deceive themselves.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:10).</p>
<p>If we say that we have not sinned after our salvation, we not only deceive ourselves but also make God a liar because we can sin and have sinned as a consequence of our sinful nature, which we still have after our salvation.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, looking to yourself lest you also be tempted&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 6:1).</p>
<p>The apostle&rsquo;s word in this verse is spoken to brothers, to saved ones. <em>If a man is overtaken in some offense</em> means that there is the possibility of stumbling and sinning. Furthermore, the apostle says that believers should be careful when they seek to restore a stumbled, sinning brother lest they also be tempted. For example, there was a brother who wanted to restore a brother who had fallen into going to movies. He wanted to help the brother forsake movies, but when he heard the brother talk about the latest films that he had seen, he was tempted and went to the movie theater with the brother who needed to be restored. The apostle&rsquo;s word shows that we still can sin after we are saved. Furthermore, it is even possible for those who are spiritual to sin.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:12).</p>
<p>The context of the apostle&rsquo;s word in this verse shows that a believer who thinks he stands is in danger of falling and sinning unless he takes heed. Those who say that a believer cannot sin after believing have not received the apostle&rsquo;s warning that it is possible to fall into sin.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;I have made petition concerning you that your faith would not fail; and you, once you have turned again...Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know Me&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 22:32, 34, see also vv. 54-62).</p>
<p>Peter had faith in the Lord, but he still sinned by denying the Lord three times in front of Him. If Peter could fall in such a way, who is able to not sin after being saved?</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;It is actually reported that there is fornication among you...Deliver such a one...that his spirit may be saved...Anyone who is called a brother&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:1, 5, 11).</p>
<p>In Corinth there was a brother who committed the sin of adultery. Although he was saved, he committed a gross sin. This shows that believers can commit sins after being saved.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Demas has abandoned me, having loved the present age&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:10; see also Col. 4:14; Philem. 24).</p>
<p>Demas, a co-worker with the apostle, loved the world that had been condemned by the Lord and abandoned the apostle. If this is a possibility for a co-worker, how much more is it possible for a believer who has just been saved? This is a strong proof of the great possibility that a believer can stumble and sin after being saved.</p>
<p>The Bible clearly reveals that believers can sin after their salvation. Nevertheless, some may wonder about the meaning of 1 John 3:9, which says, &ldquo;Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin,&rdquo; and of 5:18, which contains the phrase <em>does not sin.</em> Not practicing sin means that we do not sin habitually. This speaks of the nature and habit of regenerated believers. According to nature and habit, those who have the life of God do not practice sin and cannot sin when they live according to God&rsquo;s sinless life. The divine seed of God&rsquo;s life within us does not have the nature or habit of sinning, but this does not mean that it is impossible for us to not stumble or sin. Although we have God&rsquo;s life with its nature and habit of not sinning, we can experience acts of falling and sinning because we can still live according to our old nature. For example, wood floats on water and iron sinks, but if iron is tied to wood, the wood will sink. According to its nature, a pig lives in mud, and according to its nature, a sheep does not live in mud. Nevertheless, a sheep can briefly live like a pig because it can stumble and fall into a pit of mud. If it falls into mud, however, it will not be comfortable, and it will not stay in the mud for very long because it is not its nature or habit to roll around in mud. Similarly, sinning is not in our new nature or in our habit, even though we can fall into sin if we are not careful.</p>
<p>We must realize that believers have two natures, one that is new and one that is old. Our new nature comes from the life that we obtained in Christ. The old nature comes from the life we had in Adam. Although our new nature is separate from sin and cannot sin, our old nature is sin and can sin. Since believers have two natures, the apostle John speaks of the consequences of living according to our old nature in 1 John 2:1 and of the consequences of living according to our new nature, which we received when we were begotten of God, in 1 John 3:9 and 5:18. When he writes concerning sin in chapters 3 and 5, he has not forgotten what he has written in chapter 2. His words in chapters 3 and 5 are related to our new nature, which cannot sin, rather than to our old nature, which can still commit acts of sin. Thus, the teaching in his Epistle shows that believers can sin after being saved but that they should not sin.</p><h2 class="head1">THE IMPACT OF SIN<br />
ON A BELIEVER&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>Although there are many views concerning whether or not a believer who sins after being saved is truly saved, we must see what is the truth according to the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:5).</p>
<p>In this verse the apostle clearly indicates that a believer who sins after being saved can suffer punishment and loss but that he also will not lose his salvation. Sins do not result in the loss of our eternal salvation, even if we experience God&rsquo;s discipline and punishment. Paul says that the sinful brother in Corinth should be delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh as a punishment so that his spirit and soul could be recovered and saved in the day of the Lord. Sins committed after our salvation do not result in eternal perdition but they can result in suffering in this age.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Eternal salvation&rdquo;; &ldquo;By no means perish forever&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 5:9; John 10:28).</p>
<p>The Lord accomplished an eternal salvation for us. Furthermore, the Lord Himself is the source of our eternal salvation. Therefore, when we received the Lord and His salvation, we received an eternal salvation. The Lord&rsquo;s life is also eternal. Consequently, when we obtained His life, He said that we would by no means perish forever. According to the Lord&rsquo;s clear and assured word, we will by no means perish forever once we are saved. We should not allow any other opinion, even our own, to cause us to be concerned that committing sin after our salvation will result in our eternal perdition. The Bible speaks of eternal salvation. Therefore, we should believe that we are eternally saved. The Lord said, &ldquo;By no means perish forever.&rdquo; Therefore, we should acknowledge that we will by no means perish forever.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that many people teach that a believer will perish if he sins after being saved. They base this teaching mainly on Hebrews 6:1-8 and 10:25-31. This teaching, which is based on an improper understanding of these verses, openly contradicts the word of the Lord that a person who believes in the Lord and receives the Lord&rsquo;s eternal life will by no means perish forever. This teaching is not according to the principles of the Bible and the nature of the Lord&rsquo;s eternal salvation. The word of the Bible does not contradict itself. The Bible would not say that those who believe are eternally saved and will by no means perish forever and later say that a believer is no longer saved and will perish if he sins. The Bible does not speak of a believer perishing if he sins; it speaks only of a believer being punished if he sins.</p>
<p>The emphasis in Hebrews 6:1-8 is on the matter of a believer&rsquo;s growth in life after his salvation. When we grow, we can be useful to God and blessed by Him, but if we do not grow and our condition is not proper, we can be punished by God and suffer loss. Growth requires that we leave the word of the beginning of the teaching of Christ&rsquo;s salvation. This beginning involves repentance from dead works and faith in God. Repentance and faith are basic teachings. When we were saved, we received these basic teachings; that is, we repented and believed. If we want to grow, we do not need to return to these basic teachings and lay another foundation. The foundation has been laid. If we stumble, we do not need to repent for the sins that we committed prior to our salvation and believe again. Instead, we should be brought on to maturity (v. 1). If we fall away from the Lord&rsquo;s teaching after we are saved, having been enlightened by God, having tasted of His heavenly grace, having gained His Holy Spirit, having tasted that God is good, and knowing the powers of the age to come, we simply need to get up and go forward. We do not need to return to our initial experience of Christ&rsquo;s salvation and repent of sins that have already been forgiven. We do not need to start over because it is impossible to even do this. After we have repented and believed initially, we do not need to repeat these experiences. Even if we wanted to repent and believe again, this would be an impossibility because God has already forgiven us of those sins. This can be compared to the impossibility of a person being born of his human life a second time. When a person falls, he simply needs to get up from where he fell and go forward from there. He does not need to start from his birth again. Even if he wanted to do this, it would be impossible for him to be born a second time. It is regrettable that many Christians who sin after their salvation think that they need to go back to the position of a new believer by repenting and believing again. When they do this and then fall again, they again try to go back to the beginning to start all over. Since it is possible for believers to commit sins, they are never able to leave the starting point in order to go on and grow to be useful to God. They are like a field that has received so much rain that it grows more thorns and weeds than useful vegetables. This uselessness brings in God&rsquo;s punishment because they have no capacity to be used by God. They are saved, and they will be eternally saved, but they will experience a salvation that must pass through the fire, that is, through punishment that causes suffering and loss. First Corinthians 3:15 speaks of this when it refers to a believer being saved yet so as through fire. A field that grows useless things often is burned, but the field itself is not destroyed. Only the useless things growing in it are burned. Hebrews 6 does not speak about eternal perdition for those who sin after being saved. It speaks about receiving God&rsquo;s punishment for not being brought on to maturity after our salvation.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:25-31 was written to Hebrew believers who were returning to their Jewish background and environment. Although they were Hebrews, Israelites, who had previously worshipped God in the Jewish religion according to the law of the old covenant, they had believed in Jesus and were serving God in the church according to the new covenant. But they also were being persecuted by those in Judaism because of their belief in Christ. They also esteemed the offerings and rituals that God gave to their forefathers in the old covenant. It was very difficult for them to put aside these things, and with the added persecution of Judaism, they were faced with the temptation to return to Judaism to worship God according to the law of the old covenant. Thus, the apostle wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews to tell them that God had annulled the old covenant (8:7, 13). He pointed out that all the offerings in the old covenant were types of Christ. Since Christ came and accomplished an eternal redemption, there was no need for offerings according to the old covenant; the old covenant was over (9:9&mdash;10:18). He charged them not to return to Judaism to worship God with offerings according to the law of the old covenant but to assemble and serve God together with Christians according to the new covenant. Once this truth is known, a believer is willfully sinning when he ceases to assemble and serve with other Christians according to the new covenant and goes back to Judaism with its sacrificial types of Christ&rsquo;s redemption under the old covenant. In effect, he is returning to a covenant that God has ended through the coming of Christ and His redemptive death. Thus, if he goes back to Judaism to worship God with offerings, he will not only lose the new covenant blessing but will also be punished by falling into the hands of the living God (v. 31). Going back to offer the blood of bulls and rams for redemption is also a treading on and a despising of the Son of God, because it treats His blood as something common, like the blood of bulls and rams. Furthermore, abandoning the new covenant insults the Spirit of grace (v. 29) because the Holy Spirit, no doubt, inwardly operates and forbids such a return to Judaism. For this reason, he will receive a worse punishment. This passage in Hebrews 10 does not say that if we willfully sin after being saved, our sins are no longer forgiven, and we are no longer saved; it says that once we know God&rsquo;s will according to His new covenant, we should follow it or be prepared to suffer punishment.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BELIEVERS<br />
WHO SIN AFTER SALVATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:1-2).</p>
<p>If we commit sins after our salvation, we have the Lord Jesus as our Advocate and as the propitiation for our sins. Consequently, we should not be discouraged or lose heart. We can be recovered by the Lord because He Himself is the basis of our propitiation with God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>John spoke this word to believers, not unbelievers. The word <em>cleanses</em> in Greek denotes a continuous cleansing. The blood of the Lord Jesus continually cleanses us from every sin. If we sin after our salvation, we should seek the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is our Advocate before God and also the propitiation for our sins. He is propitiating for us in every situation so that we can be in fellowship with God, and His blood constantly cleanses us. As a consequence of all these matters, we can be cleansed of our sins before God at any time. If we sin, we should confess our sins to God, depending on the Lord Jesus as our Advocate and receiving the constant cleansing of His blood. When we confess our sins, according to His word and based on the Lord&rsquo;s blood, God forgives us of our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness. This is a matter of His faithfulness and righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSEQUENCES FOR BELIEVERS<br />
NOT CONFESSING SINS<br />
AND NOT DEPARTING FROM EVIL</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:10).</p>
<p>As believers, we will be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ to be judged for our living and work. We will receive what we have done through the body according to what we have practiced, whether good or bad. The good will be rewarded and the bad will be punished. Therefore, if we sin after our salvation, we should confess quickly, depart from the sin, and receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness. If we do not, we will be punished when the Lord comes to execute judgment. This punishment is not related to eternal perdition but to the loss of the Lord&rsquo;s reward. All believers are saved, but some will suffer loss (1 Cor. 3:12-15).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Shall be liable&rdquo;; &ldquo;Whose end is to be burned&rdquo;; &ldquo;A certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:22; Heb. 6:8; 10:27).</p>
<p>There are passages in the Bible, such as Matthew 5:22; Hebrews 6:8; and 10:27, which speak of punishment for believers who sin. This punishment will be meted out when the Lord returns. Therefore, according to the teaching of the Bible, if we sin and do not deal with it through confession and by departing from the sin, we will be punished when the Lord returns. Of course, if we sin and deal with it through confession, God will forgive us and not punish us in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POSSIBILITY OF BELIEVERS<br />
AVOIDING SIN AFTER SALVATION</h2>
<p>Since we have examined the question of whether it is possible for believers to sin after salvation, we need to consider whether it is possible for believers to <em>avoid</em> sinning after salvation.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:14).</p>
<p>Even though the Bible speaks of believers sinning after their salvation, it also speaks of believers avoiding sin. It is possible for a believer to sin and also to avoid sin. Avoiding sin is different from being incapable of sinning. A person who can refrain from speaking is different from a mute person who is incapable of speaking. Although the Bible does not speak of believers being incapable of sinning, it does speak of them avoiding sin. After we are saved, we still can sin, but we can also avoid sin.</p>
<p>We can avoid sin because we are not under law but under grace. Under the law means that we are using our own strength to refuse sin, but our strength is insufficient to free us from the bondage of sin. Under God&rsquo;s grace, which is the life of God in Christ and is just God Himself, we can be freed from the bondage of sin in order to avoid sin. Under the grace of God and with God in Christ as our life and power, sin cannot lord it over us; consequently, we can avoid sin.</p><h2 class="head2">Avoiding Sin</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He who has died is justified from sin&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:7).</p>
<p>Only death can enable us to avoid sin because death frees a person from sin. For example, it is difficult for a person who is addicted to opium to break this habit, but when he dies, he is freed from this habit. Therefore, we must die in order to avoid sinning. We do not need to be zealous to do good or strive to refuse sin; we must die in order to avoid sin. The way in which we die is revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>We have already been crucified with Christ. This fact was applied when we were baptized. We do not have to put ourselves to death because we have already died with Christ. We were crucified with Christ on the cross of Christ. We do not have to crucify ourselves; we have been crucified with Christ on the cross. If we see this fact and receive this fact, we can be freed from sin and will be able to avoid sin.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:11).</p>
<p>If we see and receive the fact of our crucifixion with Christ by faith, we can reckon ourselves dead to sin but living to God. When Christ died on the cross, we were included in His death and crucified with Him. In ourselves we are not dead, but in Christ we are dead. Thus, in Christ we can reckon ourselves to be dead. If we look only at ourselves, we are still alive, but if we reckon ourselves in Christ, we will be dead to sin. Therefore, we should not look at ourselves; we should only reckon ourselves in Christ. If we reckon ourselves as being alive, we will be under the bondage of sin and will sin. If we reckon that we are dead in Christ, we will be freed from the authority of sin and able to avoid sin.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Do not let sin therefore reign in your mortal body...but present yourselves...and your members as weapons of righteousness to God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:12-13).</p>
<p>Since we have seen the fact that we have been crucified with Christ and since we reckon ourselves dead in Christ, we should not let sin reign in our mortal bodies or let it have any place in us. We should present ourselves to God and present our members as weapons of righteousness to God. After we have seen and received the fact of our death with Christ, we should consecrate ourselves to God, completely giving ourselves and our bodies to Him. Such a consecration is a declaration to sin that we will not cooperate with it, and it is a declaration to God that we will cooperate with Him. We can take our entire being back from the control of sin and give it to God to let Him rule us and use us. Our death with Christ causes sin to lose its authority over us so that we can be freed from sin, and our resurrection with Christ makes us living to God, causes us to live in God, and gives Him a position in us. Therefore, we can refuse to allow sin to reign in our body, and we can present ourselves and our bodies to God to be completely possessed and gained by Him. If we are willing to reject sin and cooperate to present ourselves to God, we can be freed from the bondage of sin and avoid sin.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>After we see and receive the fact of our death with Christ and consecrate ourselves to God, we should live according to the law of the Spirit of life. The law of the Spirit of life causes us to enjoy the resurrection power of God&rsquo;s life and frees us from the law that makes us sin unto death. Therefore, we must live according to the law of the Spirit of life in order to avoid sin.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Walk...according to the spirit...Mind...the things of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:4-5).</p>
<p>If we want to avoid sin, we must also walk according to the Spirit and mind the things of the Spirit. This is to live in the Spirit and in the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life. The reality of our death with the Lord is available in our experience of the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life. The law of the Spirit of life is in the Spirit to manifest its function of freeing us from sin. Therefore, we must walk according to the Spirit, and we must mind the things of the Spirit in order to live in the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life, to be freed from sin, and to avoid sin.</p>
<p>We avoid sin by being freed from sin, not by subduing sin or overcoming sin. The Bible never tells us to overcome sin but rather to be freed from sin. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation frees us from sin. The Lord&rsquo;s way of salvation does not eradicate sin; it releases us from sin (Rom. 8:2; 6:18, 22). Even though sin still remains, we can be freed from it. Thus, we can avoid sin.</p>
<p>The way for us to avoid sin and to be freed from sin is to see the reality of our death with Christ, to reckon ourselves dead in Christ, to consecrate ourselves to God, to live according to the law of the Spirit of life, and to live in fellowship with the Lord by walking according to the Spirit and minding the things of the Spirit.</p></body></html>
