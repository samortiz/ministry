The religious leaders rejected Christ to the uttermost because they were fully occupied, possessed, and veiled by their religion
As we follow the Lord in His recovery, we should not know people according to the flesh or estimate them according to the flesh
In the church life in the Lord's recovery we do not care for the outward appearance; we care only for the spirit within, where Christ is
3 For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother
According to Matthew's presentation, after the rejection by religion and natural knowledge, there is the rejection by politics
In 12:24 the Jewish religious leaders, representing the entire nation of the Jews, rejected the heavenly King to the uttermost
You will see the rottenness and darkness in Roman politics, which was the leading political system on earth at the time
132 In spite of the rejection by all kinds of people, there were still a large number of people who followed the heavenly King
It was not that the King came to their cities to visit them, but that they left their cultured cities to follow Him in a deserted place
Through all the centuries the true followers of Christ have left cultured spheres to follow their heavenly King outside the cultured world
15 Now when evening fell, the disciples came to Him, saying, This place is deserted and the hour is already late
All that they needed was His resurrection life, which would satisfy their spiritual hunger, as signified in this miracle
22 And immediately He compelled the disciples to step into the boat and to go before Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away
30 But 1seeing the strong wind, he became frightened; and as he began to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!
31 And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt?
301 Peter came down from the boat and walked on the water by faith in the Lords word however when he saw the strong wind his faith vanished
The storm in chapter fourteen indicates that on the pathway where we follow the rejected King there will always be troubles
3 And He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
4 For God said, '1Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death'
6 Shall by no means honor his father or his mother; and you have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition
The Roman Catholic Church and most Protestant denominations make void the word of God because of their traditions
In Christendom many still insist on the traditions, and in the so-called churches these traditions are very prevailing
The Lord Jesus and His followers were accused by the traditionalists, and today we are accused by the religionists
Fallen human nature, however, always prompts man to ignore his parents, that is, to rebel against God's government
In order to bring man back to God's government, the Lord as the heavenly King emphasized that man should honor his parents
11 It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this 1defiles the man
12 Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were stumbled when they heard this word?
19 For out of the heart come 1evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies
131 This word from the heavenly King indicates that the hypocritical Pharisees had not been planted by the heavenly Father
It is an insignificant matter whether our hands are dirty; it is the condition of our inward parts that is important
The Galileans-thinking they knew everything about Him-rejected Him because they were blinded by their natural knowledge
The Lord's miraculous feeding of the crowds in the wilderness portrays our situation after we have experienced and passed through rejection
The storm in chapter fourteen indicates that on the pathway where we follow the rejected King there will always be troubles
Those who follow the traditions may claim to know the Bible, but actually they are completely blind and have no light at all
22 And behold, a 1Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, 2Lord, Son of David!
At this time He came to a Gentile region, thus affording the Gentiles an opportunity to participate in His grace
The Canaanite woman considered Him the Lord-a divine person-and the Son of David-a royal descendant, great and high in His reign
The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, had come as a portion to the children of Israel
They threw Him off the table to the ground, the Gentile land, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles
4 An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah
12 Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the 1teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees
When we eat bread, we may not realize that we are also eating leaven, for leaven is hidden in the bread and thus is invisible
Eating is the way to partake of Christ , and eating causes Gentile dogs to become children of God, even proper men
We must beware of eating leaven , especially the religious leaven hidden within religious people, such as the Pharisees and the Sadducees
13 Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?
14 And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets
In 16:13-20 we come to a section of the Gospel of Matthew concerned with the revelation of Christ and the church
Before we consider the details of this section, we need to consider the connection between it and the foregoing section, verses 1-12
It was in Caesarea Philippi that the vision concerning Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, came to Peter
It was there also that the church was revealed and mentioned for the first time as the means of bringing in the kingdom of the heavens
We need to leave the religious center and go far to the north, to the region of Caesarea Philippi, where the sky is clear
181 The Father's revelation concerning Christ is only the first half of the great mystery, which is Christ and the church
183 This rock refers not only to Christ but also to this revelation concerning Christ, a revelation that Peter received from the Father
The Lord is not building His church in Christendom, which is composed of the apostate Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations
There is spiritual warfare between Satan's power, which is his kingdom, and the church, which is God's kingdom
The authority to bind and to loose was given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church here, but also to the church itself
194 Whatever the church people bind or loose on earth must be something that has already been bound or loosed in the heavens
Any group that is built upon doctrines, views, practices, or concepts is not the church built upon the revelation concerning Christ
2You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are 3not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men
After the revelation of the great mystery concerning Christ and the church, the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ were unveiled
In order for Christ to build His church, He had to go to the religious center, pass through crucifixion, and enter into resurrection
Following the revelation of Christ and the church, the Lord Jesus revealed to His enlightened disciples His crucifixion and resurrection
The disciples heard that the Lord was to be killed, but it seems that they did not hear that He would be resurrected
Without Peter, we would not have so many revelations, for through his boldness in making mistakes a number of revelations were given
24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him 1deny 2himself and take up his cross and follow Me
25 For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever 1loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it
27 For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings
Our soul-life is embodied in and lived out by our self, and our self is expressed through our mind, our thought, our concept, our opinion
When we set our mind not on the things of God but on the things of men, our mind grasps the opportunity to act and express itself
Because in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit , we follow Him in our spirit
In chapter fifteen, immediately after the dispute regarding the washing of hands , there is a record of feeding on Jesus
By this Matthew shows that what the Lord wants is not the washing of hands but the eating of Him, the taking in of Him as food
In order to be cleansed from within, something must get into us, and the only way this can take place is by eating
It was in Caesarea Philippi that the vision concerning Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, came to Peter
It was there also that the church was revealed and mentioned for the first time as the means of bringing in the kingdom of the heavens
The authority to bind and to loose was given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church here, but also to the church itself
The concept of bearing the cross in Matthew 16 is not that of suffering but of keeping the self under the termination of death
17:1 And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up to a 1high mountain privately
The record from 1353178 portrays the way to follow the heavenly King from His rejection to the entering of the manifestation of the kingdom
His followers not only shared His being rejected by the Jews but also were persecuted and even martyred by Gentile politics
When they were on the stormy sea under the contrary wind, He walked on the sea, calmed the storm, and brought them through
Nearly all the points in that message were the same as those covered in these messages on the pathway to glory
2 And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light
In the past we pointed out that the Lord's coming will not take place suddenly; rather, it will come gradually
According to Matthew 17:1-2 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification
Thessalonians 1:10 says, 'When He comes to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed'
God purposely did these two things that Moses and Elijah might appear with Christ on the mount of His transfiguration
Now Moses and Elijah appeared and conversed with Christ concerning His death , which had been spoken of in the Old Testament
In God's economy the law and the prophets are only a testimony of Christ; they should not be put on the same level with Him
, the law and the prophets, with Christ, but God took Moses and Elijah away, leaving no one except Jesus Himself
111 This will be fulfilled at the time of the great tribulation, when Elijah will be one of the two witnesses , as prophesied in Mal
121 This refers to John the Baptist , who came in the spirit and power of Elijah and was rejected and beheaded
God took Moses and Elijah away because He would not tolerate seeing His children rank anyone on the same level as His Son Jesus Christ
As we await the coming of the kingdom, we must learn not to rank Moses, Elijah, or anyone else on the same level as Christ
If we believe in resurrection and live in resurrection, we will be in glory, even though the manifestation of the kingdom has not yet come
When we live and walk in resurrection, we have the sense that we are in glory and that we can see the glorious manifestation of the kingdom
15 Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water
Immediately after the record of the Lord's transfiguration on the mountain, we have the record of the healing of a demon possessed person
If we would understand the Gospel of Matthew, we need to remember that Matthew puts different facts together to reveal a doctrine
In the realm of the Lord's transfiguration there is glory, but outside this realm there is the power of darkness
While we are enjoying the transfiguration on the mountaintop, others are in the valley suffering from demon possession
As the heavenly King, the Lord has such authority, but we need to pray, even with fasting, to execute the Lord's authority
According to the concept of Peter, James, and John, the Christ who had been transfigured on the mountaintop did not need to be crucified
Afterward, however, we still need to descend from the mountain and bear the cross in the presence of our husband or wife
No matter how excellent the experience of transfiguration might be, we still need to stay under the killing of the cross
24 And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the 1temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the 1temple tax?
Unless we receive light from the Lord, it is difficult to see the connection between verses 1 through 23 and verses 24 through 27
In chapter sixteen Peter received a clear revelation from the heavenly Father regarding Christ as the Son of the living God
When you are with your wife or husband, the revelation of having been crucified with Christ and of Christ living in you may vanish
If he had still remembered that word, he would have referred the poll tax gatherers' question to Christ to hear what He would say
24 And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?
Peter had received the revelation concerning Christ's being the Son of God and had seen the vision of the Son of God
He forgot that the Lord was the Son of God, who, as such, did not need to pay the poll tax for His Father's house
Perhaps Peter was about to go after the poll tax gatherers and tell them that the Lord did not need to pay the tax
The meaning of the vision on the mountaintop is that we should hear the Lord Jesus and not anyone else, including ourselves
According to Matthew 17:1-2 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification
As we await the coming of the kingdom, we must learn not to rank Moses, Elijah, or anyone else on the same level as Christ
While we are enjoying the transfiguration on the mountaintop, others are in the valley suffering from demon possession
According to the disciples' mistaken concept, the Christ who had been transfigured on the mountaintop did not need to be crucified
No matter how excellent the experience of transfiguration might be, we still need to stay under the killing of the cross
The meaning of the vision on the mountaintop is that we should hear the Lord Jesus and not anyone else, including ourselves
4 He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens
Matthew purposely covers these five problems in his Gospel to show that we must take care of them in order to be in the kingdom
If the hand, the foot, or the eye causes us to stumble , we must deal with these causes of stumbling in a serious way
We so easily offend the little ones for whom the Father cares, and as little ones ourselves we are easily stumbled
16 But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
In both of its aspects the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose
Many such meetings may be held separately in the same locality, yet they are still the unique church in that locality
23 For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to 1settle accounts with his slaves
If you consider verse 18 in its context, you will realize that it is not an insignificant matter to rebel against the church
If you repent to the church, the heavens will immediately loose you, and then the church will loose what has been loosed in the heavens
Both our unwillingness to repent and our unwillingness to forgive will keep us out of the kingdom not only in this age but in the coming age
Many Christians do not know how to interpret this part of the Word because they have not seen God's dispensational administration
If we do not practice the way of repentance and forgiveness, the longer we stay in the church life, the more offenses there will be
311 Our not forgiving the brother who sins against us will grieve the other brothers, and they may bring this matter to the Lord
If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, we will be disciplined by the Lord until we forgive him from the heart, i
3 And some Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?
5 And said, 'For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh'?
8 He said to them, Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the 1beginning it has not been so
10 His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry
It was given by Moses not according to Gods ordination from the beginning but as something temporary because of the hardness of mans heart
121 These are the ones to whom God has given the gift to remain unmarried for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens
The religionists' temptation here afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal a further matter concerning the kingdom of the heavens
26 And looking upon them, Jesus said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible
The former is to be redeemed and regenerated by the Holy Spirit, whereby we receive God's life; the latter is to live and walk by God's life
In both of its aspects, universal and local, the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose
In chapter eighteen we see how to deal with someone who offends others as well as the seriousness of offending others
When we are saved we receive God's life, but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to live and walk by God's life
If, for the kingdom's sake, or for the sake of the Lord's name, we leave all these things, the Lord will reward us a hundredfold
In the manifestation of the kingdom, we will participate in the enjoyment of eternal life in the millennial kingdom with the Lord Jesus
The first twelve apostles, including Peter, will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, and the other overcomers will rule over the nations
1 For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard
12 Saying, These last ones worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the scorching heat
Peter's natural concept, representing that of all believers, was commercial; he did not know the Lord's gracious wish
To leave all things behind and follow the Lord is not to pay a price; it is to enjoy the grace we have received
18 Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes
19 And deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised
She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom
Apart from experiencing the Lord's cross and resurrection, it is impossible to experience the Lord's life for the reward of the kingdom
He said that he desired to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to Christ's death
Rather, verses 20 and 21 say, 'Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him
She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom'
The mother of the sons of Zebedee was the Lord's aunt, His mother's sister, and Zebedee's sons, James and John, were His cousins
30 And behold two blind men sitting by the road hearing that Jesus was passing by cried out saying Have mercy on us Lord Son of David!
34 And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed Him
The selfish entreaty of the mother of John and James afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal the way to enter into the kingdom
Standing in the position of man, the Lord was fully subject to the Father; He did not assume the right to do anything outside the Father
The twelve were filled to the brim with ambition for position, and nothing regarding the Lord's death and resurrection penetrated them
The fact that this incident immediately follows the record of the mother of James and John indicates that James and John were blind
5 Say to the daughter of Zion Behold your King is coming to you meek and mounted on a donkey and on a colt a foal of a beast of burden
8 And most of the crowd spread their own garments in the road, and others cut 1branches from the trees and spread them in the road
According to Psalm 118, only the One who came in the name of the Lord was qualified to be praised in such a way
The spontaneous praise of the people sovereignly indicated that this meek King came not in His own name, but in the name of Jehovah
13 And He said to them, It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a den of robbers
