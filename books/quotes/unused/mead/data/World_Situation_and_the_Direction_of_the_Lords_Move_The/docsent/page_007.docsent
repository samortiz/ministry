   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE REVELATION IN THE HOLY WRITINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WRITINGS OF THE HOLY BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to see the steps the Lord has taken to give us the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we have the divine revelation in the holy writings the writings of the holy Bible 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Old Testament was written in Hebrew, and the New Testament was written in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE TRANSLATION OF THE HOLY WRITINGS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE OLD TESTAMENT USED BY THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>IN HIS SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>WAS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>BUT WAS A GREEK TRANSLATION,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE SEPTUAGINT VERSION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to have the divine truths, there needs to be the translation of the holy writings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has spoken in Hebrew and Greek, but what He has spoken needs to be properly translated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even the Old Testament used by the Lord Jesus in His speaking to the people was not in the original language, but was a Greek translation, the Septuagint version.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This version was a translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek, completed about three hundred years before Christ was born.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was translated by seventy Jewish scholars, and the Lord Jesus and early apostles quoted from it a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The translation of the holy writings is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without the translation of the Bible into many languages, most people would not be able to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE INTERPRETATION OF THE HOLY WRITINGS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition to the translation of the holy writings, there needs to be the interpretation of the holy writings Acts 8:27-37; Heb 5:11-12; 9:1-10, especially v. 5; 2 Tim 2:15; 2 Pet 3:15-16 . For example, who can explain what it means in Daniel 11:32 for the people who know their God to show strength and to take action? This word refers to the Jewish heroes, who were known as the Maccabees.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They defeated Antiochus Epiphanes, who was the first type of the coming Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word in Daniel 11:32 was spoken to the Maccabees, encouraging them to defeat Antiochus, to show strength and take action.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a story in Acts 8 of Philip s encounter with an Ethiopian eunuch which illustrates the need of the interpretation of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This eunuch had come to worship in Jerusalem and was returning to Ethiopia.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was reading Isaiah 53 when Philip approached his chariot.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Philip heard him reading, he asked, Do you really know what you are reading? v. 30 . Then the eunuch said, How can I unless someone guides me? v. 31 . To some, Isaiah 53 may be easy to understand, but to that eunuch it was difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This shows that without the interpretation and exposition of the Bible, people cannot understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some have said that they do not need the Life-studies and that they just read the pure Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if people merely read the Bible without the proper exposition of the Bible, they will not be able to understand it in many portions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul said in Hebrews that he had much to say concerning Melchesidec as a type of Christ, but that this was hard to explain because the Hebrews had become dull of hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He told the Hebrews that they should have been teachers by that time, but they were still babes in understanding the holy Word 5:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Hebrews 9, Paul speaks of the first tabernacle, the Holy Place, and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, as symbols of two covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signifies the old covenant as a type vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>1-2, 6, 8-10 , and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies the new covenant as a reality vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3-5, 7-8, 10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 9 Paul said that the first tabernacle mentioned in verse 8 was a figure, a type, for the present time, which is the new testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first tabernacle, the Holy Place, was a symbol of the old covenant and, at the same time, it was also a type of the new testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without Paul s guidance, how could we understand that the first tabernacle typifies the new testament age?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even today not many people realize that the first tabernacle is a type of the new testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For more help concerning this truth, see message thirty-nine of the Life-study of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is a great amount of truth in the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have published Life-study messages on the entire twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was completed by our having two annual trainings from 1974 to 1986.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Life-studies do not replace the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, they open the Bible, expound the Bible, and release the unsearchable riches in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Recently, I was having a time with the Lord in the morning with the help of the publication we have entitled The Holy Word for Morning Revival.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was praying over Ephesians 6:23, which says, Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was asking myself what peace and love with faith meant.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I forgot that I had written a note on this verse in the Recovery Version, so I read it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The note points out that faith is to receive Christ John 1:12 and love is to enjoy Christ 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then it says, Here it is not faith and love, nor love and faith, but love with faith, because this is the conclusion of the book on the church, which needs to enjoy Christ in love with faith, which works through love Gal 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus peace will also be her portion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I received much help from reading this note on Ephesians 6:23.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This shows that we need the interpretation and the exposition of the Word.</S>
