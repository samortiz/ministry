   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH OUR DISPOSITION BY THE CROSS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament, the one with the strongest disposition was perhaps the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His disposition inwardly was very strong, but his stature was probably small and thin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although Paul's disposition was strong, in reading 1 Corinthians 7, you cannot see his strong disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul wrote to the believers in Corinth who were of the logical and philosophical Greek background.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He wrote in a very logical manner, but you cannot discover a hint of his strong disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The person of Paul was there, but the "snake" of his disposition had been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 Corinthians 7, the person who was Saul of Tarsus with the strong disposition had been dealt with, but the regenerated Paul remained.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Paul's word in Galatians 2:20, he was crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His being crucified with Christ dealt with his disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Galatians 2:20, there is the old "I" and the new "I."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The old "I" included the disposition of Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although his disposition was crucified, Saul was not thrown away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, through regeneration Saul of Tarsus was uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the sand on the seashore is sifted in order to find the precious things, Saul of Tarsus was sifted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the negative and fallen things were put away, but the regenerated person of Saul was uplifted and purified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As saved sinners, our negative aspects have been put away, but our positive aspects are being uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through regeneration we have an uplifted humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This does not mean that we have exchanged our old humanity for a new humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We still have the humanity we received at birth, but before regeneration our humanity was old and of a low standard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After regeneration our humanity is being sifted, and through such a process it is being uplifted and purified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This uplifted and purified humanity is the new "I" in Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul says, "And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>" Paul lived by the life which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Corinthians 7, the person of Saul who became Paul still remained.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the sifting process, Saul became Paul, a person who had been uplifted and purified with a high standard of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such a person is joined to the Lord and is one spirit with the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While Paul was writing 1 Corinthians 7, he was joined to the Lord as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, he could give a command saying, "I charge," and he could also say, "Not I but the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He could say such things because he was one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His strong disposition had been sifted away through the cross of Christ, objectively in the fact of being crucified with Christ and subjectively in the experience of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul experienced the subjective cross of Christ by experiencing the subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul was a person who lived under the shadow of the cross all the time; thus, when he wrote 1 Corinthians 7, he was a regenerated, sifted, uplifted, and purified person who was joined to the Lord as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION SEEN IN THE GRAFTED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 7 in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The principle of incarnation is that God enters into man and mingles Himself with man to make man one with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, God is in man and man is also in God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This can be illustrated by grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When two trees are grafted together, both trees must be cut.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The cut in the first tree is an opening to receive the other tree.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second tree must also be cut in order to be put into the first tree.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the two cuts are put together and the two trees begin to grow together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order for us to be grafted into Christ, Christ and we must be cut.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This cut was made at the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ as the good, cultivated olive tree Rom 11:17-18; John 15:1 was cut through His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also were cut by our crucifixion with Christ on the cross Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we believed into Christ and were baptized into Him, we were grafted into Christ, the two cuts were put together, and we began to live together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There was no exchange of lives; rather, two lives were joined together and began to grow together organically Rom 6:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A stanza in a hymn written by A. B. Simpson Hymns, #482 speaks of the matter of grafting:</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This the secret nature hideth,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Harvest grows from buried grain;</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A poor tree with better grafted,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Richer, sweeter life doth gain.</S>
