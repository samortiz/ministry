I doubt that Peter prayed to the Lord concerning their living after those two meetings with the resurrected Christ on two successive Lord&#8217;s Days. The disciples did not have the proper spiritual realization, the right spiritual habit. They did not practice living in a spiritual way. There is nothing to indicate that Peter prayed to the Lord when he was in need of food. Instead of praying, Peter said, &#8220;I am going fishing.&#8221; This utterance indicates Peter&#8217;s disappointment with his situation. Because he could no longer tolerate not knowing what to do, he decided to go fishing.<p>In John 21 the Lord Jesus was training the disciples by keeping all the fish away from them. Here the Lord seems to be saying, &#8220;Do you think that you are able to catch fish? I am the One who created the fish. If I had not created these fish, how could you get any? I am still the Creator, and the entire universe is under My hand. If you don&#8217;t go My way and carry out My commission to be sent out, you will not be able to catch anything. All I have to do is say the word, and the fish will stay away from you. I want you to know that I am here. Listen to Me, and don&#8217;t go fishing by yourselves. When I say go fishing, then you should go fishing. When I say let down the net, you should let the net down. Don&#8217;t do anything by yourselves.&#8221; According to verse 6, the Lord told the disciples to cast the net on the right side of the boat. When they did this, they caught an abundance of fishes.<p>When the disciples got onto the land with the fishes, they saw a fire of coals with fish lying on it and bread (v. 9). According to the Lord&#8217;s word, they had caught an abundance of fishes. But then they learned that the Lord had already prepared fish and bread for them. By this the Lord trained them to realize that He is able to provide fish for them. Though they caught many fish according to the Lord&#8217;s word, the Lord did not use these fish to feed them. No doubt, this was a real lesson to Peter.<p>There is no indication that the disciples asked the Lord Jesus how He obtained the fish and the bread. I certainly do not know where these fish came from. Here the fish and the bread signify the riches of the Lord&#8217;s supply. The Lord provided the disciples with the riches of the sea and of the land.<h2 class=head1>RESTORED BY THE LORD</h2><p>The disciples, especially Peter, learned a great deal from the Lord in John 21. There is no further record to indicate that Peter was ever again troubled concerning the matter of having food to eat. Furthermore, there is no hint that Peter went fishing again. Instead of remaining in Galilee, he went to Jerusalem according to the Lord&#8217;s word, a place that was not safe for the followers of the Lord Jesus. Nevertheless, he and the others had the boldness to remain in Jerusalem for ten days praying. We do not know how they obtained the necessary supply of food. But it is clear from Acts 1 that Peter was not concerned about this. On the contrary, Peter was taking care of the Lord&#8217;s commission. For example, he spoke of the need of a replacement for Judas (Acts 1:15-22). But he had learned the lesson not to say, &#8220;I am going fishing.&#8221; In this matter, he was trained by the Lord. By this we see that chapter twenty-one of the Gospel of John is very practical.<p>I can testify from my experience with the Lord that He is able to provide for our needs. On the day I was saved, I was walking home, and I stopped and said, &#8220;Lord, I am willing to give up the whole world. I simply want to take my Bible and go throughout the villages preaching Christ. I don&#8217;t care what I eat, and I am willing to suffer poverty. I only care to preach Christ.&#8221; That was my only intention, and I made that decision before the Lord in 1925. Some years later the Lord raised up a church in my home town. As the number increased and the need became greater, the Lord burdened me to give up my job and to serve Him full time. He reminded me of what I had said to Him that day on the street. Then He told me that it was time for me to leave my job and serve Him by taking care of the church. I knew that He did not want me to serve as a hired one, but He wanted me to serve Him by faith. After more than fifty years of experience, I can testify that the Lord is faithful.<p>On the one hand, Peter was trained by the Lord in John 21 in a strict, thorough way. On the other hand, the Lord used the situation in His wisdom to restore Peter. It was by a miracle related to fishing that the Lord had called Peter three and a half years earlier. Then after Peter&#8217;s backsliding from the Lord&#8217;s calling to his old profession, the Lord manifested Himself again to restore Peter through another miracle related to fishing. I believe that the Lord used this as a sign purposely to remind Peter of how He had called him three and a half years before. Therefore, in this aspect of the aggregate sign in chapter twenty-one we see that Peter was not only trained but also restored.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_224.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_226.html">Next</a> </body></html>
