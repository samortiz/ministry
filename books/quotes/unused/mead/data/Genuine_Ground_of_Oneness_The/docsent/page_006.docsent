   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ONENESS OF GOD IN CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible reveals four great acts or activities of God: creation, election, the new creation, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In each of these four acts we see the matter of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first three actions the creation, the election of the nation of Israel, and the formation of the church as the new creation have already taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The coming of the New Jerusalem, God's new city, of course, will take place in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the age of the millennium, this new city will be manifested in full.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's creation was uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did not create more than one universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, in this unique universe, man is the focal point of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible clearly reveals that God created just one man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I was young, I wondered why God did not create billions of people at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seemed to me that it would have been much wiser for God to carry on the work of creation in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be sure, God was able to simultaneously create billions of human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, He did not do so.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the sake of the oneness, God created one man, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genesis 1:26 says, "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to this verse, God firstly said, "Let us make man."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then He went on to say, "Let them have dominion."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In referring to the man created in His image, God used a plural pronoun.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that the one man created by God was a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's intention is not to have many men; it is to have one corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is for the keeping of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This principle applies to the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, with reference to the church, we may speak of the church in a particular locality, such as the church in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But, on the other hand, we may also refer to the church by using such pronouns as we and us to denote the members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because the church is a corporate entity, it includes all the believers in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, in referring to the church, we may speak either of the church in singular number or of us, the believers in Christ, in plural number.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that the church is a corporate entity and that we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as the church is a corporate entity, so, in the same principle, the man created by God was a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE ONENESS OF GOD IN SELECTION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, due to the repeated falls of man, the corporate man created by God became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Step by step the man created for God's purpose fell lower and lower until, with the lowest stage of his fall at Babel, he was divided into nations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The one man was of God, but the many nations had their source in the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The nations were devilish because they were divisions of the corporate man created by God for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When this corporate man became the nations, it was no longer possible for him to carry out God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that point, God was forced to give up fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, for the sake of His eternal purpose, God came in to call out one man, Abraham, to be the father of the called race.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He selected one person from among fallen mankind to be the father of the called race.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as God had created one man, so He called only one man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may think that God should have called out a multitude of people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we were God at the time of the calling of Abraham, we certainly would have called many people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, it would have been against God's nature to call more than one person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's nature is oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, both in creation and in selection He was true to His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Paul speaks of the oneness of the church in Ephesians 4, he speaks of one Spirit, one Lord, and one God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because God is uniquely one, He is bound by His nature to create one man and also to call one man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To act otherwise would be contrary to His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God does not act hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although He is the almighty God, He never does anything in a hasty way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He created one man, Adam, and He selected one man, Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because His nature is oneness, He created only one person and called only one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the descendants of Abraham were about to enter into the good land, God charged them not to worship at the place of their choice Deut 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, they were required to go to the place of God's choice, to the place He had chosen to put His name and for His habitation Deut 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No matter how many Israelites there might have been, they were required to come to this unique place three times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to the natural concept, such a requirement is not reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nevertheless, God required this of His people in order to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, the oneness of God's people was eventually lost.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Firstly, the oneness of created mankind was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, due to the degradation of the nation of Israel, the oneness of God's chosen people was also destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some were carried off to Assyria, others to Egypt, and still more to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Such a division of God's people was a frustration to the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
