        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">A LIVING OF APPROPRIATING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:4-5; 1 John 2:27; Rom. 8:9-10; 2 Cor. 3:17-18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A BASIC KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is to work His life into us so that we may be conformed to the image of the Son, Christ (Rom. 8:29). The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is not to change us from being evil to being good or from being wicked to being virtuous. Rather, it is to make His life available to those who do not have His life and to enable those who receive His life as His sons to bear the image of His Son.</p>
<p>Being good or evil and being virtuous or wicked are concepts that are unrelated to God&rsquo;s redemption; they are religious concepts. God&rsquo;s life is the focus of His redemption, and the image of His Son is the purpose of His redemption. Human religions stress good and evil for the sake of cultivating good human beings. However, God&rsquo;s redemption emphasizes life for the purpose of giving us the life of God and making us sons of God.</p>
<p>Without revelation from God, it is easy to regard the Bible as a book of religious teachings. People think that just as religion instructs people to leave evil and pursue good, the Bible teaches the same thing but with a higher standard. Therefore, they regard the teachings of Christianity and the teachings of other religions to be similar in nature. Those who have received revelation from God, however, know that teachings related to good and evil, even if they are based on the Bible, are the product of man-made religions. The Bible does not teach people to leave evil and pursue good but rather to receive Christ&rsquo;s redemption, to live God&rsquo;s life, and to be conformed to the image of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT CULTIVATING THE SELF<br />
BUT LIVING IN GOD&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>Instead of cultivating the good self, God&rsquo;s redeemed should live by His life. When we appropriate redemption, we receive God&rsquo;s life, and God wants us to begin to live by His life. However, it is easy to focus on good deeds and on improving ourselves, because we lack revelation. Consequently, we neglect the life of God in us, and we miss the purpose of His redemption. God&rsquo;s intention is that the image of His Son would be our goal, but we make good deeds our aim. God wants us to live by His life, but we focus on improving ourselves.</p>
<p>We need revelation in order to see that God does not want us to improve ourselves. He wants us to reject the self and live by His life, that is, to live in Him. God does not want good deeds to be our aim; neither does He want us to cultivate ourselves to be good. He wants us to take Christ as our goal and to be conformed to His image. If we see this, we would receive salvation and be transformed.</p>
<p>We should consecrate ourselves to God after we are saved so that His life can work in us. Once we have consecrated ourselves, we need to stop our endeavoring and learn to live by God&rsquo;s life. Consecration is not for us to work for God but to let God work on us. God works on us through His life. In order to be worked on by God, we need to let His life operate in us. This requires that we not only consecrate ourselves to God but also that we stop ourselves and live in His life after our consecration.</p>
<p>Just as the concept of self-cultivation hinders us from living by God&rsquo;s life, the desire to work for God distracts us so that we engage in activities apart from His life. Our activity, our doing, and our working prevent us from living by God&rsquo;s life. Our concepts concerning our self-effort are veils that cover and prevent us from seeing how to live by God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING WITH GOD</h2>
<p>If we desire to live by God&rsquo;s life, we need to fellowship with Him. God&rsquo;s life is inseparable from God. God&rsquo;s life is God Himself. Hence, if we want to live by His life, we must fellowship with Him. When we fellowship with God, we touch Him, and when we touch Him, we can live by His life.</p>
<p>God wants us to live a life of fellowshipping with Him so that we can live by His life. His life has entered into us in order to grow and mature so that we would bear the image of Christ. If we stop our activities and self-cultivation and, instead, fellowship with Him, His life will have the opportunity to operate, to work, in us, and all that He is will be worked into us. If we live and walk according to the operation of His life in us, we will live by His life.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemption is focused on the divine life. Therefore, the central significance of the appropriation of redemption is the appropriation of God&rsquo;s life. The degree to which we appropriate God&rsquo;s life will be the degree to which we enjoy God&rsquo;s redemption. To live by God&rsquo;s life is the practical appropriation of redemption and also the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s redemption. In order to live by God&rsquo;s life, we must fellowship with Him and touch the sense of His life.</p>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is to make us exactly the same as Christ. This is what God desires to accomplish through His life in us. If we want to allow God to achieve the purpose of His redemption, we must give His life an opportunity to operate in us. Hence, we must stop ourselves and fellowship with God. This is the way to give His life an opportunity to operate freely in us. To fellowship with God and to allow His life to operate in us enable God to achieve the purpose of His redemption.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
