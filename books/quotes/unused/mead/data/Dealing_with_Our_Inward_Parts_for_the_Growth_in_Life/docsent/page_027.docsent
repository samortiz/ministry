   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit whom we have received is also the anointing Spirit 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many other aspects of the Spirit, such as the Spirit of sonship, the Spirit of holiness, and the Spirit of wisdom Isa 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The above aspects, however, are the main ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit of God today, who is the Spirit of Christ, is within us as the Spirit of life, who is also the Spirit of reality, the Paraclete, the seal, the earnest, and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to know all these items of the Spirit not only in knowledge but also by experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Son</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fourth, in regeneration we also receive the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Corinthians 13:5 and Romans 8:10 prove to us that the Son, Christ, is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 4:6 indicates that through regeneration we have also received the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse says, "One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have the divine life, the divine nature, the Spirit, the Son, and God the Father in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First John 3:24 says, "And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verses 12 and 13 of chapter four say, "No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 15 says, "Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These verses prove adequately that God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What have we obtained by regeneration?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have the divine life, the divine nature, the Holy Spirit, the Son, and the Father God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have you ever fully realized that by your regeneration you have received all these items?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are simply the spiritual ABCs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Christians today think that they know many things, and they do, but the one thing they do not know is life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The matter of life is not something in our natural human concept, as many other teachings are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you put a Christian to the test and ask him or her to speak something about life, you will see where Christians today are.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The matter of life is veiled by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The above five items that we receive in regeneration are actually just one item with five aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, the Spirit is the Spirit of life, and within the divine life is the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Son is the embodiment of the Father, so the Father is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit is the reality of the Son, so the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This Spirit comes into us as the Spirit of life, and within this life is the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The divine life we have received is nothing less than God Himself, but not merely God in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, God the Father is the fullness in God the Son, God the Son is the very embodiment of God the Father, God the Son is realized as God the Spirit, and God the Spirit is the very transmission of the Triune God who comes into us as the divine life with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the divine attributes such as wisdom, holiness, power, and love are in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have this Spirit as the all-inclusive dose, we have all these divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this all-inclusive Spirit we even have the human nature of Christ and the effectiveness and killing power of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All this we have obtained by regeneration.</S>
