   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>d Providing the First Part of the Good Land for Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Deuteronomy 33:21 says of Gad, "He provided the first part for himself, for there a portion of the lawgiver was reserved" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Victory always gives us enlargement, which is the expansion of space.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, this verse says that Gad provided the first part for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For years I was not able to understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the history in the Old Testament, the first part refers to the first part of the good land east of the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In their journeys, the twelve tribes firstly entered this part, which was on the east side of Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Desiring this rich, fertile land, Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh begged Moses to give it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although Moses agreed, he charged them not to stay there, enjoying their good land, while their brothers had not yet obtained their portion of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, Moses charged them to fight the battle for the rest of the land Num 32:1-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After that, they would divide the land justly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the two and a half tribes had stayed there and had not gone on to fight for the rest of the land, they would not have been just.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, Gad provided the first part for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There a portion was reserved for the lawgiver.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This points to the fact that Moses, the lawgiver, was buried there Deut 32:48-52; 34:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>e Coming with the Heads of the People</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>to Execute the Justice of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and His Ordinances with Israel</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 21 also says, "And he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his ordinances with Israel" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Gad came with the heads of the people, the leaders, to take the rest of the good land to execute the justice of the Lord in dividing the land and His ordinances with Israel Josh 22:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Dan's failure was his pride.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he gained more land, he became proud and set up another center of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not care for his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In your spiritual experience, you must beware of pride when you gain more land, more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Never set up another center of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, you must take care of your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not say, "I have won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have more land, more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I don't care about the others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will stay here to enjoy my victory."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do this, you will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though you have gained the land, you must press on to take care of the need of your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have obtained your portion, but what about the portion of your brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must fight the battle to get the rest of the land so that all your brothers may have their share.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To enjoy your portion of the land without helping your brothers obtain their portion would not be just.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It would not be the execution of God's justice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must go on with the other leaders to fight the battle for the rest of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then all your brothers will have a portion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To do this is to execute the justice of the Lord and to keep His ordinances with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Gad had a number of good points.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He recovered the victory, he was enlarged, and he tore the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, although he provided a place for himself, he did not enjoy it until he helped his brothers gain their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He went on with them to fight until everyone had a portion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was the execution of the justice of the Lord and of His ordinances with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Again I say, Dan warns us not to be proud, to be independent, or to set up another center of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Gad helps us to know that even after we have gained the victory and have been enlarged, we should not forget our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not rest in our portion until we have helped our brothers gain their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To win a spiritual victory and to gain Christ is truly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But beware of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may set up a separate worship center, neglecting your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Never do this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not enjoy the portion you have gained until you have helped your brothers win theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not be proud and do not forget your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hearing this should be a help to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we know what we should do after gaining the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not establish another center, but we should take care of our brothers, fighting for the sake of their portion.</S>
