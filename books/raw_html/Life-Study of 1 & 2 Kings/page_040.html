<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. A Type of the Apostasy of Today's Christianity</H2><P>The apostasy of Jeroboam in the above five items could be considered a type of the apostasy of today's Christianity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. God's Judgment<br>on the Altar at Bethel Made by Jeroboam</H2><P>First Kings 13:1-32 is a record of God's judgment on the altar at Bethel made by Jeroboam. This judgment was carried out by a man of God from Judah (vv. 1-10). This man of God was then deceived by an old prophet to take the way against God's commandment and was torn apart by a lion (vv. 11-32).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Ahijah's Prophecy<br>concerning the Tragic Ending of Jeroboam</H2><P>In 14:1-18 we have Ahijah's prophecy concerning the tragic ending of Jeroboam. Jeroboam sent his wife in disguise to see Ahijah the prophet in Shiloh, hoping to get some good news concerning his son Abijah (vv. 1-5). Instead of giving good news, Ahijah the prophet, in a prophecy from God, told the wife of Jeroboam that because of Jeroboam's evils in his apostasy, God would destroy Jeroboam and his whole family as a man sweeps dung until it is all gone (vv. 6-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Jeroboam Reigning Twenty-two Years<br>over the Ten Tribes of Israel</H2><P>Jeroboam reigned twenty-two years over the ten tribes of Israel. His life was ended by the severe punishment of God (vv. 19-20a).</P>
