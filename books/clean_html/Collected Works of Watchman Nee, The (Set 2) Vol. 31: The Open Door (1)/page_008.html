<h2 class="head2">Letters from Sister Bao Hsu-min, Foochow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Honorable X:</p><p>While I was en route to Wei-Yang from Kutien, I sent you a letter. I wonder whether you have read it. I arrived in Foochow on the fourteenth. Although I worked there for only six days, God blessed the people very much. They had begun their autumn harvest and were very busy. Nevertheless, their longing made them very enthusiastic, and they attended two to three meetings daily. Since the great harvest was approaching, we felt that it would not be good to continue our work, so we stopped the meetings and came here. The situation in the Tai-Jiang gospel hall is very good, and there are many new believers. I had planned to go elsewhere via Foochow, but some of the believers here wanted me to remain a few more days for the need of the new believers among the women. I also felt that I should render something to meet their need out of the love and compassion of the Lord, and I considered this as important as the work of personal evangelism. Therefore, a few women have gathered every afternoon at the Tai-Jiang meeting hall since the eighteenth. Sister Li Shiu-yi has been in charge of teaching them to read and recite hymns. I spoke to them on aspects regarding life. For the time being, we have decided to conduct this meeting for one week.</p><p>If the Lord opens the way, I am willing to go to the downstream region for a brief stay and then onward to southern Fukien. I also would like to stay at Ping-Yang for a longer time. I am now praying about this. Due to some difficulties that I encountered in seeking the Lord's path, I am afraid that I will have to stay here for a few more days. Perhaps I can also visit the rural vicinities around Foochow. The path before me is unclear; I can only proceed one step at a time. Although there seem to be many difficulties, I am very blessed within. I feel very strong and bold, and my heart is firmly secure and at rest. In spite of the work load, nothing seems to be burdensome and all is well. Although I have suffered from a cold recently, my living and work are not frustrated. Recently, Brother Lo Da-jun, from the meeting at Ching-Liu Township in western Fukien, heard that I had returned to Fukien and tried to invite me to labor in his place for some time. In order to go there from Foochow, one has to pass through four counties: Amoy, Changchow, Lung-Yen, and Lienchen. There are meetings in the first three places, but in Lienchen there seem to be only denominational churches. I was in Amoy and Changchow last year and also met the brothers who labored at Lienchen. If it is the Lord's will, there should be no difficulty (referring to the journey) for me to go there, except that I do not know who would go with me. Therefore, I am still praying. If I am assured that this journey is all gain and no loss, I will visit Yung-An on my way back (where I had been a teacher before), passing through Da-Tien County to Amoy and then to Ping-Yang. I have heard that Mr. Nee has returned to Shanghai. When you have a chance, please ask for his opinion concerning my path. I have planned, prayed, and waited, but I need to walk according to God's ordination. I wish to be more clear concerning all matters as befitting the proper principles. According to present circumstances, some can go with me, but I wish to do so according to God's way. Recently I read the newsletters and found out about the situations elsewhere. Truly, tribulation is a blessing in disguise. Thank the Father for gracing the brothers and sisters in other places!</p><p>This letter was written during three sittings. Some changes have occurred since I began it. The first page was written several days ago, while the first half of this page was written yesterday morning. It has been five days since the meetings in Tai-Jiang. The Lord really blessed the meetings according to the need. Some sisters still hope to carry on for another week, which may indeed happen. In the evenings I have a home-meeting (prayer-edifying) with some sisters in town. The house is borrowed; hopefully, we will not encounter any frustrations. Please pray for us and give us your comments. May peace be with you in the Lord.</p><p>Bao Hsu-min<br />October 23</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Sister X:</p><p>Through reading the local newsletter from Shanghai, I learned that you had gone to Hankow. Thanks be to the grace of the Father. I heard that there will be a co-workers' meeting in Hankow. May God bestow His grace and greatly advance His work through such a meeting, amen. Though I am here, my heart longs to be there. I had planned to go to western Fukien, but I was repeatedly delayed in going. Presently, I am still in Foochow sharing the same dwelling place with Miss Li Shiu-yi at the Gospel Hospital. I have been resting and having more contact with the academic circle. The activities of my heart, spirit, soul, body, and walk seem quite different from before. I wonder whether there is any danger in my endeavors. I hope very much to be taught by you face to face. For now, I feel stable and calm in heart, neither burning nor desperate. I can wait quietly for the Father's fresh grace. If you are familiar with my condition, please give me some guidance in writing. I would very much appreciate it. May peace be with you in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Bao Hsu-min<br />November 20<br />[Address omitted]</p>
