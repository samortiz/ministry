   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD HAVING GIVEN US FAITH, THE DIVINE SEED, AND THE PRECIOUS AND EXCEEDINGLY GREAT PROMISES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Peter 1 tells us that God has given us three categories of things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, God has given us Christ as faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Peter said that we have received equally precious faith v. 1 . In this equally precious faith, Peter and we are exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even if we are not able to define what faith is, we still have it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are many precious things which we cannot explain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have our physical life, but what is it?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one can define it, not even the medical doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Life is just life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same way, we have something within us called faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot explain it, but we have it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot give it up or forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After believing into Christ, some may want to give up being a Christian, but they cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is too late.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Something came into them which they cannot give up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once it gets in, it never leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have been caught by the Lord, and He has come into us as our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have all received equally precious faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, God has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness v. 3 . Godliness includes the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Timothy 3 reveals that the great mystery of godliness is the church life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Godliness is the expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have all things pertaining to life within and to the expression of life without.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has given us all these things and we have received them, but how can we prove this?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us use the seed of a certain plant as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the things related to what this seed will be are included in the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have given me the seed, you have given me the root, the stump, the branches, the leaves, the blossoms, and the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since I have received the seed, I have received all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everything pertaining to life and the expression of life are included in the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second Peter 1 says that God's divine power has given us all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This divine power is nothing less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the very moment we opened up our mouth to say, "O Lord Jesus," He came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may say that the Triune God came into us, but we need to realize that this One is the divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The divine power is nothing less than God Himself in His Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Triune God as the divine power came into us, and this divine power has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Triune God is the seed within us 1 John 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to see that the very Triune God who is the divine power, the seed of all the things pertaining to life and godliness, is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Godliness includes the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are faithful to cooperate with this all-inclusive seed, the church life will be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has also given us the precious and exceedingly great promises 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible is a book of promises.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has given us faith, the seed of all the things pertaining to life and godliness, and the Word, which has the promises, great and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have everything we need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these verses, the predicate is in the perfect tense: God has granted.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything has been granted, and everything has been received.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All believers, young and old, have received the same three things: faith, the seed of life, and the promises of the Word.</S>
