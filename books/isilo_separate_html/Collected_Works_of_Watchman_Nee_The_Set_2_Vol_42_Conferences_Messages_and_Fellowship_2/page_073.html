From the day that man sinned, the way to the tree of life was guarded by the cherubim and access to it was taken away. God no longer allowed a sinner to eat directly of the fruit of the tree of life. From that time forward, man first had to pass through God's redemption before he could receive God's life. God sent Christ to accomplish the work of redemption on the one hand, and to dispense to us His own life on the other hand. When a man believes in the Lord, not only are his sins forgiven, but he also receives God's life.</p><h2 class="head1">ABNORMAL EXPERIENCES AMONG CHRISTIANS</h2><p>After a man is saved and has received God's life, a number of problems often arise. First, he still sins in his daily life even though he has believed in Christ and received Him as his Savior and life. Second, even though he is able to have a sweet and intimate fellowship with God at times, the fellowship does not last for long. He may feel wonderful in the morning for an hour. But by the time he goes to school, to his office, or to contact others in the hospital, the deep sense of fellowship with God is lost. He discovers that not only does he have besetting sins, but he is unable to have a sustained and sweet fellowship with God.</p><p>Third, there is always the problem of not receiving an answer to our prayer. The Bible does not say that receiving an answer to prayer is the experience of some special kind of Christians. No. Everyone who prays to God should receive answers to his prayer. The Bible promises us that we can enjoy the Father's care all the time. Yet how many of our prayers are answered? Is it not true that they are so few in number that we can count them on our fingers? God's provision for Christians includes answers to prayer every day; there should always be experiences of answers to prayer. But many people find that they have experienced very few answers to their prayers.</p><p>Fourth, there is a problem in understanding the Bible. Many people read the Bible without understanding it; they only touch the letters of the Word. The Bible is nothing but black and white letters to them; there is no revelation, light, or understanding. God has given this book to men. This book is the word of God; it is what men need for their daily living. God's children should receive nourishment from His Word every day, morning and evening, just like taking meals every day. God's intention is that when we open up the Bible, we would find joy, light, spiritual nourishment, and life supply. Yet many people open the Bible merely for the purpose of bribing their conscience. This is not the proper way for a Christian to live.</p><p>Fifth, there is a problem in understanding God's will. Sheep know the voice of their master. In the same way, every child of God should know His will. We are in the New Testament age; this is not like the time of Exodus, when the Lord had to lead the Israelites out by their hand. Today, everyone can know God's will inwardly. Hebrews 8 says that God has placed His laws within a Christian's heart. A Christian does not need to teach his neighbor or brother, because all will know God, from the little one to the great one (vv. 10-11). A New Testament believer does not need to continually seek counsel from others concerning God's will. In actuality, however, many people do not understand God's will nor can they obey God's will. This is not what a normal Christian life should be.</p><p>Sixth, there is the problem of an unwillingness to obey God. A victorious Christian has a heart that wants to obey God. He does not bargain with God. He has the power within him to obey God. A victorious Christian does not dodge the cross; instead, he embraces the cross with joy. We have to admit that many are not living this kind of life.</p><p>All of the above conditions are abnormal. God has prepared a full salvation for us. He is saving us to the uttermost. If we cannot experience God's full salvation, it means that there are problems on our part. The Bible shows us what a victorious Christian is like. There are at least six conditions of a victorious Christian: (1) He should have overcome all known sins; this is the most basic condition. (2) He should be able to sustain an intimate fellowship with the Lord. (3) He should receive answers to his prayer. (4) He should enjoy reading the Word and be able to understand and receive light and supply from it. (5) He should fully understand God's will, and know God Himself. (6) He should be able to obey God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_072.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_074.html">Next</a> </body></html>
