<h1 class="title">The Excellency of Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 8</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Psalm 8 shows that God&rsquo;s purpose and plan for man to express Him with His image and to represent Him with His dominion have never changed&mdash;Gen. 1:26:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The man prophesied in Psalm 8 is the second man, the Lord Jesus, who has recovered man&rsquo;s lost ordination and has fulfilled God&rsquo;s original purpose&mdash;Heb. 2:5-9.</li>
	<li>This second man is also a corporate man, the new man, the corporate Christ, who expresses God in His image and represents God to have dominion over all things for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:10-11; Acts 9:4-5; Eph. 1:22-23; Heb. 2:10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 8 is David&rsquo;s inspired praise of the excellency of Christ&mdash;this psalm speaks of the heavens, the earth, babes and sucklings, man, three categories of enemies, and the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension, the Body of Christ, His coming back, and His kingdom.</li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s name is excellent (majestic) in all the earth, and His splendor (glory) has been set over the heavens&mdash;v. 1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Psalms 3 through 7 it was a mess on the earth, according to David&rsquo;s human concept.</li>
	<li>Here in Psalm 8 the name of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and exalted Jesus (Phil. 2:5-11) is excellent (majestic) in all the earth according to the divine revelation, and the Lord&rsquo;s glory is over the heavens in the sight of David.</li>
	<li>The goal of this psalm is to join the earth to the heavens and bring the heavens down to the earth, making the earth and the heavens one&mdash;John 1:51; Gen. 28:12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings the Lord has established strength (praise&mdash;Matt. 21:16) because of His adversaries, to stop the enemy and the avenger&mdash;Psa. 8:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Babes and sucklings are the youngest, smallest, and weakest among men, indicating the highest consummation of the Lord&rsquo;s work in His redemption.</li>
	<li>The Lord has established praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings because of His adversaries (within) and for the stopping of the enemy and the avenger (without).</li>
	<li>Satan is God&rsquo;s adversary within God&rsquo;s kingdom, God&rsquo;s enemy outside God&rsquo;s kingdom, and the avenger who roves to and fro over the earth&mdash;cf. Job 1:7; 1 Pet. 5:8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>David saw the heavens, the works of the Lord&rsquo;s fingers, the moon and the stars, which the Lord has ordained&mdash;Psa. 8:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The moon and the stars indicate that David had this view&mdash;a view turned from looking at the earth to contemplating the heavens in the night.</li>
	<li>In this view David had a pure vision to see the pure work in God&rsquo;s creation and ordination.</li>
	<li>The aim in the Lord&rsquo;s redemption is to turn us from the messy earth to the bright heaven.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What is mortal man, that the Lord remembers him, and the son of man, that He visits him?&mdash;v. 4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In his view in the heavens, David turned his consideration to man on the earth.</li>
	<li>Man is the central object of God in His creation for the accomplishment of His economy to fulfill His heart&rsquo;s desire.</li>
	<li>The first &ldquo;man&rdquo; in verse 4 is <em>enosh</em> in Hebrew, and the second &ldquo;man&rdquo; is <em>adam</em> in Hebrew, both referring to:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The God-created man in God&rsquo;s creation in Genesis 1:26.</li>
		<li>The Satan-captured man in man&rsquo;s fall in Psalm 8:4.</li>
		<li>Christ as a man in His incarnation for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s redemption in Hebrews 2:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Such a man God remembers in His economy and visits in His incarnation&mdash;John 1:14; Phil. 2:7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord has made man a little lower than angels&mdash;Psa. 8:5a; Heb. 2:7a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This refers to Christ&rsquo;s incarnation with His human living for His all-inclusive death&mdash;John 1:14; Heb. 2:9a.</li>
	<li>In His incarnation Christ was made a little lower than angels, physically not positionally, in the sense of being in the flesh.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God has crowned man (Christ) with glory and honor&mdash;Psa. 8:5b; Heb. 2:7b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This refers to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection in His glory (John 7:39b; Luke 24:26) and His ascension in His honor (Acts 2:33-36; 5:31a).</li>
	<li>This was through His all-inclusive death&mdash;Heb. 2:9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 8:2-5 shows us how the babes and sucklings are produced:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to produce babes and sucklings, God has visited man&mdash;v. 4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God visited man by becoming incarnated, by putting on humanity and becoming a man to be a little lower than the angels&mdash;v. 5a.</li>
		<li>God visited man also by living on earth, dying, rising up from the dead, and ascending to the heavens to be crowned with glory and honor&mdash;v. 5b.</li>
		<li>God visited man through the long journey of His process to become the life-giving Spirit to reach us and to enter into us&mdash;John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; cf. 1 Pet. 2:12; Luke 1:68, 78.</li>
		<li>The incarnated One has become the life-giving Spirit, and it is this One who produces babes and sucklings.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We become babes and sucklings in the initial stage through regeneration:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are remade, re-created, through regeneration&mdash;cf. Matt. 18:3; 19:14.</li>
		<li>Regeneration reduces our natural activity.</li>
		<li>The proper, genuine salvation stops our human doing and makes us babes and sucklings to praise the Lord.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The process of producing babes and sucklings continues with sanctification, renewing, and transformation&mdash;Heb. 2:11; Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	<li>The Lord has perfected praise, or established strength, out of the mouths of babes and sucklings for the purpose of stopping His adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger&mdash;Psa. 8:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God overcomes His enemy through babes and sucklings, the youngest, smallest, and weakest among men; this is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and victory&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 1:26-31.</li>
		<li>All things will be ruled over by Christ with His Body, and all things will be subjected under His feet&mdash;Psa. 8:6-8.</li>
		<li>The perfected praise of the babes and sucklings is the ultimate consummation of the Lord&rsquo;s work of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and coming back to rule on earth:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We may praise the Lord, but our praise needs to be perfected; through transformation we are perfected in praising the Lord.</li>
			<li>The perfected praise is the praise for the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and kingdom.</li>
			<li>In order to praise the Lord, we need to see Jesus, turning our view from the messy earth to the bright heaven&mdash;Heb. 2:9; 12:1-2.</li>
			<li>The perfected praise is the strength out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, the praise that defeats the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger&mdash;2 Chron. 20:22; cf. vv. 12, 20-21.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>&ldquo;Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 13:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God has caused man (Christ) to rule over the works of God&rsquo;s hands and has put all things under His feet: all sheep and oxen, the beasts of the field, the birds of heaven, the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas&mdash;Psa. 8:6-8; Heb. 2:7b-8a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This word was fulfilled in Adam (Gen. 1:26-28), but it was broken by man&rsquo;s fall.</li>
	<li>In Christ&rsquo;s ascension God subjected all things under Christ&rsquo;s feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; Rom. 16:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Body life we participate in the transmission of Christ&rsquo;s subjecting power to put all things under the feet of His Body.</li>
		<li>The God of peace crushes Satan under the feet of those who live the church life as the practical expression of the Body&mdash;v. 20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>This word will be fulfilled in full in the millennium, the age of restoration&mdash;Rev. 20:4-6; Matt. 19:28; Isa. 11:6-9; 65:25.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>O Jehovah our Lord, how excellent (majestic) is Your name in all the earth!&mdash;Psa. 8:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Verse 9 repeats the first part of verse 1 to strengthen the thought concerning the excellency of the Lord&rsquo;s name in all the earth.</li>
	<li>This makes the earth as excellent as the heavens, as indicated in the first part of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer: &ldquo;Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 6:9-10.</li>
