   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the last of the Songs of Ascents, Psalm 134 is the praise of the saint in His going up to Zion concerning the charge and the blessing of the children of Israel to the serving priests in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This psalm indicates that the highest people, those who are in Zion, can bless everyone and teach everyone.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you read the history of the church, you will see that in every age and century God's blessing has come to the church because of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever there are some overcomers, there will be God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God always blesses His people from Zion, from the highest peak, from the ones who have attained to the top, to the position of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From this position God blesses all His people.</S>
