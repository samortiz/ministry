Because of the present urgent need of all the saints everywhere for these kinds of messages, we have published them today
According to God's desire, plan, and redemption, He has ordained that His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, be all spiritual matters and things
If it is something else, no matter how good and valuable, we are merely touching vain and unprofitable things!
The characteristic of Christianity, the root of Christianity, and all its depth and riches are contained in the knowledge of the Son of God
The Lord meant that He is the way for us to go to the Father; He is the method by which we can go to the Father
Thank the Lord that many genuine Christians have at least learned one lesson, which is to go to God through His Son, Jesus of Nazareth
A little while later, another person may come and, upon hearing the testimony of the first group, ask for God's enlightening also
He asks for God to show him his worthlessness, and he learns to trust in God, to be humble, and to deny himself
In other words, the last brother has received a method from the first group of brothers; he has not received the Lord
The brother who thought that he would never fall eventually failed because he had merely gained a method; he did not gain the Lord
Sometimes, we may think that we have not seen very much; we may not be so confident as to say that we have seen the Lord
The mere understanding of a method will not save us; only the knowledge of the Lord as our method will save us
A testimony by others of how they have trusted the Lord will not save us; only our own trust in the Lord will save us
We should realize that spiritual things are living only when the Lord is there, and they are dead when the Lord is not there
When the Lord shines within us, when He becomes the One working within us, and when we realize this inwardly, what we have will be living
You can only say that he does not cause much trouble, or that he treats others politely, that he does not argue or quarrel
You cannot say that what he has issues from Christ, because what he has is natural; it is not life, and it is not Christ
It is Christ manifesting Himself from us, not us utilizing Christ to manifest the goodness that we desire to have
One brother went to meet in a place, and an elderly Christian asked him, 'Why did you go to that place to meet'?
This conversation shows us that life is not emotional stimulations good thoughts wise words clever words logical words or thoughtful words
Experience tells us that many people who are very good at creating a noisy atmosphere know very little about the Lord
After we have learned some lessons, we begin to look to Him more and more, because we know that everything depends on Christ and not on us
After we learned some lessons, we began to understand a little and began to realize that we have to learn to trust in the Lord
Trusting in the Lord does not mean trusting in Him for individual things, but trusting in Him to do what we cannot do in ourselves
After we find out that Christ is our life, we realize that everything depends on Christ and not on our working
May the Lord be gracious to us and show us that spiritual matters are nothing but the Lord that spiritual matters are nothing but Christ
It is wrong for the truth to be something that is apart from Christ, and it is wrong for the life to be something that is apart from Christ
He who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him'
The resurrection of Lazarus was not the greatest thing; the greatest thing is to know that the Lord Jesus is the resurrection
We hope that at least a little light will shine on us so that we can know that the Lord is everything and know Him as such a Lord
There is false repentance, false confession, false salvation, false zeal, false love, false spiritual works, and false spiritual gifts
Those who are experienced and who have learned some lessons tell us that life is deeper than feelings and mental activities
The words that come out of one person's mouth may be life, while the same good words out of another person's mouth may only be nice ideas
It is possible that in one person we have the mind, while in the other person we do not have the mind, but life
We can identify something as mental activity, we can identify something as feelings, and we can identify something as works
Brothers and sisters, one day when the Lord opens our eyes, we will know what life is, and spontaneously we will touch the Lord
Resurrection means that a life bears the mark of death, yet still lives; it is living, yet it also bears the mark of death
It is possible for you to have wisdom without the mark of death, and it is possible for you to have talent without the mark of death
Whether or not others see the mark of death in our eloquence, cleverness, and talent determines whether we have resurrection
Although he is self-confident, self-trusting, self-assured, and very energetic, the mark of death cannot be found in him
Many things that originate from the self will not rise again once they have passed through the cross; they are lost in death
Whatever remains after it has passed through death, and whatever has the mark of death and is still living is resurrection
Resurrection must be something that has passed through death and whatever has passed through death must have suffered deprivation and loss
If you really know what resurrection is, you will find many things removed from you as you pass through the cross
If you really know what resurrection is, you will become another person; many things will be stripped from you
If resurrection is within you, many things have been left behind in the grave, because these things could not pass the test of death
Anything that belongs to resurrection belongs to the Lord's life, the life which has passed through death and which has come out of death
The life we have received is the resurrected life, and whatever we have that has to do with God is in resurrection
One problem frequently encountered in the spiritual realm is that man's service to God is often based on natural things
The oneness of the church can only be achieved when God's children know the cross and deal with the flesh and natural things
It is true that the church needs people who consecrate themselves and who are useful, but the mark of death must be there
If some day the Lord has mercy on us and gives us a severe blow, our self will never rise again, and the scar will remain on us forever
Today scars will be found on those who know the Lord and who experience the Lord as their personal resurrection as well
Many things pass through the grave and are brought to the other side they bear the mark of the cross and they are the things of resurrection
May the Lord not only grant us more life and more of the things which are of Him, but may He eliminate all that we should not have
May the natural things in us be eliminated more and more, and may the things of resurrection be expressed more and more
Whenever we stretch out our own hands, may the Lord show us that there is no resurrection, but only naturalness and the flesh
Brothers and sisters, the more we go on in God's way, the more we will discover that there is only one grace among all God's graces
We do not mean that prayer or reading the Bible is useless, but we should remember that the Lord Jesus said, 'I am the bread of life'
Some people have been dealt with by God; they live before God fearfully, and they are in weakness and trembling
In the following verses the Lord said to the disciples, 'My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work'
After we finish such a work, there is no strength left within us, because something has gone wrong between us and the Lord
We do not preach until we run out of teachings to speak about, and then go and find some new doctrines; this is not our bread
It is wrong if we think that satisfaction depends on resting, on listening to messages, or on spiritual retreats
Even though you may speak enthusiastically, after five or ten minutes of this kind of speaking, you will feel that something is wrong within
There is nothing wrong with your words; the words are right, the attitude is also right, and you have tried your best to help
The strange thing is that the more you speak, the emptier you become, and the more you feel that something has collapsed inside
Whenever you do something by yourself, no matter how successful you are outwardly, inwardly you will feel deflated
You will feel as though the more you work, the more meaningless things become, and the more emptiness there is
The question is not where you have gone, what you have done, what message you have spoken, or how long you have spent in spiritual devotions
It means that when we do anything according to the Lord's will, we are filled within, and we become stronger than ever
At the time the Lord was born in Bethlehem, many priests and scribes could memorize the books of the prophets, but they did not know Christ
We need to realize that when we read the Bible, it is possible that we will gain only knowledge instead of knowing Christ
Some persons say that they have received some light, but the light they are speaking of is not necessarily the light of life
Brothers and sisters, many people can tell us from their experience that what they see in the light of life is often difficult to articulate
It is like a small child lifting a big dictionary; the book may not be very heavy, but it is exhausting for him to carry it
A person can hear eight or ten teachings, and may even be able to recite them clearly and reasonably, but he remains the same
When a doctrine becomes a thing, a teaching becomes a thing, and words become a thing, the result is death; it is not light
A teaching will not do it, the brothers and sisters will not be able to help, and our own effort will not achieve it
Anyone who is self-assured and who thinks he knows everything needs God's mercy, because such a man has never seen the light
May the Lord truly have mercy on us to show us as the days go by that all things are dead and only the Lord is living
Only then will all things be headed up, for if Christ is all and if Christ is in all, all things will be headed up spontaneously
It is not a matter of the Lord Jesus being able to give light, restore sight, and lead those who follow Him out of darkness
It says, 'But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
If God were to say to us, 'I have made the Lord Jesus the Lord of righteousness; He is the One who justifies you,' what would you say?
Our redemption and deliverance are not something that we receive at one time; our redemption and deliverance are a person
We constantly ask for one thing after another we ask for one two three ten fifty a hundred ten thousand a million and ten million things
The amazing thing is that when we believe more receive more and look to Him more we do not get the food that we hoped for yet we are filled
No matter what we are seeking before the Lord, what He gives us is the same-Christ; He is 'a thousand pages of the same thing'
By the fifth year, or even as early as the third year, the situation began to change; the things themselves were gone
He will take away your patience, your love, your power, your meekness, your humility, and everything that you have
You were so sure of this experience that you could almost write down the words: 'My problem with endurance is over'
Brothers, God will take away many 'things' from you; He will only give you One; He will only give you a person
It is human conduct; it is man who is working, seeking, hoping, praying, believing, receiving, gaining, and acquiring something called love
What do you feel when you render some help to a brother and open his eyes and help him to go on with the Lord?
Some people can say that they know Christ as their patience, Christ as their love, or Christ as their humility; this is knowing Christ
Many people know Christ as the Lord of justification, but they still fear God and do not know that Christ is their righteousness
The problem is that although many of us know that Christ is our Lord, we do not know that Christ is our matters and things
All those who know Him only as the Redeemer, Justifier, Sanctifier, or any other '-er,' only know His work; they do not know what He is
Those who know Him as matters and things enter the second stage of their knowing of Him, and their knowing of Him is higher and deeper
Among God's children, some know the Lord Jesus as one of the many gifts of God, while others know Him as God's unique gift
Many people confess that the Lord Jesus is God's gift, which means that they recognize Him as God's unique gift
They consider the Lord Jesus as one from among many gifts of God; that is, He is only the first among many gifts
When this happens, it seems as though we have overcome our shortcomings, and we rejoice in our heart that we have acquired a gift
In this circumstance, many of God's children begin to think that the purpose of God's gifts and grace is just to fill up our lack
Some may say that they have love and that they only need a little more humility, a little more patience, or a few other things
The problem is that many of us have come to realize that what we think we lack before the Lord and what we ask for are merely things
Our lack and our prayers are all centered around the matters and the things; they are all individual, countable objects
As a consequence, when we pray, we ask for patience like that of a certain person, or we ask for humility like that of another person
If we could have patience and humility on top of what we already had, we would have been satisfied and thought that we were perfect
Many people only acquire a thing; yet their heart rejoices and they thank the Lord because they have acquired it
Even if we put all the patience on earth, all the humility, and the myriads of good things together, we still could not make a Christian
Our service to the Lord often demands that we suffer, sacrifice ourselves, and expend our energy and our money
Many times, the rebuke we suffer through sin is not as severe as the rebuke we suffer through doing many good things
The proper principle in God's eyes is not the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but the principle of the tree of life
If He has not said them we should not because once we do we will touch death we will be inwardly weakened and deflated and we will collapse
We have to ask the Lord to deliver us from good and righteous acts as much as we ask Him to deliver us from sins
It is not easy to be delivered from the natural life, because many of us have not condemned the natural life in us
When we first believed in the Lord, God might have been willing to be our Healer, and He might have been willing to heal us
They think that this is something apart from Christ and that everything is over after He has performed the healing
If He wants to put us through His test or do anything else to us, there is nothing that we can do to resist Him
Sometimes to answer His children's immediate need and to accommodate their foolishness, God answers their prayers
He cannot allow patience, humility, or love to continue to exist as things by themselves on this earth forever
Even if he prays and God gives something to him, he only has temporary things that have no spiritual value in God's eyes at all
To others, who also have the experience of grace, their grace comes in the form of a person, who is the Son of God
Many brothers can only differentiate between right and wrong; they cannot differentiate between life and death
He may be patient, meek, humble, faithful, loving, warm, forgiving, and merciful; he may be filled with many things
You can at least tell the difference between a man's hat and his head, his glasses and his eyes, or his clothes and his body
If you can tell the difference between these things, you should be able to tell the difference between a thing and Christ
It is dead in itself, and when you perform this thing, if you have any spiritual sense at all, you will feel dead as well
If we are truly led by the Lord to go on in this way, we will surely find out one thing: God hates sin, and He also hates behavior
As you advance somewhat in your Christian life, God will take things away day by day so that He can give you Christ
Lord, we pray that You would open our eyes so that Christ would become real to us, so that the things will pass away and life will fill us
Lord, build up Yourself in us in a powerful way so that everything within and without us is just Christ, just Yourself
