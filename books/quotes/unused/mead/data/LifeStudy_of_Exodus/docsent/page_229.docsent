   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. CONCERNING MAN S RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS A. Details to the Ten Commandments 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To the Sixth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 21:12-14, 18-32 we have details related to the commandment forbidding murder.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we read these verses, we should observe the principle of noting the sweet spirit in which they were written.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 12 says, He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, according to verse 13, if a man kills another accidentally, he may flee to a place of refuge: And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This provision is for one who killed another by mistake, without having any intention of killing him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 13 even indicates that the slain one was delivered to the other person by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The person was killed because of God s hand, not because a fellow Israelite intended to slay him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, God would not blame one who killed another accidentally.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, we know from Numbers 35 that there were cities of refuge at strategically located places in the land of Canaan to which a person could flee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the provision made for refuge in verse 13, we surely see the sweetness of the divine law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 14 goes on to say, But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that if an Israelite slew a person by guile, he could not find safety even if he ran to the altar and laid hold of the horns of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a person was to be taken away from God s altar and put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ordinances in these chapters all have a spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For instance, the city of refuge typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In His humanity Christ became a city of refuge for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may flee into Him as our refuge because, in God s sight, the things we have done may be regarded as mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we have the right to flee into Christ as our city of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To the Fifth</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 21:15 and 17 we have details related to the fifth commandment, the commandment to honor father and mother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 15 says, He that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 17 continues, And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may not have smitten our parents or cursed them; however, some may have cursed their parents inwardly, within their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To the Eighth</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 22:1-6 there are many details related to the eighth commandment, the commandment forbidding stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these details are sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These verses also reveal that although God is great, He cares very much for details.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To the Tenth</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The details to the tenth commandment, the commandment which forbids coveting, in 22:7-15 indicate that coveting is a matter of greed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not easy to be pure concerning valuables belonging to another which are committed to our care for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I know of a case of a person who was entrusted with the care of a diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He exchanged the real diamond for a synthetic diamond, kept the real diamond for himself, and gave the synthetic diamond to the owner of the real diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The motive for this unlawful exchange was greed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Out of greed children may switch textbooks with another at school or switch pieces of cake at home.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They desire a newer book or a larger piece of cake and make the exchange without the other person knowing it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not only coveting; it is also stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Theft is motivated by greed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there were no coveting, there would not be any stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these verses stealing and coveting are mentioned together, for it is difficult to separate them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, even in the ordinances related to theft and covetousness the spirit and taste are sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To the Seventh</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 22:16-17, 19 we have details related to the seventh commandment, which forbids adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To the Ninth</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 23:1-3, 6-8, we find details related to the ninth commandment, the commandment dealing with false witness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without these details, this commandment may not be adequately clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Exodus 23:1 clearly says, Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.</S>
