Chapters 1 through 9 were given from February 5 through 8 to the church in Taipei concerning various aspects of church service
We must fellowship and pray together concerning the way to advance in the gospel work in the junior high schools, high schools, and colleges
According to statistics, in Taipei there are about one hundred schools that are either junior high school, high school, or college
If we count only the colleges with a day curriculum, there are twenty-one colleges with about one hundred ten thousand students
If we include the students in junior high school and high school, there are a total of three hundred and seventy thousand students
In the city of Taipei alone, there are three hundred and seventy thousand young people between the ages of twelve and twenty-two
The past two thousand years of history show that the gospel, the truth, and the church are a great help to any country or society
When Western missionaries went to China to preach the gospel, their preaching was restricted by the ignorance of the people
We have three hundred seventy thousand 'fish' around us, and many saints are burdened for the gospel in the schools
In the earlier days fruit stores used old newspaper to wrap their products for their customers, but today the packaging is very refined
Preaching the gospel like we did thirty-five years ago is an indication that the church has fallen behind the times
We can never change the truth in the Bible, but there is room for change in the way we preach and spread the gospel
We set off at seven o'clock in the morning, but by nine o'clock in the evening we had covered less than thirty miles
With all the jolting and tossing on the way, my joints were quite sore by the time we arrived at our destination
Nowadays a direct flight from Los Angeles to Taipei takes only twelve hours, and the journey by plane is smooth
Even if people do not want to receive the gospel when they turn on their television they would hear us sing Since Jesus came into my heart
We should consider and evaluate whether we should videotape the activities of the church and put them on television
Even commercial packaging has made improvements, but we are still using methods from thirty-five years ago for the sake of saving money
The Chinese people are intelligent and capable and can succeed as long as they drop the attitude of sticking to the old ways
The Chinese logic, the Chinese economics, is to save money by repairing only the damaged portion of the doorframe
There is a large fishpond in front of us, and the resources of the church, including the brothers and sisters, are rich
We should not think that this provision is sufficient in order for us to succeed in the gospel work in schools
No one can change the fact that two plus two is four, but the way to teach this fact can be progressively improved
To continue in this way is to shut our doors thinking that we are doing all right without paying attention to the advancements all around us
We should not say that Brother Lee is developing some strange ways to lead us and that we did not do these things in the past
A number of saints in the church are serving either part time or full time, and still more saints have a heart to serve full time
There is a Chinese proverb that politicians like to use, which says, 'Circumstances often create a hero, but a hero creates circumstances'
Taiwan may be a small island, but there are still many towns and villages that do not have a church life and need to be gained
We are not beginning a new work, we are not going out under a new banner, nor are we starting another recovery
Dollars cannot be compared to going to a village and raising up one hundred new believers to meet together and serve the Lord
Only this kind of pioneering spirit can stir up the interest of the young saints and cause them to rise up to follow and also serve
The full-timers, especially those who are under the age of thirty, will be assigned to specific schools to carry out the gospel work
Every block of time is an opportune time for the gospel work in schools, whether it is in the morning, the afternoon, or the evening
We need to know how many saints are teaching in the schools and how many are burdened to coordinate in the gospel work
Every district should make a list of the schools in which our saints are either staff or students and include the names of the saints
Once we have the basic statistics, we can identify what each college, high school, or junior high school needs
Most junior high schools do not allow outsiders to enter their campus, but it is permissible to enter university campuses
Some universities do not have dormitories or large open areas, whereas others, such as the National Taiwan University, have large open areas
The parents send their children to school in the morning, and after school they escort their children to extra classes
Through the brothers and sisters who are either staff members or students, we can spread the gospel to the junior high schools
Not only should we invite others to hear the gospel; we can also print material, such as small booklets and gospel tracts
We need to be like gourmet chefs who can cook elaborate dishes using the same three ingredients: vegetables, meat, and fish
Studying scientifically does not mean that we need to use scientific instruments but that we should not use old methods to do things
Everything is studied thoroughly so that seeds are sown at the right time, in the right condition, and on the right ground
Some of the saints have learned the way to preach the gospel in the schools, and they have gained a wealth of experience
Many schools are the object of our work, the target of our warfare, so we need to consider how much manpower we can afford to invest
The church can be compared to the headquarters, supplying all the needs in the propagation of the gospel work in the schools
The first step in propagating the gospel in the schools is to identify the brothers and sisters who are either staff or students
If we contact one or two saints a week, in a few weeks we will have fellowshipped with all the saints in a school
If a school does not have any saints who are students or staff members, we should leave it and begin with another school that has saints
We can greet them, converse with them, give them a gospel tract, and walk with them for a short distance to get to know them
Our saying that the economical Spirit is with us is absolutely different from what the Pentecostal movement promotes
In the 1960s the Pentecostal movement was prevalent in Southeast Asia, and a small number of our saints were affected by Pentecostalism
For this reason, when we begin the gospel work in the schools, we should treasure contacting people one at a time
Perhaps a saint who is a teacher lives near the school or a saint who can receive the students lives near the school
We can ask the saint, whose home is near the school, whether we can bring some students to his home after school hours
If a school looks promising for the gospel work, those who labor in that school should consider moving close to it
There can be gospel tracts, snacks, and something to drink in the living room so that the students can talk freely
Eventually, the parents will find out that their children have believed in the Lord Jesus, or their children will tell them
The full-timers who are involved with the gospel work in the schools must find suitable, nearby locations to receive the students
When our homes are receiving stations, we can contact students on a daily basis, and the care that we render will not be routine or formal
After we build up the habit of meeting with our new ones on the Lords Day we can then bring them to a young peoples meeting on the Lords Day
We can have a conference or a big gathering for all the saints in high school and junior high school at least every six months
We can use it to bring the students step by step into the atmosphere and the realm of the gospel, into life, into truth, and into the church
Perhaps the church can purchase a plot of land in the nearby scenic area and build a recreation center for the students
Perhaps this week the students from hall two use it, and next week the church in Yung-Ho or the church in Ban-Chiao can use it
Having such a place available for the young people will make everyone happy, and its effect will be beneficial
Presently, in the United States the work with the high school and college young people depends on these conferences
They live in the dormitory away from home, and the colleges do not watch over them strictly but allow them more freedom
We need to carefully study how to labor on the college campuses to know how to best utilize their time and how to contact them one by one
According to our experience with institutions such as Ching-Hwa and Yen-ching universities, most professors live on campus
We can therefore use the homes of the saints who are professors at the universities to contact students and even have meetings
The difficulty lies in the fact that the college students have begun to consider certain deep issues, making it easier for them to debate
Not more than two thousand college students can gather together for a week and be trained in life, truth, and the gospel
By the Lord's mercy, after eight mountain trips, when he graduates from college, he will continue with two years in the full-time training
For this reason, the full-timers who are laboring in the gospel work in the schools must be clear and have this goal
We must not be bothered with anything else, not the Lord's Day meeting or any other matters, other than the new students
In principle, whether we serve full time or part time and are under thirty years old, our labor in the gospel should be in the schools
Question: What should we say if people ask us why we do not participate in a campus-wide fellowship involving other Christian groups?
By the end of the sixth century, after several councils Catholicism was officially formed, and the pope controlled everything
They did not accept church traditions; they returned to the truth in the Bible and compared traditions with the truth
As a result, the state church, which appeared first in Germany, believed in justification by faith and was called the Lutheran church
Later a group of believers pursued the truth and saw that the practice of state churches was not according to the Bible
Around the year 1920 this truth reached us in China, and we began to meet outside of any denominational structure
We accepted all the saints regardless of their denominational background, as long as they were genuinely saved
Any so-called campus-wide fellowship is a gospel organization formed by several groups that work together on the campuses
We will not interfere with a believer who joins such a campus-wide fellowship, because this will only give rise to criticism
We are led by the Lord to enter into the church life, and we believe that gradually all believers will know the truth concerning the church
Any endeavor that does not begin with the basics and does not begin small will fail sooner or later, because there is no foundation
An endeavor that does not start small may appear to be doing well, but as soon as difficulties come, nothing will remain
Sun Yat-Sen, the founder of the Republic of China, made contacts in China and outside of China in preparation for a revolution
He made contacts with people in China Hong Kong Southeast Asia and America gaining a group of comrades both young and old for the revolution
In half a year we can gain at least a few solid contacts among the freshmen and lead them to contact another two or three students
In this way, in half a year we will gain twelve students, and in another half year we will have forty-eight students
Not only should the gospel work in the schools be done in this way, but in all the other aspects of the work we should take the same way
Every year we can harvest four kinds of crop: from the families, from students, from the community, and from the children's work
Once there is a stable base for the work in the homes, with little effort, whatever we do will achieve maximum result
After some students are saved, we will gradually receive the Lord's leading and usher them into the church life
In mainland China and even during the early years in Taiwan, we did not have the practice of brothers' and sisters' houses
The Bible does tell us to call on the Lord's name loudly , but our being loud can either be pleasant to the ears or unpleasant
Two hundred years ago, John Wesley broke the tradition of worshipping only in a chapel, that is, a so-called sanctuary
At that time, the tide of the French revolution had swept through Europe, and it would have crossed the English Channel
Apart from that revolution the English society was already going through a change brought about by the effectiveness of Wesley's preaching
The friend was Chinese and reluctantly 'complied,' but he later told others that he would never come to another meeting
We do not require the brothers and sisters who live together to uniformly pray-read the Lord's Word and call on the Lord's name
There is a need to set up rules for their daily living, such as what time the door is locked and what time the lights are turned off
Others may not need to take vitamins to remain healthy, but we may become sick and even die if we do not take vitamins
Some might continue to live without pray-reading the Lord's Word, but we become dry and even wither if we do not pray-read the Lord's Word
We all want the church to be a home that can care for the young and the sick and can feed and give people warmth
Not only should the brothers' and sisters' houses be managed in this way, but the church should also be led in this way
Those who have lived in the brothers' or sisters' house for a longer time should be like older brothers and sisters
If we can cultivate the young ones in this way, in two to three weeks they will be delivered from their old habits
Hall three will be renovated, and we feel that it should be made into a student center because it is situated near several universities
The student center will be larger than a brothers' or sisters' house, and we believe that it will be twice as effective as corporate housing
There needs to be space designated for activities and lounges, and at least two or three floors should be used as bedrooms
Those who are burdened to preach the gospel in the schools or in the community must learn the truth of the gospel
If we are not equipped in the truth of the gospel, we will be short of the element of the gospel when we speak with others
In Christianity giving messages, preaching the gospel, and teaching the truth are taken care of by people who have attended a seminary
In America there used to be a popular trend in which lay people were invited to give messages, preach the gospel, and serve as pastors
In order to announce the gospel, we must know the truth of the gospel, have the utterance of the gospel, and know the manner of the gospel
In particular, the full-timers should spend several hours every morning to study the New Testament and the Old Testament
The sixteen topics in volume 1 are concerning salvation, beginning with the condition of man and ending with the security of salvation
We should memorize the verses related to justification, salvation, regeneration, sanctification, and obtaining eternal life
Peter 2:24 says, 'Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness'
We should memorize such verses so that whether we are at home at school or in the meeting hall we can use these verses to preach the gospel
We need to read God's Word to others, because the Bible has the authority of God, and it has a unique place in people's heart
There was an American brother who used to be a preacher with the Brethren assemblies and was an itinerant traveling evangelist
Later we edited the outline into a small booklet entitled How to Lead Different Kinds of People to Receive the Gospel
We should not provoke him or cause him to dislike us; neither should we cause him to feel that we are condemning him
The second topic is concerning the meaning of the universe, which is also God, whereas the center of the universe, the third topic, is man
There is the evil one of the universe, who is the devil, Satan, and the tragedy of the universe, which is the fall of man
Following these, there is the gospel as the glad tidings of the universe, and Christ as the Savior of the universe
The third group is concerning the main points of the gospel including God the devil man sin the Savior redemption believing and salvation
We need to stay in the 'dye' of the truth of the gospel for a long time so that we are saturated with the gospel
In this way we will be filled inwardly with the gospel, and what comes out of our mouth will also be the gospel
Our publications are the best source to learn the truth, and they are guaranteed not to lead a person into error
In between the church fathers and the Brethren, many believers studied the Bible and put out books, which was their theology
If a believer who desires to expound the Bible takes the Brethren theology as his standard, he will not be far off the mark
Those in reformed theology do not even speak of regeneration, and they do not accept that believers have two natures within them
It is the crystallization of Christian theology, which we inherited by standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us
We save much time by studying the Recovery Version, because many good points in the expositions of others are included in our footnotes
We consulted and studied these riches together with the light we received from the Lord, and then we either included or dropped an item
The most important matter for the young full-timers is to know the truth and then to pursue the growth in life
Another sister, who preached the gospel in the schools, was bold and fearless and was not afraid to lose her job
In Taipei we have the Gospel Book Room with at least fifty to sixty full-time brothers and sisters serving in three departments
If you have a desire and are willing to receive a burden for the gospel the truth life and the church the Lord will bless you and use you
A work that is all show with no substance cannot withstand frustrations, but a work that begins small cannot be thwarted by any frustration
While you are still young, you should learn to plant your feet on solid ground, care for the basics, and not aim high
If you take the way of caring for the basics and move forward in a stable way, you will surely bring in the Lord's blessings
The twelve apostles gathered all the disciples and said to them, 'It is not fitting for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables
Look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need
Whether you are a younger or an older full-timer, since you have given yourself to the work of the Lord's recovery, you should pray
We should pray for the work we are participating in, pray for ourselves, and pray for the move of the work and the target of the work
Prayer is the expression of our attitude toward the Lord that we do not know what to do and that we are not able to do anything
It is not easy for a person who is capable, knowledgeable, and resourceful to ask for help, because he has everything he needs
In serving God, we should never think that we should ask God only when our inability to do something is manifested
If a brother who is about to give a message prays only because he cannot speak well, he will not pray if he speaks well
We encourage the saints to study Greek and to learn many languages, but we should not rely on what we have learned
Otherwise, the education that we have received can act as veils on our mind, just as layers of dust on a window can block the light
Also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done'
When we pray we should learn not to speak so many of our own words because this interrupts the watchfulness and the observing in the spirit
The content of the self is the flesh, the old creation, with its passions, lusts, sins, jealousy, strife, and ambition
The Lord Jesus said, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
The longer we live on the earth the more experienced we may become concerning spiritual things but our self may also become more experienced
Any member that is separated will die, because a member that is detached from the Body is isolated, and this results in death
Two or three saints should coordinate together and learn to fellowship together, checking with one another's feelings
Serving the Lord is a corporate matter that requires the serving ones to come together to fellowship without any opinions
Generally speaking, most people who like to voice their opinions do not have much insight; that is, their view is not clear
Our view and opinion concerning a matter is often affected by several factors: our habits, environment, and tradition
A husband and wife may have morning revival together, pray-reading the Lord's Word and calling on His name in a good way
We should not have opinions about our husband or wife, and we should even refrain from expressing our opinions to our children
If we express too many opinions to our children, it will be easy for them to be confrontational when they grow up
As a result, all their frustrations remain pent up inside, and they express their feelings by pounding on the wall or stomping on the floor
When there is a need to say something, we should look to the Lord to give us wisdom so that we have a thorough view and speak with insight
Those elders expressed their differences so that everything was apparent and open, and this troubled the saints
It may seem that our problems have nothing to do with opinions, but the hidden cause of our problems is opinions
An elder in hall one expects hall one to be the best hall, and an elder in hall two expects hall two to be the best
The saints in Taipei also do not like to hear that the church in Hong Kong is more advanced than the church in Taipei
The brothers and sisters in Hong Kong become angry if they hear someone say that the church in Hong Kong is not good
The brothers from Taichung will be unhappy if they hear that the church in Taichung is not as good as other churches
Because many young full-time brothers will participate in preaching the gospel in the schools, everyone should be clear
We each need to adopt the attitude that my work is to glorify the Lord and that your work is also to glorify the Lord
In a large church it is inevitable that some areas of the work overlap or that there is friction because everyone wants the capable saints
None of the other countries-Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, or Thailand-can match Taiwan
Every business requires its employees to be followers, but we in the Lord's recovery must not have a following
When we are reassigned from one area of service to another, we should go by ourselves and not take any followers with us
Although we are brothers and sisters and members one of another, there should never be a situation of natural relationships among us
As we continue in the Lord these things will be manifested among us not only in the younger serving ones but also in the older serving ones
If there are small groups that do well in the future, we all must learn from their strong points and their merits
It is only in this way that we can maintain the Lord's blessing and maintain our longevity in the Lord's service
We must learn these lessons every day so that we can remain in the Lord's work and allow Him to use us to bring His blessing
Finally, it encourages the saints to preach the gospel in the small group, in their homes, and in their daily living
It may be that out of five homes none will be willing to open, or it may be that only one home is willing to open
The slave thought that he had done a good thing because he guarded his master's money and did not lose anything
We should not only preach the gospel to the children but also labor on the children with weekly children's meetings
Two responsible brothers, who take the lead in the community gospel, need to learn the skill of preaching the gospel
In the international airport in Los Angeles, America, there are young Mormon men in teams of two, dressed in suits
They approach Chinese students arriving from China, and in fluent Chinese they offer to give the newcomers a ride to their destination
Many new Chinese students who are not familiar with the surroundings are gained by the Mormons, because of their zealous help
They learn not only to greet others but also to converse about world politics, and they can speak in good Chinese
In practice, if the saints open their homes for the gospel, they should invite people with the same occupation
If a full-time brother gives the message, he might display an air of preaching, which would not be interesting to the doctors
Not only should we preach the gospel in the medical field in this way, but we should do the same with the policemen
The most effective way is to encourage the working saints to open their homes and to invite their colleagues to hear the gospel
There are many brothers and sisters who have consecrated themselves to be full time, and about two-fifths of them are over thirty years old
There are also saints who are over seventy and are retired, and their children are either overseas or married with their own families
We decided that all the full-timers and part-timers who are over thirty years old will be assigned to the community gospel
She can discreetly find out who lives in each apartment, their occupation, whether they are young or old, and their schedules
After two or three weeks of distributing tracts, we can find a morning suitable to knock on her door and visit her
When the older lady opens the door, we can gracefully and politely inquire if she has seen the tracts that were in her mailbox
If we would continue in this way for one or two years, all the people in the apartment buildings will know that we love Jesus
The way for increase is through the gospel in the community, and the gospel in schools and homes, and the children's work
Most Christian groups that are successful in the gospel take this way, and this way is most suitable for older sisters
Today everyone is afraid of being robbed, but old ladies do not look like robbers, nor do they act like robbers
If the older sisters are willing to take this way, their neighbors will know the gospel after six months to one year
We need to pray and ask the Lord to touch these saints to also open their homes and invite their colleagues to hear the gospel
If the church in Taipei is able to break through in this matter, it will cause the rest of the island to rise up
In Luke 14:23 the Lord told us to go into the roads and hedges and compel people to come so that His house may be filled
We should find ways to compel the people whom we invite until they have no alternative but to agree with the gospel
We are giving the Lord of heaven and earth to people; we are bringing them salvation and grace, as well as life and light
Initially, people may feel that we are bothersome, but after they believe into the Lord, they will appreciate us
Not only so, we should believe in the Lord's word, which says that all those whom we lead to salvation will be our crown
Some may say that it is blessed to have children, but those who have children know that our children often provoke us to anger
Our children in the flesh give us both blessing and anger, but our spiritual children give us only blessing, not anger
With the development of human society and culture, there has been more social and educational emphasis put on children
At the time, our purpose in beginning a children's meeting was mainly to care for the saints who brought their children to the meeting
When we began the work in Taiwan, we also began the children's work because the number of children among us was increasing
Sometimes the children's work needed more than fifty serving saints to prepare the material, teach the lessons, and care for the children
Thirty years later, their children have grown and are serving in the church, bearing important responsibilities
If we had carried this out at that time and contacted ten thousand children, a majority of them would be older brothers and sisters today
We cannot guarantee that every child would have been saved, but at least eighty percent of the children would have been saved
They will continue to be cultivated through three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and four years of college
While they will receive sixteen years of secular education, they will also receive sixteen years of spiritual cultivation in the church
After two years they will know whether the Lord is leading them to serve full time for the rest of their lives
No matter what they do, these saints will have received sixteen years of spiritual education together with two years of full-time training
It is particularly easy for children between the ages of six and twelve to make friends, and they listen to their friends
Our purpose, however, is not focused only on the children, but even more, through the children, we want to reach their parents and siblings
Since the people were ignorant and illiterate, the Western missionaries had to educate them before the gospel could be preached widely
There was no school system established in China, and many towns and villages still had the traditional private tutoring
A brother once testified that he believed into Jesus because a person who did not believe in Jesus said It is very good to believe in Jesus
The Western missionaries put much effort into establishing schools not only to educate people but ultimately to preach the gospel to them
The priest then gives his approval with the condition that the couple gives their children to the Catholic Church
The children may not all be able to travel to the meeting hall, and the meeting hall may not have sufficient space for the meeting
In the church in Anaheim there are more than ten rooms for children's meetings, but the space is still not enough
Even if we have many rooms, it will not be easy for all the children to come to the meeting hall for a scheduled meeting
If their children are abroad or married and their circumstances allow them, they should open their home for a children's meeting
We want to produce a video that shows children from various countries wearing their traditional dress and singing the hymns
After watching the video, we can help the children identify the different nationalities and then say something concerning God's creation
They might not get saved at this time, but at a later time in their life they will remember something and return to the church
The households with children can take the initiative to open their homes and ask their children to invite other children in the neighborhood
They should determine how to contact the opened homes and how to lead the saints to receive a burden and be faithful
We are taking this way to nourish our children and gain many more children so that the gospel can be preached to their unbelieving families
We especially hope that the older sisters can open their homes and gather some children to have children's meetings once a week
Lord by Your grace we are willing to consecrate ourselves afresh to You as a living sacrifice a burnt offering to satisfy Your hearts desire
We thank the Lord that we have already begun the small groups, but in order to maintain them, there are still several needs to be met
The Lord desires us to be His witnesses beginning from Jerusalem then through all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth
Cornelius sent his servants to Joppa to find Peter, and Cornelius also invited his relatives and intimate friends to his home
There are only ten elders in Taipei who are responsible for administration, shepherding, and leading the twenty-one meeting halls
No matter how many saints there are in a church, it is still one church; it cannot be divided into several churches
On the day of Pentecost three thousand were saved in Jerusalem , and a few days later five thousand were saved, not including women
Even though there were many saints meeting in many houses, the believers did not have the flavor of division or separation
According to the Bible, even though there are six to seven thousand saints meeting and serving in Taipei, there is only one church
Apparently the twenty-one meeting halls are separate in their service and leading, but in principle they are one
No legislation can override the constitution; otherwise, it contradicts and violates the constitution of the country
Every state in America has the right to legislate, but their legislation is restricted by the federal constitution
In every meeting hall there was a service of baptism, but the time of baptism was determined in the elders' meeting
After the baptism the meeting hall must give the baptismal information to the business office for their records
In the beginning of the Lord's recovery we accepted the truth of baptism by immersion; this is the light we saw from the Bible
Each meeting hall can decide when and where to baptize people, but it has no ground to change the truth concerning baptism by immersion
The churches in various places can confirm this fact: when the number in a church reaches one hundred saints, the increase slows down
Much effort is required to increase from one hundred saints to one hundred twenty, and it is even more difficult to reach two hundred saints
There are many affairs that need to be taken care of, such as purchasing land and building a meeting hall for the spread
Ephesians 4:11 says, 'He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers'
Today the full-time brothers among us rarely preach the gospel or serve as teachers, nor do they go out as apostles
According to the truth, the administration and affairs of a locality should be borne entirely by the local brothers
There are many brothers and sisters in Taipei who have a heart for the Lord and are useful, but they have not been put to use
With regard to the length of an elder's term, we need to remember that the appointment of elders is entirely according to the Bible
It is a good sign when brothers are willing to serve the Lord for life, but it is not good for such a situation to be without limitation
Since we absolutely abide by the Bible, and the Bible says nothing concerning this, no one dares to do anything
No one can do a thorough and adequate job in appointing forty-six brothers to be elders within only a few days
We will make adjustments according to the situation, and there will inevitably be some corrections when the adjustments are made
They had many responsibilities that they would not have been able to fulfill after they were fifty years of age
The responsibility of the elders should fall on the shoulders of those who are between the ages of thirty and fifty
Unless a person is exceptionally strong physically and mentally it is not so easy for him to function as an elder after the age of sixtyfive
Since a person's physical energy decreases when he turns sixty-five, he should no longer assume certain responsibilities
Even though a brother might be able to bear the responsibility of an elder, his condition can change in three or five years
Otherwise, not only does he suffer harm by remaining in the eldership, but he may also hinder the work of the church
Under such a circumstance, he should not wait for the church to ask him to resign; he should take the initiative to resign
If after a period of time the number in the church increases to three or five hundred this elder will be unable to bear the heavier burden
If he forces himself to remain in the eldership, he is limited in his service, and he will also hinder the work of the church
According to the practical need, he should step down and allow someone more able and qualified to be appointed
When the environment changes and we are unable to meet the need of the church, we should resign and let others bear the responsibility
The saints who handle administration need to be experienced and have a vision, and those who promote need to have energy
The supply of the word is related to teaching, teaching is related to shepherding, and shepherding and visiting are also related
For a church to be strong, it needs to pay attention to these four things: the supply of the word, teaching, shepherding, and visiting
If there are one hundred saints in a church, twenty saints should be involved in shepherding and caring for others
The saints who shepherd and visit must have some experience in life; they need a certain measure of life and some knowledge of the truth
In learning to visit others, we must learn to speak, and what we speak needs to be according to life and truth
If we progress further we will be able not only to speak one message but also to release the Lords word which becomes the supply of the word
In addition to the elders, in every church or meeting hall twenty saints should be charged to teach, shepherd, and visit
As the small groups gradually become stronger, we can set aside twenty percent of our manpower to do the work of shepherding and teaching
It will not be possible for a person to stop coming to the meeting or to become sick without others knowing about it
We must work in this way until one out of every five saints is a shepherd, who shepherds, teaches, visits, and cares for others
The elders, co-workers, ushers, and piano players all attended, because the same group of saints took care of all the services
The community gospel involves people in all walks of life, including the medical field, business, education, and the military
We need the local saints to coordinate in these three aspects of the gospel, but even more so, we need the participation of the full-timers
All the fulltime brothers need to participate in the coordination for the community gospel the gospel in the schools and the childrens work
We will first fellowship concerning the Lord's move in the church in Taipei as well as on the island of Taiwan
He once expressed the desire to write notes to the New Testament, but God never gave him the opportunity to do so
What remains with us from our brother are the books that we have today, but they cannot compare to what he saw
At that time we did not have even one meeting hall on the island, and there were only a few hundred saints here
With respect to the church, there are already more than forty localities with close to ten thousand saints attending the meetings every week
The terms visiting, shepherding, and teaching may not be new, but we must admit that we have not carried them out thoroughly in the past
We will spend much time fellowshipping concerning the way for the church to move forward so that we may find a new way
The testimony of the Lords recovery does not depend on socalled power neither does it depend on socalled miracles or theological teachings
If our reading of the Bible is not thorough and our learning of the truth is shallow, we can be certain that we will not receive light
Believers in today's Christianity who are qualified to speak of the faith are rare, because their knowledge of the truth is superficial
The extent of their faith is that Jesus died for us so that we can believe in Him and go to heaven to be spared from perdition
These items of the truth are nearly buried in Christianity, but they are what we have emphasized over the years
The mystery of the faith refers mainly to Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
Gradually, we saw that the mystery of God was Christ, not morality, ethics, honesty, faithfulness, righteousness, or holiness
While instructing the elders and the deacons, Paul tells the deacons to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience
Although we might not have any wrongdoings, our life is not a life in the Body of Christ nor a life that lives out Christ
Our conscience, which has been enlightened, must be so pure that it wants nothing other than Christ and the church
Similarly, if the elders and the deacons know the truth and live Christ in the Body, that church will be strong and rich
The first matter that we need is to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, that is, to live Christ in the Body of Christ
There are also approximately one hundred churches in South and Central America that have been raised up by this ministry
These churches and the more than one hundred churches in Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa have all been raised up recently
In America there are some in the Lord's recovery who travel from place to place looking for an opportunity to be an elder
The functioning saints stopped laboring in the children's work because no one promoted the work and no one sounded the call
According to my observation, the co-workers have a haughty and lofty manner, and the elders have a bureaucratic flavor
Because their physical energy is decreasing, they cannot bear too many responsibilities, but they are still elders
There were Jews who spoke Greek and Jews who spoke Hebrew, and the two groups could not communicate with each other
Brothers, look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need
Among the co-workers and elders there are always some that are more spiritual and more experienced, who make decisions
The responsibilities of the elders are not under those of the deacons, nor are the responsibilities of the deacons under those of the elders
According to the Bible, the elders should take care of shepherding and overseeing, and the deacons take care of various affairs
The elders should communicate in the way of fellowship, instead of taking a superior position to speak to a saint who is serving as a deacon
He says God has placed some in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers and then he mentions helps and administrations
It is the elders' responsibility to determine how the meetings should be conducted, but this decision should not be made only by the elders
In principle it is the elders who make decisions concerning matters, and their decisions should be carried out through fellowship
There it says that those who want to be great should be servants, and whoever wants to be first shall be a slave
We should not be according to the order in 1 Timothy 3, where the elders are mentioned first, before the deacons
If we do not keep this in mind whenever we think of administration we will be haughty as if we were a general manager ruling over a company
No member in the Body rules over other members; rather, every member keeps his position and exercises his function
The elders should never have the concept that is in society and think that they are the first, the elders, the 'president'
Every saint should function according to his portion and do what he can to the best of his ability in his place
In this way, no manpower and no resources will be wasted, and we will not hinder the Lord's business or waste His time
The word leads is used in the New Testament, but it is regrettable that in the Chinese Bible this word is translated as 'administrates'
The New Testament says that God gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers
An elder may stand up in a meeting and say, 'The New Year is near, and the people in the world are busy shopping
The first thing a shepherd must do is to supply food to the flock by preparing all that the flock needs for food and drink
There is a saying in the Philippines that illustrates the function of a driver: 'The car is here, but the head of the car is not here'
They might not be able to recover all six hundred saints who have not been meeting, but they can at least try to recover half of them
Every meeting hall will be entrusted to two responsible brothers who need to be accountable to come up with ideas
In addition to the elders leading teaching shepherding and promoting in a local church there is still a need for the deacons visitation
There are many names on our list, but less than half the saints come to the meetings regularly, because there is a lack in visitation
We must raise up a sufficient number of saints in the local churches to take up the responsibility of visitation
These saints should know the truth, have some growth in life, love the brothers and sisters, and have a heart to serve the Lord
Some older saints are retired and no longer work, and they do not have much responsibility at home because their children are all grown
We should help the older saints to participate in the work of visitation, but we do not need to give them the title of a deacon
Ushering needs a brother or a sister who is a deacon to bear this responsibility and to ask other saints to serve as ushers
We should use several groups of saints: one group for Lord's Day, another group for Tuesday, and still another group for Thursday
Many saints will be involved in serving as ushers, no one will be tired, and all the services will be evenly borne by the saints
The relationship between the elders and the deacons involves everyone fulfilling his respective responsibilities
We feel that the elders are high and the deacons are low, or that the elders give orders and the deacons take orders
In some churches the manner in which a deacon in the business office contacts the elders is like that of a subordinate reporting to his boss
It is good that the deacons are humble, gentle, and full of love and sweetness when they give a report to the elders
To a certain extent the elders and coworkers have the attitude that they are a special class in the church that they are higher than others
Although they do not say this nor do they make a show of it, they still have a superior attitude, according to my observation
If people who come to the church can tell who among us are the 'bosses' and who are the 'subordinates,' it is to our shame
The responsibilities of leading, managing, shepherding, teaching, and promoting are not higher than the responsibilities of a deacon
The Bible emphasizes the fact that each member has responsibilities, but there is no distinction as to who is higher or who is lower
The Lord Jesus said, 'The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many'
Those who serve as elders have their responsibilities, but their position is not higher than that of the deacons
Those who serve as deacons have their responsibilities, but their position is not lower than that of the elders
Peter says, 'Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God'
Being high or low is an organizational view, but in the organism of a body, there is only a distinction of function
If the eye is higher than the nose, then we would ask, does the nose rule the mouth, or does the mouth rule the nose?
The elders should not give orders to the deacons, and neither should the deacons consider themselves to be subordinates to the elders
If we simply change and let the banker's wife clean the toilet and the servant dust the lectern, we are being political to avoid criticism
We must consider the brothers and sisters as the same, without any concept of rank, and therefore do everything through fellowship
Hundred saints would not be too many to preach the gospel and meet the needs of these six hundred thousand students
My desire is that we would utilize the possessions that we have in coordination with a society that is suitable for the gospel
Since we are learning how to serve in these meetings we are telling you what our feeling is and the goal toward which the Lord is leading us
As long as we are faithful to mobilize every church, beginning with Taipei, we believe that we will accomplish this goal in five years
Almost all the saints in the church in Taipei were mobilized to distribute gospel tracts to every door on the street where they lived
If someone walked on the street and saw gospel banners posted on the two sides of a front door, he knew that it was the house of a saint
Many of those who were newly saved later became elders, deacons, and deaconesses in various localities all over Taiwan
In Luke 14:23 the Lord Jesus told us that to go out and bring people in, we even need to go to the roads and hedges and compel people
Seemingly, this is against what Christianity teaches about being kind, loving, and broad, but this is indeed the Lord's word
We never saw the matter that the Lord Jesus wants us to go and compel others, nor did we see that the Lord wants us to hate
He compared Himself to a man of noble birth who was going to a distant country to receive a kingdom and return
Whether we will be able to rule over ten cities in the future does not depend on fate; rather, it depends on whether we do business
They keep the Lord's salvation carefully and wrap it in a handkerchief for fear that they will be penalized because they lost it
There was a Western missionary who at that time was over ninety years old and could only speak a few Chinese words
He often stood by the street with a big handful of coins, which attracted many children from the poor families to follow him
He took a solid staff with him, and before a villager closed the door, he put his staff inside the door to prevent the door from shutting
When the Western missionaries began to preach the gospel in China, they never went to the house of a wealthy man
In the second stage of preaching the gospel Western missionaries went to the ends of the earth to preach the gospel in all the foreign lands
The roads refer to the main thoroughfares where there is traffic, and the hedges refer to the houses where people dwell
The society of Taiwan at that time was backward, and there were many people who fled from mainland China and did not have homes
We need to go to the roads and the hedges that is to the places where traffic is convenient and the places where people dwell to compel them
If we read the Gospel of Luke thoroughly, we will see that the age we are in today is the third stage of preaching the gospel
It is indeed not easy to go out and reap the harvest; however, those who preach the gospel in this stage will receive a reward
If we can all practice to preach the gospel in the way of compelling, each one of us will bring at least one person to salvation every year
Having a close relative who is not saved indicates that we have not devoted our time and energy to compelling people
According to the parable in Luke 14, we are in the third stage of preaching the gospel; hence, we must compel people to hear the gospel
Rather, the elders and co-workers should receive a burden to encourage the working saints to preach the gospel
We can encourage the saints who are medical doctors, lawyers, legislators, nurses, or policemen to rise up and preach the gospel
The elders and co-workers need to kindle the spirit of the gospel in the saints and raise them up to preach the gospel to their colleagues
Suppose a saint who is a legislator lives in housing appointed by the government, and his neighbors are all legislators
The secret to promoting the gospel in the community lies in the promoters being burning, crazy, and going out to compel others
It is a great thing to encourage the working saints to open their homes and to participate in the gospel at their work place
If we understand that the Lord's heart is to cause His church to increase and spread, we will preach the gospel widely
We are practicing the small groups so that after the small groups are established, every saint's home will become a gospel-preaching home
We also need to encourage the saints to open their homes and concentrate on preaching the gospel to their fellow workers
The saints need to learn to receive a burden for the gospel and not rely on others but to practice preaching the gospel by themselves
Perhaps some might feel overwhelmed by this kind of gospel preaching and say that they cannot do it by themselves
These saints should not merely have a high social status and make much money, but even more, they should preach the Lord's gospel
As long as they are saved, we should help them to fan into flame the gift within them and cause them to have a heart for the Lord
Many of the old-fashioned Japanese-style houses in Taiwan have been replaced with high-rise apartment buildings
For this reason, the brothers responsible for the community gospel must locate all our older saints who live in these apartments
We should ask them to open their homes and preach the gospel to the older people living in their apartment building
The parents focus on their childrens studies and conduct because they expect the children to do well academically and be proper human beings
After the children participate in the children's meetings, they become a testimony when they return to their home
The older sisters who serve the children must believe that if we gain the children, sooner or later we will gain their parents
The church in Taipei should care not only for Taipei, and the church in Tainan should care not only for Tainan
In other words, in order to evangelize the entire island of Taiwan, we must see that each local church is a center to evangelize Taiwan
According to what we have seen and learned from the Lord, we do not want any aspect of the work to have a centralization of power
According to the basic principle in the Bible, in the Old Testament God asked His people to give one-tenth of all their produce
Not only so, there were twelve tribes among the Israelites, and the one tribe, the tribe of Levi, was supported by the other tribes
According to Acts, there were about one hundred twenty people who prayed in the upper room in a house in Jerusalem
When we went to visit their chapel, we noticed that it was very clean, but the furniture and the windows and doors were rather old
Nine thousand saints should produce four hundred fifty full-timers; however, we have a little under two hundred full-timers
If we do not have one full-timer for every twenty saints, we cannot give an account to the Lord, and the Lord will not have a way among us
One of the small groups has been established for a little over two months, and yet it has brought in forty newly saved ones
If we are all willing to do our best, by the end of this year the total number of believers in Taiwan will double
Those full-time brothers and sisters should take Taipei as their center and preach the gospel in the nearby areas
The full-timers produced by Taichung should take Taichung as their center and spread the gospel in the nearby towns and villages
The full-timers produced by a local church are supported by that local church, but the local church does not hire them
The authority to direct the full-timers rests with the co-workers in all the localities, just as it did in the church in Antioch
Those who should resign from their jobs, should resign, and those who should close their shops, should close them
When the full-time brothers and sisters go to the various towns and villages, they do not need to be involved in many activities
We should not be greedy, however, and think that if we would give the Lord a little more, He will give us more in return
Throughout the centuries, every saint who gave one-tenth of their income, according to God's word, was blessed by God
In addition to the regular giving of one-tenth, in the Old Testament there is also the giving for special occasions
After giving one-tenth, some brothers and sisters who have a higher income will have more than enough left over
These saints should not consider what they give for the construction of a large meeting hall as part of their regular giving
Some saints may think that our God extorts high taxes, because there is the first kind of tithe, a second kind of tithe, and other tithes
A person could give a tithe during the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets
What we give to the Lord is merely one-tenth of our income, but the Lord opens the windows of heaven and pours out manifold blessings on us
We may not feel that people's salvation is related to our giving, but actually their salvation depends on our giving
To the one who did not gain even one mina, the Lord said, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas
If we preach the gospel, we will gain a reward, but if we do not preach the gospel, we will receive punishment
If every saint rises up and follows this way, we will have a great prospect of evangelizing Taiwan in five years
From the perspective of sinners, receiving God's salvation is an occasion that is full of warmth and affection
It is possible that our feeling toward a person's repentance and salvation does not compare to the feeling of the angels
The gospel cannot be entrusted to the angels, because the basic principle of preaching the gospel involves the principle of incarnation
Even though an angel appeared to Cornelius and spoke to him, the angel did not have the privilege of preaching the gospel
The Lord said that we could give the money to 'the bank,' and when He returns, He will collect the principle plus the interest
Our answer will determine whether we can reign with Him when He gains His kingdom and returns to establish it on the earth
Fallen man is unrighteous, but it pleases God in His mercy to use us, the unrighteous people, to preach His gospel
Not only has God put unrighteous money into our hand; it also pleases Him to use that unrighteous money to preach the gospel
The Corinthians were Paul's children born in Christ; they were also the friends Paul made by means of his money
If the heavenly host rises up to praise when one sinner is saved, we must regard the preaching of the gospel seriously
In chapter 21 the Lord Jesus went into Jerusalem for the last time, and the city was filled with people welcoming Him
A brother said that we have less children than what we had twenty years ago, because there are fewer children in each household
In some churches the number of children in the children's meeting is larger than the number of saints in the meeting
In order to lead children to the Lord, we must take care of the children's meeting; this includes the matter of teachers
If the person we visit does not believe today, we can visit him again next week and continue visiting him until he is saved
We should consider what will make the angels rejoice: our attending all the meetings or our leading some to salvation
The older sisters can open their homes and preach the gospel to their neighbors who are available during the day
May the Lord kindle a fire in the ten thousand saints who meet regularly so that every saint will have the spirit of the gospel
We are indebted to You for Your grace, Your mercy, and Your glory, but Your mercy is exhaustless and never ceases
Lord, we look to You to give us grace that we may enter into another stage and that we may sense that a new age has begun
There are close to thirteen hundred brothers and sisters participating in this training for the members in the small groups
Praise the Lord that He has gained thirteen hundred members who are each concerned, eager, capable, and have a sense of responsibility
In the beginning of August 1949, when we began the labor in Taipei, three or four hundred brothers and sisters were gained quickly
From the day of Pentecost, when the church was produced, the disciples met in the temple as well as from house to house
The history of the church also confirms that small groups are the most effective way to bring in new ones and to uphold them
All the people brought in through the small groups grow up in the small groups, and they do not need to be prodded to function
In this way every new one becomes a responsible one because the atmosphere in the small group causes every member to exercise his function
After participating in the small group a few times, the new one will spontaneously exercise his function and responsibility
After years of experience we know that in order for a meeting to be rich, strong, living, and high, there must be the Lord's word
In addition, the main points and an outline of the same message can be released in the big meeting on the Lord's Day
It may seem that we are covering only one message a week at a slow pace, but we are actually covering fifty-two messages in one year
In two years they will have read more than a hundred messages and in four years more than two hundred messages
Every week they can read half a message in the small group meeting and read the other half after the table meeting
If this brother needs financial help, the brothers can put something in the offering box to render support and supply to him
Since everyone has been built up through the fellowship in the small group and there is one accord among them, no one will be lost
Make us prosper materially, spiritually, and mentally so that others may see that we are Your living witnesses
In Acts 6 the church appointed seven brothers to serve food, but there was no chief serving brother among them
Deacons and elders were appointed in the New Testament, but there is no record of a chief deacon or chief elder
There were five family members in the home where we met: the older parents, the son and daughter-in-law, and the grandson
In the past the son did not meet regularly, but now that he had a small group meeting, he was stirred up to invite and bring people
There were more than ten persons in that small group, including the gospel friends and those who had not met for a while
Every one of us should learn to lead the small group and should focus on the crucial points in each Life-study message
As long as we have no doubts, we will see the riches in the Lord's word and understand that this is the right way
Not only should we be diligent to go to the small group meetings, but we should bring others to the small group
We should try our best to recover those who have not been meeting for a long time, and we should bring our unbelieving relatives and friends
By the time of the small group meeting we will be very familiar with the content of each section in the message
We should not bring in any other things, speak of unrelated matters, or repeat the old stories of our salvation
In the small group meeting the 'ball' should be passed around, and everyone should learn to pick up the ball and pass it
Not only so, the small group is also the way to uphold the saints and to equip and perfect the saints in the truth
If we do not go forward on this way, there is no other way that we can take, because this is truly the way of the Lord
If we are willing to face the difficulties we encounter, we will succeed, and if we are willing to labor, we will reap a harvest
In the past one person spoke and the rest listened but now everyone is speaking everyone is pursuing and everyone is preaching the gospel
In the service of the small groups we must be active, and we must be concerned, burdened, and willing to exercise our portion
To this end, the members must give themselves to enable the whole church to see the importance of the small groups
Those who are burdened for the progress of the small group should be willing to speak truthfully in love to one another
If there is a review after a meeting, it will be beneficial, and if we review regularly, there will be regular progress
After each meeting we must ask ourselves whether the Lord's word was opened to us and whether we touched the riches in His word
If the Lord's word was not opened to us and we did not touch the riches in His word, then we need to reconsider what profits us
Rather than just beginning and joining in, we often wait for someone else to read, but they are waiting for someone else to read as well
If a person asks a question that is bound to arouse an argument, instead of replying, it is best to smile and to refocus on the subject
If we desire to read the message and bring it to life in the small group, we must recognize the operation of the Holy Spirit in the meeting
We need to know what the Holy Spirit has touched through the reading and then follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to speak
He will have a sense of participating in the meeting, which is totally different from what he would feel if he had never opened his mouth
Otherwise, the gossip will be passed on to another person in another small group, and eventually the entire church will be contaminated
When a person continually expresses his feeling or his view, others may not interrupt him, but inwardly they will criticize him
A person may appear to be using the Life-study, but he is actually recounting an event that occurred many years ago
The absence of new ones in a small group violates the spirit of the small group and is also against the purpose of the small group
Even if the same saints attend the meeting every week, rain or shine, that group will decline if there are no new ones
Every Lord's Day morning more than three thousand saints listen to Your word; we do not want to take this matter lightly
Lord, only You know what we should do concerning the supply of the word in the small groups and after the table meeting on the Lord's Day
Cause each of us to feel a sense of responsibility and to not be spectators but rather be involved in bearing the Ark
It is difficult for a local church that does not receive the supply of the rich, fresh, and living word to be strong
If we use the messages in the same way, the saints may lose their appetite and stop coming to the Lord's Day meeting
The same message can be touched in one way in the small group meetings and in a completely different way on the Lord's Day
We do not want to merely repeat the same content in the message on the Lord's Day, but we are afraid to use our own utterance
We must possess not only general knowledge concerning many things; we must also have cursory knowledge of the biographies of spiritual men
The first message also speaks of the background of the book of Galatians, which is that Judaism and the Mosaic law replace Christ
Concerning all these points we should get into the footnotes, which contain a substantial amount of explanation
When we come to the section concerning the background, we must pay attention to two things in the background: religion and the law
We need to find ways to develop all the material that we have unearthed into our utterance, making the message rich and interesting
We must not merely repeat a message that is used in both the small group meeting and on the Lord's Day, because God's word is too rich
After hearing a message, we should not think that we do not need to hear it again; rather, we need to hear it again and again
The next day after much consideration he quoted the same verse and he continued to speak the same message concerning how God loved the world
The audience was not bored with the message; instead, they felt that the truth of God's loving the world was endlessly precious
After staying in a place for one year, they would move on to another place because they had exhausted their sermons
If they do not move to another place after exhausting their sermons, they would begin to speak on unrelated matters
If each of us can take what we read in the morning and apply it in the small group meeting, the result will be impressive
If we can spend two years to devote ourselves to the small groups and lay a foundation, we will reap a great harvest
In order to practice the Body life, we first need to see that the Body is a living entity, an organism of life
We need to know that our being members of the church is not because we are Christians who were baptized and have joined a group
After we were saved, the life of God, like electricity, entered into us, and we thus became one entity in the life of God
The church became degraded because it departed from its function as an organism in Gods life and fell into the organization of human society
It is not easy to give a message to an audience of one thousand people, and not all seminary graduates are good speakers
Many saints among us have listened to messages for more than twenty or thirty years and have become experts in listening to messages
Their criticism may be accurate, but after listening to so many messages and criticizing the speakers, can they themselves speak?
The advantage of having big meetings was to produce those who could meet with others and teach from house to house
If there had only been Peter, it would have been impossible for him to go to these homes and speak to all of them
When we began the work in Taiwan, the number of people increased greatly, and we began the practice of small groups
Gradually we also went downward, because we dropped the practice of the small groups and stressed only the big meeting
It is easier for the elders, the co-workers, and the saints, because all we need to do is to bring our Bible bag to the meeting
In one meeting only six saints function: two during the singing, two in the Scripture reading, one in speaking, and one in the prayer
Although this seems like a big help to the other saints, none of the other saints need to exert their strength or exercise their function
We must see that these six people have not done anyone a favor; rather, they have annulled the organic function of all the saints
There will be three hundred sixty new ones every week, and there will be close to one thousand five hundred new ones in four weeks
The Lord's recovery has been on this island for thirty-six years, but the gospel has not yet been preached throughout the land
Even though transportation and communication methods have greatly advanced, we have not spread the gospel to all of Taiwan
We have to confess our shortage before the Lord and produce many more full-timers so that the gospel can be preached widely
In the New Testament nine persons supporting one full-timer is more advanced than eleven supporting one in the Old Testament
According to the practice of this group, at least one in every twenty saints was sent overseas to preach the gospel
In the past it was expensive for Europe or America to send missionaries overseas, yet they had the spirit to do so
The church where we are will be able to declare, 'We spend money, energy, and even ourselves for sinners' souls'
We should function in the meeting, we should function by giving our bodies to serve full time, and we should function by giving money
During those years many full-time serving ones were produced, and the number of saints on the island grew to almost forty thousand
The churches in Taiwan have a more solid foundation, and the saints have progressed in knowing the truth and growing in life
Security is good, the transportation system is developed, education is available to all, and the economy is booming
Instead of the government restricting the church from preaching the gospel, it grants the church many favors to preach the gospel
Besides this, the missionaries translated the Bible into the local languages of some of the other countries in Asia
Even though the circumstances were difficult, it took them less than two centuries to spread the gospel throughout the whole world
We have been here for more than a quarter century, and yet we have not spread the gospel throughout this island
For many years all the churches have been stable, without any turmoil, problems, heretical teachings, or disputes
He also said, 'You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth'
We have not even taken the gospel to the area surrounding Kaohsiung, not to speak of the uttermost part of the earth
Neither would it be too much for there to be thirty to forty churches that were established by the saints sent out from Kaohsiung
During the past thirty years, no less than five to six thousand people were baptized in the church in Kaohsiung
The saints who meet regularly should set aside at least one day a week to look for the saints who have not been meeting for a long time
If a dormant brother is only available during the table meeting, we should sacrifice the table meeting to go and be with him
If we are willing to sacrifice even the meetings to be with the dormant saints, in two or three months they will be recovered
In order to evangelize Taiwan in five years, we must produce five hundred full-timers every year, beginning from this year
Our burden in the Lord's recovery is to spread the gospel so that the gospel would multiply and increase in this age
Suppose there are seventy-five full-timers, and every full-timer needs ten thousand New Taiwan dollars a month
We must remember what the Lord said concerning using unrighteous mammon to make friends while the mammon is still useful
If we can meet the construction need with five hundred thousand dollars, we should never use five hundred twenty thousand
We would rather have a simple meeting hall, which can shield us from the wind and the rain, than be short in sending out full-timers
Most of the saints will not be able to work for the Lord immediately after they set their heart to serve full time
In every aspect of our daily living-what we eat, what we wear, where we live, and how we travel-we should save money for the Lord
The co-workers should give themselves for the Lord's sake by offering up whatever they can to bear this burden
Every small group should take care of itself, and the members in the small groups should have mutual care for one another
The saints must change their view concerning the church life, from stressing the big meetings to emphasizing the small groups
We should give the big meetings only forty percent of our time, and the rest of our time should be given to the small groups
