   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE EIGHT STANDING FIRM IN ONE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>STRIVING TOGETHER WITH ONE SOUL Scripture Reading: Phil 1:27-30</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The basic concept of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would have a proper understanding of Philippians 1 and the extraordinary expressions used in it, we need to see that the controlling concept, the governing factor, of the whole book is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should interpret Paul s expressions not according to our natural understanding, but according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Virtually every point in this book is related to Christ and the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>EXERCISING BOTH SPIRIT AND SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1:27 Paul says, Only conduct yourselves worthily of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent I may hear the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together in the faith of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need not only to stand firm in one spirit for the experience of Christ, but also to strive together with one soul in the faith of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be with one soul for the gospel work is more difficult than to be in one spirit for the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This requires that, after being regenerated in our spirit, we be transformed in our soul, especially in our mind, which is the main part, the leading part, of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1:27 Paul charges the Philippians to stand firm in one spirit and to strive with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nowhere else in the Bible are the terms spirit and soul used together in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning our standing, we need to be firm in one spirit; concerning striving together, we need to be with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to exercise both our spirit and our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We exercise our spirit to stand firm, and we exercise our soul to strive together in the faith of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To strive here is to struggle, to work by fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>STANDING BY STRIVING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is important to see that we stand in one spirit and strive with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to differentiate between the prepositions in and with.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In one spirit we stand; with one soul we strive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We stand before God, but we strive before man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before God we must stand as a testimony, and before man we must strive together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, according to the grammatical construction of verse 27, standing firm in one spirit and striving together with one soul are not two separate things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul does not charge the Philippians to stand firm in one spirit and then to strive together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, he charges them to stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul s way of writing indicates that in order to stand firm, we need to strive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Striving is in fact part of standing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We stand firm in one spirit by striving together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the difference between in one spirit and with one soul ?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why does Paul not say with one spirit and in one soul ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And why does Paul say stand firm...striving together instead of stand firm and strive together ?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let me use a simple illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose a father says to his son, Eat quickly, using your fork properly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is different from saying, Eat quickly and use your fork properly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the first command, using the fork properly is the way to eat quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the second, eating quickly and using the fork properly are two distinct matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of the background, Paul did not tell the Philippians to stand firm and strive, but to stand firm, striving together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the Judaizers were so active, it was necessary for the believers to stand firm and not be distracted, shaken, or moved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a firm standing was especially necessary during Paul s absence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul, the one who could establish the believers, was away from them, but the Judaistic teachers, those who were preaching contrary to God s economy, were at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was the reason that toward the end of chapter one Paul charged the believers to stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if they were to stand firm, they would have to strive together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Apart from striving, they would not be able to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in this case striving is not a thing separate from standing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, striving is the standing in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we today only stand but do not strive, eventually we shall be shaken by the opposition or moved by it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not adequate simply to encourage others to stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I repeat, in order to stand firm, we must strive and fight.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Striving is the way to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, to strive is to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Another way of putting it is to say that in order to have a defense, we need to be on the offensive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not know how to go on the offensive, we shall not have an adequate defense.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we would defend ourselves, we must take the offensive against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The point here is that defense requires offense.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the reason that in 1:27 Paul does not make standing firm a separate matter from striving together.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, he indicates that these two matters are one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In some places the churches are standing firm.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, they are not doing much striving.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If these churches do not begin to strive and fight, eventually they will be shaken or moved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the churches need to be aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By striving in this way, they will be able to maintain their stand.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if the churches do not strive, sooner or later they will be shaken and moved.</S>
