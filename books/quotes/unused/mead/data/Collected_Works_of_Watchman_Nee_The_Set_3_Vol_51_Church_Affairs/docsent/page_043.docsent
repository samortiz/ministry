   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING The Real Worship Service</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The bread-breaking meeting is already quite clear among us, but we must always tell the brothers in various localities to take note that the bread-breaking meeting is the real worship service, the real worship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Divided into Two Sections</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this meeting we need to see that the first section is always toward the Lord and the second section toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the first section we see the One who was sent; in the second section we come to the One who sent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first section we always meet the Lord, and in the second section we meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Spontaneously, when these two sections are joined together, the bread-breaking meeting is on the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The First Section Needing to Be Quick</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brothers and sisters, the first section of the bread-breaking meeting must be quick.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If your appreciation for the Lord Jesus comes slowly, there will not be enough time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, if the first section is slow, there will not be enough time for the next section.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must touch the Lord in a quick way during the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps there should not be too many hymns or too many prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As soon as you touch the Lord, begin to break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After you break the bread, immediately come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am afraid the problem today is that we begin to break the bread too late.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps I can say it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many times you may feel that before God the brothers have already reached the climax of their feelings toward the Lord, yet they have not broken the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the meeting goes down.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After a while a high point is reached the second time, and they still do not break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The meeting goes down again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps not until a high point is reached a third time do they break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In principle you should break the bread when you reach the high point the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you break the bread when you reach the high point the first time, you will have time to worship God later.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Need for the Burdens to Be Discharged</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The principle of two or three persons in 1 Corinthians 14 is the principle of speaking the word, not the principle of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we limit the time and the number of people for prayer, I am afraid that some burdens may remain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am afraid that if the burdens are not discharged after a while, people will go home with their burdens still heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is because when people come to the bread-breaking meeting in the Lord's presence, there are many burdens to be discharged, and if we limit the time and the number of people, their burden will not be discharged, and the burdens of the church will not be discharged either.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have much feeling concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Very often we have not broken the bread when we have reached a high point.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We break the bread after we have climbed to the top two or three times.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is indeed too late.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The moment that we reach the high point is always the time to break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps after a few prayers or hymns, we have already reached the high point.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should then break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then there will be sufficient time for the worship of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Leading Us to Worship Together</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The brothers must see that during the time for the Father, the Lord's position is not the same as it was in the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At this time, the Lord begins to lead us to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is the Lord who leads us to approach the Father together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is the Lord who leads us to sing hymns of praise to the Father together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Son Himself is involved, and He and the many sons praise together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During the second section it is always the case that the children of God together with the Lord Jesus come before God to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The meeting should reach such a level.</S>
