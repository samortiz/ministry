   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 For the Faith Once for All Delivered to the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Timothy 6:12a Paul says, "Fight the good fight of the faith," and in 2 Timothy 4:7c he says, "I have kept the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, Jude 3b tells us that we should "contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these verses "the faith" refers not to our subjective believing but to our objective belief, that is, to what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith Acts 6:7; 1 Tim 1:19; 3:9; 4:1; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim 3:8; Titus 1:13 , in which we believe for our common salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This faith, not any doctrine, has been delivered once for all to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this faith we should contend.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament faith has both an objective meaning and a subjective meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When used in a subjective sense, faith denotes our action of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Used in an objective sense, faith denotes the object of our belief.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1 Timothy 1:19 the word faith is used in both a subjective and objective sense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here Paul says, "Holding faith and a good conscience, which some thrusting away have become shipwrecked regarding the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first reference to faith in this verse is subjective; it denotes our capacity to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second use of faith is objective; it denotes the object of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The faith our belief is constituted of certain basic truths.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, we believe that God is one yet triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, we believe that our God became incarnated in the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Third, we believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God incarnated as man, lived on earth and died on the cross for our sins to secure our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the third day He was resurrected from the dead both physically and spiritually, and today He is our Savior, our Lord in resurrection, and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because we believe in Him, our sins have been forgiven, He has come into us as our life, and we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, the Lord Jesus will come back to receive all His believers to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These are basic truths, basic doctrines, that constitute the faith for which we should contend.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because every sound, genuine believer holds these basic truths, they are called the common faith Titus 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The faith in the objective sense is equal to the contents of God's will given to us in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The law includes the contents of the Ten Commandments and all the subordinate ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law was given in the Old Testament, but what God gives in the New Testament is the faith that includes all the items of God's new will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will even includes the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, it does not include such matters as head covering, foot washing, or methods of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, some believers contend for such things, thinking that they are contending for the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But that is not the correct understanding of what Jude means by contending for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To contend for the faith is to contend for the basic and crucial matters of God's new will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One of these basic matters is Christ's death for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Someone may tell you that Jesus died on the cross not for redemption but because He was a martyr and sacrificed Himself for His teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This understanding of the death of Christ is heretical; it is contrary to one of the basic items of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we need to contend for the truth concerning Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This illustrates what it means to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The faith, the common faith, has been delivered to the saints once for all, and what we need to do now is to contend for it.</S>
