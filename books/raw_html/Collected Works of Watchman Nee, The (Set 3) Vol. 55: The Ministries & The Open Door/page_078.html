<p>I have no other intention than to exhort the brothers and sisters to not miss our special opportunity. There have never been as many wonderful and numerous opportunities as those that we are facing today. If we but open our eyes a little, we will see these opportunities. Let me repeat: We should not miss any opportunity. If we seize every opportunity, we will stop many things from happening. If we grasp every opportunity, distracting situations will not develop in some areas. Diversions developed in some areas because the brothers were lazy and poor. The brothers should be strong to take action. Once God moves, we should move. We should not give up any opportunity.</p><p>I am happy that God has given us opportunities. When an opportunity comes, we find money coming as well; souls are saved, and the work advances. If we just afford these opportunities a little opening, they rush in. The problem, however, is that opportunities do not wait for us. When God opens the way for us to do something, we must do it. Once time moves on, the opportunity is gone. If we wait until tomorrow to do something, we will miss the opportunity. It may be useful to talk to a brother today. However, if we wait until tomorrow, it may no longer be useful because the opportunity is gone. We must have spiritual insight, and we must have spiritual senses. We must ask God to preserve each opportunity He has given us.</p><p>Recently, I experienced a great change in my feeling. I believe the Lord wants our senses to be sharpened. If we make any mistakes now, we will lose the God-given opportunities, and once these opportunities are gone, we may have to wait a few decades before they will come again. Perhaps I will conclude my words here. But I still want to bring up some practical matters. Once the new believer edification meetings are well established, I believe we should find a way to reach out to the groups that love the Lord and are amicable to us. We should establish fellowship with them and bring them to the church. In the past our emphasis was to gain sinners from among the "Gentiles." Among believers, we only sought to bring in individuals. We were afraid that people would say we were stealing sheep. We were hesitant to go out to them. This was our attitude in the past. Even to this day, we have taken this way. This was what the Lord wanted us to do in the past.</p><p>After the second Kuling conference, my feeling began to change. It was not a doctrinal change. Over the past three months, this inward feeling has become stronger and stronger. Today I feel that we must not only gain lovers of the Lord individually but must gain group after group of those who love the Lord. Suppose there is a group of people who love the Lord in a pure way, who are not a mixed denomination. Suppose further that the people there do not know the church and have not taken the same way as us. When the new believer edification meetings are well established, I think the Lord will want us to fellowship with such a spiritual group. Of course, if the new believer edification meetings are not strong, we cannot stand up easily. All the brothers must be mobilized to go out and reach these ones. We did not do this in the past; we must do it now. We must pray much. Everyone must consider before the Lord to see if these feelings will grow within us. On the one hand, we must emphasize the gospel. On the other hand, we must pay attention to the spiritual groups. We will gain not only individuals but entire groups. The responsible brothers in each locality must see if this is what the Lord wants us to do today.</p><p>For example, there is the "Family of Jesus" Church. Perhaps the time has come when we should gain them. We can learn something from them. They know more than we do and are more advanced than we are in the matter of possessing all things in common and living the communal life. They can help us. Perhaps, we can help them concerning the truth of the church. This can become a great move of God in China. May God lead us. If this is His opportunity, I hope we do not miss it.</p><p>If our goal is to bring all the groups that love the Lord into the same way, there are many other spiritual groups aside from the Family of Jesus. All the brothers and sisters have to rise up to do this. We want to turn them as a group. I am presenting this matter before us today in a simple way. I hope we will spend some quiet time to meditate upon such God-given opportunities. This is the opportunity of opportunities. We do not want to miss it; we want to take advantage of it. We must repent and confess our sins for having missed so many opportunities! We have continually dropped the opportunities which God has given us. If we had not lost so many opportunities, there would be more than one meeting hall and one place for training today. There would be more than one communal farm today. I hope that from now on, no opportunity will escape our feelings and our eyes. If we take the way of opportunities, perhaps we will be able to gain a few more steps along the way.</p><p>Watchman Nee<br />Shanghai,<br />July 19, 1950</p>
