   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN PERFECTING THE SAINTS AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ESTABLISHING THE CHURCH SERVICES LEARNING TO ADAPT TO THE ENVIRONMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fellowship in this chapter is concerning the work and is mainly related to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most of the co-workers have a particular way of doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a co-worker goes to serve in a locality, he wants the elders and the saints to hand everything over to him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the elders hold something back, the co-workers feel that they cannot work, because they are restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This attitude must be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the reason that the work does not have an effect among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, even if the elders were to do whatever the co-workers tell them, I question how much the co-workers would be able to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The co-workers serve in a way that causes everyone else to become unemployed because they must be directed by the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, the co-workers may not be able to properly exercise their function.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, not only are the saints idle, but the Lord s work is hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is very difficult for a person to change his temperament, habit, and style of work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As soon as a person becomes the master of a domain, everyone must listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This creates problems in the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, if we do not drop this concept, our work will have no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The co-workers will not be able to coordinate with others, nor will others be able to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is an existing problem among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The co-workers have this flavor in their work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Forgive me for saying this: Not every saint is qualified to be a co-worker when he begins serving full time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, all the brothers and sisters who serve together are co-workers, but this does not mean that they can take the lead in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some saints think that the co-workers are apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every saint is a disciple, and every disciple is a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the co-workers want to be useful in the Lord s hand, they must adapt to their environment and not expect the environment to adapt to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some brothers said that there are many capable saints in the church in Los Angeles and that the serving ones there are also capable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I serve, I do my best to bring the saints into function.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church in Los Angeles is the fourth or fifth church that I have served.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I was in northern China, there were many capable ones there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There were many capable ones in Shanghai, and there were even more capable ones in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, initially the serving ones are not necessarily capable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The truth is that the saints who are brought into function become capable, but those who are not brought into function remain limited.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we perfect the saints, we do not necessarily need to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even without our taking the lead, the saints can still be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the co-workers must not depend on others being accommodating.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The co-workers must be like rainwater, which can seep through any crack.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the past we have said that the co-workers should be accommodating of others to the point that they are like glue.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Glue can be applied to a horizontal surface as well as to a vertical surface; it can be applied to an area under a table as well as to a surface that is slanted.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, glue can be applied to objects of any shape, whether they are pointed, round, or rectangular.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The co-workers have no alternative but to be like glue, which can be applied to any surface, in any condition, even if the surface looks messy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They can be accommodating in their function when they are in a locality where the church affairs are in order, and they can also be accommodating in their function when they go to a locality where the church affairs are not in order.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wherever they go, they need to function as glue, no matter what the situation is in the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The function of the co-workers is to be accommodating like glue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They should be accommodating whether or not the elders restrict them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From this time onward, we should be more direct in our dealings with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whoever is not willing to go to a certain place to serve should be compelled to go, and whoever is not doing an acceptable work should continue serving until his work is acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not right for a co-worker to do poorly in his service or to do an average job.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He must serve in a satisfactory way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A co-worker who is afraid of being restricted by the elders should be asked to serve with the strongest elders so that he can learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The elders in some local churches are very restrictive, but they have been sovereignly prepared by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the co-workers serve, they must adapt to their environment and not expect the environment to adapt to them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the past I wanted some co-workers to go to the West and serve in countries such as Canada, the United States, and Brazil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, when I once recommended a co-worker to some local brothers in the West, they were concerned about his temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A person with a temperament problem has difficulties in accommodating others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For this reason, the co-workers must visit other places.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more places they visit, the broader their experience and knowledge will be.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The brothers who have gone overseas may not be skilled and experienced, but they have a broader view of things because they have been living abroad, they know the situation of the churches in China, and they have contact with many Westerners.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many problems in the work are due to the inability of the co-workers to adapt to their environment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without the ability to adapt to our environment, we cannot be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The usefulness of a co-worker will be very limited unless his concept is changed, no matter whether he is abroad or in his own country.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some want others to revere them, but they do not revere others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This indicates that they are not accommodating in their service; instead, they want to be the master.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If they cannot be the master, they are not willing to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have always had this problem, even when we were in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If not for this problem, the work would have spread to many places.</S>
