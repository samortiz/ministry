   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this chapter we will consider the God-men and the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I. THE GOD-MEN A. Born of God to Overcome Sin and the World</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The God-men are born of God to overcome sin and the world 1 John 3:9; 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As God-men, we were born not only to be saved but also to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First John 3:9 tells us that we were born to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then 5:4 tells us that we were born to overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sin and the world are two big seducers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within us sin is seducing us continually, and outside us the world seduces us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be an overcomer, we need to overcome the first line of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In a battle there are battle lines.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have been born of God to overcome the first line of the enemy, which consists of two items, sin and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. Destined by God to Conquer All the Oppositions and Persecutions, the Hard Environments, and the Difficult Situations</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only so, we are destined by God to conquer all the oppositions and persecutions, the hard environments, and the difficult situations Rom 8:31, 36-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After being saved, we, the God-men, are destined to travel not on a plain, smooth highway but on a rugged way full of troubles, trials, temptations, persecutions, attacks, and oppositions John 15:20a; Acts 14:22; 1 Thes 3:4; 2 Tim 3:12; 2 Cor 11:23-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before we were saved, many of us had a smooth family life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we believed in the Lord Jesus, our family life may have become very rugged.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, we are destined to conquer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the second line of the enemy that we must overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After being saved, many Christians are unable to overcome sin and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, they become indulgent in their lust and in their enjoyment of worldly pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some believers temporarily overcome sin and the world, but they are not able to overcome the problems and the difficulties and all kinds of attacks, criticisms, persecutions, and oppositions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They do not dare to take the Lord's way, which is a constricted and rugged way Matt 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, they compromise with the opposition that they encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, to please his unsaved wife, a believing husband may compromise by participating with her in the enjoyment of worldly entertainments and pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians know that they should overcome certain things, but when they are threatened by opposition, they compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning the church life, some Christian leaders know that the denominations are wrong, but they dare not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They dare not give up their involvement with their denomination, because they are afraid of losing their position as a pastor or a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the second line of the enemy that we must overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. Called by the Lord among the Churches to Be the Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin and the world are the first line of Satan, and the oppositions and persecutions, hard environments, and difficult situations are the second line.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In addition to these two lines, the enemy has built up a third line to frustrate the lovers of Christ from going on to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This third line is the degradation of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The God-men are born of God to overcome the first line of Satan, and they are destined by God to conquer the second line.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To overcome the third line, the God-men have been called by the Lord among the churches to be the overcomers Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 .</S>
