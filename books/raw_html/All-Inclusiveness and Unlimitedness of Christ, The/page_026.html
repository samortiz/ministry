<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>IN HIS LIVING OUT AND TESTIMONY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Gal. 2:20a; 2 Tim. 4:22; Phil. 1:19-21a; Acts 1:8; Rev. 1:9; 21:2, 10; 22:5b</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In His multiplying resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6) He becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit—1 Cor. 15:45b.</li><li>This all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling and living in the countless members whom He has regenerated—Gal. 2:20a; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li><li>We living Him out by the bountiful supply of this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (Phil. 1:19-21a) as His witnesses and testimony—Acts 1:8; Rev. 1:9.</li><li>This testimony being universal and spreading to the uttermost part of the earth—Acts 1:8.</li><li>The ultimate consummation of this testimony being the New Jerusalem, which is eternal, full, and endless—Rev. 21:2, 10; 22:5b.</li></ol><p>In this message we will see how the all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness of Christ can be seen in our living and testimony. We live out and testify Christ, and in such a living out and testimony Christ is all-inclusive and unlimited.<h2 class=head1>WE BEING ALL-INCLUSIVE IN OUR LIVING ONLY BY LIVING OUT CHRIST</h2><p>People have problems because they are not inclusive. Once again we may use husbands and wives as an illustration. Many of you are married. Please tell me, is there inclusiveness between you and your husband or wife? Are you inclusive with your wife? Are you inclusive with your husband? If you are willing to speak an honest word, you will admit that no one is inclusive. Nevertheless, when your experience of life reaches an extent in which you can truly say, “It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me,” then you are inclusive. The reason why couples are separated or divorced is that they are not inclusive. Sometimes the husband thinks that his wife is a burden to him and he has no way to be inclusive with her. Sometimes the wife also feels that her husband is too annoying and she has no way to be inclusive with him. Why are you not inclusive? It is because you are not the multiplication of Christ. If you can truly say, “I am crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live,” then you are inclusive, and your inclusiveness is unlimited. The truths that we have released in these messages are not empty doctrines but can be put into practice in spirit. If you can say, “O Lord, I am crucified with You, and it is no longer I who live,” then you will have no problem getting along in the church with ninety thousand brothers and sisters, let alone nine thousand. You will be able to be inclusive with everyone.<p>In the churches, I often come across brothers and sisters who come to me with their problems. In America, sometimes some brothers who are overseas Chinese have come to me, saying, “Brother Lee, we can’t stand a certain American brother. His American flavor is too strong.” In less than two weeks’ time, an American brother may also come, saying, “Brother Lee, how can this be? Those Chinese brothers bear too much of the Chinese flavor!” We can see from this that when we live in our self, there is no way for us to be inclusive. We must see and realize that we are the multiplication of Christ. “It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.” Whenever we live by Christ, we live out His all-inclusiveness.
