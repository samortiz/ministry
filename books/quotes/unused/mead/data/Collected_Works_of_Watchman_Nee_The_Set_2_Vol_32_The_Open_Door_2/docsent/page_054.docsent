   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>T'ai-yuan, Shansi Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank God our Father, who has sent us our desire The Open Door....Last August I went with two co-workers, Sisters Shang Yee-rong and Wu Deh-shin, to my hometown of Tai-Gu.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God opened the door of preaching for us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In every meeting there were forty to fifty women.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later, Brother Chai En-shang also came to work in Tai-Gu for a week.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through negotiations with the supervisor of the students at Ming-Shien Girls' School, we were allowed to preach the gospel at the high school.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were ready to invite Brother Witness Lee to come to work in Tai-Gu, but there was no transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I graduated from Ming-En School ten years ago, and I have been working in it for five years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In T'ai-yuan Sisters Han Miao-ying and Chang Li-yeh are taking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Two weeks ago I received a letter from Sister Peace Wang in Szechuan, telling us that she will soon go to Kweichow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sister in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chang Chui-hsi, in my sickness, August 22</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank God that Issue No. 11 was published in Hankow under His grace! This issue is being typeset in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We hope it can come out safely in October through your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the past month I have received a few letters reminding me of something concerning this publication.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I take them to heart and am very grateful for them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, one brother wrote, "In one issue of The Open Door, you mentioned one item briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although it may not stir up much attention, I am afraid that mentioning this news will cause the readers not to turn away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this work is legitimate, we should pay proper attention to it, because it would mean that God has one more worker.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if this work is not proper, we should ignore it altogether."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I was directed by my reasoning at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While I did not trust in the brother, his letter seemed to indicate some kind of a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since I was afraid of being bound by my own prejudice, I only deleted the portion of the letter which pertained to his work and published the part about his escape from the war.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition, I said in that issue, "Some news is good, but if the editor does not feel peaceful about publishing it, she will not dare publish it."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I was referring to the deleted part of this brother's letter that has to do with his work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Recently, I checked into this matter and found that this brother has written many places telling others how God had greatly used him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Certain believers who contacted him said, "He is liable to lie, despite the fact that what he says is similar to what you are saying."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, we cannot control others from becoming false apostles, but neither are we willing to remove the rooftops of others and uncover them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The best we can do is ignore them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have no way to stop anyone from utilizing the podium or taking godliness as a means for base gain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But a church such as Ephesus will be able to discern those who call themselves apostles but are not.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, those who are truly spiritual will recognize who these people are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We still hope that the brother says these things out of an ignorance of his self, not out of a willful intention to deceive others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A few other brothers wrote, "You should be careful and discreet in publishing the condition of local churches, personal letters, reports of personal work, or stories about the work of others."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They also quoted examples, saying, "In one issue you said that a certain brother was giving messages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We dare not say such a word before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In another issue you published a letter by someone whose salvation is still doubtful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It would be better to be more careful and discreet in such cases.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, in another issue, the report is not very accurate."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be careful and discrete is truly right in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But there are often difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With most of the news, I have done my best to cut off certain things so that we will not fall into exaggeration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With some letters, the writer is my personal acquaintance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to avoid problems, I have investigated, according to my ability, the trustworthiness of the statements that come from other sources.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is inevitable that there will still be mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are two points, however, I wish to make.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, I hope that by prayer I will have a clearer inner guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the other hand, I hope that all correspondents will take care not to exaggerate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, if anyone knows of anything that requires correction, please do not hesitate to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the first page of every issue, we have the words: "This is a personal ministry and not the official publication of an organization."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we wish that the co-workers and the local churches would pay attention to the fact that in this magazine, the recommendation or nonrecommendation of any individual and the selection or deletion of any news of the work or of the churches are of a personal nature and are not in the nature of any official organization.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All relationships are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As to the offerings designated for the work, Brothers Ho Yueh-chiao and Lan Tsi-yi and myself are merely entrusted to transfer money to others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not a faith mission.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even the cares among the co-workers are lessons in supplying the needs of others; no one is responsible to anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our eyes should be set on God alone, and our hearts should give thanks to Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Recently, most of the brothers and sisters who are in Hankow, Ch'ang-sha, and Szechuan have found ways to meet their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We thank the Lord for His grace with all of our hearts!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot predict the future of Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Should communication with Hankow become blocked, all questions and orders should be sent directly through Mr. Ho Nai-yee in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I will leave Chungking for Kuei-yang soon and will be in K'un-ming in the middle of October.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then I may go to Kweilin or back to Shanghai via Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All news of the work and the churches should be directed to Brother Weigh in K'un-ming if you are sending it before the middle of October.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After the middle of October, please send it to Mr. Ho Nai-yee, P. O. Box 1664, Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Ruth Lee in Chungking</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>September 14, 1938</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>ANNOUNCEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Omitted</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>ADDRESSES OF A FEW CHURCHES</S>
