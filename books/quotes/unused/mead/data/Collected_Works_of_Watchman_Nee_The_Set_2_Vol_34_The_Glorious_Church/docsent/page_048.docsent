   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At this point we must realize how useless it is to put our emphasis merely on doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must never think that we will benefit if we only know a little more theology or scriptural teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are not of much use.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only that which is burned into us by the Holy Spirit is of value.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If something has not been burned into an article, a little rubbing will remove it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What spiritual value is there in something which can be wiped away from us with a little rubbing?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This does not mean that we should not read our Bible, but it does mean that what we read is of value only when the Holy Spirit burns it into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All precious stones have come out of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To have precious stones, we need the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without fire, there will never be any precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason we should never refuse the trials that come upon us through our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should never refuse the discipline of the Holy Spirit, nor complain when God's hand encircles and encloses us in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How bound and pressed we feel many times!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How we would like to break through all the bondage and limitation and be released for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we must remember that we are in God's forming hand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is forming us so that one day we will come out as precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has not only given us His life, but He is also working in us to the extent that we may possess a special quality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what the Holy Spirit is forming in us through all the circumstances which God allows, and this is called precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What use is it then to merely have knowledge or doctrine?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only that which the Spirit burns into us is of any value.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only when a Christian has received something through burning will he be able to preach messages from what he really knows rather than from books.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only that which has been burned into us by the Holy Spirit is precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, it is wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes when we sit in the presence of an elderly person, we feel that he is one who is really walking with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a life in him which very much characterizes him; it has become his special nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can only bow down before him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There may be others who have a greater ministry than he and others who have undertaken a greater work, but he has an abundant life; something has been formed within him by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has a special quality, something which has come out from the fire; he is a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the presence of such a one we can only bow and say, "How we wish that we also may have something that is so inspiring, so touching."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not words which inspire and touch people, but something which has gone through the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the New Jerusalem there are precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without precious stones, the New Jerusalem will never come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God needs precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He needs a group of people who will manifest the quality of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh, may God deliver us from being shallow!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only what the Holy Spirit has wrought into our life is of any value or use.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 21 continues, "And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Jerusalem consists not only of pure gold and precious stones, but also of pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Pearls are not formed by burning; they are the result of a gradual formation within a sea creature after it has been wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the meaning of pearl is life which issues from death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Pearl signifies the life released by the Lord Jesus in the non-redemptive aspect of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Matthew 13 also speaks about a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To whom does this pearl refer?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a reference to the church, which the Lord has formed out of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was willing to sell all that He had in order to purchase this pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Pearl signifies something positive, not something passive or negative.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the church, the new man, that God desires to create.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Within such a One there is no problem of sin, nor of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was willing to sell all to obtain this pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This shows us how precious is the life which is wholly out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How precious it is to God, and how precious it is to Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the New Jerusalem, pearls function as the gates of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that everything of God starts from here.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, in order for man to obtain life before God, the life must not be something of man, but of the death of Christ, of the non-redemptive aspect of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First Corinthians 3:12 says that spiritual building should have materials of gold, silver, and precious stones, not wood, grass, or stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In 1 Corinthians 3 there are gold, silver, and precious stones; but in Genesis 2, in the garden of Eden, there were gold, precious stones, and pearl there was no silver.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Revelation 21, in the New Jerusalem, there are once again gold, precious stones, and pearl; there is no silver.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is the significance of this?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Gold, precious stones, and pearl these three items are found both in the garden of Eden and in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that gold, precious stones, and pearl are from eternity to eternity.</S>
