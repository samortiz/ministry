<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>We, the believers of Christ, were born in Adam in our natural birth with all his involvements.</li>
<li>In Adam:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We were of the old creation.</li>
	<li>We were fallen.</li>
	<li>We became sinners before God with sin in our nature&mdash;Rom. 3:23; 7:17.</li>
	<li>We became dead in our spirit because of sin in our flesh&mdash;Eph. 2:1, 5; Col. 2:13.</li>
	<li>We became God&rsquo;s enemies by following God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan&mdash;Rom. 5:10a; 8:7; Eph. 2:2.</li>
	<li>We were in the kingdom of Satan under his authority of darkness&mdash;Matt. 12:26; Col. 1:13; Acts 26:18a.</li>
	<li>We were loving the world, which lies wholly in the evil one and of which Satan, the evil one, the enemy of God, is the ruler&mdash;1 John 2:15-16; 5:19b; John 12:31.</li>
	<li>We were condemned by God under His wrath&mdash; John 3:18b, 36b.</li>
	<li>We were sentenced by God to die, to perish in the lake of fire forever&mdash;Heb. 9:27; John 3:16b; Rev. 21:8.</li>
	<li>We became flesh, not being subject to the law of God, unable to please God, and having no possibility of being justified by God&mdash;Gen. 6:3a; Rom. 8:7-8; Gal. 2:16b.</li>
	<li>We were walking according to the age of this world and according to the ruler of the authority of the air in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh, being the children of wrath by nature&mdash; Eph. 2:2-3.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We are regenerated in Christ in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3); in this rebirth the divine transfer takes place and transfers us out of Adam into Christ.</li>
<li>In Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We were chosen by God the Father to be holy to partake of His holy nature and predestinated unto sonship to possess His divine life&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5.</li>
	<li>We are judicially redeemed, forgiven, justified, and reconciled to God&mdash;Eph. 1:7; Rom. 3:24; 5:10a.</li>
	<li>We are organically regenerated to be the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ, for the constitution of the church, the Body of Christ&mdash; 1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:14, 29; Eph. 1:22-23; Rom. 12:5.</li>
	<li>We are sanctified by the Spirit of life with the element of the divine nature (Rom. 15:16), renewed from the oldness of our old man by the Spirit of life (Rom. 12:2b; Titus 3:5), transformed by the Lord Spirit with the life element of Christ (Rom. 12:2b; 2 Cor. 3:18), conformed through the transformation in life to the image of the firstborn Son of God, making us the many God-men, the mass reproduction of Christ the God-man, the prototype (Rom. 8:29), and glorified to be completely redeemed in our body, the framework of our entire being, for the full enjoyment of our divine sonship (Rom. 8:30, 23).</li>
	<li>We are delivered out of the evil kingdom of Satan, the authority of darkness (Col. 1:13a), freed from the warring, subduing, and killing power of sin (Rom. 6:7; 7:11, 17-23), freed from the yoke of slavery of the law (Gal. 5:1), and freed from the vanity of the old creation and the slavery of corruption (Rom. 8:20-21).</li>
	<li>We are made a royal priesthood and a holy nation (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9), the overcomers over Satan (Rev. 12:11), the overcomers over the world (1 John 5:5), more than conquerors over the environmental troubles (Rom. 8:35-39), and the kings to reign in the eternal life forever (Rom. 5:17, 21).</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>In this message we want to see the divine transfer of the believers from Adam to Christ. Praise the Lord that in the whole universe there is such a divine transfer of the believers. This is not like a transfer of furniture or office material from one place to another. This is a transfer of God&rsquo;s chosen people, who were chosen by God in eternity to be holy and who were predestinated in eternity unto His sonship (Eph. 1:4-5). These elect of God need a transfer because they became fallen from the proper position to another position. They need a transfer that will bring them out of their fallen position back to God&rsquo;s ordained position.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Epistle to the Romans &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
