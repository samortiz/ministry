The brothers and sisters must be able to study the Bible, manage practical affairs, and preach the gospel. In particular, the young brothers also need a vocational skill. This skill has to fit the requirements of the government everywhere. We cannot move an ordinary wage earner into the interior of China, because this does not fit the requirements of the local government. The church in the inland regions cannot support us, and we become a burden to them instead. If we have some special skill, we will not only support ourselves when we move inland, but we will be able to support others as well. Those who are migrating should know some Bible truths. They should be able to manage practical affairs, and they should be able to preach the gospel. But they must also be able to sustain themselves with a living. Shanghai shortly will move another group to Yi-Yang. Two hundred people have signed up already, but we can only choose thirty among them for the move. In Yi-Yang saints go for months without a single dollar of pocket money to spare. This is the reason everyone has to have a skill and be able to support himself.</p><p>In choosing an occupation, we should not have the concept that some jobs are noble while others are lowly. The age has changed. The young brothers and sisters in particular should change their concept. Do not be ashamed of being a manual laborer. On the contrary, all of us have to learn to be manual laborers. When the need of migration arises and we have the desire, the church can send us, and it will be easy for us to coordinate with others. If possible, I hope that some will go to the university to study medicine. Today there is a great need for doctors and nurses everywhere. There are too many doctors and nurses in the cities, but there is a shortage in the villages. There is a need for doctors and nurses all over China from the north to the south. In the future, professional people like doctors, nurses, and chemists will be welcomed everywhere. Some brothers in Shanghai are starting a dye factory and desperately need chemical technicians. Perhaps some pharmacists can go back to school to learn something more about medicine. The dye factory can also train some specially skilled workers and dye technicians. Yi-Yang can buy four or six mills and provide jobs for the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Wherever we go we form large cooperative farms. This matches the land reform policy of the government. In addition to farming, we can also do some small scale ranching. Concrete workers, carpenters, and accountants are also good professions. These professions or skills can be very useful to the migration. Hence, we should not study a subject that does not support long term employment. I hope that the twelve leading brothers here will spend time to get into this matter. Our job should be permanent in its usefulness, and it should be good for coordination with others.</p><p>Some saints in Chefoo have migrated to the northwest. That can be considered the first migration of the church. Yi-Yang is our second migration. In the future there will be more and more migrations. All the migrants should be able to sustain their living by working with their two hands. Today we should never choose a job that is easy. May the Lord grant the brothers and sisters the grace to offer up everything in an absolute way. May we prepare ourselves for the migration. We should not wait until a migration comes to discover that we cannot do anything.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF MIGRATION<br />EVERYWHERE AND THE CENTERS</h2><p>The centers of our work in the coming days include: Shanghai for Kiangsu province, Swatow for the Hakka dialect region, and Ch'ang-ch'un for Manchuria. In the future, six or seven co-workers will go to Ch'ang-ch'un. Presently there are sixty assemblies in Manchuria, and about twenty to thirty of them need men. The co-workers will be leaving next week.</p><p>The provinces of Hopeh, Shuiyuen, and Chahar have Peking as their center. K'un-ming will oversee the province of Yunnan. There are many Miao natives in Yunnan. Most of them are populated around the Nu River. There is the need for people to give themselves to care for these ones. Presently, we do not have any work in Kwaichow; there is the need of some positive pioneering. The northwest is centered in Lanchow, which takes care of Sinkiang and Tsinghai also. Presently, there are three assemblies in Tsinghai. In the future some will need to migrate to Lanchow. Presently, the province of Shensi cannot be under Lanchow; it can have Sian as its center. The "ministry house" that is set up now is for training the young brothers and sisters in Bible study. The work of migration in Shanghai is going on smoothly. Some have migrated to Nanchang. Therefore, we can set up a region in Nanchang now.</p><p>The work of migration in all these places requires financial support. We hope that the amount of work and the amount of money offered can match one another. When we told you to sell some of your possessions the last time, half of those proceeds should be left in Hong Kong for the purchase of the meeting hall. The other half should be given to the responsible brothers and distributed to the above mentioned places. Let the money you have offered be sent to other places and let it work for the furtherance of the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD OF CLARIFICATION</h2><p>I must say a word of clarification here. In a sense it is redundant to say this, but I will speak of it in passing for the sake of those who want to be clear about everything. This is not the greatest thing to say, and many of you can say this for me, but the list of places that we just spoke of does not include Kuling. The Lord forgives me for boasting. From the first day until now, Kuling has not received any income from anyone. Hong Kong offered a little sum once, and Swatow also offered once, but it was used for food expenses in Kuling; these offerings were not designated for the work. We will only accept the offering of those who have passed through the training in Kuling. This is not a narrowness of heart on my part. I simply do not want to give others an opportunity for criticism. Since 1934 I have not received any offering from the churches. It was only two weeks ago that I first received an offering of fifty dollars, but I have transferred it to those who are in need of food.</p><p>If I relax my standing, the Lord's work will suffer a setback. I make this declaration because I want to be honest to you. I have to maintain my standing as a worker of the Lord. It is not a matter of being too proud to bow my head to receive offerings from others. I want to maintain the honor of a worker of God. I do this to make sure that my mouth is not shut up. This is my standing, and this is Kuling's standing. I have not allowed any of my co-workers to touch one penny of the work's money. Brother Witness is here. Please excuse me for saying this word to you: Any attack on him is an attack on me. If Brother Witness makes a mistake in anything, it is my mistake. Many people have offered us very cheap criticism, but in the end they will not move a little finger of their own. It is wrong for us to love money. It is wrong for us to love the world. Please forgive me for saying "a foolish word." I say this to show you that the sincerity of Christ is in me. No one can stop me from boasting this way. My word is not to lower my own standard. In every place our co-workers have to do the same; they should not do this only in Hong Kong. I expect our testimony to be above the criticism of the fault finders. I want to show that all the criticisms are untrue. The reason there is so much criticism is that some people love money. This is the reason they made up all the slander. We have to know that our co-workers are laboring with a burden on their shoulders. This is a little word of clarification from me to those who are listening as bystanders here. May the Lord be merciful in regard to what I have just said.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_094.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 95</div><br></body></html>
