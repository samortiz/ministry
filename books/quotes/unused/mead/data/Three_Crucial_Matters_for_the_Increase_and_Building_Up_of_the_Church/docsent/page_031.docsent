   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE MAKING A PROFIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND GIVING PEOPLE FOOD BEING CONSIDERATE OF ONE ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND SHARING THE BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order for a training to be successful, the trainers and the trainees need to be blended together so that they can work together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is difficult to carry out the training if the trainees are scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is under the administration and leadership of the elders, but because most of the elders have jobs, it is difficult for them to participate in the training.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, they bear the responsibility of being an elder in the church, and on the other hand, they work to support their families.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In today s industrial and commercial society, earning a living can be compared to fighting a battle; everyone must endeavor, compete, and struggle for his existence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not criticize the elders by asking why they do not attend the training or why they do not go door-knocking when the saints go door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The elders desire to participate in the training and to go door-knocking, but their situations do not allow them to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are a family, and we should understand one another s situation and be considerate of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The trainers should be able to take care of the needs of the training, and the elders should bear their responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should all function to meet the need through fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the elders lack the time to take care of the various needs, they should allow others to help them in the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CHANGING OUR CONCEPT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE DIFFICULTY IN CHANGING THE SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is difficult for us as human beings to change our concepts; hence, it is not easy to change the system.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The 1911 revolution in China is an example.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nearly eighty years ago Sun Yat-sen led the revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty and established the Republic of China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the fact that there are still problems in China today indicates that the revolution was not entirely successful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows that it is not easy to change a system.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I was a young student in Chefoo, Western influence was prevalent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There were many foreign consulates, and there were post offices for countries such as France, Japan, and Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I attended an American school that was founded by an American missionary board.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The school was an international school with students from Korea, Russia, and other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some of the students wore Western suits, but when they wore their suits outside the school premises, people insulted them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A person was also reviled if he spoke English.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, at that time I did not wear Western suits, and I dared not speak English.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1949 when I came to Taiwan, I still wore Chinese-style clothes and shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I did not begin wearing Western suits until I traveled abroad, because it was difficult for me to change my conservative concept.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now it is natural for me to wear a Western suit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Related to English, even though I studied English as a youth, I still speak poorly because the environment did not allow me to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was scolded whenever I spoke English.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now speaking English is a trend, and sooner or later everyone must learn to speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s church has come to a standstill both in Christianity and in the Lord s recovery; there is no spread and no increase.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christianity has been in Taiwan for more than a century, but today only one person out of every forty is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even in America Christianity is not spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This proves that the old system is wrong, because it kills the function of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>SEMINARY EDUCATION BEING DIFFERENT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>FROM THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christianity emphasizes pastors and preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, there are many seminaries around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The seminaries all teach Old Testament Hebrew and New Testament Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is good because both of these languages are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the seminaries do not teach classes that are according to the divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In their history classes they consider matters such as whether the Pentateuch was written by Moses and whether the biblical record concerning Abraham is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In their geography classes they research which lands belonged to Pharaoh and to other kings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In addition to these courses, they also teach psychology and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, the more that people study psychology and philosophy, the further they are from God, and the more they feel that the Bible is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is taught in the seminaries is different from what we teach in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-studies are full of light, life, and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Pastors and preachers graduate from the seminaries and teach the Bible, but people are often not satisfied with what they teach.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Seminaries emphasize the preaching of the gospel, and as a result, many people are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is regrettable, however, that after their salvation these people cannot obtain an adequate supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Seminaries also pay a great deal of attention to the methods of preaching the gospel, to sermons, and to managing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They also study how to be social, how to contact people, and how to understand human psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even though the seminary students have the Bible in their hands, they may not understand the things in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They know what the Bible says concerning Abraham and Moses, but they do not fully believe or receive what is recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some believers think that the identity of the author of the book of Hebrews is still undetermined, but we are clear that Paul wrote Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These points show that Christianity is poor because it does not teach people to enter into the truth and revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For this reason, we must change the system to ensure that the condition of the church meetings does not fall into the condition of Christianity.</S>
