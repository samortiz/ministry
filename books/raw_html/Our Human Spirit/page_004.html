<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRITS OF THE PROPHETS</h2><p>Revelation 22:6 tells us that the Lord is the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets. In addition, 1 Corinthians 14:32 says “The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.” The spirits of the prophets refer not to the Holy Spirit, but to the human spirits of the prophets. When I was a young Christian, I was taught that with the prophet of God there is always the need of the Holy Spirit. I was never told that with the prophets of God there is also the human spirit.<p>On God’s side there is the divine Spirit, the Spirit of God. On our side there is the human spirit. When these two spirits meet one with another there is a divine “deal.” We have such a divine deal by having God as the divine Spirit and our human spirit meet one with another. In dealing with God, the human spirit is just as important as the divine Spirit. Without the divine Spirit, there is no way for us to contact God. In the same principle, without the human spirit, there is no means, no organ for us to contact God.<p>We all have to know that we have such a spirit. If you are going to be a good medical doctor, you must spend a long time studying the body. If we are going to be proper Christians, we must study the spirit.<h2 class=head1>MY SPIRIT</h2><p>In Romans, Paul says I serve God in my spirit (Rom. 1:9). The very God whom I serve, I serve in my spirit. Don’t think “my spirit” is just a New Testament term. Psalms 77:3 says, “I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed.” Also, Psalms 77:6 says, “I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.”<p>“My spirit” is not just a New Testament term, but also an Old Testament term. When I remembered God and considered all the troubles, my spirit was overwhelmed. I commune with my heart and my spirit made diligent search. Brothers and sisters, have you ever exercised your spirit? Have you ever used your spirit? Do you have this kind of experience?<h2 class=head1>PROVOKED IN SPIRIT</h2><p>In Acts 17:16 Paul was provoked when he saw so many idols in the city of Athens. When he saw the idols he was provoked in his spirit. He served God in his spirit, and he was provoked with the evil things in his spirit.<h2 class=head1>MEETING BY MY SPIRIT</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 5:4 Paul says he even gathered with the saints at Corinth by his spirit. While he was absent, he said, “When you and my spirit are assembled.” He was away from Corinth, but he was attending their meeting. His body was away, but his spirit was attending their meeting. Have you ever attended some church meeting by your spirit while you were away from that church? While Paul was away physically from Corinth, he was still attending their meeting.<h2 class=head1>MY SPIRIT REFRESHED</h2><p>Furthermore, Paul says in 2 Corinthians 2:13 that he couldn’t find his brother Titus, so he had no rest in his spirit. Then in 2 Corinthians 7:13 Paul says Titus was refreshed by the Corinthians in his spirit. Also, 1 Corinthians 16:18 says that some of the saints have “refreshed my spirit and yours.” The spirit of Paul and the spirits of the saints at Corinth all had been refreshed by some dear brothers.
