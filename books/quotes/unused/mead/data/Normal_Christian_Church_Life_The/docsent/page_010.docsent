   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SEPARATION OF WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yes, it was the Holy Spirit who called Barnabas and Saul, but He said to the other prophets and teachers as well as to them, "Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Holy Spirit spoke directly to the apostles, but He also spoke indirectly through the prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What was said privately to the two was confirmed publicly through the other three.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All apostles must have a personal revelation of God's will, but to make that alone the basis of their going forth is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, the opinion of others, however spiritual and however experienced, can never be a substitute for a direct call from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the other hand, a personal call, however definite, requires the confirmation of the representative members of the Body of Christ in the locality from which the workers go out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us observe that the Holy Spirit did not say to the church in Antioch, "Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was to the prophets and teachers He spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For God to make His will known to the entire assembly would scarcely have been practicable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some of its members were spiritually mature, but others were only babes in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some were wholeheartedly devoted to the Lord, but it is highly improbable that all the members sought the Lord with such singleness of purpose that they could clearly differentiate between His will and their own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God therefore spoke to a representative company in the church, to men of spiritual experience who were utterly devoted to His interest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And here was the result: "When they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away" Acts 13:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The setting apart of the apostles by the prophets and teachers followed the call which came to them from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The call was personal, the separation was corporate; and the one was not complete without the other.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A direct call from God, and a confirmation of that call in the setting apart of the called ones by the prophets and teachers, is God's provision against free lances in His service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The calling of an apostle is the Holy Spirit speaking directly to the one called.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The separating of an apostle is the Holy Spirit speaking indirectly through the fellow workers of the called one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is the Holy Spirit who takes the initiative both in the calling and separation of workers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, if the representative brethren of any assembly set men apart for the service of the Lord, they must ask themselves, Are we doing this on our own initiative, or as representing the Spirit of God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If they move without absolute assurance that they are acting on behalf of the Holy Spirit, then the separation of the worker has no spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They must be able to say of every worker they send forth, He was sent out by the Holy Spirit, not by man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No separation of workers should be done hastily or lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was for this reason that fasting and prayer preceded the sending forth of Barnabas and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Barnabas and Saul were separated for the work, there was prayer and fasting and the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The prayer and fasting was not merely in view of the immediate need of clear discernment regarding the will of God, but in view also of the coming need when the apostles would actually go forth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And the laying on of hands was not by way of ordination, for Barnabas and Saul were already ordained by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here, as in the Old Testament, it was an expression of the perfect oneness of the two parties represented.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was as though the three sending forth the two said to them, "When you two members of the Body of Christ go forth, all the other members go with you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your going is our going, and your work is our work."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The laying on of hands was a testimony to the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It meant that those who remained behind were one with those who went forth, and in full sympathy with them; and that, as they went, those at the base pledged themselves to follow them continually with prayerful interest and loving sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As regards all sent ones, they must pay attention to these two aspects in their separation for the service of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, there must be a direct call from God and a personal recognition of that call.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the other hand, there must be a confirmation of that call by the representative members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And as regards all who are responsible for the sending forth of others, they must on the one hand be in a position to receive the revelation of the Spirit and to discern the mind of the Lord; on the other hand, they must be able to enter sympathetically into the experience of those whom they, as the representative members of the Body of Christ, send forth in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The principle that governed the sending forth of the first apostles still governs the sending forth of all apostles who are truly appointed by the Spirit to the work of God.</S>
