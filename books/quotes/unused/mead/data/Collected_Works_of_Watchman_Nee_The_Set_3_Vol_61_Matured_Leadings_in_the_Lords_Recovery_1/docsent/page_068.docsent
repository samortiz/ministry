   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSECRATION NOT A REPAYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT A RESPONSE TO GOD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the past two thousand years, countless numbers of people have consecrated themselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In one sense we may say that they were paying back in gratitude what they owed, but it is hard to say that there was any paying back at all, because they all felt that they were unworthy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What they had consecrated were worthless items when compared with what they had received.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Lan once said that we are like beggars; it is actually a joke to say that we are offering anything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Psalm 116:12 also says, "What shall I return to Jehovah for all His benefits toward me?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people have the thought of paying back, but they dare not say this with their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They can only say, "God, under Your great and unmatched grace, I should at least offer up myself to You."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 12 is a most special chapter in all the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It tells us that the beginning of the Christian work is consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapters one through eleven tell us the great things God that has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter twelve, we bow down and say to Him, "I offer myself to You."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE CONSECRATION OF THE BODY BEING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE MOST PRACTICAL AND SPECIFIC CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul was very wise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He charged us to present our bodies, not our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to be specific, practical, and thorough in our consecration, we have to present our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The consecration of the heart is very abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The heart is a strange thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It can be very honest, but when it is not honest, it can deceive itself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Proverbs 28:26 says that only the foolish man will trust in his own heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one knows when the heart will run away or change.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is more practical, solid, and reliable for a man to offer his little finger to the Lord than to consecrate his heart to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The little finger is tangible, but the heart is not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we talk about the consecration of the body, we are no longer speaking abstractly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the wisdom of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people talk about consecration, but their consecration is not as practical and specific as Paul's consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consecration means offering up our bodies and everything related to our bodies, including our possessions, our members, and our time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When our body is consecrated, everything related to it will spontaneously be consecrated as well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE PRACTICE OF PRESENTING OUR BODIES</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Three things are involved in the presenting of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first is time, the second is money, and the third is physical energy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The presenting of our body is the presenting of our time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our time must be available.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot squander our time; we have to devote our time to the service of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot say that we have consecrated ourselves, yet still have our time in our own hand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once our time is offered up, our body is offered up, because the body is bound up in time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We also have to present our money.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many poor people and poor brothers and sisters are around us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They all have needs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is also the need of money in the work of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Saying that our heart is consecrated without offering up our money is like shutting up our affection 1 John 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Affection may be there, but it is shut up and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to remove the things that shut up our affection before we can love God and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Third, we have to offer up our physical energy; we have to work with our own hands and serve the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every chore in the meeting hall, including scrubbing the floor, dusting the chairs and tables, and cleaning the windows, should not be done by any hired workers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps many of the brothers and sisters here have never dusted the chairs in the meeting hall or scrubbed the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The people in Hong Kong are very peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some of them love Mr. Chiang Chiang Kai-Shek , and some love Mr. Mao Mao Ze-Tung . If either of these two persons were here today and requested a cup of tea from us, we would feel very honored to do it for him; we would not want to hire a servant to do it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may have servants at home, and we may be managers in our office, but when we come to the meeting hall we have to learn to do everything by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This will perfect us and give us the opportunity to serve in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hiring a servant is easy, and he actually may do a better job than us, but let me ask, "Do we hire people to distribute tracts?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can hire people to market our goods at the street corner, but spiritual service is a matter of our body; no money can replace this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord wants us to do many things by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Shanghai we have a sister who is the wife of a bank director.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times she was driven by her chauffeur to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once she reached the hall, she got down on her knees to scrub the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In other places you could never hire the wife of a bank director to scrub floors.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are a couple of sisters who have at least four servants in their homes, but when the church gathers for a meal, they come and serve at the tables.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Consecration is not just a heart matter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are the Lord's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every item of service in the church needs to be taken up by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I would love to see a few brothers with high positions in the world cleaning chairs in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This would be sweet and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The second year after I was saved, I read the books of Chronicles, and found that David had many mighty men.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When David was ready to build the temple, these mighty men were assigned to guard the gates 1 Chron 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I was very touched when I read this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even David, who was being served, and who was a mighty man himself, longed to serve at the door of the temple of God Psa 84:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our service to the Lord is a personal thing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today the co-workers are serving the Lord with their mouths, but just presenting our mouth is not enough; we have to present our hands as well.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Here we should not have any worldly concepts or private habits.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The sisters in Shanghai organized a sewing group to wash, mend, and iron the items that the saints offered up, and then they gave them away.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is not a simple thing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is easy for the sisters to offer money to buy new clothes to give to the poor, but they collected worn items and washed, mended, ironed, and folded them, and then gave them away.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Of course, we should not think that this is all that consecration involves.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Nevertheless, there is a principle here: We have to make our consecration practical and specific.</S>
