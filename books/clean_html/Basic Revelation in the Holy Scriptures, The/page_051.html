<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MILLENNIUM</H2><P>The millennium has an earthly part and a heavenly part. The earthly part is the kingdom of the Messiah (2 Sam. 7:13), the tabernacle of David (Acts 15:16), the kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41; Rev. 11:15). The kingdom of the Father is the heavenly part of the millennium. The kingdom of the Son of Man is the earthly part of the millennium. In the millennium the overcomers in the heavenly part reign with Christ over the earthly part. In the earthly part is the restored kingdom of David, where Christ as the Son of Man, David's royal descendant, will be the King over the children of Israel.</P><P>During this time the children of Israel will be priests (Zech. 8:20-23; Isa. '':2-3). The overcoming saints will be kings in the heavenly part, and the restored nation of Israel will be priests in the earthly part, teaching the nations how to know God and how to serve Him. The nations will be the people in the earthly part of the millennium (Matt. 25:32-34). The sheep in Matthew 25 will be the nations, and the nations will be the people.</P><P>In the millennium, then, there will be three kinds of people: the overcoming saints as kings in the heavenly part, the restored Jews as the priests in the earthly part, and the sheep, the nations, as the people. The overcoming saints will have the nations to rule over, and the Jews will have the nations to teach. The nations will be the people ruled by us and taught by the Jews.</P><P>The kingdom of the heavens will end with the millennium (Rev. 20:7). The kingdom of God, however, will continue for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KINGDOM OF GOD IN ITS FULLEST EXTENT</H2><P>The fullest extent of the kingdom of God will begin in the new heaven and the new earth (1 Cor. 15:24; Rev. 21:1-2). In this eternal kingdom all the redeemed saints through all the ages will enjoy the eternal blessings of eternal life in the New Jerusalem as the sons of God and kings with Christ over the nations forever (Rev. 21:6-7; 22:3b-5, 14, 17). As the royal family, we will have two titles: sons of God and kings over the nations. The remnant of the purged nations will be the people of the nations to enjoy the restored blessing of God's creation eternally (Rev. 21:3-5; 22:2b, 3a).</P><P>Thus far we have seen a clear picture of the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens. Our God has a kingdom to carry out His purpose, accomplish His will, and exercise His justice. This kingdom displays His multifarious wisdom. Our God is just, wise, and purposeful. The truth of the kingdom will encourage us to go on, and it</P><P>will also be a warning to us to be in the right place and the right track that we may arrive at the right destination.</P>
