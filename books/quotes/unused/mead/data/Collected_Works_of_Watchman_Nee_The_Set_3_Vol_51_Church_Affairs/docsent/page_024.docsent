   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE LEVITICAL SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We do not need to say much concerning the service of the Levites, because it is a very simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Levitical work is different from the priestly work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The priests are for serving God and for attending to the things in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Levites are for serving the priests, helping the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, the priestly service represented in the Old Testament is a spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Levitical service refers to the service of practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Levites washed the bullocks, poured out the blood, carried away the dung, helped in flaying the offerings, and also carried the things of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever God's pillar of cloud rose up, the tabernacle was taken down, and the Levites came to carry the things of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All these things are the Levitical service.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>BEING OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BUT NOT IN THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although what the Levites do is not spiritual, what they do is related to God and to spirituality; it is of the world but not in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The things that they do are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, in the Bible the service of the deacons is Levitical in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are deacons in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The work of the deacons in the local churches is Levitical in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They take care of the practical affairs, and these affairs are related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>ALL SHOULD LEARN</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With regard to the practical affairs of the church, the brothers and sisters must be very concerned and very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regardless of what kind of affair it is, all must put their hand to it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, the cleaning of the meeting place and the care and arrangement of the blankets and sheets that belong to the church are all in the nature of the service of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The care of those who are needy among us and the receiving and sending off of visiting brothers and sisters are also work in the nature of the Levitical service.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a great amount of work in the nature of the Levitical service.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is much work in the church service office, which is also Levitical.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When a person serves God, there is the priestly work on the one hand, and there is the Levitical work on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Both should be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, you participate in the spiritual service, and on the other hand, you should also take care of the practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Remember that Stephen and some others took care of serving food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That was the service of the deacons, the work of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the disciples distributed the loaves and collected twelve baskets of fragments and on another occasion collected seven baskets of fragments, they were doing the work of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In particular, Judas's responsibility for the purse was the business of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus at the well at Sychar sent His disciples away to buy food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their buying of food also was the work of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These things occupy a great part of Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This category of things is what everyone in the church must properly learn before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>HELPING IN HOUSEHOLD CHORES</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, at this point I think I can make a suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please pay close attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are many brothers and sisters who have some spare time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are also many sisters at home who have no time whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have to cook, and they have to take care of their children.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why would the brothers in the service of the Levites not take responsibility in this matter by actually arranging for someone to go to their home to help them?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The responsible ones can tell them that there are two sisters among us who can help them do the laundry two hours every week.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is also the work of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the time of the apostles, the widows of the Hellenists were not adequately being cared for, and there were murmurings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such was the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although this was not something spiritual, but rather a practical affair, it still needed to be done.</S>
