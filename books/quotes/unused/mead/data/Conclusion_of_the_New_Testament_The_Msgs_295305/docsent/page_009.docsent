   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Factor of Our Justification a. Delivered on the Cross because of Our Offenses</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Satisfy God s Righteous Requirements</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 4:25 we see that Christ is the factor of our justification: Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse first tells us that Christ was delivered up to die on the cross because of our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that because we have offenses against God, Christ was delivered on the cross for us in order to satisfy God s righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the death of Christ has fulfilled and fully satisfied God s righteous requirements, we are justified by God through His death 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Raised because of Our Justification 1 As a Proof of God s Satisfaction</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>for God to Accept Us</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 4:25 goes on to say that God raised Him from the dead for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If God had not been satisfied with Christ s offering for us, how could God have raised Him from the dead?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s raising Christ is a strong proof that God was satisfied with Christ s dying for us and that we are justified by God because of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now God can accept us through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose that Christ died for us and for our sins and was buried in the tomb but was not resurrected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If this were the situation, we could not believe that His death was accepted by God and that it satisfied God s requirements and fulfilled His desires.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, Christ is not in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God raised Him up from the dead, and He came back in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a strong proof that God has accepted His death for us, that His death satisfied God s requirements and fulfilled whatever God wanted Him to do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the resurrection of Christ is the proof of our justification by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Christ, the resurrected One, we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2 As the Resurrected Life for Us to Live a Life</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Justified by God and Acceptable to God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ was raised not only as a proof that God accepted us through Christ but also as the resurrection life for us to live a life justified by God and acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The resurrected Christ is in the third heavens at the right hand of God as conclusive evidence that all of God s requirements have been satisfied and that we have been thoroughly and adequately justified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, this resurrected Christ is not only in the heavens but also within us to impart life that we may have a life of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By believing in Him, we have received Christ as our objective righteousness and are objectively justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have also received Christ as resurrection life that we can live by this life to have Christ lived out of us as our subjective righteousness; hence, we can be subjectively justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The resurrected Christ enters into us that we may have the subjective justification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This resurrected Christ is living in us to be our life that we may live out a life of righteousness Col 1:27b; 3:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the subjective justification which we obtain through Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This subjective justification is our living by the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, justification is not merely a positional matter; it is a dispositional matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The death of Christ gave us a positional justification, and the resurrected Christ in the heavens is a proof of this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now the resurrected Christ also lives inside us, living out a life of dispositional justification.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, we are justified both in position and in disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have not only an objective justification but a subjective justification as well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may now live such a subjective, dispositional justification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, as the factor of our justification, Christ was delivered on the cross because of our offenses in order to satisfy God s righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He then was raised because of our justification as a proof of God s satisfaction for God to accept us; He was raised also as the resurrected life for us to live a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today Christ in resurrection is our justification.</S>
