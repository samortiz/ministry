   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Babylon had her beginning in the tower of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Day by day Babylon is becoming larger and larger.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But God will judge her in the end. Revelation 19:1-4 says, "After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and He avenged the blood of His slaves at her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And a second time they said, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And her smoke goes up forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God judges the harlot and shatters all her work, and when He casts out all that she is and the principle she represents, voices from heaven will say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the New Testament, there are very few hallelujahs, and they are all expressed in this chapter because Babylon, she who adulterated the Word of Christ, has been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The passage in Revelation 18:2-8 tells us the reason for Babylon's fall and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sinful deeds of Babylon are announced and the consequences of her judgment are set forth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All who are of the same mind with God must say, Hallelujah, for God has judged Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Though the actual judgment is in the future, the spiritual judgment must take place today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The actual judgment will be performed by God in the future, but the spiritual judgment must be made by us today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If God's children bring many unspiritual things into the church, how do we feel about it?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Does the fact that we are all God's children and the fact that we should love one another mean that we should not say, Hallelujah, to God's judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must realize that this is not a matter of love, but a matter of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The principle of Babylon is confusion and uncleanness; therefore, her name is the harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The few passages in Revelation which God uses to describe Babylon show us His exceeding hatred toward her.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Those who destroy the earth" in Revelation 11:18 are of this woman, of whom it is written in chapter nineteen that she "corrupted the earth" v. 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God hates the principle of Babylon more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must note in His presence how much of our being is still not absolute for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anything which is halfway and not absolute is called Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need God to enlighten us so that in His light we may judge everything in us which is not absolute toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only when we judge ourselves in this way can we confess that we too hate the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By His grace, may the Lord not allow us to seek any glory and honor outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord requires that we delight and seek to be one who is absolute, not one who is living in the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 19:5 says, "And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His slaves and those who fear Him, the small and the great."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A special feature of the book of Revelation is the proclamations from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We read such things as a "voice out of heaven" and "a voice came out from the throne" 18:4; 19:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These are declarations from heaven, signifying the time when God speaks, the place where God speaks, and what His emphasis is on.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are definite reasons for the proclamation in Revelation 19:5.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand, it is because the great harlot is judged, and on the other hand, it is looking toward the marriage of the Lamb which is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, there is a proclamation from the throne to give praise to our God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has been working from eternity and has expended much energy on His work so that He might obtain praise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians mentions that God has an inheritance in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is God's inheritance in the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is only one thing that man can render to God praise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise is God's inheritance in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The voice from heaven proclaims that all of God's servants, all who belong to God, both small and great, must praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's purpose must be fulfilled, and it will be soon.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God must obtain what He is after; we all must praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the voice from the throne declared that praise be given to God, there was a host of echoes resounding throughout the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Revelation 19:6 says, "And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On one hand, there was a declaration from the throne, and on the other hand, there was a response of thousands upon thousands, and ten thousands upon ten thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As John was listening, he did not hear the voice of a single person; rather, he heard the voice of a great multitude as if it were the voice of many waters and the voice of mighty thunders.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you listen to the noise of a great waterfall or the waves of the ocean, you will realize how loud a voice of many waters can be.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The voice of thunder is great enough; how much greater is the voice of mighty thunders!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All of these mighty and thunderous voices were saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The declaration from heaven, the response from the whole universe, and every voice was saying, Hallelujah, because of a special event which was about to take place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The event is "the Lord our God the Almighty reigns."</S>
