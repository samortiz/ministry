[1]  The Vision, Living and Work of the Lord's Serving Ones CONTENTS
[2]  As those who serve full time, our work is to lead people to salvation, and after a person is saved, we need to lead him to live the Christian life.
[3]  Some say that to live the Christian life is to live in spirit, to live a life according to the spirit, and to know that Christ is our life.
[4]  In leading the new believers we must first help them to pray, read the Bible, meet with the saints, and preach the gospel.
[5]  We should spend more time in preaching the gospel, helping them to be active in approaching non-believers and speaking the gospel.
[6]  According to our experience, in addition to helping them to pray, read the Bible, meet with the saints, and preach the gospel, we also need to help them learn to fellowship with the Lord.
[7]  We cannot say that this is wrong; nevertheless, it is better if a new believer, after having dealt with his sins, would have a spontaneous desire within his spirit to consecrate himself to the Lord and thus pray, Lord, I truly love You, and I desire to give myself and my whole life to You.
[8]  Leading new believers in the life practices of praying, reading the Bible, meeting with the saints, and preaching the gospel can be considered as only elementary education.
[9]  Therefore, we should lead them into fellowshipping with the Lord, being enlightened, and dealing with their sins so that there are no barriers between them and the Lord.
[10]  We should also lead them to consecrate themselves fully to the Lord, walk according to the spirit, and know the anointing.
[11]  Furthermore, we should find relevant verses concerning the Lord s speaking to us through the Spirit, knowing the sense of life from the Lord, dealing with our sins in the light, and consecrating ourselves to the Lord.
[12]  In this chapter we will consider how to preach the gospel.
[13]  After young people consecrate themselves to serve full time, the first thing they need to do is preach the gospel.
[14]  The key of God s creation unlocks the mystery of human existence, the key of man s fall unlocks the mystery of the two natures of man, the key of Christ s redemption unlocks the mystery of the God-man, and the key of God s dispensing unlocks the mystery of faith.
[15]  We have practiced the common and general way to preach the gospel.
[16]  When we preach the gospel, the most important thing for us to learn is how to use the Bible and how to be flexible in using the Bible.
[17]  If we are well-versed in all the points of the gospel, whether we are preaching the gospel on a campus or in a home gathering, the people we contact will be saved.
[18]  In the previous chapters we said that we should use appropriate verses when we shepherd the new believers.
[19]  Now we will consider the most suitable verses to use when speaking about being saved.
[20]  We can match this verse with Romans 10:13: Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[21]  In this chapter we will consider the first item to shepherd a new believer into immediately after he is saved.
[22]  After a person is genuinely saved by believing in the Lord and calling on His name, we should not rejoice and walk away from him.
[23]  Others have suggested Ephesians 2:8: By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God ; Acts 16:31: Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household ; and John 3:16: God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.
[24]  The outward proof for the assurance of salvation is God s Word, the Bible.
[25]  Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.
[26]  It is difficult to comprehend how the Spirit of God witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.
[27]  We have covered two proofs of salvation: the outward proof, the word of God I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God 1 John 5:13 and the inward proof, the Spirit of God The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God Rom 8:16 .
[28]  We know that we have passed out of death into life not only because of the Word of God outside of us and the witnessing of the Spirit of God within us but also because of our love for the brothers.
[29]  We should use these points when we preach the gospel.
[30]  Since we have consecrated our life to the Lord, separating ourselves from the world and placing ourselves in the Lord s hand, we should treasure every breath, treasure every drop of blood, and treasure every minute we have.
[31]  There are several basic matters that we must know and practice in serving the Lord.
[32]  These basic matters include preaching the gospel, helping new believers to have the assurance of salvation, and leading them to live the Christian life.
[33]  Although it cannot be said that this is a fixed rule, we should not neglect these matters when we shepherd new believers.
[34]  We must use solid proofs so that they know clearly, without a doubt, that they have been saved by grace, they belong to Christ, and they are children of God.
[35]  Concerning shepherding new believers to live the Christian life, in chapter 1 we spoke about praying, reading the Bible, meeting, preaching the gospel, fellowshipping with the Lord, consecration, walking according to the spirit, and knowing the anointing.
[36]  In addition to these items we should lead the new ones to experience Christ as life, that is, to know that Christ is their life.
[37]  When we shepherd new believers, we must open the Bible and ask them to read these two verses, showing them that Christ lives in us to be our life.
[38]  When we shepherd new believers to experience Christ as life, we also need to tell them that every believer has a regenerated spirit, a spirit that has been enlivened with the life of God.
[39]  When we shepherd a new believer, we need to pay attention to several matters.
[40]  First, we should not act like a teacher and give lessons or admonitions.
[41]  We are not his teacher; we are only a saint who has led him to salvation and who is also helping him to live the Christian life, to experience Christ, and to experience the growth in life.
[42]  When we speak of Christ being life, we must stress the matter of regeneration, for it is only through regeneration that Christ can come into us.
[43]  After leading new believers to experience Christ as life, we need to lead them into a deeper experience.
[44]  If we live Christ and experience Christ as life, we will see that the Christ whom we experience is the Spirit of life.
[45]  At that time we saw only the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2; we did not see the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45.
[46]  In order to experience Christ, we must know that Christ is the life-giving Spirit with many elements; He is the compound Spirit.
[47]  In our experience the all-inclusive compound Spirit manifests mainly the element of the all-inclusive death, that is, the cross of Christ.
[48]  As we experience this all-inclusive Spirit, everything in us that is not Christ will be killed.
[49]  This holy anointing oil, a compound ointment of olive oil and four spices Exo 30:23-24 , is a full type of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the processed Triune God, whom Christ became through His death and resurrection 1 Cor 15:45; John 7:39; Phil 1:19 .
[50]  The significances of the ingredients of this compound anointing oil are as follows: 1 flowing myrrh, a spice used in burial John 19:39 , signifies the precious death of Christ Rom 6:3 ; 2 fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ s death 8:13 ; 3 fragrant calamus, from a reed that grew upward in a marsh or muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ Eph 2:6; Col 3:1; 1 Pet 1:3 ; 4 cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ s resurrection Phil 3:10 ; and 5 the olive oil as the base of the compound ointment signifies the Spirit of God as the base of the compound Spirit Gen 1:2 .
[51]  Bible expositors have called Christ in resurrection the pneumatic Christ.
[52]  Concerning the Spirit, in John 7:38-39 the Lord Jesus said that out of the innermost being of those who believe into Him would flow rivers of living water, but the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
[53]  Hence, when we experience Christ as our life, we experience the all-inclusive Spirit, and an important element in the all-inclusive Spirit is the cross.
[54]  When we experience Christ as our life, the element of Christ s death in His life spontaneously has a killing effect within us.
[55]  Many years ago we saw that in order to experience Christ s death we need to have the experience of the Holy Spirit, but we did not see that in the New Testament the Holy Spirit has become the life-giving Spirit.
[56]  This life-giving Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit who passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.
[57]  The Spirit of God had only the element of divinity, but through the Lord s incarnation, the element of humanity was added to the Spirit of God.
[58]  In 1954 some brothers felt that we needed to invite Brother T. Austin-Sparks, who was well known for his spiritual ministry in the West.
[59]  I fellowshipped with the brothers that in terms of knowing a person or a matter, we never pay attention to big things; rather, it is in the small things that we see the true situation of a person.
[60]  The next time we came together, I felt that I could no longer stay neutral.
[61]  Therefore, I said, In our fellowship during the past two days we have touched the matter of the ground of the church.
[62]  He said that it depends on the measure of the stature of Christ that a group has; the greater the measure of the stature of Christ, the more the group is right, and the smaller the measure of the stature of Christ, the less the group is right.
[63]  Suppose at that time a prophet arose and said, It is right that we worship, pursue, and love God, but we do not need to return to Jerusalem.
[64]  When leading a new believer to take the way of life, we should ultimately bring him to the church, because the Lord in His salvation desires to obtain the church.
[65]  Although this truth has not been clearly seen and is neglected in various denominations in Christianity, the fact is that every believer is a member of the church.
[66]  The Lord Jesus spoke concerning numerous truths in the Gospels, but He spoke of the church only twice, and both instances are in the Gospel of Matthew.
[67]  If we read Matthew 16:18 and 18:17 in context, we will see that the truth concerning the church is presented in an all-inclusive and complete way.
[68]  Ephesians 3:9-11 says, To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[69]  The Church Coming out of Christ s Life and
[70]  After Peter said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus said, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens Matt 16:17 .
[71]  Then the Lord continued, And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church v. 18 . The word and at the beginning of the verse is crucial; it indicates that verse 18 is a continuation of verse 17.
[72]  From this verse we know that the church comes out of Christ.
[73]  As long as we lead people to salvation and to live the Christian life, we must also lead them to experience the anointing.
[74]  If the Lord would give me another thirty years to speak two messages a day on the church, I would not exhaust this topic, because the entire Bible is on Christ and the church.
[75]  We should lead them from the experience of life to knowing the church, enabling them to see that the church is a product of Christ; the church is the Eve of Christ.
[76]  In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus spoke of the church twice, first referring to the universal church, the Body of Christ, and later referring to the local church, the expression of the universal church in a locality.
[77]  In leading new believers to know the church, we must first use 16:18, which speaks of the universal aspect of the church.
[78]  If we do not have Christ as our life, we are not regenerated, and if we do not have any knowledge and experience of Christ, it will be impossible for us to grow as members and constituents of the universal church.
[79]  When leading new believers to know the church, we first should let them know that Christ is the life and nature of the church.
[80]  When we were regenerated, the Lord entered into us to be our life and our nature.
[81]  Some believers do not understand why we say that we are the church.
[82]  Whether or not we are the church depends on whether Christ is our life and nature.
[83]  Then we should go to Matthew 18 and speak concerning the local church and concerning the living of the church life in every locality as the expression of the universal church.
[84]  TO KNOW THE CHURCH 3 WHAT THE CHURCH IS TO GOD AND TO CHRIST
[85]  In relation to Christ, the church is first the Body of Christ Eph 1:22b-23 and then the bride of Christ 5:24-25 .
[86]  In Ephesians 2, 4, and 6, we see that the church is also the new man and the warrior, both of which are for the accomplishment of God s purpose.
[87]  As the house of God, the church lives out and upholds the truth concerning God being manifested in the flesh, God being mingled with and dispensing Himself into men so that they may become His dwelling place and His household in order to live Him out and express Him.
[88]  Furthermore, we must help new believers to see that the kingdom of God is the enlargement of the life of God.
[89]  The house makes it possible for us to enjoy God and for God to enjoy us, whereas the kingdom is a realm established by God where Christ can be enlarged and can reign for the accomplishing of God s purpose.
[90]  In the previous chapters we saw the vision of the church and the nature of the church.
[91]  If we desire to work for the Lord and be used by Him, we must have a thorough knowledge regarding the church so that we bear a proper testimony.
[92]  The starting point of our gospel preaching is not to solve people s problems but to reconcile them to God so that their sins may be forgiven by the Lord and so that they may receive a new life.
[93]  According to God s heart s desire and His Word, the Lord has only one church, and there is only one Body of Christ, there is only one bride of Christ, there is only one house of God, there is only one kingdom of God, there is only one new man, and there is only one warrior.
[94]  Division issues in confusion, and confusion changes the nature of the church.
[95]  A brother asked how we can say that we are the Lord s recovery and others are not, when he knows a brother in Christianity who reads the Bible, prays, is spiritual, and has the Lord s presence.
[96]  We must humbly confess that there are many of God s children who love the Lord more than we do and are more spiritual than we are.
[97]  Even after we have such an understanding, we will still need to ask the Lord by His mercy to grant us to be faithful so that when we encounter difficult environments or trials, we will stand firm on the ground of the church.
[98]  In this chapter we will continue to look at the practice of the church.
[99]  Although there are good things in Christianity, in relation to the ground of the church it has deviated from God s original intention.
[100]  Now that we are clear concerning our ground and concerning the situation in Christianity, we will consider what kind of attitude we should have toward all God s children.
[101]  First, we should love all God s children, considering them as brothers and sisters in the Lord.
[102]  The Bible says that we should love the brothers; it does not say which kind of brothers we should love.
[103]  We must have faith in the Lord that this does not mean that we are proud or exclusive but rather that we are standing on the ground of the church.
[104]  In response to this we should say that the truths that the Lord has given to us are very rich, but we are not building up our own group; instead, we are spreading the riches of the Lord s truths to all believers.
[105]  Whether we are speaking for the Lord or preaching the gospel, we will be full of life and the life supply, and others will realize that we uphold the truth and practice the truth.
[106]  Question: Why do we not participate in joint gospel preaching with other Christian groups on college campuses or with the denominations?
[107]  After we lead people to salvation and lead them to know the gospel and life, we should lead them into the church, because every believer must not only know the Lord, but even more, he should know the Lord s heart s desire.
[108]  Based on our study of the Word, our experience in the work, and our study of church history, we can say that the Lord s recovery is the right way.
[109]  If we cooperate, the Lord s recovery will advance quickly and spread widely, but if we do not cooperate, the spread of the Lord s recovery will be slow, and its advance will be restricted.
[110]  From church history and from more than fifty years of experience in the Lord s work, we can see that since the time of the apostles, few believers have realized that the small group is the basic and excelling way to build up the church.
[111]  The Lord s recovery has been among us for sixty-three years, and although we have practiced the small groups in the past, we did not stress them, nor did we take the time to study them.
[112]  Beginning with this chapter, we will cover some important matters that serving ones should pay attention to.
[113]  Those who desire to serve the Lord full time, especially the brothers, should learn Greek.
[114]  If asked what the qualifications of a full-time brother should be, I would say that it is best to have a college degree and be conversant in Chinese, English, and Greek.
[115]  In this chapter we will fellowship concerning something higher and deeper.
[116]  In that appearing the Lord said He was sending Paul to the Gentiles, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith v. 18 . Then Paul said to King Agrippa that he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision v. 19 . From Paul s defense to King Agrippa, we see that his life was divided into two periods.
[117]  Proverbs 16:9 says, A man s heart devises his way, / But Jehovah directs his steps.
[118]  I have experienced many ups and downs in my life, so I understand human life.
[119]  It may seem that we are the ones who have chosen the way we have taken in life; however, it is altogether foreordained by God.
[120]  In this chapter we will consider the relationship that a serving one should have with his community.
[121]  THE SMALL GROUPS BEING STRONG IN SPIRIT, RICH IN THE WORD,
[122]  The young people with a heart to serve the Lord full time are new blood in the churches in Taiwan, in the Lord s recovery, and in the Lord s testimony.
[123]  The desire of God s heart is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life John 17:3; 3:16 , and become the sons of God John 1:12; Gal 4:5-6 Life-study of Galatians, p.
[124]  As serving ones, we have a relationship with our community and a relationship with the church.
[125]  Now that we are saved and want to serve the Lord, not only is it impossible for us to stay away from our community, but even more we cannot stay away from the church.
[126]  If we desire to serve the Lord, we must be in an environment where there is no different teaching, that is, where there is no speaking in contradiction to God s economy.
[127]  God s people are numerous; hence, we must always pray and ask the Lord to give us wisdom and knowledge so that we may know how to go out and come in before His people, that is, how to conduct ourselves among them.
[128]  Second, we should have a definite goal in pursuing the truth.
[129]  In order to serve the Lord, one needs to know the truth and also to grow in life.
[130]  We should not seek to be great when we work; we need to properly allocate our time.
[131]  A person who serves the Lord has a relationship not only with his community and with the church but also with his fellow workers.
[132]  In the coordination we should not have the thought that if one place does not suit us, we can move to another place.
[133]  If we leave, we should not expect our work to be blessed by the Lord or that our conscience will be clear.
[134]  It is impossible for those who are working for the Lord to work alone.
