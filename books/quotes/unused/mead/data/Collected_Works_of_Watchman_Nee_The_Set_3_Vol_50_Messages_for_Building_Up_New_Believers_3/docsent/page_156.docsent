   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Concerning Miracles and Healing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible records many miracles and works of wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many such miracles are related to the healing of sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are signs used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But many heresies in this world attract men by miracles and works of wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord prophesied that before His coming again, many miracles would appear to deceive men Matt 24:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A big part of heretical teachings involves the healing of sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These heresies attract men by their power of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to be careful about all forms of healing and supernatural phenomena.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The miracles and supernatural events in the Bible were initiated by the Holy Spirit through the hands of men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Holy Spirit acknowledges Jesus as the Lord; He testifies for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is nothing wrong for a man who has faith, who has a word from God, and who believes in such a word to pray and anoint sick ones in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But some miracle workers in some heretical groups do not believe in sickness and death at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They say that both sickness and death are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it is interesting that they themselves also die.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christian Scientists do not believe in aging, sickness, or death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After Mary Baker Eddy died, a scandal developed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Her will instructed that a certain sum of money be given to her followers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet her followers insisted before a judge that she had not died.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The judge considered this to be absurd, because if she had not died, the will could not go into effect, and the church could not claim her inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet if she had died, it would disprove her teaching about the absence of sickness, pain, sin, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not be too obsessed with healing and miraculous things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sickness is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some sicknesses are the result of natural laws.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some sicknesses are the result of attacks from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some sicknesses are the result of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, we believe in the existence of sickness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, we also believe in supernatural acts as the free manifestation of the work of the Holy Spirit, who always acknowledges Christ Jesus as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we should also realize that the world likes to believe in strange and inexplicable things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should exercise our care in discerning these things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>G. Concerning Prophecies</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people believe that the Lord will come again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the Lord told us that no one knows the day of His coming, not even the angels or the Son of Man Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a basic principle concerning the day of Christ's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Christ came in 1874.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The founder of the group, Charles T. Russell, preached this, and his follower Joseph Rutherford continued this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The strange thing is that even though they claimed that they saw the coming of the Lord, we do not see it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They say that we are already in the millennium and that this is the reason for all the wonderful inventions like the typewriter, the telephone, and the automobile.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some also believe that the Lord Jesus entered the Holy of Holies in heaven in 1844.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Others say that Christ came in 1918.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two places in the Bible speak of a day as a year: Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some base their arguments on these verses and postulate that a day signifies a year in every prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But God only said that in certain particular things a day is like a year.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He did not say that this is true for all things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is wrong to calculate the day of Christ's coming according to this "day-year theory."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The seventy weeks in the book of Daniel may fit the "day-year theory."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But other than that, all other days should be considered merely as days.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a person says that a day is always a year, then the millennium would be a period of three hundred and sixty thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some would then argue that a day, being short, can be interpreted as a long year, but that a year, being so long, is a long enough period, and there is no need for further interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is tiresome to argue about these things, and we do not have to bother ourselves with them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All those who predict the day of Christ's return based on the "day-year" theory are in danger of being heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>H. Communication</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>between the Living and the Dead</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to Deuteronomy 18:9-14 and Leviticus 20:6, God strictly forbids the living to communicate with the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Gospel of Luke, the Lord spoke about the rich man in Hades, who implored the Lord to send Lazarus to the land of the living, yet the Lord would not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Dead people are in Hades or in Paradise, and they cannot return to the land of the living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For a dead man to return to the land of the living or for the living to communicate with the dead is to engage in divination.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible strictly forbids this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A diviner or a witch is a woman who communicates with demons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A woman can actually be acquainted with only one demon.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Such a woman is familiar with evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In divination a demon pretends to be the spirit of many dead persons.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The one with whom a diviner communicates is not actually the spirit of the dead person, but the demon himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Bible only 1 Samuel speaks of a spirit coming up from Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After Samuel died, his spirit was called up, and he rebuked Saul 1 Sam 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The one place that speaks of the reason for Saul's death is 1 Chronicles 10:13-14, which says that Saul died because he took counsel from one who had a familiar spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The laws of Moses forbade a woman from communicating with spirits, and those who did so were to be stoned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Anyone who engages in divination is a heretic.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I. Concerning Women Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First Timothy 2, 1 Corinthians 14, and Revelation 2 all show that God forbids a woman from teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Any sect that is started by a woman or headed up by one, or any group in which the woman occupies the same place as the man is highly suspicious.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>More than half of the heresies in the world have been started by women.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For example, the founder of the Christian Scientists was Mary Baker Eddy, and the founder of the Seventh-day Adventists was Mrs. White.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the Bible speaks about Roman Catholicism, it also refers to the teaching of the woman Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>J. Concerning the Lord's Coming</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The principle of heresy is a Satanic imitation of what the Lord is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For example, the Lord heals sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Satan also heals sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Concerning the Lord's coming, heresies try to confuse men.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For example, some claim that the Lord will come on a certain day in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the Lord does not come as predicted, men begin to ignore or despise the very truth concerning the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Satan likes to smear the truth concerning the Lord's coming with such infamous incidents.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is true that the Lord is coming soon, and many people will pay more attention to prophecies in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>For this reason, more heresies will be found in the area of prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If any sect or group claims that it is waiting for the Lord to return on a certain date in a certain place, you can tell immediately that this is a heretical group.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If anyone claims that he is one of the two witnesses, or one of the three angels, do not believe him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If anyone claims to be a certain person described in the Bible, do not trust him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord says that one day men will claim, "Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here!"</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Matt 24:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do not believe them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>These are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should not put our trust in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The only thing we should pursue is to be the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Others may say that they are certain persons described in the book of Revelation or the book of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They are heretics, and we should not receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In the end times heresies will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is why we have to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Do not be curious to try them out.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Such curiosity will always cause damage to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we try them out, we are tasting poison.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If anyone does not pass any of the above ten tests, he is a heretic, and we must not have any fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>These teachings are rising up day by day in China, and we have to be on the alert against them.</S>
