   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHTY-ONE BEING TRANSFORMED 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to consider further the experience at Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>e God's Promise</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may be quite familiar with the term promise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this portion of the Word, however, God's promise is not common.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The God who gives the promise in chapter thirty-five is God all-sufficient v. 11, Heb . We need to give attention to the revelation of God's titles in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In chapter one, God is only revealed as Elohim, and in chapter two we see the title Jehovah rendered Lord in the King James Version .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Elohim is God's title as Creator in relation to His creation, and Jehovah is His title in His relationship with man, revealing how God is related to man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The title the all-sufficient God, or God all-sufficient, is not revealed until 17:1, where God said to Abraham, "I am the all-sufficient God; walk before me and be thou perfect" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the past, we did not adequately realize the significance of this title.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We thought that it simply meant that God was everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Undoubtedly, it is correct to say that God's all-sufficiency means that He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But for what purpose is this title of God revealed?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have given a number of messages in the past on this title of God, telling people that it denotes that God is rich and that He is our all-sufficient supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is everything to supply all our need.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a sense, this was right.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is all-sufficient in order to supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But for what does He supply us?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Does He supply us merely in order that we might be saved or be spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No. If we would see the purpose for God's being the all-sufficient One, we need to read Genesis 35 and compare it with Genesis 17.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The purpose of God's revealing Himself as the all-sufficient God is for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just as Elohim is for God's creation, so the all-sufficient God is for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not understand the Holy Word by your imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Understand the Bible by the Bible itself, by comparing one portion of the Word with another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How do we know that Elohim is for God's creation?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All Bible students agree that the first mention of an item in the Bible establishes a principle for that particular thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first mention of Elohim is in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this chapter, God is revealed for His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, this establishes the principle that Elohim basically denotes the creating God, God the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Genesis 17:1, the first mention of the title the all-sufficient God, El-Shaddai, clearly reveals the significance of this title.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Prior to that time, Abraham had been called by God for the purpose of becoming the father of so many of God's called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God did not intend that Abraham fulfill this by the exercise of his natural strength, and God did not give Abraham a child until his natural strength had been exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Abraham, however, neither understood God adequately, nor had faith in Him for this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, he followed his wife's proposal that he bring forth a child by using his natural strength with a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God was offended by this and did not speak to Abraham for thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not think that God cannot be offended, or that He will always be patient with you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are nowhere told in the Bible that God is all-patient.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Abraham's case, God was offended, not by sin, but by the exercise of Abraham's natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In God's economy, nothing offends Him more than your exercise of your natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever a called one of God uses his natural strength to do something for the accomplishment of God's purpose, God will be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a sense, using your natural strength is an insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God does not need your help.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To exercise your natural strength means that you are capable of helping God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates that God is not sufficient and that He needs you to assist Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God spoke to Abraham again after an interval of thirteen years, He said, "I am the all-sufficient God."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you read this chapter carefully, you will see that God's being all-sufficient is for us to produce the materials for His house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Genesis 17 and 35 correspond to each other in at least three ways.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Firstly, both chapters reveal that God is all-sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God revealed this divine title to both Abraham and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Secondly, in both chapters a change of name occurs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Abraham's name was changed from Abram to Abraham, and Jacob's name was changed from Jacob to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In spiritual life, the change of name signifies transformation, not merely the change of label.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may say, "Witness Lee, you have done something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From now on, you are not Witness Lee but Charles Ford."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This change of label means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to the Bible, to change your name is to change your being.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Formerly, you were Abram; now you are Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Previously, you were a supplanting Jacob; now you are Israel, the wrestler of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the change, not of a label, but of your being, of your constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, chapter seventeen speaks of the transformation of Abraham and chapter thirty-five speaks of the transformation of Jacob.</S>
