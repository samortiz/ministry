   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Ointment Symbolizing the Completed God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The completed, or consummated, God is symbolized by the ointment, which was compounded with four spices and olive oil Exo 30:22-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This ointment is mentioned in 1 John 2:20 and 27.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these verses the word anointing, a gerund, is used to describe the moving of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you apply cream to your face, you cause the cream to move.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may say that in Exodus 30 we have the "cream," the ointment, and in 1 John 2 we have the moving of the cream, the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have this anointing, the moving of the ointment, within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ointment is not a thing but a person the completed God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ointment within us is the processed, compounded, consummated Triune God, the God who has passed through the necessary processes in order to be completed.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The completed God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 7:39b says, "The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Jesus was glorified, that is, when He entered into resurrection Luke 24:26 , the Triune God was consummated and completed to become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit, therefore, is the processed, consummated, and completed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us consider what the Spirit comprises.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Within the Spirit is divinity, the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit also includes humanity, the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that the Spirit includes the element of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How great a thing was the incarnation!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God was conceived within a virgin's womb and stayed there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The divine conception was part of a marvelous process.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This conception was followed by the Lord's birth and human living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For thirty years the Lord Jesus lived in the home of a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He came forth to minister for three and one-half years, passing through all kinds of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His crucifixion He accomplished an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then He walked through death, came forth from death, and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In resurrection He, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , and this life-giving Spirit is now the Spirit the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now He is ready to be applied to us as the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the Triune God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is anointing us with the compounded Spirit, the consummation and completion of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I can testify that when I am preparing myself to speak for the Lord, I usually pray, "Lord, fill me with Yourself as the essential Spirit and pour Yourself upon me as the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>O Lord, in my speaking be one spirit with me so that You speak in my speaking."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever I pray like this, I am strengthened, confirmed, infused, and filled inwardly and outwardly with the consummated Triune God.</S>
