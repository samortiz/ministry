   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN CHRIST OUR LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 3:1-4; Rom 8:30, 19, 21; Phil 3:21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the beginning of this message I would like to give a further word on the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this, I would ask you to consult the diagram on the last page of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE PROCESSED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In eternity past God existed alone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then, in time, He created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At a certain point in history, this creating God, the Creator of all, became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This crucial step is called incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By means of incarnation, God put on man with all of creation, for man is the head of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus, God incarnate, lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He was crucified, all creation was crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that not only did Christ go to the cross, but the very man God had put on Himself with the entire creation went to the cross with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, Christ s death on the cross was an all-inclusive crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After His crucifixion, Christ was buried in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The man and the creation which were crucified with Christ were also buried in that tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After three days, Christ arose from the dead in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through resurrection and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, in His ascension to the third heaven, He was crowned and became the Head and the Lord over all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then He descended upon His Body as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because God, after completing the work of creation, passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, we may speak of Him as the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The diagram portrays the process through which He has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, He has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After ascending to the third heaven, where He was enthroned and crowned, and where He was made the Head and Lord of all, He descended upon the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His descension, He is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This all-inclusive Spirit has come upon God s elect, who make up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Christ was incarnated and born in the manger in Bethlehem, He put humanity on Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This humanity included us and all of creation as well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, even before we were born, Christ put us on Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As Christ passed through human living, we passed through it with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, when He went to the cross and was crucified, we were crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we were buried with Him in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In fact, all of creation was buried there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, Christ s tomb was an all-inclusive tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have also resurrected and ascended with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now, even while we are participating in the church life, we are sitting with Him in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, we are in the church on earth; on the other hand, we are in Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is a great deal of traffic between the heavens and the church, traffic that moves faster than the speed of light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, to refer to such traffic is to speak from a human point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From God s point of view, the heavens and the church are one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, to be in the church is to be in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE REALITY OF THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We also need to point out that the all-inclusive Spirit is the reality of the compound ointment described in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the compound ointment, the Spirit no longer includes only the Spirit of God typified by the olive oil, but also the aspects of Christ s death and resurrection typified by the spices.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the olive oil had been blended with the spices, the oil became a compound, an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Formerly the olive oil was of one essence, one element.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But after it had been compounded with the spices, other elements had been added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ointment produced by compounding olive oil with the four spices signifies the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In eternity past the Spirit of God existed with just one element, the element of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But at the time of Christ s incarnation, God put on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During Christ s thirty-three and a half years of human living on earth, more was added to the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, through His crucifixion, the essence of His all-inclusive, effective death was added to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The same was true of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As Christ took these crucial steps, God was processed and compounded with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just as the olive oil was blended with the spices to be a type, the Spirit of God was blended with the effectiveness and sweetness of Christ s death and with the effectiveness and power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, our God is now the processed God who descends as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His chosen people and enters into them to make them the church.</S>
