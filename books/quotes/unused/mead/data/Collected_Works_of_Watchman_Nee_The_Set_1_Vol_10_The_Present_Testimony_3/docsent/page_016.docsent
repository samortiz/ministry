   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LATENT POWER OF THE SOUL 1 Issue No. 26</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 18:11-13 says, "And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargo anymore: cargo of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls...and cattle and sheep, and cargo of horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The merchandise mentioned here began with gold and silver and ended with the souls of men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Gold, silver, horses, and chariots are merchandise and can be bought and sold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Slaves can also be bought and sold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the human body can be bought and sold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition to these things, the souls of men can also be bought and sold as merchandise.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 15:45 says, "So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul'; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The proper translations of the words soul and spirit were clearly explained in the appendix of The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 15:46 says, "But the spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, he became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the past two years, I was deeply burdened to convey this profound message.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But this message is very hard and very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is hard for both the speaker to speak it as well as for the listener to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, when I was writing The Spiritual Man, I did not include this message, "The Soul," in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I feel, however, that I should speak on this topic.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After I read some books and magazines, contacted some unbelievers, and observed the present condition and trend of society and the church, I sensed how precious is the truth that we know.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Considering the situation today, I cannot help but feel that I should pass on what we have received because, if I do not do this, I am hiding the light under the bushel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today I want to talk about the relationship between spiritual warfare and the last generation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the subject which I was reluctant to put into the book, The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In that book we explained clearly the difference between the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some of you may not have read this book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, I would like to repeat this briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The "breath of life" is the spirit God gave man, and this is Adam's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can see that man's body was made of dust and man's spirit was given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After God breathed into Adam the breath of life, man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, the spirit, soul, and body are three separate things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is incorrect to say that man has only the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, "And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The spirit is given by God, the soul is a living soul, and the body is formed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the world's common understanding, the soul is our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the spirit is joined to the body, there is a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The main feature of the angels is that they are spirits; the main feature of the animals such as the beasts is that they are flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Human beings have a spirit and body; but our main feature is neither the spirit nor the body, but the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why the Bible calls man a soul after the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, in mentioning Jacob's household of seventy people that went down to Egypt, Genesis 46:27 says, "All the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other places, when the Bible relates to us the number of people saved, it says that these are the number of souls saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The soul stands for the human personality; it is that which distinguishes us as man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What are the functions of the spirit, soul, and body?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In chapter one of The Spiritual Man, we explained this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was very glad one day to find a book called The Spirit of Christ written by Andrew Murray.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In its appendix was an explanation of the spirit, the soul, and the body in exactly the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, today I would like to read Andrew Murray's word:</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the history of man's creation we read, "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground": thus was his body made "and breathed into his nostrils the breath" or spirit "of life": thus his spirit came from God; "and man became a living soul."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Spirit quickening the body made man a living soul, a living person with the consciousness of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We know that only man has the consciousness of himself; wood and stone have no self consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The soul was the meeting-place, the point of union between body and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Through the body, man, the living soul, stood related to the external world of sense, could influence it, or be influenced by it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Through the spirit he stood related to the spiritual world and the Spirit of God, whence he had his origin; could be the recipient and the minister of its life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Standing thus midway between two worlds, belonging to both, the soul had the power of determining itself, of choosing or refusing the objects by which it was surrounded, and to which it stood related.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the constitution of these three parts of man's nature, the spirit, as linking him with the Divine, was the highest; the body, connecting him with the sensible and animal, the lowest; intermediate stood the soul, partaker of the nature of the others, the bond that united them and through which they could act on each other.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Its work, as the central power, was to maintain them in their due relation; to keep the body, as the lowest, in subjection to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Fort Washington, Pa., Christian Literature Crusade, 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Note C: The Place of the Indwelling, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>227-228.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I quote this to show you that not only do we differentiate in this way; even Andrew Murray clearly differentiated the spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whatever causes us to sense God and have a relationship with God is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What is the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Anything that causes us to contact the self and have self-awareness is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What is the body?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Anything that causes us to contact the world is the body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The notes in the Scofield Reference Bible say the same thing: the spirit gives us God-consciousness, the soul gives us self-consciousness, and the body gives us world-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Beasts and horses are not conscious of God because they do not have a spirit; they are only conscious of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The body causes us to feel and see the physical world, to feel hot or cold, etc. I think we are all familiar with this, and there is no need for me to speak too much on it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The above covers the functions of the spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now I come to the biggest question, which was also mentioned in the book The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many people think that they should pay attention to the matter of the spirit, soul, and body simply because it is related to their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, this matter is not only related to our spiritual life but to our spiritual work and warfare as well.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They think that Adam was more or less the same as we are now, even before he fell.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They think that we are quite similar to each other because Adam was a man and we are men.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They think that Adam was incapable of doing what we are incapable of doing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whatever Adam was incapable of doing, we are also incapable of doing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They do not realize, however, that what Adam was capable of doing, we are incapable of doing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I am afraid that we still do not know what Adam's abilities were.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we read the Bible carefully, we will see what Adam was really like before his fall.</S>
