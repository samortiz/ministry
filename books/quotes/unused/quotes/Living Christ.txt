Although believers throughout all the ages have read the Bible extensively, most of them have missed the central point
Consider this: If God does not enter into man and live out Himself through man, how can God express Himself, and how could man express God?
Perhaps you have seen a variety show featuring two performers, one of whom speaks while the other acts out the gestures
If you have your picture taken, and it does not turn out to be like you but looks like a tiger or a demon, this picture does not express you
According to the Bible, man is a 'photograph' of God because man was created according to God's image and likeness for God's expression
Man has a body on the outside and a soul inside, and within the soul there is a spirit, which is the organ for him to receive God
Although man had the image of God outwardly and was a receptacle to receive God inwardly, God had not entered into him yet
If they hear this kind of speaking-'eating Christ to become Christ'-they are bothered and are quick to judge it as heresy
Today Christians will not make this declaration, 'To me, to live is Christ,' mainly because they disobey the Spirit
Many good men will end up in the lake of fire in the coming age, even though they have never committed murder, robbery, or adultery
In this way every day we live mostly either according to ethics or according to logic we spend very little time living Christ in our spirit
Some are contentious and do not live Christ; others are peaceable and never say much, but they also do not live Christ
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil includes not only things that are evil but also things that are good
Indeed, after a few years under the influence of the church they gradually changed and were no longer rude or wild
When this brother was rude, his rudeness was not of the tree of life but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Have you noticed that among the unbelievers, the ladies paint their lips red, powder their cheeks white, and color their eyebrows black?
The sisters here neither paint themselves red nor powder themselves white; they do not apply any color at all to themselves
When they walked into the meeting hall, I, a Chinese, had to examine them closely to determine whether they were humans or demons
They were actually humans, but from the back they looked like demons, and from the front they looked like cats full of whiskers
After they had been in the church life for a period of time, they cut their hair short and shaved off their beards
Because even though a person's hair has been shortened and his beard has been shaved away, his nature remains untouched
If he were truly transformed, not only would his hair be shortened and his beard shaved off, but his nature would also be dealt with
The length of the hair and having a beard or no beard are of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and are not of life
From the point of view of the spiritual life, merely being humble, ethical, and honest are not necessarily a spiritual living
You should not live in your mind but in your spirit, nor live in your knowledge but in fellowship with the Lord
When we live in constant fellowship with Him by praying unceasingly, we will ultimately have the boldness to say, 'To me, to live is Christ'
In this way you will be delivered from religion, ethics, and logic, and you will truly live out Christ in your spirit
From the beginning of time up to the present, the existence of the human race has been depending on these two things: knowledge and good
When you were little, your parents sent you to kindergarten, and then they sent you to elementary school, high school, and college
Just one degree was not sufficient; you had to go to graduate school to get a master's degree, and after that a Ph
To elaborate somewhat, this is to have kindness, love, humility, patience, gentleness, and a willingness to yield to others out of humility
Western people do not know what it is to yield in humility; therefore, such a phrase cannot be found in their dictionary
If technology, philosophy, religion, and the law were removed, what kind of people would the Filipinos become?
These four items must not be abandoned; technology, philosophy, religion, and the law are necessary items in human culture
They may consider themselves young people of the space age, and therefore they cannot be without technology or knowledge
She continues, 'The second reason is that there are young brothers around, which also makes quarreling improper'
There are other elders who are full of experience; they do everything slowly to avoid hurting others by being too quick
Day by day we read much about Christ, pray much to Christ, and hear much about Christ, but we do not live Christ very much
Today there are many theologians and Christians who read and study the Bible, yet they are not willing to contact Christ in their spirit
Paul seemed to be saying to the Galatians, 'O Galatians, because you believed into Christ, you are now in Christ
All of Christ's riches and grace have become blessings to you, yet you have now returned to Judaism to keep the law
There is only a bridge separating Malaysia from Singapore, yet the flavors from the two sides are not the same
Consider three brothers from Japan, three brothers from Indonesia, and three brothers from the southern islands of the Philippines
These three live Japan, these other three live Indonesia, and the last three live the southern islands of the Philippines
Although we love the Lord and we say that we live by the Lord, in reality, instead of living the Lord, we live our culture
The fact is that not only does each region or each race have its own culture, even all of us individually have our own self-invented culture
They are genuine Japanese, but each has his own individual philosophy, and each has his own individual culture
All three brothers have been saved; all have Christ within them; all have the same Bible, sing the same hymns, and shout the same slogans
At most they spend one hour in the spirit, in which they forget about Japan, forget about themselves, and live Christ
Sometimes you hear a brother say, 'Brother So-and-so shouldn't have done this, and Sister So-and-so shouldn't have done that
We should not live technology or philosophy or religion or the law; rather, we should live Christ and live and walk in Christ
You need to remain in this spirit, live in this spirit, breathe in this spirit, pray in this spirit, and fellowship with Him in this spirit
Today all of you have clearly heard and seen that it is not knowledge, good and evil, religion, or culture, but it is Christ
Mere doctrines regarding Christ are not Christ, the life-study messages are not Christ, and even the Bible is not Christ
In this wonderful resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit as the consummate expression of the Triune God
As long as you receive Him and let Him come into you, the riches of His all-inclusiveness also will come into you
All you need to do is repent and believe, call on the Lord's name, pray and receive Him; then this delicious dish will become your portion
The pastor would say, 'The Bible does not say that you should love your lovable wife; it only says that you should love your own wife
Formerly, the devil seduced man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; now the pastors compel people to eat of it
You see that by asking such a question, this one immediately turned to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
She should neither say yes or no but turn to the Lord and say, 'O Lord, You are the Spirit of life, and You are in my spirit'
You do not know how to honor your parents, how to be a good wife, how to love others, and how not to lose your temper
We should not be in such an atmosphere only when we are praying; rather, we should bring this atmosphere into our living
If you are willing to do this, you will see that the element of the Lord will be added into you day by day, and you will be sanctified
Because the Lord's element has increased in you, this increase of the Lord has completely transformed you from within
As the Lord of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things, the Lord Jesus became flesh, passed through death, and entered into resurrection
The Lord Jesus said If anyone loves Me he will keep My word and My Father will love him and We will come to him and make an abode with him
The New Testament tells us Unceasingly pray Do not quench the Spirit and By means of all prayer and petition praying at every time in spirit
As a result, we are together here as the church today, and in the future we will be together as the New Jerusalem
All you would care about is to love the Lord, to be one spirit with Him, to fellowship with Him in spirit, and to walk in the Spirit
Hallelujah, the Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwells in us to be joined with us as one spirit!
