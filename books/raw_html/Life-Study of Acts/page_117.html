<h2 class="head1">REJECTED BY THE JEWS</h2><h2 class="head2">Unworthy of Eternal Life</h2><p>In 13:44-52 we see that Paul and Barnabas were rejected by the Jews. Verses 44 through 46 say, &ldquo;And on the coming Sabbath almost all the city was gathered together to hear the word of the Lord. But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and contradicted the things spoken by Paul, blaspheming. And Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and said, It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first; since you thrust it away and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.&rdquo; To thrust away the word of God proves that such a one, by his own judgment, is unworthy of eternal life.</p><p>In his preaching as recorded in this chapter Paul did not speak of eternal life. Rather, he spoke of the Son of God, the Savior, the holy and faithful things, and the grace of God. But now, with regard to the Jews who were rejecting them, Paul and Barnabas said that they judged themselves unworthy of eternal life. This is a strong proof that the totality of all that Paul preached concerning the resurrected Christ, the Son of God, the Savior, the holy and faithful things, and the grace of God is eternal life.</p><p>If we would have a proper understanding of eternal life in 13:43, we need adequate spiritual experience. From our experience we know that eternal life is the Savior, the firstborn Son of God, the holy and faithful things, and the all-inclusive grace. When the Jews rejected the word spoken by Paul and Barnabas, they judged themselves unworthy of eternal life, which is the Savior, the Son of God, the holy and faithful things, and the grace of God.</p><h2 class="head2">A Light of the Gentiles</h2><p>In 13:47 Paul said to the rejecting Jews, &ldquo;For so the Lord has commanded us: I have set you for a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo; This word is a quotation from Isaiah 49:6, which refers to Christ as God&rsquo;s Servant, whom God makes a light to the Gentiles so that His salvation may reach to the end of the earth. The apostle Paul, because he was one with Christ in carrying out God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ, applied this prophetic word to himself in his ministry of gospel preaching for the turning of the gospel from the Jews, because of their rejection, to the Gentiles. In His ministry on earth the Lord expressed the same thing to the stubborn Jews in Luke 4:24-27.</p><h2 class="head2">Those Appointed to Eternal Life</h2><p>Acts 13:48 continues, &ldquo;And the Gentiles, hearing this, rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; also may be rendered &ldquo;ordained.&rdquo; To reject the gospel is evidence of one&rsquo;s being unworthy of eternal life (v. 46); to believe it is proof of one&rsquo;s being appointed, or ordained, by God to eternal life. God&rsquo;s ordination or predestination for man&rsquo;s salvation is sovereignly of Himself. However, He still leaves man to his own free will. Whether man will believe or reject His salvation is left up to man&rsquo;s own decision.</p><p>Whether or not we are appointed to eternal life is made evident by our rejecting or believing the gospel. If you receive the word of the gospel, this is a proof that God has appointed you to eternal life. But if a particular person rejects the word of the gospel, this is a proof that he is not worthy of eternal life, that he has not been appointed to eternal life. Concerning this, God has His authority and jurisdiction, and man has a free will. On the one hand, God has the power to assign, to appoint; on the other hand, man has the ability to accept or refuse.</p><p>In these verses we have the Savior, the Son of God, the holy and faithful things, the grace of God, and eternal life. When we enjoy eternal life, we enjoy the grace of God. When we enjoy this grace, we enjoy the holy and faithful things. When we enjoy the holy and faithful things, we enjoy the firstborn Son of God and the Savior.</p><h2 class="head2">The Disciples Made Full<br />of Joy and of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Acts 13:49-52 say, &ldquo;And the word of the Lord was carried through the whole country. But the Jews incited the worshipping women of high standing and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out from their districts. But they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came to Iconium. And the disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In verse 52 the Greek word translated &ldquo;made full&rdquo; is <i>pleroo,</i> which means to be filled inwardly. According to its usage in Acts, <i>pleroo</i> denotes to fill a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly in 2:2. In 13:52 the disciples were filled inwardly and essentially with the Spirit for their Christian living. This infilling is of the Holy Spirit essentially for life, not for power economically. Joy, being a matter of life, not of power, proves this.</p><p>In addition to the Savior, the Son of God, the holy and faithful things, the grace of God, and eternal life in verses 34 through 48, we now have the Holy Spirit in verse 52. The Savior, the Son of God, the holy and faithful things, the grace of God, and the eternal life are compounded in the one, all-inclusive, life-giving Holy Spirit. This all-inclusive Spirit is now the all-inclusive &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; for our experience and enjoyment. When we partake of this &ldquo;sandwich,&rdquo; we enjoy eternal life, grace, the holy and faithful things, the firstborn Son of God, and the Savior.</p><p>In this message we have seen the way to study the Bible and to preach the gospel. First we have Christ Jesus, and eventually we have the Holy Spirit. We have Christ Jesus as the Savior, the firstborn Son of God, the holy and faithful things, grace, and eternal life. Now we see that all this is in the Holy Spirit, and we are made full of this Spirit essentially. Thank the Lord that within the all-inclusive Holy Spirit we have forgiveness, justification, sanctification, righteousness, holiness, power, strength, authority, life, and light. Praise the Lord for all that is included in the all-inclusive Spirit!</p>
