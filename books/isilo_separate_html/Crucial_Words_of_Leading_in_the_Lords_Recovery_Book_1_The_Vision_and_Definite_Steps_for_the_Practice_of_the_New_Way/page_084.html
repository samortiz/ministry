<p>I hope we will overturn the Chinese disposition, which is to be nice and polite when sitting in a meeting. Even if everyone decided to visit hell, there would be no disagreement; at the most there might be an oblique suggestion to visit heaven instead. But after the meeting, everyone is freely criticized and condemned. When the elders come together, they can talk and debate about everything, but in the end everyone must be in one accord to carry out the decision. No one can act independently. Please remember that we are not serving merely as elders in our own little halls; we are serving as one of the elders of the entire church in conjunction with eighty other brothers.</p>
<p>In the past I told the senior elders that they should not carry the burden of the church in Taipei entirely on their own shoulders. They must build up the elders&rsquo; meeting and let that meeting lead and direct the church. Only in this way can the church be strong and the Lord have a free way to go on. When I returned to Taiwan a year and a half ago, I appointed eighty elders. The purpose of my appointment was to build up the elders&rsquo; meeting. I hope that we will learn to pick up the burden of the church and will learn to expand and head up the church in a good way. Only then will the church advance and have a good future.</p>
<p>In summary, our goal is very clear. We need to work on the communities because the general population is there. The church must follow the direction of the population. At the same time, we must work on the campuses. We need to gain the present generation of young people for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In particular, the church must do something at National Taiwan University. For this purpose, the elders need to rise up, pray much, and fellowship concerning what to do. For now, we will advance toward these two main goals. The spreading of the gospel in other areas will follow.</p>
<p>It is right to be careful and cautious, but &ldquo;where there is a will, there is a way.&rdquo; The Lord wants our cooperation. The church is here, and it should have some action and endeavoring. Several times in the past I rebuked the co-workers. I pointed out that in Taiwan, industry, commerce, education, and politics are all advancing, but the church is not advancing. I have waited for many years, but nothing has changed; everything has remained the same. This is the reason I made the drastic decision to come back and do something myself. The elders can consider themselves a new generation. The senior elders should also consider themselves as young and vigorous. We should begin everything anew and build up the church anew. We cannot sit around and do nothing, merely conveying a little truth and life to the saints and expecting them to grow in life at their own pace. On the island of Taiwan the Lord has been delayed by our delaying for more than thirty years. There has been no gain, no progress. In the face of all the advances and prosperity around us, we must do something. We should strive with all we have. Only then will the Lord have a way. We must pick up these three burdens&mdash;building up the home meetings, having a success in the truth-teaching meetings, and aggressively developing the community and campus work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MATCHING GOD&rsquo;S WORK WITH OUR MATERIAL SUPPLY</h2>
<p>In order to pick up the burden and to spread the work aggressively, we need to match God&rsquo;s work with our material supply. The present urgent need is to take care of the full-timers. Today the standard of living in Taiwan is high, yet our support for the full-timers is very low. These full-timers have given up their future for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In addition to taking care of their living, they also give away books and booklets to their contacts and the new believers. We need to take care of them. For this reason, I have seriously considered before the Lord to raise the support of the full-timers so that they will not need to worry about their living and can concentrate on the great work of evangelizing Taiwan.</p>
<p>I have presented all these needs to the churches. I hope we will see that the gospelization of Taiwan is not a slogan. We must give our all. The need of the full-timers is at least NT$120,000,000 (approximately US$4,000,000) per year. If we can raise this amount, we can be elders. If we cannot raise this amount, we are not qualified to be an elder. In order for all the saints to give everything to the Lord, the co-workers and elders must be in one accord. We must take the lead to charge forward. The result will surely come. However, if we expect the horses to run fast without supplying them with adequate grass, we are impractical. The Lord cannot bless this kind of attitude.</p>
<p>I say this because I am clear within that the Lord has blessed us greatly in material supply. Today the assets and income of most of the saints far exceed their need. The question is whether or not we are truly for the Lord. Have we truly consecrated our all to the Lord? When we all put our shoulders together, we can build a city. When everyone gives a hand, we can lift many things easily. If everyone puts in his share, we will more than meet our needs. This requires not only the churches&rsquo; attention and the saints&rsquo; awareness but also our practical consecration.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, should any church or meeting hall have some promising persons, I hope we would send them to the United States for special training. Their mind will be opened when they learn from other churches and fellowship with other churches. This is the way the world advances in science, education, and commerce. It encourages international exchange, and the result is phenomenal. We, however, are barely moving at all. We need to learn so that the church can catch up with the advance of the age.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> </body></html>
