[1]  2 "The Things Which You Have Seen" Section Two "The Things Which Are" Sections Three Ephesus The Post-Apostolic Church Sub-Section One Smyrna The Suffering Church Sub-Section Two Pergamos The Corrupted Church Sub-Section Three
[2]  SECTION TWO "THE THINGS WHICH YOU HAVE SEEN" CHAPTER ONE
[3]  Verse 1: "The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John."
[4]  Revelation is also what the Lord Jesus showed unto "His slaves."
[5]  He did not show Himself as the Head of the Body to His disciples or as their friend to disclose to them what was in His heart.
[6]  In the Gospel of John, the sole purpose of the Holy Spirit is to point out that those who believe in the Lord Jesus are children of God.
[7]  John 1:12 says: "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name."
[8]  After the Lord resurrected from the dead, He said, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" 20:17 .
[9]  What John saw was "the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ."
[10]  He did not testify something besides the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
[11]  It is not only so at the beginning of the book, but also at the end of the book, where the Lord also said, "These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place.
[12]  The book of Revelation really demands us to keep its words.
[13]  Although it sometimes seems very difficult to keep according to the flesh, is not the yoke of the Lord easy?
[14]  B. GREETING AND BLESSING VERSES 4-5 Verses Four and Five
[15]  Verses 4-5a: "John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne.
[16]  And from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth."
[17]  The name of our God here also matches this point.
[18]  "Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth."
[19]  Here we see that grace and peace are from the Triune God.
[20]  However, it is no more "Grace to you and peace from God our Father," nor is it "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[21]  Isaiah 55:4 says that God has "given him as a witness to the peoples."
[22]  When our Lord was judged, He Himself also said, "I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth" John 18:37 .
[23]  Since the Lord witnessed a good confession, we should follow His example.
[24]  Many people who witness for God have failed in varying degrees, but our Lord is faithful.
[25]  If our hearts are not faithful to the things of the Lord, though we may have many successes, the Lord is not concerned.
[26]  Not only is our Lord like this; He desires that we also be like Him in these three things: we are to be His witnesses, our hope is to attain unto the out-resurrection Phil 3:11 , and we are to desire after the reigning together with Him as kings in the future.
[27]  C. EXULTATION VERSES 5-7 Verses Five through Six
[28]  Verses 5b-6: "To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and the might forever and ever.
[29]  When a person who is intimately related to the Lord hears about the glory of the Lord, he will surely be reminded of his relationship with the Lord.
[30]  Even though what is described here is not the intimate relationship between the Lord Jesus and the church but rather His glory as the Judge, nevertheless, those who really love the Lord cannot but raise their voices to praise Him.
[31]  In the coming kingdom, the Lord will make us a kingdom of priests.
[32]  At that time we shall not only be priests individually, but we shall be joined together to be a priesthood, as a kingdom.
[33]  One who has the same kind of life as Enoch's will undoubtedly have the same testimony as Enoch's. "And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him" Gen 5:24 . This is he that testified, "Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints." The saints of God living in this world should be like Enoch, walking with God and witnessing for God.
[34]  Verse 7: "Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him.
[35]  Although verses 5 through 7 are all exultations of the saints, verses 5 and 6 are their praises while verse 7 is their testimony toward the world following their praising of the Lord.
[36]  It is through seeing Christ and through realizing the blessings we have in Him that we are drawn to fellowship with Him and to worship Him.
[37]  Only when we consider the cross of the Lord and recall how He expresses His love, washes away our sins, and puts us in a high position are we able to have a sense of gratitude which results in worship and a worship which results in fellowship with the Lord.
[38]  However, if the believers pay attention only to the key passages of the prophecies without touching the love of the Lord, they will not be able to worship the Lord.
[39]  Why does the Lord allow them to go through the great tribulation and to suffer?
[40]  He wants to use the suffering to discipline them.
[41]  The Lord rebukes and chastens them because He wants them to "partake of His holiness" Heb 12:10 .
[42]  If God does not receive His children's response when He calls them with love in grace, He will have no other course but to refine them with rebukes in grace.
[43]  Therefore, may the Lord grant us grace and make us willing now to allow His Holy Spirit to work the cross deeply into us through the constraint of Christ's love, so that we will have the genuine experience of being crucified, resurrected, and ascended with the Lord, and that we will gain His pleasure and be raptured.
[44]  In our study of prophecy we should carefully differentiate these three points: the special rapture of the overcoming saints, the coming of the Lord to the air to receive all of the saints, and the coming of the Lord with the saints to the earth.
[45]  This is also the same as the testimony in Acts: the Lord Jesus "was lifted up, and a cloud took Him away from their sight...Behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them, who also said,...This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven" 1:9-11 .
[46]  D. THE TESTIMONY OF GOD VERSE 8 Verse 8
[47]  Verse 8: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty."
[48]  This means that this phrase, "Yes, amen" was spoken by "the Lord God."
[49]  John did not call himself a member of Christ nor did he call himself an apostle.
[50]  May the Lord give us a bigger heart to receive all the brothers in the Lord so that they will know that we are always joint partakers with them in all things.
[51]  Tribulation, kingdom, and endurance we have already seen how the Word of God testifies that we should gain the kingdom through tribulation.
[52]  To those who know the future glory and who for its sake are willing to endure the tribulation, the most important thing is endurance.
[53]  We may be counted unworthy by the Lord to enter into the kingdom of God.
[54]  If by the Holy Spirit of God we would endure tribulation, ever accepting that which is new after that which is old is over, and faithfully allowing tribulation to treat us harshly, to hurt us, to afflict us, and to break us so that God can accomplish His perfect will, our next tribulation will find us with more strength to endure than before.
[55]  On the one hand, if we look at the signs now, we know the Lord is surely coming soon, but on the other hand, maybe the Lord will not come within ten years or a hundred years.
[56]  If we forsake sins, we should all the more be humble, for the one who suffers for the Lord, if he does not continue to rely upon Him, may think, "I serve the Lord this way, but no one else does!"
[57]  When the apostle addressed himself as "I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus," was not his intention for us to be partakers in all these three things?
[58]  Unless we do partake in them, we will probably not be able to understand the spiritual meaning in this book.
[59]  If we befriend the world, how can we sympathize with John on the island of Patmos?
[60]  Although the Word of God is now complete and there is no need for newer revelations, do not those who follow in the footsteps of the servants of God receive the opening up of God's word and the companionship of the Lord Jesus?
[61]  If the Lord's Day were to refer to the day of the Lord, then what is recorded in Revelation could only be things happening at the day of the Lord.
[62]  The believers should ask for grace in the Lord to separate the soul from the spirit in their experience so that in all circumstances, whether it be the deserted island of Patmos or other harrowing environments, their spirits will not be bound from fellowshipping with the Lord and receiving revelation from Him.
[63]  Verse 11: "Saying, What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."
[64]  John said, "Young children, it is the last hour" 1 John 2:18 .
[65]  Was this not written during only the first few pages of the history of the church?
[66]  Jude said also, "For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who of old have been written of beforehand for this judgment, ungodly men, perverting the grace of our God into licentiousness and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ" Jude 4 .
[67]  Verse 12: "And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands."
[68]  Before the apostle was to see the future judgment and glory, he was to first consider the condition of the church.
[69]  The seven golden lampstands that John saw were a symbol of the seven churches v. 20 . It is God's boundless grace that made Him speak to the churches even then.
[70]  Hebrews 8:2 and 5 say, "A Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man....Who the priest serve the example and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to complete the tabernacle; for, See,' He said, that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.'"
[71]  Verse 13: "And in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle."
[72]  Verses 14-15: "And His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire; and His feet were like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace; and His voice was like the sound of many waters."
[73]  Not only does the Lord's clothing reveal the nature of judgment, He Himself reveals nothing less than the same.
[74]  Verse 16: "And He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword; and His face shone as the sun shines in its power."
[75]  The above is a declaration of the person of the One who became the Son of Man in grace.
[76]  G. THE COMMISSION OF THE LORD VERSES 17-20 Verse Seventeen
[77]  Verse 17a: "And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead."
[78]  It took only a turn and one glimpse of this glorious Lord Jesus to produce such an effect.
[79]  Although Christ is the judge expressing His majesty, and although the saints bear a serious responsibility before Him, John heard someone say, "Do not fear."
[80]  It is because the Lord Jesus, who is alive and who is the First and the Last, has become a man and has died and resurrected.
[81]  The Lord continued in verse 19: "Write therefore the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which are about to take place after these things."
[82]  Because the Lord Jesus is "the First and the Last and the living One," and because He "became dead," and is "living forever and ever," and because He has "the keys of death and of Hades," therefore "write."
[83]  Because He is what He said He is in verses 17 and 18, therefore write to show forth His glory, and because He is what He said He is in verses 17 and 18, therefore write to declare the believer's responsibility and the devil's defeat.
[84]  Since He was alive from the dead and is the Lord of all, He commanded John to write, and His commandment must be right.
[85]  Verse 20: "The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are seven churches."
[86]  While the cry for an indigenous church today carries such high pitch and perhaps the church will go through a major change in the near future may we understand what the will of God is toward the church so that we will not compound mistake upon mistake.
[87]  The arguments related to church matters cannot be built on only one single verse, especially when this verse is full of mystery.
[88]  This is especially true when the concept in question is not allowed elsewhere in the Bible.
[89]  Lately, there have been many of God's children everywhere who consider it wrong to have Christ's Body divided.
[90]  Secondly, what kind of people were they in the churches?
[91]  According to the term messenger, they are the representatives of the churches.
[92]  When we read chapters two and three, we see that the messengers were those counted by the Lord to be responsible for the whole church.
[93]  They were the true members of the church, and as such, the Lord charged them to bear the responsibility for the whole church because they were the only ones that were able to hear the speaking of the Holy Spirit.
[94]  We will just say this much concerning the messengers.
[95]  The church is a lampstand and not a candle because the light of the church comes through the Holy Spirit and is completely dependent upon the Holy Spirit.
[96]  Although we know that these seven churches represent the churches throughout the ages we will speak of that in a moment we must not think that Christ's intention was for us to wait until these two thousand years have passed and the conditions of these seven churches have all become history in the seven periods of the churches before He returns.
[97]  Furthermore, at the end of each of these seven letters was written, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
[98]  There is no other place in the Bible where the importance of these words is emphasized like it is here.
[99]  This word clearly indicates that the message was not written only for the people at that time.
[100]  Nevertheless, our Lord did not explicitly state that these seven churches represented the churches in consecutive generations, nor did He state that these seven epistles are the history of the church in chronological sequence.
[101]  2 In every epistle a different priestly title is revealed.
[102]  Ephesus was a church on the decline, so the Lord revealed Himself as One walking in their midst inspecting His churches.
[103]  Smyrna was a church in tribulation, so the Lord revealed Himself as One who died and rose again, preparing them for martyrdom.
[104]  Pergamos was a church with heresies, so the Lord spoke to them with a two-edged sword showing His judgment.
[105]  Sardis was a church in death, so the Lord revealed Himself as the Spirit of life and as the bright shining star.
[106]  Although to each church the Lord revealed one aspect of Himself for the purpose of exhorting and warning them, these revelations were not limited only to the individual church that received the epistle.
[107]  There were two churches that were perfect and were without any rebuke from the Lord, namely Smyrna and Philadelphia.
[108]  There were two churches completely in failure, having no praise at all from the Lord, namely Sardis and Laodicea.
[109]  There were other churches that had many good works as well as many evil deeds.
[110]  We observe that at the beginning the Lord always commended their virtues, and at the end He always had to reprimand them!
[111]  In 2:2-3 the Lord mentioned many virtues about the church in Ephesus, but in verse four He says, "But I have one thing against you...."
[112]  In 2:13 the Lord commended the faithfulness of the church in Pergamos, but verse 14 says, "But I have a few things against you..."
[113]  May we be separated from others in all sinful situations, whether they be in the world or in the church, and may we overcome as our Lord has overcome so that we may please God and obtain His reward.
[114]  Verse one: "To the messenger of the church in Ephesus write: These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands."
[115]  Although today we no longer have direct inspirations from the Lord, we should be careful about what we write.
[116]  Those who are faithful in the Lord's service grieve much for the present church organizations and denominations, but unfortunately, they forget that one local church is but the representation of the whole church of God in that locality.
[117]  At the time Paul wrote his Epistle to the Ephesians, the latter's spiritual progress was unmatched by any other churches of the day.
[118]  However, the epistle we are about to read was written by the Lord Jesus thirty years later.
[119]  Although they still kept their predecessors' tradition of zealous service for the Lord, they had lost the impetus of the zeal of their predecessors.
[120]  The name of the place where this church was, Ephesus, also shows the laxity in love which would eventually come in. We would not be surprised if the church in Corinth were considered the foremost of all churches and were to lose its first love, but it is quite incomprehensible that a church as spiritual as this one would degrade into such a condition.
[121]  Were they officers in the church by whom the Lord conveyed His intention to the church, or were they specially capable ones through whom the Lord pronounced His judgment?"
[122]  They are the ones who have an ear to hear the Lord, eyes to behold the Lord, and a heart to love the Lord.
[123]  Verses 2-3: "I know your works and your labor and your endurance and that you cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false; and you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary."
[124]  Although the Lord rebuked the shortcomings of the saints, He tried His best to first praise them.
[125]  Just as the apostle told the believers: "What things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things" Phil 4:8 , in the same way the Lord loves to praise what is good in His sight.
[126]  Verse 4:"But I have one thing against you, that you have left your first love."
[127]  This softens the tone of the Lord and gives the impression that the Lord's rebuke was a light one.
[128]  If we think that the Lord was only against them in this one thing, we may think that what the Lord was against was not something too serious.
[129]  Now, as far as the church is concerned, the "first" love does not refer only to the love of an individual saint when he first believes in the Lord.
[130]  The "first" here is not just a matter of time.
[131]  This is the result of the prayer of Ephesians 3:14-19: "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" vv.
[132]  The most dangerous thing is for saints not to be in the Lord's light, who, not having seen any light, assume that everything is just as before and that there is no danger of separation from the Lord in their spiritual life, not knowing that in the deepest part of their hearts they have lost the fellowship of intense love between them and the Lord.
[133]  Verse 5:"Remember therefore where you have fallen from and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent."
[134]  The Lord did not abandon them and leave them to desolation.
[135]  It is not that we are reluctant to serve the Lord, but we would much rather serve the Lord in a way that would not require us to do something that is too humiliating for us and which would sacrifice the achievements that we boast in. This kind of repentance is too embarrassing for us! It is alright for the sinners to do this, but for a saint to do this is too unsettling to his self-righteous heart! But then, the cross is not something up to our choice.
[136]  After we have read the book of Ephesians, we will see the relationship between "the first love" and "the first works": "But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love" 4:15-16 .
[137]  These are the "first works" that parallel the "first love."
[138]  The works considered precious by the Lord are not those that are outwardly great or important, but those that actually build up the Body of Christ "in love."
[139]  Because there is the love of the Lord Jesus, all the works become works for the building up of the church, and there will be the fitting and the knitting in harmony, and no dissension of opinions will be brought in. Although the church has now left its first love and has not done its first works, we can still be joined to the Head and can grow into Him in all things, from whom we will receive the supply and the strength.
[140]  When we receive the Lord Jesus Christ with a definite faith and allow Him to make home in our heart, our love will be rooted and grounded, and we will "be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth" v. 18 . When the Lord of love makes home in us, we will realize the measure of love.
[141]  We have to realize that the church will be judged in this age and will lose its illuminating power and position.
[142]  Whenever the spiritual power is gone, God's judgment follows.
[143]  The Lord leaves the church on earth as a testimony for the Lord Jesus.
[144]  The church should testify of the Lord's past works, His present position, and His future glory.
[145]  Verse 6: "But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
[146]  We will not cover the teaching of the Nicolaitans until we come to the section on Pergamos.
[147]  But what should we do if the church has left its first love, intentionally or unintentionally, and has usurped the place of Christ and the Holy Spirit, acting contrary to the teaching of the Bible, adding to it what the Bible never teaches, and shouting loudly for others to follow it?
[148]  The Lord is calling individual saints to hear what the Spirit is speaking to the churches so that through their understanding of Christ's mind they may be able to measure the condition of the church by His word.
[149]  13-15 , so that the disciples who had ears could hear v. 9 . In the same way, the Lord has now judged the church and is speaking words that they "hear and by no means understand" v. 14 so that those who have ears can follow Him individually.
[150]  In these few epistles God did not give one promise to the whole church.
[151]  In Revelation, God never takes the whole church as a unit and promises the same reward to the whole church.
[152]  Furthermore, according to the original language, it is "the Paradise of My God," that is, the Paradise of the God of the Lord Jesus, the God whom the Lord Jesus knows.
[153]  This church had committed three mistakes: 1 forgetting the Lord's power and His presence; for this reason, the Lord reminded them that He had the seven stars in His right hand and was walking in the midst of the seven lampstands; 2 forsaking the first love; and 3 looking to a human leader.
[154]  When we study history and consider the conditions then, we will realize that it was exactly as our Lord had described.
[155]  We have seen how the church had left her first love to the Lord Jesus during the age of Ephesus.
[156]  When God saw that His church had lost her first position, He allowed Satan, who was always seeking for the opportunity, to persecute her so that through suffering she may learn to realize that God is her hiding place.
[157]  Although we may think that the suffering of Smyrna was in the nature of a chastening rod, we cannot consider her suffering to be purely of this nature.
[158]  Those who suffer with Christ may not be the ones who suffer for Christ.
[159]  However, sometimes God would have us suffer for Christ while we are suffering with Him.
[160]  The Lord had lovingly restrained the roaring of the enemy so that His people would recover the freshness they had for the Lord, which otherwise would have been lost in their comfort.
[161]  Verse 9: "I know your tribulation and poverty but you are rich and the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."
[162]  He knows how the church has become poor for His sake, and He knows what the suffering and poverty of the church mean.
[163]  Every suffering that we encounter in our heart and soul and every wound in our body that we suffer for the Lord draw us closer to the Lord.
[164]  On the other hand, those who are faithful for the Lord, who love the Lord zealously, and who are willing to suffer opposition and persecution from the world and from the church for the Lord's sake and for His truth's sake, though void of great endeavors in the world, are precious in the Lord's eyes.
[165]  "And the slander from those who call themselves Jews..."
[166]  The Lord not only knows the tribulations of His people and puts their tears into His bottle Psa 56:8 , He also knows the cruelty and slander of their persecutors.
[167]  However, we should not think that because of this the church is at her golden age and that she is full of glory and void of failures.
[168]  Although the Lord was fully sympathetic towards His suffering people, He pointed out the problem that everyone else did not see: "the slander from those who call themselves Jews."
[169]  The Judaistic teachings, that is, the teachings that turn believers back to the Old Testament to the keeping of the commandments of the law, cannot solve the problems of life, death, salvation, and perdition.
[170]  In the age of the law, there was never the assurance of salvation, and there was never the justification of man.
[171]  Although the law says that "if a man do he shall live by them" Lev 18:5 , yet it also says "there is none that doeth good, no, not one" Psa 14:3 .
[172]  Actually, it was predestinated to be so: "Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God" Rom 3:19 .
[173]  There are too many errors in the teachings of the Judaizers.
[174]  They cause man to doubt the assurance of his salvation; they rob man of his freedom and put him under the heavy yoke of the law again Gal 5:1 .
[175]  Today, all around us, we see the effect of the Judaistic teachings: God has retreated behind the veil, man has departed from God, everywhere there is darkness and uncertain hopes, the church is mingled with the world, believers have lost their joy and blessing, and the church has degenerated.
[176]  Verse 10: "Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer.
[177]  Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days.
[178]  The Lord Jesus is here forewarning His people of their coming sufferings.
[179]  The Lord Jesus is the prophet to His church; He knows everything that is going to happen.
[180]  God allows Satan to sift the saints so that their light may shine and that God's name may be glorified.
[181]  It does not mean that they are not true.
[182]  Although the Lord allows Satan to apply his great pressure to the church, the Lord restricts the work of the enemy, in the same way that He handled the case of Job "You will have tribulation ten days."
[183]  This being the case, since the Lord has put us in tribulations, and since He has allowed the enemy to try us, we should not hope or pray for the Lord to have pity on our weakness, to lead us out of the tribulations, to stop the fiery trials, and to grant us a comfortable and peaceful living.
[184]  The word "faithful" is pistos in the original language.
[185]  Although not all of us will necessarily die, and although it is possible for some of us to remain until the Lord comes back, such is the Lord's charge: to be faithful unto death, that is, to be faithful unto the end. The day of the coming of the Lord is nearer day by day.
[186]  Although the Lord has not ordained that every one of us be martyrs in our body, He desires that we have the spirit of those who will not deny the Lord or disobey His word even unto death.
[187]  Nevertheless, some people think that it is easier to make a clear-cut move and to die for the Lord once for all.
[188]  They think that it is too difficult to suffer daily for the Lord, to bear misunderstandings and opposition for the sake of obeying the Lord and His word and for the sake of pleasing the Lord's heart.
[189]  However, if one cannot live as a martyr for the Lord, he cannot die as a martyr for the Lord.
[190]  If a man realizes the heart-rending pain a martyr faces at the point of death, he will not consider it an easy thing to die for the Lord.
[191]  If the Lord Jesus with His perfect humanity would need to have the prayer at Gethesemane, how about the ordinary man?
[192]  If we truly have the cross working in us, we will consider this life in death as something precious, because it is this life that pleases the Lord.
[193]  He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death."
[194]  1 According to the biblical teaching, we know that as soon as a sinner receives the Lord Jesus as his personal Savior, and as soon as he believes that the Lord Jesus has died for him on the cross, he is eternally saved.
[195]  The following are the proofs: 1 "He who believes has eternal life" John 6:47 .
[196]  Once we believe, we have it, and what we have is eternal life.
[197]  As such, the efficaciousness of the blood of the Lord Jesus is eternal with those who believe in Him.
[198]  4 Once a sinner believes in the Lord Jesus, he receives the Holy Spirit and is joined to the Lord in life, becoming a member of the Body of Christ.
[199]  In conclusion, the Bible teaches us that believers are saved forever.
[200]  We believe and know that the Bible does not contradict itself, and God's work does not contradict itself.
[201]  Ephesus depicts the first era of the church on earth.
[202]  Verse 12: "And to the messenger of the church in Pergamos write: These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword."
[203]  In the church in Smyrna we saw that although Satan attacked the church, its love increased through persecution.
[204]  Verse 13: "I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; and you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells."
[205]  Verse 14: "But I have a few things against you, that you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication."
[206]  There are, of course, many reasons for God to forbid the bearing of various yokes.
[207]  But the total significance of these yokes is an alliance with man for the purpose of pursuing after a common goal.
[208]  However, we must not forget that as far as yokes are concerned the most serious consideration is in relationship to the church itself.
[209]  If I say more, my heart will not be happy and will not improve anything.
[210]  But I would present this most solemn matter before those who love Christ honestly and who honor Him faithfully.
[211]  Verse 15: "In the same way you also have some who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans."
[212]  After reading the Lord's letter to the Ephesians, we should realize what the works of the Nicolaitans are.
[213]  Therefore, we have to spend some time to investigate, not from the church but from the Bible, the matter of ordination.
[214]  If we read through the New Testament, we will not be able to find one place where man must be ordained before he can teach, preach, administer the Lord's supper, or baptize others.
[215]  At the beginning, we see the church in Jerusalem being dispersed and everyone except the apostles going out to preach.
[216]  Please do not misunderstand the teaching of the Bible.
[217]  Although the Bible has never taught us that a man must be ordained before he can preach and teach and before he can administer the bread or baptize others, it has never annulled the works that Christians have been set apart to do.
[218]  It does not mean that since the Bible has no record of any ordination that leads to a clerical class that transcends over other brothers, there is, therefore, no such thing as the ministry of preaching in the Bible.
[219]  The Bible teaches us that everyone who preaches for the Lord does so by receiving the gift from the Head of the church, who takes care of His people under His direction.
[220]  The work they did was the work of overseeing.
[221]  Since heresies and evil teachings were prevalent at that time, being "apt to teach" must have been one of their qualifications 1 Tim 3:2 .
[222]  However, we must not make the mistake in thinking that since elders should be apt to teach, all therefore who teach are the elders.
[223]  Since we cannot find in the Bible the teaching of ordination for the evangelists and the shepherds and teachers, we know that the system of the denominations is a tradition of man and is of no effect to those Christians who faithfully love the Lord.
[224]  How we wish that we did not have to speak what we are speaking here!
[225]  How we wish that the scattered children of God could walk according to His word and could move solely by God's instruction without any tradition or self-will.
[226]  If this were the case, we would not have need to say all the things that we have said!
[227]  But since we are at a time of apostasy and tradition, we, the servants of God, dare not be silent, and we dare not keep back our testimony against sin, whether it be sin in the world or sin in the church.
[228]  The Lord Jesus said in Revelation 2:6, "But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
[229]  As a result, we do not compare them with the word of God in His light and do not differentiate and examine carefully to see if what we have received and what is declared are contrary to the teaching of God.
[230]  Verse 16: "Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth."
[231]  The Lord demanded His messengers to repent and to drive the sinning ones from their midst.
[232]  The Lord considers the messengers the ones responsible before Him.
[233]  The Lord rebuked the messengers because He considers them the representatives of the church.
[234]  The Lord considers it their responsibility to excommunicate from the church those who follow the teaching of Balaam and the Nicolaitans.
[235]  Moreover, this punishment is beneficial also to the excommunicated believers, for when the church exercises righteousness and love to remove the sinning ones from the church according to the teaching of the Bible and the leading of the Holy Spirit, the sinning ones will be recovered to their true faith and will repent of their sinful acts through the punishment.
[236]  If believers would remember that the house of God should be pure and that God Himself is a consuming fire, they will know how to preserve the order in the house of God and will not come into conflict with God's holiness.
[237]  Verse 17: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
[238]  Here the Lord Jesus is again calling those who have spiritual ears to learn the lesson taught by the Holy Spirit.
[239]  Only those who sympathize with God, not only in mind but in conduct as well, can understand the meaning of the hidden manna.
[240]  We cannot love what contradicts our mind and conduct.
[241]  If we long after the form of Christ as manna on earth, we cannot help but live the same kind of life.
[242]  All our sufferings for the Lord, our works for Him, all our experiences in Him, whether in realizing His victory, in being filled with His life, or in tasting of His love, will all be reviewed in experience in eternity.
[243]  Hence, the wilderness is a place where man trusts in God.
[244]  He is not only our Lord, protecting us; He is also in our midst, walking with us, holding our hands, sympathizing with us, and speaking words of comfort to us.
[245]  "I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows except he who receives it" 2:17 .
[246]  Both the hidden manna and the white stone refer to the individual hidden experiences, but the former points to how the believers love the Lord, while the latter points to how the Lord loves the believers.
[247]  The church in this age is the church that had passed through the great persecutions of the Roman Empire and which was accepted by the Roman Emperor as the state religion.
