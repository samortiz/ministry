   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE JEWS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the last one hundred years, the United States has been able to assimilate all kinds of peoples into one culture.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Jews are an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Had it not been for the fact that it is so difficult for them to be assimilated, after more than twenty-five hundred years of exile they would have become the same as the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But God has promised through the Old Testament prophets that He would gather the Jews back to their country again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they had been assimilated, how could they return?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why God has preserved their national distinctiveness for more than two thousand years!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a proof of the reality of the biblical prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE PLANNING OF A NEW COLLEGE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the past two years, someone has considered building a British-style college on the Mount of Olives with 250,000.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>HOSPITALS ESTABLISHED IN PALESTINE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The United Hadassah Society, the American Zionist Women's Association, and the American Medical Association are prepared to spend one million dollars to build a few hospitals in Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The medical department of the Hebrew University will be incorporated into this project.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE DEVELOPMENT OF TEL AVIV AND JAFFA</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Jewish settlement office has agreed on a plan to make Tel Aviv a fast-developing city close to Jaffa the hub of a railway network in Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ludd about ten miles from Tel Aviv was originally the crossroads for the Kantara-Haifa and Jaffa-Jerusalem line.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now the crossroads will be transferred to Tel Aviv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way Tel Aviv and Jaffa will be greatly rewarded, because the office has agreed to build the harbor in Haifa and not in Jaffa.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>WORK OF THE JEWS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work of building waterways and roads around Haifa harbor has already employed six to seven hundred Jews.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Recently, Mr. ______ has a report in the World Report concerning the progress of the work in Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He wrote the following:</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every aspect of the work in Palestine is amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone is busy, and no one is idle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Progress in building can be seen everywhere throughout the country.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Residential houses are going up in hundreds, as are shops and factories.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jerusalem has some very tall buildings, and one twelve-story office building is being constructed which looks like an Egyptian palace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Wages are high, and, in short, the people are happy and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, five years ago when the land was taken back by the British from the Turks, it was a bankrupt and deserted country.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time very few cities had escaped the damage of the war.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All arable fields were left untilled.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Areas where the Turkish armies had passed through were even more devastated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Riots and lawlessness were rife, and there were always robberies by nomad Arabs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not one aspect of Palestine, including its finances, industry, social order, and politics, was left undamaged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At present, the cleanliness and orderliness of Jerusalem surprised me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It has been found out that the mortality rate is the same as that in London.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The health department is also doing its best.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The narrow streets are being cleaned regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One thing that the British government paid attention to was to clean out the small ponds and to cover them up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There were about six thousand of them, and some of them had not been cleaned for more than a hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now mosquito-borne malaria and the suffering of fevers caused by the summer months in Jerusalem are all removed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We believe that more changes will come.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The faithful Zionists said that they will turn Palestine into another Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This reminds us of Joel 2:3 which says that the Holy Land will be as Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But it also mentions a great army coming in to destroy and to lay the land waste to desolation once more.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This fact will indeed be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the Zionists have accomplished their enterprises, the nations will come up to devastate the land again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But by that time, the Lord will come and deliver the remnant among the Israelites who fear the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The prosperity of Palestine is nothing but a sign to us that our days are about to end.</S>
