Brothers and sisters, it does not matter whether you are old or young, or whether you are a first-time hearer of my speaking. You should know that God has been dispensed into you. You have another Person in you; you are no longer by yourself. Never forget this: Now God is in you and He wants to increase in you and renew you day by day. Second Corinthians 4:16b says, &#8220;Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&#8221; God is carrying out His renewing work in us daily. We are being renewed day by day. In other words, God is increasing in us daily. Although this time you have come to attend this conference for only two days, I hope that you will gain God unlimitedly so that when you return to your home what you will show people is not what messages you have heard but a definite growth of Christ in you and an increase of God in you.<p>In this conference we have a new hymn with four stanzas (using the tune of Hymns, #499), expressing God&#8217;s highest purpose concerning man. I hope that every one of you will sing this new hymn until it gets into your being.	<ol class="decimal">	<li>What miracle!
