   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SELF-MADE CULTURE AND INHERITED CULTURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have not only the culture of our particular country, but also our self-made culture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Unconsciously and subconsciously, we all have some kind of self-made culture.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This culture is constituted not only of certain practices by which we carry on our daily living; it also becomes the standard for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we have such a standard, we are under the influence of our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Culture does not merely refer to things such as our way of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In particular, culture implies certain standards.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within us we have a mental picture of the kind of person we think we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is our self-made culture, the standard we have for our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God called Abraham, He did not give Abraham a map.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, the Lord s presence was Abraham s living map.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most of today s Christians, however, prefer to have some kind of map to direct them day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This map is drawn unconsciously according to the standards they have for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Day by day, they drive according to this map.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we have such a map, we automatically set the Lord aside, for He is replaced by our standards.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we have our self-made standards for the Christian life, there is no need to seek the Lord, to contact Him, or to trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, we live according to our standards.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some may claim that they daily pray to the Lord and ask Him for help.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes, they may pray for the Lord s help, but the kind of help they want is that which enables them to fulfill their standard.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is far different from asking the Lord to lead us according to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, we have our standards and then ask for the Lord s help to reach them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what it means to live according to our self-made culture.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Along with our self-made culture, we have the culture which we have accumulated unconsciously through the influence of our environment and background.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From childhood, many have been trained to be honest, humble, gentle, and kind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such a culture is part of their very being, and they live by it spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those with such a culture may love the Lord and may be in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, instead of living Christ, they live by their culture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may live either by the culture we have inherited or by the culture we make for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In either case, our being is occupied and possessed by culture, not by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we regard our culture as good, we do not condemn it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who would condemn the standard he has for a good married life?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of condemning our culture, we treasure it and appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We place a high value on the good things we have inherited.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Spontaneously we live by our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even though the grace which has been ministered to us in the church life causes many things to be discharged from us, our culture still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Satan, the subtle one, uses our culture to frustrate us from enjoying Christ and experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now that Christ has come into us and lives in us, we must rise up to condemn the inherited or self-made culture which hinders us from experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should condemn our culture as much as we condemn the sinful and worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because our culture is part of our very constitution, we need the heavenly light to shine upon us to expose it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Under such a shining, we shall say, Satan, I condemn your subtlety.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before Christ came into me, I needed to live by culture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now I need to live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, I hate the culture within me and condemn it, for it keeps me from enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>LIVING BY THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is crucial for us to see that God wants nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we see this vision, we shall set aside our standard and aspire to be one with the Lord in our spirit moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The all-inclusive Christ is now in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First Corinthians 6:17 tells us that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 2 Timothy 4:22 Paul says, The Lord be with thy spirit Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>. Our standard should not be the culture we have inherited or the culture we ourselves have made.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our standard should be the oneness with the Lord in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not try to be a good wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead, simply be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then you will live Christ because Christ will actually be living in you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has placed us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we see that our culture frustrates us from experiencing the indwelling Christ, we shall realize that as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the Lord indwells our spirit and that we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to live by this mingled spirit as the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we allow Christ to live in us day by day, we shall spontaneously live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way, Christ will replace our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>CHRIST, NOT CULTURAL STANDARDS</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The problem with the saints at Colosse was that most of them had been deluded and carried off from Christ to philosophy and religious observances.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They set up this philosophy and these observances as their standard and lived by it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This standard kept them from the enjoyment of Christ and the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This was the reason Paul charged them to let no one purposely defraud them of their prize 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The enemy within us is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have certain standards, either the standards we have inherited or those we have made for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because these standards are good, we do not condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Nevertheless, these good standards are not Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God does not want something good produced by us; He wants Christ and Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the eyes of God, only Christ counts for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God s intention is to work Christ into us so that we may have the full enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When Christ has the free course within us to become our enjoyment and experience, our culture will be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The time has come for all of us in the churches to hear this message, to see this vision, and to condemn our cultural standards.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then we shall realize that what God wants is Christ and that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Instead of living according to a certain standard, we should simply live by the Christ who dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As we live in the spirit, we should let Christ have a free course throughout our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then we shall enjoy Him, experience Him, and be delivered from our culture.</S>
