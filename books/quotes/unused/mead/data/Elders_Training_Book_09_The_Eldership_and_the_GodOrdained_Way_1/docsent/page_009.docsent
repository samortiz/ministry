   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO ENDEAVORING TO CARRY OUT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter I would like to present the contrast between the practice of the church life as seen in the record of the New Testament and what is seen in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE GOD-ORDAINED, SCRIPTURAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TO PRACTICE THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would like to point out three verses that are very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 2:46 tells us that the early Christians broke bread from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek text also can mean that they broke bread "according to their homes."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 5:42 tells us that the early apostles went from house to house to do two things: to preach and to teach Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their gospel was not a theology nor mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their gospel was a living person, the very Christ, whom the Jewish religion at that time opposed to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They preached this opposed One as the gospel and they also taught.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two verses are critical.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another crucial verse is 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse tells us that when the church comes together, each one should have something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This one has a psalm, another one has a teaching, another one has a revelation, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By these three verses, we can see the real situation and the real condition of the believers' meetings in the early days of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This situation and condition cannot be seen in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even we ourselves are very short of this God-ordained way to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, the early believers practiced the church life according to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the church life at that time was in the believers' homes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, when the whole church came together, it was not a meeting in which one person spoke and the rest listened.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their church meetings were full of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Each one should have something of the Lord to share with the others for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such meetings of mutuality cannot be seen in today's Christianity, and it is hard to see them prevailing among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why by October of 1984, I was forced to reconsider what is in the Bible, what we are doing, and what we see in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My eyes were once more enlightened to see God's ordained way to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Surely Christianity has deviated from this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We also have deviated to a certain extent because we have not fully practiced what is recorded in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, I was strong to make a decision that we needed to have a great change, a revolutionary change.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The present practice of Christianity leads to hierarchy, organization, and clergy, producing many so-called laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hierarchy, organization, and clergy are the factors that have killed and even cut Christ's Body into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Doctrinal factors have not done the damage that these three things have done.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These three things mainly depend on the present practice of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the present practice of Christianity is torn down, hierarchy falls apart, organization is gone, and the practice of clergy is buried.</S>
