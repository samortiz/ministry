   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Thank the Lord that today both the divine Spirit and the human spirit are very definitely located.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As believers in Christ, we all have a spirit, and our spirit has been regenerated by the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By this the two spirits have been located in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both of the two spirits are in us!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, wherever we are, these two spirits are with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They have been located within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We, the believers, live the Christian life by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should learn to practice one thing: in doing anything, we should not do it hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we are going to answer someone, we should not answer quickly; instead, we should consider whether or not we are answering in our spirit by the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In everything, we need to consider carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, this is very difficult, but still we need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was born a Chinese, and the Chinese language is my mother tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I began to study English, I found that mastering English pronunciation was very difficult for me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This has required much learning over many years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a similar sense, we were born human, and we were reborn divine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now, we the human beings must learn to live a human life by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This requires much learning because we do not know how to live by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In learning to live a human life by the divine life, prayer is a great help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By nature I am a quick person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is difficult for me to be slow and considerate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, after much prayer I become a very slow and considerate person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praying slows us down.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that praying makes us more spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Prayer causes us to live a human life by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you come to ask me something and I have not prayed in half a day, I will probably answer you quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if you come to me immediately after my morning prayer, I will be very spiritual; I will not answer you quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Prayer slows us down because to pray is to exercise our spirit, and that spontaneously puts aside our emotion, our will, and our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we stir up our spirit by praying, we become a very careful person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have no interest in merely teaching the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My burden is to help the saints to understand what Paul wrote in Galatians 5:16 and 25 concerning living and walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is very rare to meet a person who lives by the Spirit and walks by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not take verses like Galatians 5:16 and 25 for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, we must endeavor to understand what it means to live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
