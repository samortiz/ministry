<h2 class="head1">THE CONFIRMATION OF THE CHURCH GROUND</h2>
<p>The letter I wrote to Brother Hsieh Tien En was my first article published by Brother Nee&rsquo;s Gospel Book Room. I labored very much in writing this article, and although it was a letter, it was like a booklet in content. Many points in the letter were concerning denominations; it defined a denomination and the meaning of denominationalism. At the time I personally was not clear regarding the ground of the church. I knew what oneness was and what a denomination was, and I could speak concerning them. However, I did not know the ground of the church. The other co-workers were also unclear. Only Brother Nee was clear.</p>
<p>About one hundred twenty brothers and sisters from northern China attended the conference in January. This special gathering was a turning point for the advance of the church. It also influenced me personally. From the fellowship we saw the sin of sectarianism and the need for the oneness of the church. Therefore, some co-workers were burdened concerning this matter and determined to take this way.</p>
<p>After the conference, I returned by boat to northern China. Many brothers who attended the conference remained in Shanghai and requested that Brother Nee hold Bible-study meetings to help them know how to meet. This was because meetings were being raised up with ones who left the denominations and the sects, but they did not know how to meet. Brother Nee agreed, and the manuscripts were later edited and published as the book <em>The Assembly Life.</em></p>
<p>I was not present during these meetings, having already returned to northern China. When I returned to Shanghai four months later, I heard about the Bible study but did not see any notes. It was only after Brother Nee finished editing the manuscript, that he gave it to me and asked me to write a preface. I carefully read the messages and understood the content of the entire Bible study. Since then I have been deeply impressed that the expression of the church is local. The word <em>expression,</em> however, was not used then. We began to use the word <em>expression</em> in 1950 in Taiwan when we defined the boundary of a local church. It was also about that time in 1934 that we began to fellowship concerning the matter of locality, and the light concerning locality was confirmed. When the light concerning locality was confirmed, the ground of the church was also confirmed among us.</p>
<p>During the January conference Brother Nee released clear messages on Christ as God&rsquo;s centrality, and he became very clear concerning the ground of the church. As a result, 1934 was a milestone in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and we entered into another stage. We saw that Christ as God&rsquo;s centrality and universality is the content of the church and that outwardly the church should take the ground of locality. After this, Brother Nee was not the only one who was clear concerning all these matters; we, his co-workers, were also clear.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BELIEVERS ENTHUSIASTICALLY LEAVING<br />
THE DENOMINATIONS</h2>
<p>By 1934 a number of people were leaving the denominations. It was becoming a trend, and almost everywhere there was an enthusiastic response. Every day we received many letters and most of them were concerning leaving the denominations. All the letters were given to me because I was the acting editor of <em>Collection of Newsletters.</em> From these letters we learned of many stories of ones who left the denominations. We received letters from the northern, southern, and central parts of China. Leaving the denominations even caused problems among the Western missionaries. Some of the missionaries from the China Inland Mission called a special meeting to discuss how to deal with the situation. In the eyes of Christianity, it was a revolution. Everywhere many were leaving the denominations.</p>
<p>Those who left the denominations followed a general practice to leave openly, not secretly. In most cases, they would write and sign an official letter requesting their denomination to remove their names from the membership registry. It was done rather officially. Although this was not a regulation, the general practice was to write an official letter declaring one&rsquo;s decision to leave the denomination. Believers were leaving with intense fervor and vigor.</p>
