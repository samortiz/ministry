   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Epistle to the Romans Message Seven The Structure of the Gospel of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Righteousness of God, the Life of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and the Faith of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 The Essence of the Faith of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 Scripture Reading: John 3:15, 36; Gal 2:20, 16; 3:22, 26; Rom 3:22; Heb 11:6 OUTLINE The faith of the believers: The word faith bears two denotations: The first denotation refers to the things the believers believe in; it is the objective faith Eph 4:13; 1 Tim 1:19b; 2 Tim 4:7.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second denotation refers to the believing action of the believers; this is the subjective faith Gal 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The faith of the believers is actually not their own faith but Christ entering into them to be their faith Rom 3:22 and note 1; Gal 2:16 and note 1: When they repent unto God, the pneumatic Christ as the sanctifying Spirit of God 1 Pet 1:2a moves within them to be their faith by which they believe on the Lord Jesus Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By such a faith: They believe that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead that they may be saved Rom 10:9b-10a; 5:1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They have the access into the grace in which they stand Rom 5:2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, all three, the righteousness of God, the life of Christ, and the faith of the believers, become the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, this all-inclusive Christ is not only the center but also the structure of the dynamic salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The importance of faith: Without faith it is impossible to please God Heb 11:6a.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He who comes forward to God must believe that God is Heb 11:6b.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I treasure this gathering, because for years I have been expecting to have this kind of meeting so that I could release all the depths of the holy Word, the essence of every critical point in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For many years the Lord has not prepared the environment with the proper people for this kind of gathering until today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is after speaking to the saints in the United States for thirty-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through all of these messages, the Lord has shown us the depths of the holy Word in all its critical points.</S>
