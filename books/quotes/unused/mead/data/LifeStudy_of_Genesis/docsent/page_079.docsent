   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. CAUSING MAN TO HAVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DIVINE NATURE GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In message eleven we saw that this flow of living water brings forth three kinds of materials.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first of these is gold, which typifies God's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All Bible scholars agree that in typology gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Gold itself is not a transformed substance; it is an element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Unlike gold, pearl, and precious stones are transformed materials, for they have been changed from one form into another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gold is a created element and can never be transformed or changed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Iron or steel can change through the years, but gold remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the strongest and the most unchangeable element.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, gold is precious, expensive, and valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, in typology God used gold to signify His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This divine nature has been brought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The element of gold has been added to us 2 Pet 1:4; 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:18, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever you worship God or pray to Him for a period of time, you will have the sensation that you are golden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You will sense that you are shining, precious, and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Gold is weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before you prayed in such a way, you were light and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, after praying for two hours, you have an element in you that is precious, shining, and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you not had this experience?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you pray to God the Father or call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the divine life flows within you to bring forth gold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At this point, I would like to talk to the sisters about shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose you sisters pray for two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After your prayer, you have the sensation that you are precious and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then you go to the department store and do your shopping carelessly, unconcerned about the inner gold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you shop in this loose manner, you will sense that your gold has gone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although it remains within you, it has disappeared as far as your sensation is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the contrary, suppose you intend to go shopping after a two-hour period of prayer, and the inner sense of the divine gold does not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you say, "Amen, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I will not go," you will have the sense that the gold within you has increased in weight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we walk in the spirit continually, we will sense that the inner gold is increasing constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The divine nature will increase within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How much "gold" do you have within you?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps some will have to admit that they have just a little.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we pray and walk in the spirit, the inner gold will increase daily.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The flow of the divine life will add more of the divine nature to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we were made of clay, God's intention is to impart His gold into us by the flow of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way the process of transformation begins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Transformation requires a new element to be added to the original element.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose I am a person with a pale complexion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you color my face with make-up, that is outward beautification, not inward transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If I am to have a real change, a new element must be added to me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How can it be added?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By my eating.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I eat healthy meals day after day, I will undergo an inward transformation, an inward metabolic change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a metabolic change occurs, new elements are added and old elements are discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is transformation.</S>
