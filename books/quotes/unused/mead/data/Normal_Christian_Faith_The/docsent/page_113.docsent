   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CAUSES OF DIVISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The causes of the present confusion and divisions among churches can be summarized into the following categories:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Groups are denominated according to geographical reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Anglican or Episcopal Church is one example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anglican means it belongs to the Anglos.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When it was carried over to America, it was called the Episcopal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But it was in reality still the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When it was brought to China, it became the Church of England in China.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And when the Episcopal Church also came to China, it became the Church of England in America in China!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Take the example of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is in reality the Church of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When it came to China, it established churches in Shanghai and Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now Rome is mixed up with Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many denominations that originate according to geographical reasons confuse the churches throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 Confusion may arise out of the difference in time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, when Catholicism was introduced in China during the Tang dynasty, it was called Nestorianism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then during the Ming dynasty, a new wave came in distinct from the former Nestorians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the Ching dynasty, all kinds of sects and denominations started to flow in. None of them were related in any way to the former two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they all came to Shanghai, the time lapse between their establishments had produced a host of different churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3 Churches may be divided according to people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The group that Mr. John Wesley started eventually became the Methodist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It has its independent organization and administration and has branches all over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then there is the Lutheran denomination, which was formed after the death of Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now Lutheran churches appear all over the world also.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All these divisions are divided according to men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are many other organizations that denominate themselves in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>4 There may be a difference in the emphasis of truths.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who emphasize justification by faith set up the Lutheran Church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who look to Pentecostal experiences started the Pentecostal churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And those who believe in immersion, as opposed to sprinkling for baptism, formed the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some groups emphasize church administration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who believe in the independence of jurisdiction formed the Congregational churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who proposed the order of eldership started the Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who emphasize apostolic succession began the Apostolic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, all these fifteen hundred denominations were formed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every group has its history and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you merely listen to their history or doctrines, it is very difficult to find the way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today if you are in Shanghai or in Foochow, it is a hard thing for you to decide which church you should join.</S>
