   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This morning I wish to speak a word of farewell to all of the dear trainees who are with us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have collected a number of crucial thoughts and grouped them together for this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before we begin our fellowship, I want to impress you with a crucial word, that is, REMEMBER: THE CHURCH IS ALWAYS ONE UNIVERSALLY AND LOCALLY.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regardless of time and space, we must not forget that the church of God, the church of Christ, is always one universally and locally.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This morning we want to mention twelve points that we must take care of all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The most important point is that we must be one with the church John 17:11, 21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are many local churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Just in the United States alone, there may be close to one hundred forty local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every church is different from the others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The churches should not be different, but just as differences do exist among human beings on this earth, so the church cannot stay away from spontaneous, automatic differences.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you stay in a particular church for a period of time, you will get used to it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then when you move to another church, you may notice a little difference.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This might appear somewhat strange to you and may be a cause of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of you have been here for two terms, and some have been with us for more than six terms including Taipei, Irving, and Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The training not only has its own atmosphere, but it also bears a very particular flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of the environment of the training in the classrooms, dining room, and corporate living in the dormitories for many months, something may be built up within you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then when you return to the church that has sent you and is still supporting you, you might feel quite strange there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may not feel so smooth about some things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You cannot avoid these things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, you must remember that in spite of all the differences, the church is still one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not use the word churches, but church, because in our eyes there are churches, but in the Lord's eyes there is only one church, His unique Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church is always one universally and locally.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you keep this in mind, you will not be a factor of separation, discord, or division.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So you must try your best to avoid that.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, if you are careless about these twelve points, you will make trouble for others, for the church, and for yourselves.</S>
