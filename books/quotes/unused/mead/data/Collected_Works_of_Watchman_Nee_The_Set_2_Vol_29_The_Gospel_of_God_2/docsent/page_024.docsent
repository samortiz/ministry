   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The second section requires an introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we read verse 4, let me first tell you about this introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before the apostle wrote verse 4, he anticipated that these ones would ask, "If you say that we should not lay again the foundation, what then should we do if we sin again?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a person has failed, backslidden, and sinned, does he not have to lay again the foundation?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here the apostle said something in anticipation of their question.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift..."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you have a Greek New Testament in your hand, you will see that the word once according to the grammar of the original language does not refer only to the first item of the list, but to every item in the list.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It should read, "...those who have once been enlightened, and who have once tasted of the heavenly gift, and have once become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have once tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come..."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is very clear in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here is a man who has been enlightened, has tasted of the heavenly gift, and has become a partaker of the Holy Spirit, and has tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The age to come is the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This one has tasted the powers of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, he has seen and tasted miracles, wonders, healings, and the casting out of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If such a one falls away, it is impossible for him to be renewed again to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"And yet have fallen away..."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One British brother who studied Greek and who specialized in the book of Hebrews for his whole lifetime said that the falling away here means to have a slip of the foot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When it says that it is impossible to again renew themselves unto repentance, many think that it means perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this explanation is not valid.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there is a man who has once been enlightened, who has once tasted of the heavenly gift, who has once become a partaker of the Holy Spirit, who has once tasted the good word of God and once tasted the powers of the age to come, is it possible that such a one cannot any longer repent once he makes a slip?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are there cases of fallen Christians who have risen up again?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Word of God tells us that indeed there have been many, and church history also tells us that indeed there were many.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many Christians who had once slipped eventually became the best runners of the heavenly kingdom course.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Beginning from Peter, there have been countless Christians who have fallen and have risen up again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there were no possibility for these to rise up again, then Peter would have been the first one that could not have risen up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He slipped terribly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can say that he had fallen flat on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peter was not the only one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout the two thousand years of church history, countless Christians have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But eventually they became the best testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can enumerate countless proofs of this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If what was said before was right, then there should not have been a single one; if there is one, the Bible would be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this passage, there is a word in the original text, palin, which means again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is also another word, anakainizo, right after this word, which means to renew.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, according to the original text, this part should be translated as "once having slipped, it is impossible to again renew to repentance."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The apostle was telling the Hebrew believers here that the repentance from dead works, the faith in God, the teaching of baptisms and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment, are all words of the beginning of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If they have once been enlightened, once tasted of the heavenly gift, once partaken of the Holy Spirit, once tasted the good word of God, and once tasted the powers of the age to come, and have then slipped, they cannot lay again the foundation and cannot again be renewed to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please remember that the repentance here is the foundation spoken of in the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The repentance here does not mean repentance in general, for in the previous verses there are six items of the words of the beginning of the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first is repentance from dead works.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we cannot take the repentance we have in our concept and equate it to the repentance here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must consider the context of the Scripture, and we must expound it according to the thought of the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The repentance spoken of by the apostle is the same as the repentance from dead works in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The meaning here is that after a man has believed in God and has been baptized, and after he has understood the coming judgment and the truth of resurrection, and has repented of dead works, he cannot repent again for what he has repented of.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once he is baptized, he cannot be baptized again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once he has believed in the teaching of judgment, he cannot try to believe again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once he has believed in the teaching of resurrection, he cannot try to believe again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word repentance here includes all six items mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The apostle did not repeat the words "to renew again" as many times as I did: to renew again the repentance from dead works, to renew again faith toward God, and to renew again this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He only needed to use the words to renew again once.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there had never been anything yet, we would use the words to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But if there was something already, we would use the words to renew again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The apostle was afraid that we would not understand the meaning of renew, anakainizo.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, he added a further word again, palin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, the repentance spoken of in verse 6 must refer to the repentance in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the repentance in verse 1 were mentioned as the second item, we might not be very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But thank the Lord, it is placed as the first item.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As long as it is the first item, we know that all the other items are like this one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The apostle was saying that the word of the beginning of Christ can be compared to the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For one to be a Christian, first there is the need for the repentance from dead works, to judge his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then he has to have faith in God, to be baptized, to have the laying on of hands, and to believe in the resurrection of the dead and the eternal judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All these are foundational matters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once the foundation has been laid, there is no need to lay it again.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>While one is building on this foundation, even if his foot slips, there is no need to lay again the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even if one wants to lay a foundation again, it is impossible to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, Brother Wu has just come into the meeting hall from the main entrance on Wen-teh Lane.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After he came into the alley from the entrance, and as he was turning the corner to come into the building, he slipped.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What then should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His goal is to come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now he has slipped.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He does not need to start all the way from Wen-teh Lane again.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He can rise up from where he has slipped.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The apostle was saying that once a person has been enlightened and has tasted of the heavenly gift, if he slips, he cannot repent from dead works again, believe in God again, be baptized again, have the laying on of hands again, and believe in resurrection and eternal judgment again.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In other words, the apostle has no intention to say that a man can perish again after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What he means is that after a Christian is regenerated, he cannot be re-regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At most we can be regenerated once.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The apostle was not saying that one is not allowed to repent again.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He was saying that it is impossible to repent by starting all over again.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The next part of verse 6 says, "Crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting Him to open shame."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some have said that to fall is to crucify the Son of God again.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Who can crucify the Lord again?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The work of the Lord Jesus was accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He was not like the bull and the goat, which must be slaughtered when they are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>On your side, you cannot renew your repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>On the Lord's side, He cannot renew the crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you have to renew your repentance, that means that the Lord Jesus will have to renew His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If that were the case, then you would be putting the Lord to open shame.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You would be saying that the Lord Jesus' onetime crucifixion was not enough, that there have to be more crucifixions.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hence, this is not a question of salvation and perdition here.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the previous messages, we have seen that eternal salvation is a fact that cannot be overturned.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If there is a fallen and backslidden Christian among us, who was once clearly saved and was clear about God's salvation, for him to rise up again does not require a fresh start.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As long as he would rise up today, that is all that is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There is no possibility of crucifying the Lord Jesus again and putting Him to open shame.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the last section in verses 7 and 8, not only was the apostle saying that there is no need and that there is no possibility, but he went on to say, in a more serious way, that there is no right.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Why do we not have the right?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is because a laying again of the foundation would crucify again the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If one does that, there would be serious danger ahead of him; he would suffer great punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>"For the earth, which drinks the rain which often comes upon it and brings forth vegetation suitable to those for whose sake also it is cultivated, partakes of blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But if it brings forth thorns and thistles, it is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We will leave the detailed discussion of this passage until later.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>After one reads Hebrews 6, he can see that this chapter speaks of the matter of progress.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is not on the question of salvation or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Hebrews 6 never tells us that a saved person can perish.</S>
