   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN SALVATION BEING ETERNAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT 3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will continue to look at the verses which seem to argue against salvation being eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON 2 CORINTHIANS 2:7</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Corinthians 2:6-7 says, "Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority, so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with excessive sorrow."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In some translations, the words "swallowed up" are translated as "perish."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A brother in Corinth had received punishment by the majority because of his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul was concerned that the brothers and sisters had dealt with him too severely.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He asked them to forgive and encourage such a one, lest he should "perish" with excessive sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may argue that if excessive sorrow can cause such a one to perish, is this not an indication that a believer can still perish?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must realize that this brother is the same one that is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This one committed a gross sin, the sin of fornication of an abnormal sort.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul said that such a one needs to be removed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The saints in Corinth took Paul's word and removed him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After being removed, he realized that he was sinful, and was in much sorrow and agony over his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul told the saints in his second Epistle that they had to comfort and encourage him, lest he be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are careless, we may think that "perish" here means to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet Paul in 1 Corinthians 5:5 says "to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Based on this word, we can say boldly that such a one was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 2:7 is definitely not a matter of the perishing of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, the word for "be swallowed up" is not a commonly used word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a special word in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word katapino denotes something being swallowed up, as a ship sinking in the sea and being swallowed up by it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After such a brother sinned and was excommunicated, he repented.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He thought that he was excommunicated and fully rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He thought that he had lost all hope.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, he continued in his sorrow and agony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul's thought is that if the church would not forgive and comfort him right away, he would be swallowed up by sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not a matter of the saving or the perishing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON 2 PETER 3:16</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us look at another passage.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second Peter 3:16 says, "As also in all his letters, speaking in them concerning these things, in which some things are hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist, as also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some would argue after reading this word that Peter is telling us that Paul's letters were hard to understand, and that some who are unlearned and unstable, that is, untaught and unestablished, bring in their own destruction by twisting Paul's letters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they can be destroyed, does this not indicate that they will perish?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Will a saved person perish?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this case Peter is not talking about eternal perdition at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Bible, whether one perishes or not does not depend on the way that he interprets the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today in China, I have seen a number of good Christians who love the Lord and who labor everywhere in the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet they do not really understand Paul's letters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When they preach, they do more than twist the word of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Are these Christians going to perish?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Can a wrong exposition of the Scriptures be a factor of perdition?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible never makes a sound exposition of the Bible a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, Peter's word here must mean something else.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Second, the word apoleia in Greek does not refer to an ordinary kind of destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is different from the one used in 2 Corinthians 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is different from the usual word for "perdition."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Greek, this word, apollyon, means to destroy or to be corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If something is taken from you smoothly, it is a "taking"; if something is wrung out of your hands by force, it is an apollyon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What Peter meant in his Epistle is that some misunderstood Paul's letters and did not have light from God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They twisted his word in the same way that something is wrung out of a person's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In so doing, they were destroying themselves and not building up themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Destruction is the opposite of building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you are not being built up, you are being destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By so doing, you will not be built up but will have your work destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, these two verses do not tell us that a man can perish after being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They tell us of those whose work and living after salvation are not perfected, and who are unable to be built up day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you twist Paul's Epistles, you are destroying what you already have.</S>
