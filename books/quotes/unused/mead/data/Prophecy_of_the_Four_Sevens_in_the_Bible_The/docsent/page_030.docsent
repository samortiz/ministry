   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The extent of the damage of that judgment was not so definite as the damage of the first four trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the seventh trumpet, there will be further judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun through the seven bowls Rev 16:1-21 .</S>
