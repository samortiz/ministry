<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD BEING IN THE BEGINNING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1-4</h1>
<p>The Lord has shown us the matter of life again and again over the years. In recent years the Lord has been showing us that He will build His church with His life. The Lord is leading us to know life and building. In these chapters we will look at the matter of life and building in the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE ISSUING IN BUILDING</h2>
<p>The matter of life is presented to man from the beginning to the end of the Bible. In Genesis 2:8-9 God placed man in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden so that man would obtain, enjoy, and experience life. In Revelation 22:1-2 the tree of life is at the center of the New Jerusalem. From the beginning to the end of the Bible, God&rsquo;s focus is on life.</p>
<p>Following God&rsquo;s speaking concerning the tree of life in Genesis 2:9, verse 12 speaks of building materials, including gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. Chapter 2 speaks of life and of building materials. If we had only this chapter, we would not understand the relationship between the tree of life and the building materials of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. However, in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life&rdquo; (10:10), and He also spoke of building the church, saying, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (2:19). At the end of the Bible, Revelation shows a holy city that has been built with gold, pearls, and precious stones and that has the tree of life at its center. This is a clear picture showing that God&rsquo;s central work in the universe involves His coming to be life to His redeemed in order to build them into His eternal dwelling place. The issue of life is a city, a universal building. This universal city is built with life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF JOHN BEING<br />
ON LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>There were many ministers of the word in the Bible. In the Old Testament Moses and David were important ministers of the word. In the New Testament the apostles who wrote the Epistles also were important ministers of the word. Of these ministers of the word, the apostle John had a specific burden related to life and building. The Gospel of John begins by speaking of the Lord Jesus as the Word who became flesh so that we might have life (1:14; 3:15-16, 36). The Epistles of John speak of the fellowship of life enabling the believers, who have received the Lord as life, to enter deeper into God (1 John 1:2-10). Finally, Revelation shows how believers are built in God&rsquo;s life to be His eternal tabernacle, the dwelling place of God with man (21:3), which is a city built with gold, pearls, and precious stones. John&rsquo;s ministry speaks of life and building.</p>
<p>Other apostles also spoke of life and building. Peter, for example, said that God the Father &ldquo;has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&rdquo; so that we might become partakers of His life and nature (1 Pet. 1:3; 2 Pet. 1:4). We have God&rsquo;s life and nature, and we are living stones being built up into a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). The apostle Paul also spoke of life and building. He spoke of Christ being our life and of our being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit (Col. 3:4; Eph. 2:22). Although Peter and Paul both spoke on life and building, their ministries do not focus solely on life and building. John&rsquo;s ministry, however, is focused fully on life and building. John thoroughly presented the Lord Jesus as life to us, and he revealed the building of the New Jerusalem in detail.</p>
<p>John said that the Lord Jesus came so that men might have life (John 3:15-16; 10:10). He also referred to the Lord Jesus raising up the temple of God (2:19). Words such as <em>life</em> and <em>tabernacled</em> are mentioned in chapter 1. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; In the New Jerusalem there is a river of water of life and the tree of life (Rev. 22:1-2); furthermore, the city is the tabernacle of God (21:3). The Greek word for <em>tabernacle</em> in Revelation 21:3 contains the same root as the word <em>tabernacled</em> in John 1:14. Thus, John&rsquo;s ministry specifically shows how life is for building and how building comes from life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE AND BUILDING BEING<br />
THE CENTRAL MESSAGE OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Although life and building are specific to the ministry of John, they also are the central message of the Bible. From beginning to end the Bible is a story of life and building. At the beginning of the Bible we see the tree of life, which is available for man to receive, and the river of water of life, which contains materials for building&mdash;gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (Gen. 2:9-12). The matter of building is present throughout the Old Testament. In Exodus God gained a group of people on the earth and erected His tabernacle (ch. 40). In 2 Samuel David established God&rsquo;s kingdom for God to reign (chs. 6&mdash;7). In 1 Kings, Solomon built the holy temple and the holy city. When the building of the temple was finished, God&rsquo;s glory was manifested in the temple (8:11). Furthermore, God&rsquo;s authority was in place, and God&rsquo;s will was carried out. Even the work of the enemy was focused on damaging the building, destroying the walls around Jerusalem, burning the temple, and carrying God&rsquo;s people into exile at Babylon (2 Kings 25:8-21). After seventy years of captivity, some of the children of Israel returned from Babylon to Jerusalem to rebuild the holy temple and the holy city (Jer. 25:11; Ezra 1:1-6; 6:13-15; Neh. 6:15-16). When Nehemiah was rebuilding the holy city, the enemies around the city rallied their strength to destroy the building (2:19; 4:1-8; 6:1-9). This shows that God&rsquo;s building is the center of His work in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, men thought that God wanted to build a physical temple. However, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (John 2:19). The Lord Jesus was speaking of the temple of His body (v. 21), meaning that the Lord would build up God&rsquo;s dwelling place, God&rsquo;s temple, in resurrection. The temple of God that He spoke of is a spiritual temple; it is the Lord Himself and all those who have received God&rsquo;s life and who have been made alive in His resurrection. As such ones, we are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit (Eph. 2:22). This is the central point that God reveals in the Bible, and it is the central work that God is doing in the universe. God wants to enter into us to be our life and to build us up as His eternal dwelling place.</p>
