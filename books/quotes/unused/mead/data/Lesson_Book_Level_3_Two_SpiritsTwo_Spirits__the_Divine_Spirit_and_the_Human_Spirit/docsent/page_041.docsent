   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Pentecostalists</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Pentecostalists represent another extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They may neglect the Word and emphasize the Spirit in an abnormal, unbalanced way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their attention is fully occupied by their thought of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They do not see that without the Word, the Spirit is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all have to realize the Spirit comes after the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not be at either extreme, but should be balanced, caring both for the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within, we have the Spirit, and in our hands we have the Word, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SPIRIT EMBODIED IN THE WORD A. The Spoken Words Being</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>the Embodiment of the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can say that the Spirit and the Word are one because this is clearly revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus said, "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit is living and real, but rather mysterious, intangible, and difficult for people to apprehend, but the words are substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Firstly, the Lord indicated that for giving life He would become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"It is the Spirit who gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 6:63a Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we receive the Spirit who is life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. The Scripture Being God's Breath</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every word of the Bible is the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have pointed out that this breath is the pneuma, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, because both the Word and the Spirit are the breath of God, they are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit is the breath of God, and the Word also is God's breath.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, God's breath is His pneuma, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, the Word of God is the Spirit; on the other hand, the Spirit of God is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. The Word and the Spirit Being One</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, Ephesians 6:17 even identifies the Word as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this verse the Spirit and the Word are one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 5:18-19 says that when we are filled with the Spirit, we will sing hymns and songs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Colossians 3:16 says that when we are filled with the Word, we will sing hymns and songs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ephesians and Colossians are "sister books."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians says that when we are filled with the Spirit, we will sing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Colossians says that when we are filled with the Word, we will sing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we compare these two parts of the Bible, we realize that the Spirit is the Word and the Word is the Spirit!</S>
