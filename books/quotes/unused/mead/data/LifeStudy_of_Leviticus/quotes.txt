[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Lev 1:1; 27:34
[2]  B. In Exodus God's Salvation and the Building of His Habitation
[3]  The book of Exodus reveals God's salvation and the building of His habitation.
[4]  In Leviticus we have the redeemed's worship and living.
[5]  B. The Flaming Fire in Exodus and the Infinite Grace in Leviticus
[6]  In Exodus there was the flaming fire, based on the law expressing God's righteousness.
[7]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE TWO A GENERAL DEFINITION OF THE OFFERINGS Scripture Reading: Lev 1 7
[8]  In this message we shall give a general definition of the offerings.
[9]  The tabernacle is good for us to experience, to join to, God, and the offerings are good for us to enjoy and mingle with God.
[10]  D. The Tabernacle Being for God to Dwell In, and the Offerings Being for God to Enjoy through Our Appreciation and Presentation
[11]  F. The Ordinances of the Offerings Being a Recipe of the Divine Cooking
[12]  Christ is the groceries, we are the cooks, and God and we are the co-eaters enjoying Christ as the satisfaction.
[13]  Christ has made propitiation for our sins, our trespasses, as well as for our sin.
[14]  It is difficult for us to enter into the real significance of the burnt offering, and we admit that our experience of this offering is limited.
[15]  I. SIGNIFYING CHRIST NOT MAINLY FOR REDEEMING MAN'S SIN BUT FOR LIVING FOR GOD'S SATISFACTION
[16]  In our experiences Christ may be a small or a medium-sized burnt offering, but in Paul's experience Christ was a large burnt offering, a bull of the herd, because his experience of Christ was far greater than ours, and his appreciation and ability to offer Christ to God were great.
[17]  Laying our hands on Christ as the burnt offering is not just a matter of identification; it is also a matter of propitiation.
[18]  Laying our hands on Christ not only makes us one with Him but also takes care of our problems, propitiating our situation with God and enabling us to have peace with God.
[19]  Chapters one through seven of Leviticus do not give us the details concerning what Christ is as the offerings; instead, these chapters show us the way to offer Christ.
[20]  Although Leviticus 1 7 tells us that Christ is the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering, actually these chapters do not tell us how Christ is these offerings but tell us how to offer Christ as these offerings.
[21]  For example, Leviticus 1 speaks not of what Christ is totally as the burnt offering but rather speaks of the way to offer Christ as the burnt offering.
[22]  Chapter one does not teach us how much Christ is as the burnt offering but teaches us how to experience Christ and then how to bring our experience of Christ to God.
[23]  LABORING ON CHRIST THAT WE MAY HAVE SOMETHING OF CHRIST TO BRING TO GOD
[24]  In coming to the tent of meeting, we should not come empty-handed, but we should come with something of Christ.
[25]  Leviticus 1:2 says, "When anyone of you brings an offering to Jehovah, you shall bring your offering from the cattle, of the herd or of the flock."
[26]  The first part of 1:6 says, "He shall skin the burnt offering."
[27]  The skinning of the burnt offering signifies Christ's willingness to let the outward expression of His virtues be stripped.
[28]  The burnt offering was to be washed with water by the offerer.
[29]  In this message we shall consider the way to offer the burnt offering.
[30]  A believer's appreciation of Christ and his offering of Christ may be quite natural.
[31]  For example, some believers may appreciate Christ as He is presented in the four Gospels, but this appreciation may be natural.
[32]  When you first came into the church life, your way of offering Christ, either by a prayer or by a testimony, may have been quite natural.
[33]  You did offer something of Christ, but you offered Christ in a natural way.
[34]  Throughout your years in the church life, your way of offering Christ has become less and less natural.
[35]  The most crucial point for us to interpret and understand concerning the burnt offering is the difference in the way the burnt offering is offered.
[36]  If we daily and hourly live a life of experiencing Christ, we shall have Christ as a burnt offering to offer to God.
[37]  The point here is that we cannot offer Christ as a burnt offering if we do not live Christ and experience Christ in our daily walk.
[38]  While the brother is living a life of being conformed to the death of Christ and of being cut into pieces, he will realize that he surely needs wisdom.
[39]  A foolish person cannot live a life which is the experience of the life of Christ.
[40]  Instead, we should offer Christ to God as our burnt offering, yet this offering should not merely be Christ but should be the Christ whom we have experienced.
[41]  THE WATER, THE FIRE, THE BURNING, AND THE ASHES A. The Water
[42]  The burning of the burnt offering is different from the burning of the sin offering and the trespass offering 4:12 .
[43]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE SEVEN THE BURNT OFFERING CHRIST FOR GOD'S SATISFACTION 5 EXPERIENCING CHRIST IN HIS EXPERIENCES AND OFFERING THE CHRIST WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND OFFERING HIM TO GOD AS OUR BURNT OFFERING ACCORDING TO OUR EXPERIENCES OF HIM 1
[44]  Much of what we have covered in the foregoing messages on the burnt offering has been doctrinal.
[45]  Christ was also skinned, stripped of the outward appearance of His human virtues.
[46]  The Lord Jesus also had much experience in God's delight, as signified by the fat.
[47]  In the previous message we considered the different aspects of Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering to God.
[48]  In this message and in the next, we shall consider our experiences of Christ in His experiences.
[49]  It took me many years to realize that our offering of Christ as the burnt offering cannot exceed our experience of Him as this offering.
[50]  Concerning this matter, the book of Leviticus had not yet been opened to me, although it had been opened in the sense that I had learned the Brethren teachings about the offerings.
[51]  Eventually I was enlightened to see that the chapters in Leviticus dealing with the offerings do not reveal to us what Christ is in totality as the burnt offering but instead reveal how to offer Christ as the burnt offering.
[52]  If we experience Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering to God, we shall realize that we, like Christ, should be brought to the slaughter.
[53]  Eventually, Christ was slaughtered; He was put to death.
[54]  Today we may experience Christ in His experience of being slaughtered.
[55]  If we experience Christ in His being slaughtered, we shall have something of Christ to offer to God as a burnt offering.
[56]  In the foregoing message we saw that we may experience Christ in His experiences of being brought to the slaughter, of being slaughtered, of being skinned, and of being cut into pieces.
[57]  We may experience Christ also in His being a delight to God.
[58]  If we today live a life of Christ as our burnt offering, we too shall be a delight to God.
[59]  But if we let Christ live for us and if we live by Christ and even live Christ, our life will surely be a delight to God.
[60]  In Leviticus 1, the legs of the burnt offering signify Christ's walk, just as the head signifies His wisdom.
[61]  Both of these verses indicate that we can offer Christ to God as our burnt offering only to the extent to which we have experienced Christ in His experiences.
[62]  If we experience Christ in His experiences, not only shall we have something of Christ to offer to God, but we shall also be able to offer Him with a procedure that is according to our experiences.
[63]  We thank the Lord for showing us from Leviticus that we need to experience Christ in His experiences not only to have Him as the burnt offering but also to be able to go through a procedure in which we offer Christ to God by reviewing our experiences of Him.
[64]  In one of his hymns, A. B. Simpson says, " Tis not hard to die with Christ when His risen life we know" Hymns, #481 . If we see the vision concerning the experience of Christ in His experiences and are attracted to live such a life, we must have the faith that the very Christ who presents His experiences as an example is now in us as our life supply.
[65]  In the two previous messages we considered in detail the matter of experiencing Christ in His experiences and of offering to God the Christ whom we have experienced.
[66]  In this message I would like to give a brief further word concerning our experiencing Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering.
[67]  When many Christians hear that we need to experience Christ in His experiences in order to have Him as our burnt offering, they may think that this is a matter of imitating Christ in an outward way, of taking Christ as an outward example and pattern and then following Him and learning of Him.
[68]  In our married life we may try to imitate Christ, or we may exercise ourselves to live Christ.
[69]  In this message we shall begin to consider chapter two of Leviticus, which is concerned with the meal offering.
[70]  B. The Burnt Offering Emphasizing That Christ Is the Righteousness of God and the Meal Offering Emphasizing That Christ Is Righteous before God
[71]  FINE FLOUR A. The Main Element of the Meal Offering
[72]  Before we consider further aspects of the meal offering, I would like to compare the burnt offering and the meal offering.
[73]  V. ALL THE FRANKINCENSE WITH PART OF THE FINE FLOUR AND PART OF THE OIL BURNED ON THE ALTAR
[74]  This signifies that a considerable portion of Christ's excellent, perfect, Spirit-filled, and resurrection-saturated living is offered to God as food for His enjoyment.
[75]  THROUGH FIRE A. All Meal Offerings Being through Fire on the Altar
[76]  This signifies that Christ in His humanity offered to God as food has gone through fire.
[77]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE MEAL OFFERING CHRIST FOR THE SATISFACTION OF GOD'S PEOPLE ENJOYED TOGETHER WITH GOD 3 Scripture Reading: Lev 2:4-7, 13-16
[78]  In this message we will cover further aspects of the meal offering.
[79]  "Every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt; you shall not let the salt of the covenant of your God be lacking from your meal offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt" v. 13 . The salt here is not common; it is the salt of the covenant of God, the covenant which is incorruptible and unchangeable.
[80]  "And if your offering is a meal offering in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil" Lev 2:7 .
[81]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST AS THE OFFERINGS
[82]  My burden in this message is to fellowship with you concerning the practical experience and enjoyment of Christ as the offerings.
[83]  EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST AS HE IS REVEALED IN LEVITICUS
[84]  Each of the four Gospels reveals something concerning Christ.
[85]  If we would experience and enjoy Christ as He is revealed in Leviticus, we should pray not in a mental way but by releasing our spirit through the word in the Bible.
[86]  We may learn many things and we may pick up different practices, but we still do not have the adequate exercise of our spirit in prayer with the constant word in the Bible to make it the instant word in our experience that we may enjoy Christ in a practical way.
[87]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE ELEMENTS OF THE MEAL OFFERING FOR THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Lev 2:1-2, 4, 11, 13; Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20; Luke 3:21-22; 4:1; 23:14; Matt 12:46-50; Mark 10:38; John 12:24; 7:6, 16-18; Rom 8:2, 3, 6, 9-11, 13; 1 Cor 10:17
[88]  In this message I am burdened to give a further word on the meal offering.
[89]  A Faultless Humanity a Human Life with No Leaven
[90]  The humanity and human living of the Lord Jesus were without fault.
[91]  Since the Lord Jesus always lived a life of being salted, a life under the cross, He was always in resurrection.
[92]  In Leviticus 2 we see that the meal offering can be in different forms.
[93]  The cake meal offering signifies the corporate Christ, Christ with His Body, the church.
[94]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE MEAL OFFERING CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 9, 18, 22-24, 30; 2:2-4,12; 3:16; 5:6-8; 6:5, 17, 19; 7:20, 24, 40; 9:22, 26-27; 10:16-17, 23-24, 31; 11:27-29; 12:3, 4, 11, 18, 24, 27; 13:4-7; 14:26,40; 15:9-10; 16:13
[95]  The book of 1 Corinthians shows us a particular kind of church life.
[96]  Since the church life revealed here has so many aspects, it is difficult for us to summarize this church life in a phrase or a clause or even a sentence.
[97]  If we are enlightened concerning the meal offering, which describes the life of the Lord Jesus on earth, we will be able to see that the church life described in 1 Corinthians corresponds to the life of the Lord Jesus.
[98]  The fine flour signifies Christ's fine humanity, the oil signifies the Spirit of God, the frankincense signifies the fragrance of Christ's resurrection, and the salt signifies the cross of Christ, which, in a subjective way, deals with all the negative things in our life.
[99]  Chapter one of 1 Corinthians reveals that Christ is the man given to us by God.
[100]  Verse 2 says that the Lord Jesus Christ is "theirs and ours."
[101]  Paul argued with them, saying, "If there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then is our preaching vain; your faith also is vain; and we are found also false witnesses of God, because we witnessed concerning God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise if indeed the dead are not raised.
[102]  REMAINING IN THE STATE IN WHICH WE WERE CALLED
[103]  In chapter seven Paul charges the believers to remain in the state in which they were called.
[104]  We have pointed out that in the meal offering there is neither leaven nor honey.
[105]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE PEACE OFFERING CHRIST AS THE PEACE BETWEEN GOD AND GOD'S PEOPLE FOR THEIR CO-ENJOYMENT IN FELLOWSHIP Scripture Reading: Lev 3:1, 5-7, 12; 6:12; 7:37
[106]  The word in Leviticus concerning the offerings was spoken by the Lord in a little tent, the tent of meeting.
[107]  In the wilderness, apart from millions of people who were busy doing many things, the very God who created the universe came into a small tent.
[108]  Every aspect of this speaking concerning Christ and our enjoyment of Christ in togetherness with God will be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem.
[109]  The peace offering is based upon God's satisfaction in the burnt offering.
[110]  Leviticus 3:1 says, "If his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings if he offers it from the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Jehovah."
[111]  If we are weak, we enjoy a weaker Christ, not a Christ who is weak in Himself but who is weaker in our experience due to our weakness.
[112]  V. LAYING HANDS ON THE HEAD OF THE OFFERING
[113]  The one who offered the peace offering was to lay his hand on the head of the offering 3:2, 8, 13 .
[114]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE SIN OFFERING CHRIST FOR THE SIN OF GOD'S PEOPLE 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 4:1-35; 1 John 1:5-9; Col 1:12; Rom 5:12; 7:17, 20; 8:3; John 1:14; 2 Cor 5:21; John 3:14; Rom 6:6; Heb 2:14; 4:15; Gal 5:19-21; John 12:31
[115]  In the foregoing messages we covered the first three of the five basic offerings the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering.
[116]  The sequence of the five offerings in Leviticus 1 through 5 is a picture of the sequence in 1 John 1.
[117]  The burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering bring us into fellowship with God.
[118]  When we take Christ as our burnt offering before God and when we take Him as our daily life supply, we are brought into divine peace, and in this peace we enjoy the Triune God in fellowship.
[119]  From the time I brought the Lord's recovery to the United States, I have stressed four matters: Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.
[120]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE SIN OFFERING CHRIST FOR THE SIN OF GOD'S PEOPLE 2 Scripture Reading: Lev 4:1-7, 13-18, 22-25, 27-30, 32-34
[121]  In this message we will cover a number of matters related to the sin offering.
[122]  B. God Sending His Son in the Likeness of the Flesh of Sin and concerning Sin, Condemning Sin in the Flesh on the Cross of Christ
[123]  Furthermore, God made Christ, who did not know sin, sin on our behalf on the cross 2 Cor 5:21 .
[124]  Before we consider more aspects of the sin offering, I would like to give a further word concerning sin.
[125]  ALL THE FAT THAT COVERS THE INWARDS AND THAT IS ON THE INWARDS, THE TWO KIDNEYS AND THE FAT ON THEM, AND THE APPENDAGE ON THE LIVER BEING BURNED ON THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING
[126]  This signifies that the inwards of Christ as the tender and sweet part are offered to God for His satisfaction that He may be willing to forgive us.
[127]  X. THE SIN OFFERING BEING SLAUGHTERED IN THE PLACE WHERE THE BURNT OFFERING IS SLAUGHTERED
[128]  This indicates that the sin offering is based upon the burnt offering, and it signifies that Christ is the sin offering for us based upon His being the burnt offering.
[129]  If we have never enjoyed Christ as the burnt offering, we cannot realize how sinful we are.
[130]  The burnt offering means that mankind, created by God for the purpose of expressing and representing Him, should be for nothing other than God and should be absolutely for God.
[131]  This signifies that we, as the priests of God, after enjoying Christ as the sin offering, must take Him as the burnt offering that we may live Him for God's satisfaction.
[132]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE TRESPASS OFFERING CHRIST FOR THE SINS OF GOD'S PEOPLE 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 5:1-10; 7:2
[133]  B. The Trespass Offering Eventually Becoming the Sin Offering
[134]  These two offerings actually deal with one thing sin.
[135]  The word in Leviticus 5 was spoken not to an individual saint but to God's congregation, to God's people as an assembly.
[136]  Leviticus 5:3 says, "When he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever his uncleanness is whereby he is unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he knows it, then he is guilty."
[137]  The "uncleanness of man" here signifies the uncleanness of man's natural life.
[138]  Verse 11 tells us, "But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for that in which he has sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall not place oil upon it nor put frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering."
[139]  A handful of fine flour burned on the altar, as an offering of Jehovah by fire, indicates that the fine flour for the trespass offering for God to forgive our sins is based upon the shedding of blood on the altar Heb 9:22 , and it signifies that the perfect Christ is our trespass offering based upon the shedding of His blood on the cross Col 1:20 .
[140]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE LAW OF THE BURNT OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 6:8-13
[141]  Beginning with this message, we will cover the laws of the offerings.
[142]  THE FIRE ON THE ALTAR BEING KEPT BURNING CONTINUALLY AND NOT GOING OUT
[143]  THE PRIEST ARRANGING THE BURNT OFFERING ON THE ALTAR AND BURNING THE FAT PORTIONS OF THE PEACE OFFERING ON IT
[144]  "The priest shall arrange the burnt offering on it; and he shall offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings on it" 6:12b .
[145]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR THE LAW OF THE MEAL OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 6:14-23
[146]  The meal offering is not common food for common people.
[147]  Not baking the meal offering with leaven signifies that our working on Christ as our life supply must be without sin.
[148]  B. Signifying That the Partakers of Christ Should Be God's Serving Ones Priests
[149]  The males among the sons of Aaron eating of the meal offering also signifies that the partakers of Christ should be God's serving ones priests.
[150]  If we do our daily work without serving God as a priest, we cannot share in the real enjoyment of Christ.
[151]  However, we may find it hard to regard as a law something that concerns the enjoyment of Christ, We may think that if there is a law concerning the enjoyment of Christ, there will not be any enjoyment.
[152]  V. THE GARMENT ON WHICH THE BLOOD OF THE SIN OFFERING WAS SPATTERED BEING WASHED IN A HOLY PLACE
[153]  "When any of its blood is spattered on a garment, you shall wash what it was spattered on in a holy place" 6:27b .
[154]  This signifies that the daily walk of the one who has received redemption through the blood of Christ as the sin offering should be dealt with cf.
[155]  In my study of biographies and history, I have received much help from the living and practices of two persons, George M ller and Hudson Taylor.
[156]  This signifies that Christ as our trespass offering is most holy in dealing with the sins in our conduct.
[157]  Concerning the trespass offering, we need to remember that God uses this offering to refer us to the sin offering, reminding us that sin is in our flesh and that sin includes Satan, who is the father of lies John 8:44 , the world 1 John 5:19 , and the power struggle.
[158]  This reminds us and strengthens us when we take Him as our trespass offering to take Him also as our burnt offering so that in Him, with Him, and through Him we may be absolute for God.
[159]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN THE LAW OF THE PEACE OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 7:11-38
[160]  The law of the peace offering is a long law concerning the enjoyment of Christ.
[161]  No Christian would ever imagine that the enjoyment of Christ would be so regulated.
[162]  This signifies that Christ, whether mingled with the Spirit without sin, or anointed with the Spirit without sin, or as the fine One saturated with the Spirit, as the meal offering in our enjoyment of Him in His conduct, is our peace offering, crucified with the shedding of His blood on the cross Col 1:20 , in our thanksgiving to God.
[163]  "The flesh of the thanksgiving sacrifice of his peace offering shall be eaten on the day it is offered; he shall not lay aside any of it until morning" v. 15 . This signifies that the maintaining power of this kind of offering is rather small, that it has to be fully enjoyed on the offering day, and that our experience and enjoyment of Christ in this aspect should be fresh daily.
[164]  X. THE SONS OF ISRAEL NOT EATING ANY FAT OF AN OX, A SHEEP, OR A GOAT
[165]  "You shall not eat any fat of an ox, a sheep, or a goat" Lev 7:23 .
[166]  "Whoever eats the fat of a beast from which an offering by fire is offered to Jehovah, the person who eats shall be cut off from his people" v. 25 . This signifies that we who enjoy Christ as our offering to God should keep the excellent part of the person of Christ for God that we might not be put aside from the fellowship of the enjoyment of Christ.
[167]  This signifies that we who take Christ as our peace offering should offer the excellent part of Christ the fat to God for His satisfaction, with the loving part of Christ the breast in resurrection for the serving ones' enjoyment.
[168]  THE RIGHT THIGH OF THE PEACE OFFERING GIVEN TO THE PRIEST AS A HEAVE OFFERING
[169]  The more we minister Christ as the peace offering and the more we offer Christ as the peace offering to God, the more we will have the loving capacity and the strengthening power of Christ.
[170]  "I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering from the sons of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their perpetual due from the sons of Israel" v. 34 . This signifies that God has allotted, in our enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering, the loving capacity and the strengthening power of Christ to us, the New Testament priests, as our eternal portion for our enjoyment in serving God.
[171]  In this message we will begin to consider the consecration of Aaron and his sons.
[172]  I. AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING
[173]  The consecration of Aaron and his sons took place at the entrance of the tent of meeting Lev 8:3-4 .
[174]  This signifies that our consecration for the priesthood is not only before God but also for the church life.
[175]  V. MOSES ANOINTING THE TABERNACLE, THE ALTAR, AND THE LAVER WITH ALL THEIR UTENSILS TO SANCTIFY THEM
[176]  "Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them.
[177]  This indicates strongly that the consecration or anointing of the priesthood is to make God one with us, for the anointing oil signifies that whatever God is, whatever He does, and whatever He will do are ours.
[178]  THE SECOND RAM AS THE CONSECRATION OFFERING FOR THE CONSECRATION OF THE PRIESTHOOD
[179]  C. One Unleavened Cake, One Cake of Oiled Bread, and One Wafer Placed upon the Portions of the Fat and upon the Right Thigh, All These Put on the Palms of Aaron and of His Sons, Waved as a Wave Offering before Jehovah, Taken from Their Palms and Offered Up in Smoke upon the Altar upon the Burnt Offering for a Consecration Offering by Fire to Jehovah for a Satisfying Fragrance
[180]  In 8:25-28 we see that one unleavened cake, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer were placed upon the portions of the fat and upon the right thigh.
[181]  This signifies that the tender, excellent, and strong parts of Christ, with the three kinds of cakes, with His sinless but Spirit-mingled humanity in different aspects as food, are offered to God in Christ's resurrection as a satisfying and fragrant offering in the fellowship of His sufferings unto death on the cross for our assuming of the New Testament priesthood.
[182]  The unleavened cake, the cake of oiled bread, and the one wafer indicate respectively that we have Christ as our daily food without sin, that we have Christ as our daily food mingled with the Spirit, and that we have Christ as the food that is so available and easy to take in and that is good for feeding the young ones.
[183]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY THE CONSECRATION OF AARON AND HIS SONS 3 Scripture Reading: Lev 8:30-36
[184]  Before we consider some further matters related to the consecration of Aaron and his sons, I would like to give an additional word concerning the application of the blood to the right ear, the right thumb, and the big toe of the right foot and also a word about putting the offering on the palms of the priests.
[185]  E. Moses Sprinkling Aaron and His Sons and Their Garments with the Anointing Oil and Some of the Blood to Sanctify Them
[186]  "Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him; and he sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons and the garments of his sons with him" v. 30 . This signifies that God sprinkles us, the New Testament priests, and our conduct garments , with the compounded Spirit and the redeeming blood of the cross of Christ to separate us, to make us holy unto Him.
[187]  No matter how much God has been working on us, dealing with our sin, our natural life, and the old man, we still need more "coats" of the anointing oil.
[188]  "Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and eat it there with the bread which is in the basket of the consecration offering, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it" v. 31 . This signifies that Christ as the redeeming One with His humanity is food to us John 6:51 , the New Testament priests, at the entering in of the church life.
[189]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE INITIATION OF THE PRIESTLY SERVICE OF AARON AND HIS SONS Scripture Reading: Lev 9:1-21
[190]  The book of Leviticus shows us a new beginning, in which, for the first time, God's people offered offerings to God according to God's regulations.
[191]  This was the first time God's people offered Christ to God not merely according to their need but also according to God's laws, His regulations.
[192]  Leviticus 9:7 says, "Then Moses said to Aaron, Come near to the altar and prepare your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make propitiation for yourself and for the people; and prepare the offering of the people, and make propitiation for them, as Jehovah has commanded."
[193]  We need to take Christ as our sin offering to redeem us back to a peaceful situation with God, and we need to take Christ as the burnt offering, as the One who lives in us and for us a life that is absolutely for God.
[194]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO THE ISSUE OF THE PRIESTLY SERVICE Scripture Reading: Lev 9:4, 6, 22-24
[195]  In this message we will pay our attention to the issue, the result, of our priestly service.
[196]  Leviticus 9:22 says, "Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings."
[197]  This signifies that Christ as our High Priest after His crucifixion blessed us in His resurrection Luke 24:50 .
[198]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE THE LESSON AND THE REGULATIONS FOR THE PRIESTS 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 10:1-11
[199]  In chapters one through nine of Leviticus, we have seen the offerings and their laws, the consecration of Aaron and his sons, the initiation of the priestly service, and the issue of the priestly service.
[200]  The issue of the priestly service includes the appearing of God, the appearing of God's glory, the blessing of the people, and fire coming out from before God and consuming the burnt offering 9:24 .
[201]  In 10:1-11 we have the lesson of Nadab and Abihu.
[202]  B. Fire Coming Out from before Jehovah and Consuming Them to Death before Jehovah
[203]  Leviticus 10:2 tells us that "fire came out from before Jehovah" and consumed Nadab and Abihu, and "they died before Jehovah."
[204]  The fire in verse 2 is also fire for the sanctification of God by His serving ones who come near to Him v. 3a . The death of Nadab and Abihu sanctified God.
[205]  "Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Do not dishevel your hair nor tear your garments, that you may not die and that He may not be angry with all the congregation" v. 6 . This signifies that even God's death-judgment upon the relatives should not be an excuse for His serving ones to be disorderly in their subjection to the headship of Christ and to break the perfection of their conduct, that they might not suffer deadness in their spiritual life and cause God to be unhappy with His people.
[206]  In the foregoing message we covered the lesson for the priests.
[207]  C. The Sin Offering Which Is Most Holy and the Blood of Which Was Not Brought into the Holy of Holies, Being Eaten by the Priests in the Holy Place That They Might Bear Away the Iniquity of the Congregation to Make Propitiation for Them before Jehovah
[208]  This signifies that we, the New Testament priests, partake of Christ as the believers' sin offering.
[209]  D. Due to the Weakness concerning God's Death-judgment upon Nadab and Abihu, Aaron and His Sons Being Not Fit to Eat the Sin Offering
[210]  This signifies that if we are weak in accepting God's judgment upon the serving ones who are intimate and close to us, we will not be able to partake of Christ as our sin offering in the sense of taking His sin-dealing life as our life supply to minister Him to the believers as the sin-dealing life.
[211]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE A CONCLUDING WORD ON THE OFFERINGS AND THE PRIESTHOOD Scripture Reading: Heb 1:2-3; 2:14; 3:1; 4:14-15; 6:20; 7:22, 25-26; 8:1-2; 9:11-12, 24-28; 10:5-7, 9-10, 19-21; 12:2, 24; 13:21
[212]  This message, which will focus on Hebrews as an exposition of Leviticus, is a concluding word to all the foregoing messages on the offerings and the priesthood.
[213]  The Lord Jesus as the Forerunner took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and to enter into the heavenly haven, "into that which is within the veil" v. 19 , to be the High Priest for us according to the order of Melchisedec, the order of the priesthood that is in both humanity and divinity.
[214]  Hebrews 10:5-10 tells us that when Christ came, God had no more desire for or pleasure and interest in the animal sacrifices vv.
[215]  God prepared a human body for Christ, the incarnated God-man v. 5 , so that He could be the replacement of all the Old Testament offerings.
[216]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX DISCERNMENT IN DIET Scripture Reading: Lev 11:1-24a, 26-27a, 29-31a, 41-44; Acts 10:9b-14, 27-29
[217]  The book of Leviticus may be divided into two main sections.
[218]  The first thing we need to consider in relation to discernment in diet is the significance of eating.
[219]  Aquatic animals having fins and scales v. 9 signify persons who can move and act freely in the world and at the same time resist its influence.
[220]  THE CATEGORIES OF LIVING CREATURES THAT ARE NOT CLEAN WITH RESPECT TO DIET
[221]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN ABSTAINING FROM DEATH Scripture Reading: Lev 11:24-25, 27b-28a, 31-35, 39-40, 36a, 37, 3, 9, 21, 44-45
[222]  We have seen that chapter eleven of Leviticus is concerned with the matter of diet, with the matter of eating.
[223]  I. ALL DEAD THINGS BEING UNCLEAN, AND DEATH BEING MORE DEFILING AND ABOMINABLE THAN SIN
[224]  A PERSON DEFILED BY THE CARCASS OF ANY ANIMAL SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES
[225]  Christ divides the hoof and chews the cud v. 3 . When Christ walked on earth, His hooves were fully divided, and He chewed the cud.
[226]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT UNCLEANNESS IN HUMAN BIRTH Scripture Reading: Lev 12; Col 2:11-12; Heb 10:5-7
[227]  In this message on chapter twelve we come to the matter of uncleanness in human birth.
[228]  THE UNCLEANNESS OF THE MALE'S BIRTH BEING FOR SEVEN DAYS, AND THAT OF THE FEMALE'S BEING FOR FOURTEEN DAYS
[229]  Leviticus 12:3 says, "On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised."
[230]  To be circumcised is to be cut; it is to have that part of our being which is condemned in the sight of God cut off.
[231]  AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE TEST OF THE UNCLEANNESS, A BURNT OFFERING AND A SIN OFFERING NEEDING TO BE OFFERED
[232]  This signifies that after our uncleanness by birth is fully dealt with, we need Christ to be our burnt offering for our not being for God and to be our sin offering for our sin Heb 10:5-7 .
[233]  Christ is revealed in this chapter not only by the eighth day and by circumcision but also by two kinds of offerings the burnt offering and the sin offering.
[234]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE UNCLEANNESS ISSUING FROM WITHIN MAN 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 13:2-28
[235]  In Leviticus 11 we see that we need discernment in diet, discernment in eating; that is, we must be careful in what we contact and receive.
[236]  A SWELLING RISING , AN ERUPTION, OR A BRIGHT SPOT ON THE SKIN OF ONE'S FLESH
[237]  E. If the Skin Has a White Swelling Rising and It Has Turned the Hair White, and There Is an Emergence of Raw Flesh in the Swelling, It Is a Chronic Leprosy in the Skin of the Flesh
[238]  "The priest shall examine him, and if there is a white swelling in the skin and it has turned the hair white, and there is an emergence of raw flesh in the swelling, it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not isolate him, for he is unclean" vv.
[239]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY UNCLEANNESS ISSUING FROM WITHIN MAN 2 Scripture Reading: Lev 13:29-31, 33, 34b, 37-41, 45-46; 1 Cor 5:13
[240]  A disease on the head Lev 13:29a signifies something wrong in the subjection to authority and in the thinking of the mind.
[241]  In studying Leviticus 13, a chapter full of types and figures, we need the proper knowledge and understanding of the Bible as a whole.
[242]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE CLEANSING OF THE LEPER 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 14:1-9
[243]  In this message we come to a most wonderful thing the cleansing of the leper.
[244]  The live birds signify that Christ is full of life.
[245]  F. The Other Bird, the Cedar Wood, the Scarlet, and the Hyssop Being Dipped in the Blood of the Killed Bird That It Might Be Sprinkled Seven Times on the Leper Who Was to Be Cleansed
[246]  "As for the live bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, the scarlet, and the hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water.
[247]  This signifies that the Lord's perfect redemption not only causes man to be cleansed objectively in his position, but also causes man to experience subjectively in the Holy Spirit the Lord's suffering in shedding His blood in His noble, high, and lowly humanity, and to experience His death, resurrection, ascension, and glorification.
[248]  As New Testament believers, we enjoy the Lord's cleansing.
[249]  However, if we simply read and understand the New Testament, we shall not have a clear, detailed picture of what is involved in this cleansing.
[250]  In relation to the sin offering and the trespass offering, I would like to say a word concerning propitiation.
[251]  Leviticus 14:18 speaks of the priest making propitiation for a leper before Jehovah.
[252]  THE LEPER WHO WAS TO BE CLEANSED NEEDING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HIS SIN AND SINS BEFORE GOD
[253]  In 14:10-32 we see that the leper who was to be cleansed needed to solve the problem of his sin and sins before God.
[254]  Some of the Oil to Be Poured into the Palm of the Priest's Left Hand and to Be Sprinkled with His Right Finger Seven Times before Jehovah
[255]  "And some of the rest of the oil which is in his palm the priest shall put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot upon the blood of the trespass offering" v. 17 . This signifies that man can solve the problem of his trespasses only by listening to the word of God, doing the things of God, and taking the ways of God in the Spirit of resurrection, based on the redemption of the blood of the Lord Jesus as our trespass offering.
[256]  This signifies that the sinner who is to be cleansed, after having been cleansed from the uncleanness of sin and sins through Christ as his sin offering and trespass offering, offers himself in Christ as the burnt offering to God and lives and walks absolutely for God by the life of Christ as the meal offering.
[257]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR THE LEPROSY IN A HOUSE Scripture Reading: Lev 14:33-53
[258]  In the messages on Leviticus 13 we saw that leprosy may be in a person and also in one's garments.
[259]  D. The Priest Going In to Examine the House
[260]  "After that the priest shall go in to examine the house" v. 36b . This signifies that the Lord or the apostle comes to examine.
[261]  J. If the Disease Breaks Out Again in the House after the Removal of the Stones, the Scraping of the House, and the New Plastering, It Is a Malignant Leprosy in the House and It Is Unclean; the House Should Be Broken Down
[262]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE THE CLEANSING OF THE DISCHARGES FROM MAN'S AND WOMAN'S BODY Scripture Reading: Lev 15:1-31
[263]  In Leviticus 11 through 15, a section of five chapters, four troubling things are covered: our contact with people, the uncleanness of our birth, leprosy, and our discharges.
[264]  I. THE DISCHARGE FROM MAN'S BODY A. A Man Being Unclean Because of His Discharge
[265]  "Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When any man has a discharge from his body, because of his discharge he is unclean" v. 2 . This signifies that whatever issues from man's body, whether or not it is according to the law of the physical body, is unclean.
[266]  Verse 11a refers to rinsing the hands in water.
[267]  This signifies purging away our filthiness with the word of God and with the life and Spirit in the word of God.
[268]  Again we would emphasize our need of the cross of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit, the divine life, and the holy Word.
[269]  "The earthenware vessel which he who has the discharge touches shall be broken; and every wooden vessel shall be rinsed in water" v. 12 . This signifies that the created and fallen man earthenware vessel should be broken, whereas the God-created humanity wooden vessel should be kept but needs to be rinsed with the word of God and with the life and Spirit in the word of God.
[270]  ALL OTHER DISCHARGES OF MAN AND WOMAN TO BE DEALT WITH IN THE SAME WAY
[271]  For the church life, we need to be fully dealt with in our natural life by the cross of Christ, by the resurrection of Christ, by the Spirit with the divine life, and by contacting the holy Word with our spirit.
[272]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY-SIX THE PROPITIATION 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 16:1-16; Heb 10:1-4
[273]  In this message we come to the matter of propitiation.
[274]  John 3:16 says, "God so loved the world."
[275]  I. AARON BEING FORBIDDEN TO ENTER AT ALL TIMES INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES WITHIN THE VEIL, IN FRONT OF THE PROPITIATORY COVER ON THE ARK, LEST HE DIE
[276]  "And Jehovah said to Moses, Tell your brother Aaron that he should not enter at all times into the holy of holies within the veil, in front of the propitiatory cover which is on the ark, lest he die; for I will appear in the cloud above the propitiatory cover" v. 2 . This signifies that man, being sinful because of the fall, is unable to enter into God's presence by himself.
[277]  "He shall put on a holy linen tunic, and linen breeches shall be over his flesh, and he shall gird himself with a linen sash, and be attired with a linen turban; these are holy garments" v. 4a . This signifies that the one who comes near to God should take Christ as his righteousness and holiness in order that he may cover his entire being and express Christ.
[278]  "And he shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two bucks of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering" v. 5 . This signifies that anyone who desires to enter into God's presence and serve Him must himself experience Christ as the sin offering and burnt offering for those whom he is serving.
[279]  As serving saints, we need to experience Christ as the sin offering and as the burnt offering not only for ourselves but also for those whom we serve.
[280]  First we experience Christ as the sin offering and the burnt offering, and then we minister what we have experienced to others so that they may have the same experience.
[281]  AARON TAKING A CENSER FULL OF COALS OF FIRE FROM OFF THE ALTAR AND BOTH HIS HANDS FULL OF FINELY GROUND INCENSE OF SPICES, BRINGING THEM INSIDE THE VEIL, AND PUTTING THE INCENSE ON THE FIRE THAT THE CLOUD OF INCENSE MAY COVER THE PROPITIATORY COVER UPON THE ARK, SO THAT HE WOULD NOT DIE
[282]  This signifies that in His resurrection the Lord Jesus became a sweet fragrance to be the means and the protection for us to draw near to God with all boldness and be accepted by God without suffering death.
[283]  In this message we shall consider further the details concerning the propitiation in Leviticus 16.
[284]  C. Cleansing the Altar and Sanctifying It from the Uncleannesses of the Sons of Israel
[285]  Verse 19b tells us that Aaron was to cleanse the altar and "sanctify it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel."
[286]  This signifies that all the world's sins were gathered upon the cross of Christ and were cleansed away.
[287]  This signifies that after we have received the redemption of the Lord Jesus and the problem of our sins has been solved, we need the cleansing of the Spirit that we may take Christ as our burnt offering to live for God by the life of Christ.
[288]  THE FAT OF THE SIN OFFERING BEING OFFERED IN SMOKE ON THE ALTAR
[289]  "And he shall offer up in smoke the fat of the sin offering on the altar" v. 25 . This signifies that the Lord Jesus' death on the cross is for our redemption, and that His heart toward God and for God is for God's acceptance.
[290]  The fat of the sin offering signifies the heart of Christ, the tender part of Christ.
[291]  This tender part of Christ is altogether toward God and for God.
[292]  THE ONE WHO BURNED THE BULL AND THE GOAT OF THE SIN OFFERING WASHING HIS CLOTHES, BATHING HIS FLESH IN WATER, AND AFTER THAT COMING INTO THE CAMP
[293]  "And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and after that he may come into the camp" v. 28 . This signifies that the one who is defiled by contacting anything related to sin must deal with his outward living and with himself as well.
[294]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT TAKING CARE OF THE SACRIFICES AND OF THE BLOOD Scripture Reading: Lev 17:1-16
[295]  In this message we shall consider two matters in Leviticus 17 that are difficult to comprehend taking care of the sacrifices and taking care of the blood.
[296]  First, we must take care of the sacrifices and then of the blood.
[297]  Verses 3 through 9 speak of taking care of the sacrifices.
[298]  This signifies Christ as our peace with God that we may enjoy Him with man and with God in fellowship and joy, as in our enjoying of Christ in the breaking of bread for the remembrance of Him 1 Cor 10:16 .
[299]  The burnt offering signifies Christ as our burnt offering to God, by whose life we can live absolutely for God.
[300]  The burnt offering was to be offered to Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting v. 9a . This signifies taking Christ as our burnt offering to God at the entrance of God's dwelling place the church . 2.
[301]  The blood of that which dies of itself signifies the blood of one who sacrifices himself for the good of others, which blood cannot redeem us from our sins.
[302]  Only the blood of Jesus Christ, whom God bruised Isa 53:10 on the cross, can cleanse us from all sin 1 John 1:7 .
[303]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY-NINE THE HOLY LIVING OF THE HOLY PEOPLE PUTTING OFF THE OLD LIFE AND PUTTING ON THE NEW Scripture Reading: Lev 18 20
[304]  This long section of the Word is equivalent to Ephesians 4:17 5:14 in the New Testament, which charges the holy people of God to put off, as regards their former manner of life, the old man and put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth Eph 4:22, 24 , living a life that is holy, as God is holy.
[305]  I. THE SONS OF ISRAEL PUTTING OFF THE FORMER EGYPTIAN CONDUCT
[306]  The sons of Israel were charged to put off the former Egyptian conduct 18:3a .
[307]  A. The Sacrifice Was to Be Eaten on the Day of the Offering or on the Next Day, but What Remained until the Third Day Was to Be Burned with Fire
[308]  The third illustration is that of making garment material without mixture.
[309]  I very much appreciate the sequence in the book of Leviticus.
[310]  Leviticus 21:6 says, "They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they offer the offerings of Jehovah by fire, the food of their God; therefore they shall be holy."
[311]  Verse 8 goes on to say, "You shall sanctify him, for he offers the food of your God; he shall be holy to you, for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy."
[312]  This signifies that we, the ones who minister Christ to God as food for God's enjoyment, should separate ourselves to be holy unto God.
[313]  The priests were not allowed to tear their garments v. 10d . For a priest to tear his garments would be a sign that he was bankrupt in behavior.
[314]  B. The Blemishes Defects That Disqualify a Person from the Priesthood
[315]  Let us now consider the various defects that disqualify a person from the priesthood.
[316]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE THE HOLINESS IN ENJOYING THE HOLY THINGS AND THE ACCEPTABLE WAY FOR THE OFFERING OF A VOW AND A FREEWILL OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 22:1-33
[317]  Chapter twenty-two of Leviticus covers two things: the holiness in enjoying the holy things vv.
[318]  D. A Purchased Slave of a Priest and Those Who Were Born in a Priest's House Being Permitted to Eat the Holy Things
[319]  "But if a priest buys a slave, the purchase of his money, that one may eat of it; and those who are born in his house may eat of his food" v. 11 . This signifies that the ones purchased by Christ with His precious blood and born of God in His house may enjoy Christ.
[320]  Since we have been purchased by Christ and since we were born of God in His house, we are surely qualified to enjoy Christ.
[321]  A. An Offering for a Vow, for a Freewill Offering, or as a Peace Offering That Was Offered to Jehovah for a Burnt Offering Needing to Be a Male without Blemish, of the Herd, of the Sheep, or of the Goats, That It Might Be Accepted
[322]  "Anything blind, or broken, or maimed, or that has sores, or an eczema, or scabs such you shall not offer to Jehovah or make of them an offering by fire on the altar to Jehovah" v. 22 . This signifies that our offering of the Christ whom we experience, if it is blemished as typified by the six defects mentioned in this verse, should not be offered to God as His food for His satisfaction.
[323]  C. An Ox or a Sheep That Had a Member Too Long or Too Short Being Allowed to Be Offered for a Freewill Offering but Not Being Accepted for a Vow
[324]  "As for an ox or a sheep that is deformed or stunted, you may offer it for a freewill offering, but for a vow it will not be accepted" v. 23 . The Hebrew for "is deformed or stunted" may also be translated "has a member that is too long or too short." A longer member is a member that exceeds the limit; a shorter member is one that is under the proper measure.
[325]  Verse 23 signifies that we may, in a general way, offer to God as food the Christ whom we experience too much or too little, but if we offer in a stronger way, our offering will not be accepted.
[326]  D. Anything with Its Testicles Bruised, Crushed, Broken, or Cut Not Being Allowed to Be Offered to Jehovah
[327]  This signifies that we should not offer to God as food the Christ whom we have experienced with the spiritual function damaged in any way.
[328]  This means that the Christ whom we experience should have a reproducing organ that is perfect and whole that we may be able to produce more and more of Christ.
[329]  "Neither shall you offer as the food of your God any of these things obtained from the hand of a foreigner; for they are ruined, a blemish is in them; they shall not be accepted for you" v. 25 . This signifies that our offering of the Christ whom we experience that is offered to God as food by the way of the unbelievers will not be accepted by God.
[330]  "When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted for an offering by fire to Jehovah" v. 27 . This signifies that our experience of Christ must grow to the level of resurrection before it will be accepted as an offering to God for His food.
[331]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO THE FESTIVALS 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 23:1-14
[332]  In this message we come to a wonderful matter in the book of Leviticus the festivals.
[333]  This indicates that in Leviticus, a book of God's priesthood for God's service in the fellowship of God, our service results, issues, in Christ as the rest and enjoyment we have with God and with one another.
[334]  Being the Principal Denotation of All the Annual Seasons Feasts for God's Redeemed People to Rest with God and with One Another
[335]  Eating unleavened bread for seven days v. 6b signifies that we live a sinless life daily by enjoying Christ for the full course of our Christian life.
[336]  In their teaching, the Brethren did not have much to say about Christ being our life apart from sin for our entire Christian life.
[337]  In this feast we enjoy one bread the unleavened bread which signifies the Christ who is unleavened, the Christ who is apart from sin.
[338]  "On the day that you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to Jehovah" v. 12 . This signifies that the resurrected Christ, being fresh, tender, meek, strong, and without blemish, is offered to God as a burnt offering that is absolutely for God.
[339]  The Waved Sheaf's Meal Offering of Fine Flour Mingled with Oil as an Offering by Fire to Jehovah for a Satisfying Fragrance
[340]  This signifies the resurrected Christ as our meal offering mingled with the anointing Spirit, offered to God as food in His resurrection as a fragrance for God's satisfaction.
[341]  The resurrected Christ is first our burnt offering and then our meal offering.
[342]  In this message we come to the fourth feast, the feast of Pentecost.
[343]  After those forty days, the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens, leaving the disciples on earth.
[344]  For the next ten days they prayed continually in one accord.
[345]  This significance includes the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, and the outpouring of the consummated Spirit of the processed Triune God to produce the Body of Christ as the enlargement, the increase, the extension, the expansion, of the unlimited, individual Christ into a universal, corporate Christ.
[346]  The Feast of Pentecost the Feast of the Fiftieth Day, Counting from the Day after the Sabbath, the Day on Which the Sheaf of the Wave Offering Was Brought to God, to the Day after the Seventh Sabbath
[347]  Offering with the Bread Seven Lambs a Year Old without Blemish, One Young Bull, and Two Rams as a Burnt Offering to Jehovah, with Their Meal Offerings and Drink Offerings, as an Offering by Fire of a Satisfying Fragrance to Jehovah
[348]  "And you shall offer with the bread seven lambs a year old without blemish, one young bull, and two rams; they shall be a burnt offering to Jehovah, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, as an offering by fire of a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah" v. 18 . This signifies that the church on the day of Pentecost was a corporate man offered to God as a burnt offering to live absolutely for God, with a living as a meal offering mixed with leaven sins and as a drink offering pouring out its life for God by being martyred to be an offering by fire accepted by God by being consumed for the satisfaction of both God and man.
[349]  They poured out their soul to God for His satisfaction, even as Christ poured out His soul on the cross to God. c.
[350]  This signifies that because of its sins, the church on the day of Pentecost needed Christ as its sin offering, and for the sake of the fellowship of man with God and man with man, it needed Christ as its peace offering.
[351]  After living on earth as a God-man for thirty-three and a half years, the Lord Jesus died on the cross as the fulfillment and reality of the type of the Passover.
[352]  a. On the First Day of the Seventh Month, the Beginning of the Second Half of the Year
[353]  The feast of propitiation was a holy convocation v. 27b . This signifies that it is not a festival for individuals but for a congregation. b.
[354]  This signifies mourning, repenting, and feeling sorrowful for sin, and offering Christ as food to God for the satisfaction of both God and man.
[355]  For Seven Days Bringing an Offering by Fire to Jehovah
[356]  "On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall bring an offering by fire to Jehovah; it is a sacred assembly; you shall not do any laborious work" v. 36b . This signifies that in the resurrection of Christ God's people as a sacred congregation offer Christ as food to God for the satisfaction of both God and man, not needing to do any work but resting.
[357]  g. Taking the Fruit of Beautiful Trees, Branches of Palm Trees, Boughs of Leafy Trees, and Willows of the Brook, and Rejoicing before God for Seven Days
[358]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE LAMPSTAND AND THE SHOWBREAD TABLE AND THE DEATH-JUDGMENT OF THE BLASPHEMING OF THE HOLY NAME Scripture Reading: Lev 24:1-23
[359]  Leviticus 24 is a parenthesis between chapter twenty-three on the feasts and chapter twenty-five on the jubilee, the feast of feasts that was to take place every fifty years.
[360]  The Light of the Lampstand Shining Continually from Evening until Morning
[361]  The sons of Israel were "to cause the lamp to burn continually" v. 2b . Verse 3 goes on to say, "Outside the veil of the testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall tend it from evening to morning before Jehovah continually; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations." This signifies that the divine light of Christ shines continually in the house of God.
[362]  Sabbath by Sabbath Aaron Setting the Bread in Order before Jehovah Continually
[363]  "Sabbath by sabbath he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it shall be a perpetual covenant on the part of the sons of Israel" v. 8 . This signifies that our enjoyment of Christ as our food should be set in order afresh that we may have rest with God continually.
[364]  "It shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is a most holy portion for him from the offerings of Jehovah by fire, as a perpetual due" v. 9 . This signifies that we, God's serving ones, should enjoy Christ as a most holy portion of the food offered to God in the church as the holy place.
[365]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX THE SABBATH YEAR AND THE JUBILEE 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 25:1-22
[366]  C. The Sabbath Produce of the Land to Be Food for All Kinds of People and for the Cattle and the Animals
[367]  "The sabbath produce of the land shall be food for you, for your male and female slaves, for your hired servant, and for the sojourner who lives with you.
[368]  A. The Fifty Years That Consummated in the Jubilee Comprising Eight Sabbath Years, Being Sabbath upon Sabbath, to Be an Eightfold Sabbath
[369]  The fifty years that consummated in the jubilee comprising eight sabbath years, being sabbath upon sabbath to be an eightfold sabbath cf. v. 8 , signifies the superabundance of the fullness of God's rest with satisfaction to us.
[370]  E. Israel in the Present Age and in the Coming Millennium
[371]  In the present age the whole race of Israel has become poor and has lost the land of Canaan.
[372]  When an Israelite Became Poor and Sold Some of His Possession, His Nearest Relative Was to Come as His Redeemer and Redeem What He Had Sold
[373]  If an Israelite Sold a House in a Walled City, the Right Would Be Given to Him to Redeem It within One Year, but after One Year the Right Would Be Ended and the House Would Not Be Released to Him, Even in the Jubilee
[374]  The Houses of the Villages That Had No Walls around Them Were Considered as the Fields of the Country and Could Be Redeemed and Were to Be Released in the Jubilee
[375]  "But the houses of the villages that have no walls around them shall be considered as the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee" v. 31 . This signifies that in a place in which there are some believers who cannot be considered a church, the lost enjoyment of Christ can be restored.
[376]  I do not know of one person who lost the church life because of something that was an offense to God who later came back to the church life.
[377]  In each case, a saint did something that caused him to lose the church life, but that one did not return to the church life during the remainder of his life.
[378]  If we do not redeem our lost church life during the time allotted, we shall also lose the church life in the coming age, and the church life will not be restored to us until after the coming age, when we shall be disciplined, trained, corrected, and punished in order to be cleansed, prepared, and perfected for the eternal age.
[379]  In this message we shall cover some further matters related to the jubilee.
[380]  An Israelite Brother Who Became Poor and Sold Himself to Another Brother Was Not to Be Made a Slave but a Hired Servant until the Year of Jubilee
[381]  "You shall not rule over him with harshness, but you shall fear your God" v. 43 . Not ruling over a sold brother with harshness signifies that we should not harshly treat a brother who is in debt to us spiritually.
[382]  The Selling Price and the Amount of the Refund for Redemption to Be Calculated according to the Number of Years Relative to the Jubilee
[383]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE THE WORD OF WARNING 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 26:1-20
[384]  According to our understanding, we may think that the book of Leviticus should end with the jubilee in chapter twenty-five.
[385]  "You shall keep My sabbaths" v. 2a . Keeping God's sabbath signifies that we should know that the work of God was done entirely by Himself that we might enjoy it, and that there is no need for us to do any work.
[386]  However, among Christians today these things are neglected, for many do not have the adequate knowledge of what God is in Christ as His embodiment and of what God has done in the church to make it the enlargement of Christ and the manifestation of God.
[387]  B. The Land Yielding Its Rich Produce That the People May Eat the New Food Always and Dwell Securely in the Land
[388]  Verses 4b and 5 tell us that if the people obey, "the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will yield their fruit.
[389]  This signifies that we dwell in Christ as our good land and enjoy the riches of Christ for our satisfaction and security.
[390]  A. On the First Level the Appointing of Sudden Terror
[391]  In 26:14-17 we have the chastisement on the first level.
[392]  "I also will do this to you: I will appoint over you sudden terror, a consuming disease and a fever that will cause your eyesight to fail and your life to waste away; you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it" v. 16 . This signifies that we will be sick in the spirit and even in the body so that we lose our eyesight and our life, and the enemy will enjoy what we have done in emptiness.
[393]  LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE SIXTY THE WORD OF WARNING 2 Scripture Reading: Lev 26:1-20
[394]  First, we should not have idols v. 1 . This signifies that besides God we should have no other goals that we are seeking after, so that we may not lose the position to enjoy our divine possession.
[395]  Third, we need to reverence God's sanctuary v. 2b . This signifies that we should regard with reverence all that God is and has accomplished in Christ as God's dwelling, embodiment, and expression John 1:14; Col 2:9 , and in the church as the enlargement of Christ for God's dwelling and eternal manifestation Eph 2:22; Rev 21:10 . We need not only to understand these points in letter but also to see their intrinsic significance.
[396]  The basis for our obedience is first God Himself and then God's work.
[397]  Because Jesus was a man with God in Him and one with Him, He was a mystery, even to His disciples.
[398]  They knew He was human, for they had seen Him eat and also weep.
[399]  The Vision of the Processed Triune God with His Word and the Result of His Word Constituting Us into Obedient Ones
[400]  We need to take the processed Triune God, His work, and the result of His work as the basis for our obedience.
[401]  With these three things as our basis, we shall obey God.
[402]  According to the word of warning in Leviticus 26, the obeying ones will be blessed vv.
[403]  "And you will eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you will eat" v. 29 . This signifies that the church becomes so poor that it is unable to satisfy its members but bereaves them of their food supply.
[404]  In the Enemies' Lands Faintness Being Sent into the Hearts, the People Being Driven and Fleeing as though Fleeing from the Sword, Stumbling over One Another, Perishing among the Nations Being Consumed and Rotting in the Land of Their Enemies
[405]  C. In Spite of His Chastisement God Not Rejecting the People, Neither Destroying Them Utterly nor Breaking His Covenant with Them
[406]  "And yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them so as to utterly destroy them and break My covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God" v. 44 . This signifies that God, having chastised the church severely, will not reject it, nor will He destroy it utterly or break His covenant with it.
[407]  No matter what the situation may be, we are still under God's New Testament covenant, and we still have our portion.
[408]  At this point we should note that chapter twenty-five of Leviticus concerns the grace of God, signified by the jubilee, whereas chapter twenty-six concerns the administration of God chastisement, government, kingdom .
[409]  In this message we come to the last chapter of Leviticus, a chapter concerning the devotions for a vow.
[410]  The book of Leviticus concludes with a vow which we need to have with God.
[411]  Leviticus, a book of the priesthood, ends with our devotion of ourselves and of our possessions, our cattle, land, and houses.
[412]  Of a Female from Twenty to Sixty Years Old, Thirty Shekels
[413]  "And if it is a female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels" v. 4 . Here we see that the valuation of a female from twenty to sixty years old is thirty shekels, second to that of the males above.
[414]  Of a Female from Sixty Years Old and Upward, Ten Shekels
[415]  "But if he is poorer than the valuation, then he shall be presented before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of him who vowed, the priest shall value him" v. 8 . This signifies that we are not valued according to our spiritual age but according to our spiritual ability, not according to what we should do spiritually but according to what we can do spiritually.
[416]  If an Unclean Animal, Which Should Not Have Been Offered to Jehovah, Was Devoted, It Was to Be Valued by the Priest
[417]  "If it is an unclean animal, which they may not offer as an offering to Jehovah, then he shall set the animal before the priest, and the priest shall value it as either good or bad; according to the valuation of the priest, so it shall be" vv.
[418]  The Sanctifying One Who Redeemed the Field Was to Add One-fifth of the Valuation
[419]  "And if he who sanctified the field would indeed redeem it, then he shall add to it one-fifth of the valuation in money, and it shall remain his" v. 19 . This signifies that we should pay a price for our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ as the rich land.
[420]  "And if it is among the unclean beasts, then he shall ransom it according to the valuation, and shall add one-fifth of its value to it; and if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold according to the valuation" v. 27 . This signifies that even though what we have devoted to God is unclean, through the valuation of our Mediator, the Lord Jesus, the motive of our devotion is still valuable to some degree before God.
[421]  E. The Tithe of Everything Was Holy to God; It Was Not to Be Devoted, but It Could Be Redeemed with an Addition of One-fifth of Its Value, and It Was Not to Be Exchanged; Otherwise, Both It and That for Which It Was Exchanged Would Be Holy to God
[422]  "And every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is Jehovah's; it is holy to Jehovah.
[423]  In the twenty-eight foregoing messages, we covered the last seventeen chapters of Leviticus.
[424]  The fifth point is our realization that three items are crucial to us.
