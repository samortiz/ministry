   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REGENERATED UNTO A LIVING HOPE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through Christ s all-inclusive death, God s chosen people are ushered into Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ was resurrected, God s chosen people were resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consider what 1 Peter 1:3 says concerning this: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see that the Father has regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ unto a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This living hope will be fulfilled completely in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Living hope is a hope of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the hope that the life within us will develop until it reaches maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may use the birth of a child as an illustration of living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After a woman gives birth to a child, she will have a hope for that child, a hope for his growth and development.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps the mother of a certain child may hope that he will become a medical doctor or even the president of the country.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The basic factor of this hope is the life in the child.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the child has life, the mother will have hope for his future.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a similar way, we have been regenerated unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This hope is the hope of life, a life that will grow and develop until it consummates in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This living hope issues from our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you know when you were regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may answer this question by saying that, in your experience, you were regenerated some years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, you were regenerated when Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a divine fact that you were regenerated before you were born.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the sight of God, you had your second birth before you experienced your first birth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE FIRSTBORN AMONG MANY BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Acts 13:33 indicates that Christ s resurrection was a birth to Him, for in resurrection He was begotten as God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In resurrection and through resurrection the Lord Jesus as a man was born to become God s firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word firstborn indicates that the Lord Jesus has brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Romans 8:29 Paul speaks of Christ as the firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In resurrection we all have been born with Christ to become His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>USHERED INTO RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we read the Gospel of Mark, we need to realize how much the death of the God-man includes and also how much His resurrection comprises.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the process of Christ s death and resurrection was taking place, we, represented by Peter and the other disciples, were involved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In chapter fourteen Peter wept after he denied the Lord Jesus v. 72 . We may say that Peter wept because he was spiritually bankrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, because he was brought into the death of Christ, Peter was ushered by that death into the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At least by the time of Pentecost Peter realized this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of weeping, he was proclaiming the gospel to the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the day of Pentecost Peter could have said, I can tell you good news concerning Christ because I am now in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The resurrected One is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the all-inclusive, compound Spirit saturating me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is one with me, and I am one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter had been brought into the death and resurrection of Christ, the One who had become his all-inclusive replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen that regeneration issues in a living hope, in a hope for the full development of the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have the hope that this life will grow and develop in us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are in this life, and this life is within us growing and developing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, this life issues in today s church life, which is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, with many, this life will reach maturity in the millennium, which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ultimately, the divine life within all believers will reach its fullest development in the New Jerusalem, God s eternal kingdom in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This will be the consummate development of the life we received through our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No doubt, we lack an adequate realization of the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, we have had at least some realization of the fact that we have been regenerated through Christ s resurrection unto a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many saints can testify that, on certain occasions, they have prayed themselves into an ecstasy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When they were in such a state, they may have found it difficult to say where they were in the church, the millennium, or the New Jerusalem for they were beside themselves in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of us need to have experiences like this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although we are of different nationalities and come from different places around the world, we all have had the real experience of being in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we are beside ourselves in the Lord, perhaps not knowing where we are, that is an experience of being in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because we have been regenerated, we have been ushered into Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How wonderful it would be if we were always in resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we may face problems that cause us to feel that we have been buried and placed in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But we know from experience that when we cry out to the Lord, calling on His name, we once again experience His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the story of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Unbelievers, of course, do not have such experiences, because they have not been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Praise the Lord that He has brought us into His wonderful resurrection!</S>
