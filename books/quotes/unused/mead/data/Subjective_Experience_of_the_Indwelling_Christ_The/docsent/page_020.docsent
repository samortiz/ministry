   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING ONENESS WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Lord is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we pray and petition before the Lord, the Spirit comes into our spirit and dwells in us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, He is waiting for us to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He takes possession of us whenever we say, "Lord Jesus, I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more we love Him, the more we are possessed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The last stanza of Hymns, #398 says, "O to be like Thee!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While I am pleading / Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>/ Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling, / Fit for a life which Thou wouldst approve."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That we live a life approved by the Lord means that we take the Lord's mind as our mind, take the Lord's emotion as our emotion, and take the Lord's will as our will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also take the Lord's love, light, holiness, and righteousness as our love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord and we, we and the Lord, are completely one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are just the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For to us, to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ancient sages in China taught that man is innately good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What God created originally was good.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He created us with the bright virtue, the innate goodness, which needs to be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, without Christ in us, everything is still a shell devoid of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are just like an empty glove.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the hand gets inside the glove, then the glove has content and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, the glove and the hand become one; they are a perfect match.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This illustrates the oneness between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God and man, man and God, are completely satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If man does not have God, neither God nor man is satisfied; this is the root of dissatisfaction in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When man has God, both God and man are satisfied; this is the source of true satisfaction in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ wants to become your mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He also wants to be your love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even the more, He wants to be in you that which is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, well spoken of, virtuous, and praiseworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, Christ can be expressed through your God-created human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>TO LIVE BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every one of us possesses the God-created virtues, the inherent human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But it is very difficult to express these virtues by ourselves, and even if we were able to, the expression would be neither complete nor perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to be filled by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our virtues should be vessels that are filled with Christ to manifest the very essence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the highest, perfect virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the righteousness of God which Paul referred to in Philippians 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Formerly, he pursued the righteousness which he worked out by keeping the law; eventually what he pursued was the righteousness of God lived out through Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Formerly, he wanted the glove, but eventually he wanted the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The hand in the glove is the content and reality of the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, the hand and the glove are one, and the glove becomes the expression of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are the glove, and He, our beloved Lord, is the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our heart is filled with His love, and our life is one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, for us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is our life, and we are His living; He is our content, and we are His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He and we, we and He, exactly match one another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He and we become one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the enjoyment of Christ, the living out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the experience of Christ's indwelling.</S>
