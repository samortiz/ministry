   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Tsingtao One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peace to my dear brother Philip in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our hearts are filled with thanks and praise to the Lord who loves us!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has given us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the true and living God!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I pass out gospel tracts on the street, many people come over to ask for them as if they are asking for something precious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>May the Lord give them grace so that they may gain comfort from those words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One day, while a few brothers and sisters were praying with me, we saw a short slip of paper before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first sentence said, "Fear not...I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward" Gen 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second sentence said, "He is a shield unto them that put their trust in him" Prov 30:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We knelt down and prayed for the brothers and sisters in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please remember the unbelievers here in your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Lord allows, perhaps I will return home for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please pray much for the brothers and sisters in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please order seven copies of The Open Door for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in Hankow from all the brothers and sisters in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Greetings to Mrs. Luan.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have not written you for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have often wanted to write, but I did not know what to write, so I have put it off until today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I read the last little paragraph of The Open Door today and found out that you were happy to hear our news, so I am writing this letter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the never-changing Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will never forget those whom He loves!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am very unworthy, but it does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I was in Ling-Zi, I heard the rumors of war getting worse and worse every day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But thank the Lord, His doings are truly marvelous because He allowed me to do some work in Guang-Rao during that time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Outwardly I was helping people, but inwardly I was edified myself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On December 4 Mrs. Shen and Mrs. Yuan Ling-shu safely arrived in Tsingtao with their daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank the Lord for edifying us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord gave me the word in 2 Timothy 2:22 before I left.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since my arrival, it has been wonderful for us to be able to pray in one accord daily.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the Lord grant us grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Greetings to Sister Chang and Sister Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I received a letter dated January 1 from a brother in Ling-Zi saying that the county seat of Guang-Rao has been captured by bandits.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since Guang-Rao was lost, Ling-Zi is nervous.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May the Lord preserve those who believe in Him in those two places.</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thank and praise God for allowing the brothers and sisters in Tientsin to read The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have received both the first and second issues and have passed them out to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Most of the brothers and sisters are living at temporary addresses.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They move or leave Tientsin constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Communication by mail is also difficult, so the responsible brothers will subscribe for the brothers and sisters and distribute them accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This way the publications will not be lost, and the saints in Hankow will be spared much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Is this all right with you?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is very good Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am enclosing an order form for a total of eighty copies.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am wiring X dollars through the Bank of China for the Lord's work and the publication costs.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some was collected from the offering box for the work in Hankow, and some is local offerings for the expansion of the Lord's work in general.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Please determine how it should be distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let me give a little report of the assembly in Tientsin: Our address is still 82 Alley 6 Yao-Hua-Li, British Concession 21 Road, Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our meetings have continued as usual since the beginning of the war; we have not had to cancel even one meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our meetings include edification meetings, gospel meetings, table meetings, prayer meetings, and Bible studies.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although we can grow cold and change, the Lord who loves us will never change; He will love us to the end. He manifests His wisdom, power, grace, mercy, and love to His children all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Truly, "Had we ten thousand thousand tongues, our theme of joy's but one!"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Praise and thank our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The brothers and sisters are all well and safe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Please do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are, however, a few who have lost their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Please remember us in your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We also hope that God's workers will come here often.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May the Lord be with you until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Peace and joy to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Your brothers,</S>
