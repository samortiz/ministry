Because they are burning and shining, they can enlighten others.</p><h2 class="head2">The Move of the Great Wheel</h2><p>Another result of coordination is God&rsquo;s move, signified by the great wheel (vv. 16-19). As the living creatures coordinate together, the great wheel appears. This indicates that God&rsquo;s move follows the coordination of the four living creatures. If there is no coordination, there cannot be the move of the great wheel.</p><h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Administration</h2><p>The coordination of the four living creatures also results in God&rsquo;s administration. The throne of the divine administration rests upon the coordination of the living creatures. Without such a coordination, God would not have a means of ruling and He would not have the means to express His authority and His glory.</p><h2 class="head2">The Carrying Out of God&rsquo;s Will</h2><p>A further result of coordination is the carrying out of God&rsquo;s will and His plan. Because of the coordination of the four living creatures, there is a way for God&rsquo;s will and God&rsquo;s plan to be carried out.</p><p>We need to be impressed with the crucial importance of coordination. Before we can be coordinated together, we need to experience the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum and thereby become the living creatures. Then we need to have the image of a man and the faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. Furthermore, we must have the eagle&rsquo;s wings, the man&rsquo;s hands, and the calf&rsquo;s hoofs. If we have all these things, then we will be able to coordinate together. This coordination will result in the corporate expression of Christ, in our becoming burning, shining, and full of light, in God&rsquo;s move, in God&rsquo;s ruling, and in the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p><p>We need to see that coordination is the key to understanding the vision in Ezekiel 1. On the one hand, many things are for coordination; on the other hand, many things are based on coordination. Coordination is the key. May we all see this and may the Lord bring us all into a coordination with many other living creatures for the sake of the corporate expression of Christ, God&rsquo;s move, and God&rsquo;s administration.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Ezekiel &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
