   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Releasing the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must speak not only the gospel, but we must also speak the truth, the divine realities in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To speak the truth, you have to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Trinity is probably the greatest truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nearly all Christians know that our God is triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet that is all they know.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When asked to speak more concerning this they have little to say.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all must learn to speak something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You can tell people that to be baptized is to be baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then they will enjoy the grace of Christ the Son and the love of God the Father and will have a share in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They will enjoy the riches of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may think it would be hard to pick up all these points, but I do not think so.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It all depends upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you have the heart and the desire, you can surely do it, especially if you go to the Recovery Version, where there is a long note on 2 Corinthians 13:14.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This note gives a long list of the references concerning the divine Trinity, from Genesis to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, 1 Peter 1:2 says, According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ....</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the very enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then Paul in Ephesians 3 said that he bowed his knees to the Father, that He would strengthen us by the Spirit that Christ may make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Again you can see the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are many verses like this, including John 14:17-20.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are the rich words.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Learn to pick them up and to speak them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Twelve years ago you might have had a lot of excuses not to speak the rich word, but not today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because I have put a lot of rich groceries in your pantry or at least at the book counter where you can get them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now you can get all the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our training on the book of Acts we stressed the matter of dispensational transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am concerned that many of us may have missed this crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to spend a lot of time on all the notes that deal with this transfer in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that in just half a day you will pick up a strong point concerning the dispensational transfer found in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope that you would spend some time to pick up the riches of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then when you speak, you would speak not only livingly, but also richly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am thankful to the Lord that many have been attending the ministry meetings for over twelve years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do believe the reason you have kept attending is because I do not render you some cheap things, some dead things, speaking things in a poor way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever I have delivered to you has been at least somewhat living and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The livingness and the richness of this ministry attracts you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all have to learn to speak not only the living word, but also the rich word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then our speaking of the rich word will be the release of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are so many truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, the book of Galatians is full of riches: But when it pleased God...to reveal His Son in me 1:15-16 ; For I through law have died to law that I might live to God 2:19 ; I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me 2:20 ; until Christ is formed in you 4:19 ; For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With the Recovery Version and the life-studies, it is so easy to pick up all these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It would be a pity if you have been with us for over five years, yet are still not so full of the riches of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You are in a rich family with many riches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On your left side there are riches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On your right side there are riches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In back of you, in front of you, above and below you, there are many riches, but all the riches are not in you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to realize the situation and pick up the riches of the holy Word that we may speak to people the living and rich word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ministering Life</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our speaking with prayer, the Spirit, and boldness is also for the ministering of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Life is conveyed in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible is the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whatever we speak as the living, rich word of God is the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We speak the word, but within the word is life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, in our speaking we spontaneously minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, due to our shortage in the Word of God, when we try to help others, we just do not have the utterance to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The most we could say might be, You have to love the Lord, and realize that the Lord loves you and is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead we need to minister something new, something of our own experience, something that we have discovered, something that we have gone through.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By doing this we will spontaneously minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need the proper speaking of the living, rich word so that we can minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you would do these three things preach the gospel, release the truth, and minister life to others by speaking the living, rich word then when you come to a big meeting or a small meeting you will be so rich.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You will have the habit to speak, and you will have a lot to speak about, even to speak with.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You would have a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I would have a lot; each one of us would have a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way the meeting would never be poor, low, dead, or cold.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It would always be uplifted, enriched, and quite living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the way to have the church life built in the small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Recovering the Weaker Ones</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The rich speaking also helps us to recover the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the church there are always a number of weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They need your support; they need your comfort; they need your help through the rich word by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In conclusion, if we really mean business with the Lord in His recovery, we all have to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not take the shortcut way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Prepare yourself with a lot of endurance, a lot of divine patience to take this way for at least three or four years.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Go to the small meetings, always spend your time to get into the holy Word, pray properly, and learn to speak habitually the things concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Speak the divine riches firstly to build yourself up.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then you come to the meeting to practice this habit of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not say, I do not feel that I have the burden to speak anything in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I am not led; I have no inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Forget about this traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Learn to enter into the Word and pray about it, and then practice speaking according to the deposit in you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then when you come to the meeting, whether or not you have the feeling that you are inspired or led, you will just speak.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>First your speaking will build up yourself, and then it will spontaneously build up others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Thus, the meetings will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the way for the church life.</S>
