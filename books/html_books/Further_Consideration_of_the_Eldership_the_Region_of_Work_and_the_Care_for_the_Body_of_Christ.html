Lord, we are all here waiting on You. Lord, thank You that You have opened up Your Word in these days to us. We need Your Spirit, the Spirit of grace, and even the Spirit of supplication, that we may pray to You to receive Yourself as our grace. Lord, tonight we look unto You for a living revelation. Unveil Yourself to us and expose us. Lord, we want to know You. In the light of knowing You, we want to see ourselves. Lord Jesus, we want to be adjusted once more. O Lord, we like to be remodeled. Transform us in the view concerning Your Body, Your church, which is Your heart's desire. Lord, we want to know You in this desire&#151;not in our thinking, in our interest, but in what You want. Lord, do speak to us. Lord, quiet us and give us a heart which is open to You.</P><P>We want to see what You want us to do and to be in these last, crucial days. Lord, we pray for Your move to Europe, even to eastern Europe. We pray for Your step, which includes us. Deeply work in us that we may cooperate with You to go together with You. O Lord Jesus, be the Angel of Jehovah to escort us to Europe&#151;to eastern Germany and to Russia&#151;that You would have a people to carry out Your plan even today. Lord, cover us. We hide ourselves in You and hide ourselves under the cleansing of Your precious blood, the prevailing blood, which protects us against all the enemy's devices. Lord, rebuke him as You did before Joshua. We need Your cleansing; we even need Your purification. O Lord Jesus, we do not trust in what we can say or in what we can do. We still trust in Your mercy. Lord, grant us Your rich blessing. Lord, we like these three names in Zechariah 1:1&#151;at an appointed time [Iddo] Jehovah will bless [Berechiah] and Jehovah will remember [Zechariah]. Lord, we believe this is the appointed time. Lord, bless us and remember us. Lord Jesus, we put our full trust in You. We have absolutely no trust in ourselves. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROBLEMS OF PRIDE,<br>THE THOUGHT OF BEING A HERO, AND OPINIONS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Problem of Pride with the Young Ones</H2><P>I am happy that we could be together in this elders' meeting. This is probably the biggest elders' meeting we have had in the United States. There are five hundred thirty brothers here in attendance. I noticed that many young ones are among the elders. I am happy about this, but I am also quite concerned. Paul's charge to us is that the "new hands" should be considered carefully before being brought into the realm, the circle, of the eldership. In 1 Timothy 3:6 Paul says that an overseer should not be a novice, or a new convert.</P><P>On the other hand, there need to be learners in the eldership. Learning spiritual things may be likened to learning a language. It is easier for a young person to learn a new language. An older person may learn a new language, but it is difficult for him to get rid of his accent. In this sense, it is very good to have young ones in the eldership. However, I also want to warn the young ones. I have passed through your age, and I do know what is in a young man that can be a possible problem. This does not mean that we older ones do not have any problem. We have our problem, the middle-aged brothers have their problem, and the young brothers have their problem. Every age group has its problems.</P><P>When you are young, the problem is your pride. It is hard for the young people to avoid pride. In the past sixty to seventy years, I have been watching over the recovery and the world situation. I have discovered that pride is the problem with the young people. In the past seventy years, the Lord brought in some brilliant, marvelous, excellent young ones among us. However, about eighty percent of the brilliant young ones whom the Lord brought into our realm were spoiled by their pride. Thus, we are short of hands today.</P><P>Because the recovery is real and rich in truth, the entire world is open to the recovery. Especially, I would say that all of Central America and South America, with Puerto Rico and the Caribbean Islands, are open to us. We have so many requests from these places for some to come and help them. This has become our burden. We cannot bear this much. We are short of hands. If we had fifty co-workers who would be able to go to help meet the present demand, it still would not be sufficient. In New Zealand, Australia, Korea, and southeastern Asia, there is also the need.</P><P>I received a letter three days ago from a brother in Mongolia. I want to report to you that there is a local church of about twenty-five saints there in the recovery. Most of them are either students or professors in the universities. The way they meet and serve is absolutely in the new way. They have also asked for some to come there to help. These ones in Mongolia are open and eager to know the Bible and to know the Lord. Who will go to them? This shows again that the door is wide open to the Lord's recovery.</P><P>The door is also wide open to the Lord's recovery in Russia. We have signed the order to have altogether one and a half million books printed in Russian. Some brothers there promised us that they had the means to distribute these books all the way from Moscow to Vladivostok. If one hundred proper brothers (not only qualified but also proper) went there, fifty churches could be raised up within a short time. But where are the proper brothers among us? Throughout the years, we have had many promising young ones, many crops, but when they were growing up, they got cut off by their pride.</P><P>The turmoil through which we have recently passed has become a cycle in the Lord's recovery. Nearly every seven to ten years there has been a turmoil to damage the crop. In 1978 there was a storm which cut off some good brothers. Then three years ago there was another turmoil. Some useful ones were cut off through this recent turmoil.</P><P>In the past Brother Nee warned us. He said that many pieces of pottery will be broken in the process of finishing the pottery. These ones who have been involved in this recent turmoil have been spoiled like this broken pottery. These dear ones could have been very useful, but their potential usefulness has been spoiled.</P><P>At the beginning of their church life in the recovery, they were quite humble and poor in spirit. They were under the ministry to be taught, nourished, and raised up. They really learned something, and they had a certain capacity from the Lord by His mercy. But they eventually began to be deceived, trying to overthrow the present ministry in the Lord's recovery. They were like a crop going on quite well, a crop which gave much expectation to the farmers. But a hailstorm came suddenly to damage that crop. This happened during my absence from the United States. A hailstorm came and damaged the crop. Once the crop gets damaged in this way, there is no way to recover it.</P><P>I have seen this several times in our history in the Lord's recovery in mainland China. When I was sent out of mainland China, we did not have many useful, proper brothers to bear the burden because of this kind of continual damage through pride. The enemy damages the recovery firstly by people's pride.</P><P>This is why I want to warn the young ones. Today a young brother may be very humble and obedient because he is learning. But we do not have the assurance that he will be the same after seven or ten years. We do not know what the result will be with this young brother. Pride is a big killer used by Satan. Satan may not take advantage of a young one while he is learning. But after a number of years, when this brother is just entering into the years of being useful in the hand of the Lord, Satan will seek to take him as prey through his pride. This is why we are short of hands today in this time of urgent need. I hope that you young people would be impressed that the enemy is crouching, waiting for the opportunity to take you as his prey. After some years, you will have learned something, and some capacity will be there. You will be useful. That will be the time for you to get caught by the enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Problem of the Thought of Being a Hero<br>with the Middle-aged Ones</H2><P>There is also a problem with the middle-aged ones. In this elders' meeting, I have been prepared by the Lord to say something very practical to the three age groups&#151;the young people, the middle-aged brothers, and the old brothers. What is the trouble with the middle-aged brothers? A certain brother may have come into the church life when he was twenty-two. Now that he is forty years old, he praises the Lord for His mercy in keeping him in His recovery. He is thankful to the Lord for His ministry by which he has been nourished, educated, perfected, and equipped. Now he has the attitude that he knows something and can do something. Then what is the trouble? Satan is subtle. He can use anything according to your age to get you as his prey. The middle-aged brothers, after staying in the Lord's recovery about eighteen to twenty years, may consider themselves as  heroes in the recovery. They feel that the recovery cannot be short of them.</P><P>Because I have passed through the Lord's recovery as a young and middle-aged person, I understand these problems. I dropped my job in 1933 so that I could serve the Lord with all of my time. I was humble, because I did not know much about life, the Spirit, Christ, or the church as the Body of Christ. Of course, by that time I had acquired much knowledge about the types and prophecies in the Old Testament. I knew that Christ was my Savior, but I never knew that He was God's centrality and universality. Brother Nee was only two years older than I. Sister Faith Chang observed my relationship with him and testified that I was to Brother Nee just like a son to a father.</P><P>After ten years of being with Brother Nee, from 1933 to 1943, I learned a lot. In 1943, after I had been somewhat perfected and equipped, I became very sick. That was actually the mercy of the Lord. The Japanese put me into prison for one month. After I came out of prison, I got tuberculosis and nearly died. The Lord in His mercy put me into this sickness for two and a half years. I learned a lot in that time. During that time, I saw the tree of life. This took place when I was forty years old. In 1944 I left Chefoo, my hometown. Since then up to now, I have not returned there.</P><P>The lesson that I have learned with the middle-aged brothers is their thinking that they may be the hero, that they may be somebody in the recovery, and that the young ones should listen to them. If you think this way, sooner or later, a day will come when the crouching enemy will take you as his prey. Then you are finished. I thank the Lord that He delivered me out of that snare.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Problem of Opinions with the Old Ones</H2><P>Now I am in my old age. I know the problems with the elderly brothers. The problem with those in their old age is opinions. An old brother feels that he has the experience. He has passed through the problems of the young and middle-aged brothers. Now he has learned a lot. If some want to act, he will say not to because of his experience. His opinions hinder the work. The older ones can hinder the going on of a church because of their opinions.</P><P>Pride, the thought of being a hero, and opinions have been used by the enemy among us in the past seventy years. I am sorry that Brother Nee is not here. If he were here, he would nod his head again and again to my word. He would tell you that I am altogether right.</P><P>To illustrate what I have been saying, I would like to relate something of our history. I was sent by the work to Taiwan in 1949. In the spring of 1950, Brother Nee came out of mainland China to Hong Kong, and he brought in a revival there. He contacted me and asked me to come to Hong Kong from Taiwan to help. The next morning he brought me to the service meeting, which included the elders, deacons, and co-workers. He brought me in and said, "Brother Witness, according to the authority the Lord has given you, make full arrangements for all the service concerning the co-workers, the elders, and the deacons." Later, a small group was formed to take care of the purchase of some land for the building of a hall. Brother Nee found out that this group, mostly of older brothers, was full of opinions. One day, Brother Nee took the opportunity in his wisdom to tell this group, "Concerning the purchase of land and the building up of the hall, you have to listen to whatever Brother Lee says." They all agreed to this.</P><P>Soon after this, I was invited by this group to an older brother's home for a love feast. This older brother was full of experiences. These experiences had become his opinions. After we had started to eat, they said that they were begging me for permission to buy only one acre of land. I had told them previously to buy two acres of land, but they thought this might be too much.</P><P>I told them that since the church in Hong Kong was their church, this was their business. But I also told them that if they were going to buy a piece of land in a big city like Hong Kong, they should buy it in a sufficient way. I warned them that after buying the land, it would be very difficult for them to go back to get additional land. They still decided to purchase only one acre. After they made the plans for the hall, they found out that one acre was insufficient. Then they tried their best to go back and get more land. They did everything they could, but they were only able to get a little bit more property. This illustrates how the Lord's work can suffer because of opinion.</P><P>In the recovery we have been suffering and suffering from 1922 up to now because of these three things: the pride of the younger ones, the thought of being a hero of the middle-aged ones, and the opinions of the older ones. Everything may be all right with us now, but these problems are within us. All of us need to be warned. If we are younger ones, we should be warned of pride. If we are in middle age, we should learn to be nothing. We should not wear a "mask" in the eldership. We should be what we are. When we are older, we should remember that the problem with older people is opinion.</P><P>There are a number of brothers working with me to carry out the full-time training. Sometimes, although I have had the proper way to go on, I did not say anything. Because the brothers helping me expressed a way which was quite different from my way, I would not say a word. The frustration of opinions can be illustrated by five brothers taking one car to go to Los Angeles. The first decision they have to make is who the driver will be. If they have not been dealt with by the cross, this decision could take much time. Once this is decided upon, the driver may ask what way he should take. The opinions expressed concerning what way to take can also take much time. This waste of time hinders, frustrates, and delays them from arriving at their destination. This is why we should be exercised not to express any opinion if we are not the "driver." My point is this&#151;if the elders in the eldership are not one, sooner or later, they will "kill" themselves. This has been the situation among us in a number of places.</P><P>There may be three brothers in the eldership in a certain locality&#151;one is older, one is younger, and the other one is middle-aged. Thus, the three problems of pride, thinking that one is a hero, and opinions are all there. When these problems are present in the eldership, the eldership is finished. I would like to ask the elders if they are in oneness in their locality. Those who think they are a hero may wear a mask, feeling that they can convince everyone and subdue everyone. This is terrible. If this is the case, can the church in this locality be built up? The church is torn down by these kinds of problems.</P><P>Brothers, you need to realize that to be a person in the eldership in the Lord's recovery is a serious thing. If you are young, beware of your pride. If you are in middle age, beware of your thinking that you are the hero, the strong one among the others. If you are an older one, beware of your opinions. In the eldership there should be no pride, no thought of being a hero, and no opinions. There should be only truth, the Spirit, Christ, and the church, the Body of Christ. We do not want to know anything else.</P><P>In the past two years of the full-time training in Anaheim, I can testify that I and all the trainers did not have anything other than the truth, the Spirit, Christ, and the church, the Body of Christ. Thus, the blessing has been here. When we practice the one accord, our name will be Iddo, Berechiah, and Zechariah (Zech. 1:1), meaning that at the appointed time Jehovah blesses and Jehovah remembers. In some localities there is no blessing because some of the brothers wear a mask. They are not honest, sincere, and genuine. Do you think that the Lord will bless you and remember you if you are like this?</P><P>We should be serious in taking the eldership in the recovery. We have to fear the Lord as our Head. In the church life, we all have to learn to be subject one to another. Not only should the young ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the young ones in the fear of Christ (Eph. 5:21; 1 Pet. 5:5). This means that we should honor and regard Christ as the Head. In the church, we are not the head. He is the Head, and we should be careful not to offend Him.</P><P>We need to be aware of the seriousness of being in the eldership. The young ones should hate their pride; the middle-aged ones should hate the thinking that they are heroic; and the old ones should hate their opinions. We should try the best to fulfill our duty in this way under His economy. Due to our past history, I feel that what I have spoken here as a warning is needed. If we remain in the recovery in our pride, our thought of being a hero, or our opinions, we will be the first ones to suffer, and we will cause the church to suffer.</P><P>Some middle-aged brothers wear a mask in the eldership. A mask is a falsehood; it is hypocrisy. To appear in a way other than what you really are is to wear a mask. In front of one person, you may act one way. Then in front of another person, you will act in another way. This kind of pretense is hateful in the eyes of the Lord. The Lord likes to see truthfulness, sincerity, and faithfulness. In the eldership one of the most important lessons to learn is to be truthful, faithful, and sincere. We should not be two-faced. We should be one person with one genuine face. To be hypocritical cuts off your future in the recovery. The Lord knows our heart. The ones who last in the eldership are those who are honest, faithful, truthful, and sincere.</P><P>My burden in this elders' meeting is to try my best to fellowship with you all concerning the real problem among us today. Pride, the thought of being a hero, and opinions are the factors working something out secretly to damage one thing&#151;the Body of Christ. As long as I am proud, the Body of Christ is through with me. As long as I am thinking that I am the one who is a hero, the Body of Christ is gone. If opinion is here, the Body of Christ is frustrated. If we are in any of these three items, the Body is annulled.</P><P>In fact Christ does have a Body, but in practicality this Body has been crippled, annulled, and to some extent destroyed. Christ does have a Body, but where is the proper Body? Where is the Body that functions? If you have one of these three problems&#151;pride, the thought of being a hero, or opinions&#151;in practicality the Body is absent in your locality. When your problem is present, the Body of Christ is absent.</P><P>Now we want to see two crucial points concerning knowing the Body. We need to know the Body in the Spirit and in practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN THE SPIRIT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One Body, One Spirit</H2><P>Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit." The Spirit is the essence and the reality of the Body. In doctrine, it may not seem so good to say that the Spirit is the Body, but in actuality the Spirit is the Body. If you are proud, the Spirit is absent, so the Body is not here. If you are opinionated, the Body cannot be here either, because your opinions are enemies to the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Local Churches<br>Being the One, Unique Universal Church</H2><P>Just because a group of believers are meeting in your locality, it does not mean that the Body is there. Today on this earth, there are many Christian groups. You may have the thought that your local church has nothing to do with other churches and should not be in any connection with other churches. This thought isolates your local church, making it no longer a part of the Body of Christ. The Body is unique in the whole universe. There may be thousands of local churches, but there is still just one Body. All the local churches are the one, unique universal church, the one Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Local Churches<br>Having the Same One Spirit</H2><P>Furthermore, all the local churches possess the same one Spirit. The Spirit is uniquely one. There is no local Spirit; there is no local Christ; there is no local God; and there is no local Bible. Moreover, the apostles' teaching is not local, and the apostles' fellowship is not local (Acts 2:42). All the basic things for the Body are not local. Some of the business affairs may be merely local matters, but we need to realize that all the local churches are the one, unique universal church, and they all have the same one Spirit. In this light we need to reconsider our present understanding of the church. Our understanding of the church may be unbalanced.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN PRACTICE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Locality as the Church Ground of a Local Church<br>Separating the Church in Existence<br>but Not Dividing the Church in Essence</H2><P>We also need to know the Body in practice. Locality as the church ground of a local church separates the church in existence but does not divide the church in essence. The existence of the churches is separated, but their essence is inseparable. The saints who live in Atlanta and those who live in Anaheim cannot come together always as one church. This is impossible. For the sake of existence, the local churches are separate. The saints who live in Atlanta have to be the church there, and the brothers and sisters in Anaheim have to be the church here. This is a separation for the purpose of existence, but this has nothing to do with the essence. The church in Atlanta, the church in Anaheim, and all the local churches are one Body in essence. Essentially, we are still just one Body on the entire globe. Our thought needs to be revolutionized. We should consider our local church as a part of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Regions of the Work</H2><P>Brother Nee taught about the regions of the work in his book Further Talks on the Church Life (see chapter six entitled "The Way for the Work Hereafter"&#151;pp. 153-170). We have to realize that in the New Testament, for the apostles' work, there were only two regions. One was the Jewish world, and the other was the Gentile world. In these two regions, there were no sub-regions.</P><P>Peter was working in the Jewish region, and that area was relatively small. But the Gentile world in which Paul worked was vast with different countries. These different countries, such as Asia Minor, Greece, and Macedonia, were different geographical regions. Rome with its surrounding areas could also be considered as a geographical region. But the New Testament does not have this kind of consideration concerning the work. In the Gentile world, there was only one region with one group of co-workers.</P><P>Did Paul, because of the vastness of his region, let some brothers take care of the work in Rome and another group take care of Greece with Macedonia? There was not such a thing. There were not different groups of workers under Paul taking care of specific regions or sub-regions. Paul and those with him were altogether just one group.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Regions of the Work<br>Not Dividing the Churches</H2><P>The regions of the work should not divide the churches. There were regions in Paul's time, the Jewish and the Gentile, but they never divided the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Churches in the Gentile World<br>Having Fellowship<br>with Those in the Jewish World</H2><P>The churches in the Gentile world had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in solving the problems in teaching (Acts 15:1-34). Some taught circumcision as a term for eternal salvation. That was wrong. Paul, however, did not have the attitude of merely solving this problem in Antioch. Rather, he, Barnabas, and some others went to Jerusalem to get the problem solved by all the churches. That decision eventually became an epistle written by the apostles and elders. This epistle was not designated as being written by the Gentile and Jewish apostles and by the Gentile and Jewish elders. Acts 15 says that it was written simply by the apostles and the elders (v. 23), including the apostles and elders of both the Jewish and Gentile churches. They were considered as one. We have to see this.</P><P>The churches in the Gentile world also had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in supplying the physical need (Rom. 15:25-27). The apostle Paul was endeavoring to raise up financial help, physical help, from the Gentile saints for the Jewish saints. In this fellowship they were considered as one, but I do not think our attitude today is like this. Sometimes we help other churches, but there is the consideration that we have to take care of the need of the local churches in our area first. If we have some surplus, then we will consider giving something to other churches. But Paul's practice was not like this. Paul knew that the saints in Macedonia were in poverty, yet he still encouraged them to give. Their giving was their fellowship of concern to help the churches in the Jewish world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Paul, Who Worked in the Gentile World,<br>Being Concerned for the Church in Jerusalem</H2><P>Furthermore, Paul, who worked in the Gentile world, was concerned for the church in Jerusalem (Rom. 16:1-4; Acts 19:21; 20:16; 21:12-13, 17-19). He had a heavy burden to help the church in Jerusalem to enter into God's New Testament economy. Although the Spirit inspired the saints to warn him not to go to Jerusalem, he said that he did not care for his life. He had purposed in his spirit to go there. No doubt, he went there with a burden to help the saints get out of the law in the Old Testament economy and enter into the New Testament economy of God to have the church. This shows us again that the regions of the work should not divide the churches. I called a number of urgent elders' meetings beginning in 1984 because I realized that there was the tendency of division among us. If we know the Body of Christ, however, we cannot be divided.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Peter, Who Worked in the Jewish World,<br>Being Accepted by the Church in Corinth<br>in the Gentile World</H2><P>Peter, who worked in the Jewish world, was also accepted by the church in Corinth in the Gentile world (1 Cor. 1:12; Gal. 2:9). His teaching, his work, was accepted by the church in Corinth. Otherwise, some of them would not have been able to say that they were of Cephas. Since some of the Corinthian saints said this, that is a strong evidence that Peter's ministry and teaching were accepted by the Gentile world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Co-workers in the Jewish World<br>and Those in the Gentile World Having<br>Pleasant and Sweet Fellowship with One Another</H2><P>The co-workers in the Jewish world and those in the Gentile world had pleasant and sweet fellowship with one another. Galatians 2:8 and 9 record that Paul and Barnabas had fellowship with James, Cephas, and John. They did not consider themselves to be separated from one another. They considered themselves as one in the divine fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Apollos Being Received and Accepted<br>by the Brothers in the Gentile World</H2><P>Apollos was received and accepted by the brothers in the Gentile world (Acts 18:24; 19:1a; 1 Cor. 1:12; 4:6; 16:12).</P><P>In the light of this fellowship, we need to realize that our present situation is not so scriptural. I picked up all the above points to present a portrait of the situation at the time of the early apostles. The churches were all one in the Spirit and in practice, but it is not so much like this today among us.</P><P>All the above points show that all the co-workers in all the regions should do the same one work universally for the unique Body. We should do only one work. There should not be several works in the Lord's recovery. In the past there were several works in the recovery. This is still lingering among us. There is the risk and the danger that these different works will issue in divisions. We have to consider our present situation so that we can eliminate the number of works. The work should be just one. Even Paul and Peter did not carry out two works. Even though they worked in different regions, they had only one work to build up the Body of Christ.</P><P>I am concerned that in the Lord's recovery, the brothers in a certain country may consider that the work there is their work. Then some brothers in another country may consider that the work there is their work. Thus, we have many works. This shows that our situation today is abnormal, yet probably not many of us have the sensation of abnormality in the recovery. There is a practical situation that is abnormal, and the biggest point of this abnormality is the different works.</P><P>I hope that we will consider our present situation before the Lord. Are we doing the same one work for the recovery? If not, we should let the Lord have the freedom to adjust us. Thank the Lord that due to the riches of the truth, the Lord's recovery is being welcomed everywhere on the earth. In the Lord's move in His recovery, there should only be one work, not different works. Our situation is different from this. We have different works without any consciousness. This is dangerous.</P><P>In Paul's time, because of the lack of modern transportation and communication, it would have been logical to have the work divided. However, there was only one work. Today the globe has been made small by modern conveniences. All the modern conveniences have made the globe just like a city. Despite this we do not have one work but many works. If we stay in this situation, a negative result may come out eventually. We do have an existing problem among us. I hope that we would reconsider our situation.</P><P>The two problems that are bothering me very much concern the eldership and the number of works. In the eldership all the brothers in the different age groups have to deal with the Lord concerning their pride, their thought of being a hero, and their opinions. The different works also need to be eliminated. As long as we have these two problems, the recovery cannot be that healthy or that prevailing. We must look to the Lord that these two things will be absent among us. Then I assure you that the recovery will be healthy and prevailing, and the increase surely will come. Furthermore, even in life, the standard, the level, will be greatly uplifted.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>KEEPING THE ONENESS<br>OF THE BODY AND MAINTAINING<br>A GOOD ORDER IN THE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:1-3; 5:21; 1 Pet. 5:5; Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom. 15:6</H1><P>In this message we want to see more concerning knowing the Body. If we want to be those who are in the practicality of the Body, we need to keep the oneness of the Body and maintain a good order in the Body. Although the verses in the Scripture reading may be familiar to us, I would like to point out two of them. Ephesians 5:21 says, "Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ." First Peter 5:5 says, "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders, and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble."</P><P>In the previous message, I touched three problems that have been among us&#151;pride (mostly among the young people), heroism (mostly among the middle-aged), and opinions (mostly among the older ones). In our fellowship in this message, we want to address a few problems which have been existing among us for years. Until these problems are solved and removed, the church life will not have much peace, and the recovery will be greatly devastated. We expect to have the proper increase and the growth in life. But due to these problems, the church has been greatly limited in the increase and delayed in the growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO CARE FOR<br>THE ONENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>Throughout the years, we have found out that regardless of how much we teach about the oneness of the Body, some among us would not take care of this oneness. When I was in the Lord's work in mainland China, I saw a number of turmoils. Thank the Lord that I was preserved from any involvement in these turmoils. Eventually, the Lord sent me to Taiwan. In Taiwan there was one serious turmoil which took place from 1957 to 1965. In 1978 we had a turmoil in the recovery in the United States. Then nine years later, in 1987, we had a second turmoil. This turmoil is still lingering among us. It has not altogether passed away. Because of this, I want us to see the root of this problem. The source, or the root, of this present turmoil is the carelessness in our regard for the oneness of the Body. We have taught much concerning the Body, and we have printed many books concerning the Body, but when a certain situation arises, not many would take care of the Body. To take care of the Body is to take care of the oneness. If the oneness is gone, the Body is finished. No oneness&#151;no Body. The Body can only exist and survive in the oneness.</P><P>Today in all of Christianity, the reality of the Body is absent because there is no oneness. In the Catholic Church there is a so-called oneness that is humanly manufactured. The word catholic means universally one. This so-called oneness has been maintained by the organizational papal system. This is a man-made, manufactured oneness. This is not the real oneness. After Luther was raised up by the Lord, the state, or national, churches were eventually formed, such as the Church of Germany, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Denmark, the Church of Norway, and the Church of England. Through the formation of these national churches and the Protestant denominations, the oneness was slaughtered. Because the Lord's seeking ones realized that the Catholic Church and the national churches were off, they tried their best to keep the truth which they had seen and to recover this truth. As a result, division after division was continually formed. Based upon this principle, the Presbyterian church came into existence because some desired to keep the truth of the presbytery. This is the truth concerning the churches being managed and administrated under a group of elders. The Baptists saw the truth of baptism by immersion, so they formed the Baptist church. Even the Baptists are divided among themselves. Today there are the Southern Baptists, the American Baptists, and the Conservative Baptists. There are many, many so-called private churches today. There are also many free groups.</P><P>In the eighteenth century, Zinzendorf took the lead in the recovery of the initial stage of the church life in the unity of the Holy Spirit. In the nineteenth century, the British Brethren were raised up by the Lord, and they saw many truths. However, they were too occupied with doctrine according to the letter. Due to this, they were divided. The first division among them took place because of a disagreement between Darby and Newton over the person of Christ and over the rapture and second coming of Christ.</P><P>Another problem among the Brethren was concerning whether or not the recovered church should receive those saints who still remained in the denominations. George Muller felt that these saints should be received. He pointed out that some who remained in the denominations, such as Hudson Taylor, were spiritual, seeking after the Lord, and living a high standard of the Christian life. Hudson Taylor tried his best to avoid the formation of another denomination. The China Inland Mission which he formed was a mission established for going into the interior of China to save sinners. Despite what Hudson Taylor endeavored to do, China Inland Mission churches were eventually formed, established, and built up. Thus, according to the view of the Brethren, Hudson Taylor formed another denomination. Darby argued that such people might be spiritual, but because they still remained in the denominations, they had to be called evil companions. This debate concerning the receiving of the saints caused further division among the Brethren.</P><P>At this point in our fellowship concerning knowing the Body, I would like to add a word concerning those saints whom the Lord used to recover the experiences of the inner life. Madame Guyon was the one who took the lead in this recovery in the seventeenth century. However, although she was so spiritual and in life, she still went to the image of Mary. The preface of her biography said something concerning her doing this. When we translated this biography into Chinese over fifty years ago, a brother among us had the thought of including this preface, but we did not agree with this. Her life with the Lord was very good, but the truth was not that complete to her. We could not publish such a preface in the Chinese version of her biography. I am sharing this to impress us that we should not trust in people's spirituality. Spirituality is conditional. How spiritual is it to be spiritual? If you say that someone is very good, how good is very good? You may be very spiritual today, but how will you be ten years later? Because spirituality is conditional, it should not be taken as a base or as a standard. The base and the standard must be the truth. The truth is not conditional. It is the fact.</P><P>In 1957 Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to us in Taiwan for the second time. We had a few sessions with him to talk about the matter of spirituality and the truth concerning the church. Dr. Chang Yu-lan, who is now with the Lord, pointed out that there were a number of meetings in Taipei all of which claimed to meet in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then he asked Brother Austin-Sparks which one of these meetings could be considered as the church in Taipei. Brother Austin-Sparks said strongly that the ones who have more of Christ are the ones who are more the church. At first I thought I should not be involved in this discussion, since I was the translator. Eventually, I realized that I had to say something; otherwise, the issue would not be resolved.</P><P>I pointed out that Christ is the element, the reality, and the center of the church. Because of this, we might mistakenly think that those who have more of Christ are more the church. Although this seems to be correct, I showed that this was wrong. I pointed out the example of Madame Guyon. She had much of Christ, but she still remained in the Catholic Church. Could we say that because she had much of Christ, she was right concerning the church? Then I pointed out how Brother Austin-Sparks referred to F.B. Meyer in his messages. Although F.B. Meyer was very spiritual, he still remained in a denomination. He worked for and built up that denomination. Could we say that because Brother Meyer had much of Christ, he was right concerning the church? My speaking refuted what Brother Austin-Sparks said. My illustrations showed that we should not say that the more of Christ you have, the more you are the church.</P><P>Brother Austin-Sparks visited us in Taiwan in 1955 and in 1957. He took many pictures during his first visit and he showed these slides to people when he returned to England. He said that in his entire life, he never had such a marvelous congregation as he had in Taiwan. He visited us again in 1957, and this is when the problem with him arose over the truth concerning the ground of the church. When he returned he told people that I was too much for the church ground. I told people, however, that I was not yet enough for the church ground. The church should be measured by the ground of locality and by the reality of the Spirit of oneness. It should not be measured by people's spirituality. Spirituality is relative and conditional.</P><P>Brother Austin-Sparks's second visit to us created a big problem, and all the saints were tested. Some young co-workers who were raised up and taught by me were influenced by him. One of these young co-workers was even saved through me in Shanghai. They began to say that they just wanted Christ and did not care for the church. To just want Christ and not care for the church is divisive. Regardless of how much you care for Christ and have experienced Christ, if you meet in a way that does not care for the truth of the church, your meeting is a division.</P><P>These divisive ones proclaimed that they had seen the church in glory. They condemned me and some other brothers as old men who did not have visions. They felt that they had the vision. I had a long talk with them. I told them that if they did not take care of the truth concerning the church, especially the church ground, they would be divided again and again after they left the recovery. What I said to them came to pass.</P><P>I began to warn them in 1959, and we tolerated them until 1965. During those years, they were causing trouble among the churches. The leading brothers wrote me a letter in 1965 asking me to return to Taiwan from the United States to solve this problem. They said that I was the only person who had the ground, the position, and the right to deal with this problem because the work in Taiwan was started by the Lord through me. I eventually returned to Taiwan in 1965, and this problem with these rebellious ones was solved.</P><P>How can such things take place among us? They can take place because the ones involved do not care for the Body, for the oneness. Regardless of how many visions someone has seen, he has no right to build up any division. I hope that we all can see this. Paul and Peter encountered the trouble concerning circumcision recorded in Acts 15, but they did not have any division. They tried their best to get the problem solved in order to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ, that is, the oneness of all the local churches in both the Jewish and Gentile territories. Thus, the churches kept the oneness, and there was no division. In 1987 rebellion and division began to occur with certain ones among us. Even if the accusations they made were true, however, that cannot be built up as a case to justify their division. One leading brother asked one of these rebellious ones about their meeting as a division in Anaheim. This one said that he would remove this division from Anaheim. But it does not matter where it is removed to. Wherever it is, it is still a division.</P><P>I must testify in honesty that I have been commissioned by the Lord to carry His truth and bring His recovery to the United States. The recovery is based upon the truth that Christ has only one Body. Even if these divisive ones move to a city in which there is not a church, they have to be checked concerning what kind of relationship they have with the other churches. One of the tests of a genuine local church is that it should have universal fellowship with all the other local churches.</P><P>When these dissenting ones came to me, I told them that regardless of what they did, I would not make any division or set up new churches. But I also told them that I would not tolerate anything that was against the truth. Later, they began to say that once an apostle establishes churches and appoints elders in them, he should keep his hands off of these churches. I pointed out that Paul did not keep his hands off of the church in Ephesus. He established the church in Ephesus, appointed elders there, and went back to Ephesus. He stayed there at one time for three and a half years (Acts 20:17, 31). When he could not go to them personally, he wrote to them (Eph. 1:1). How could the apostles be commissioned only to set up the churches without building them up? This is altogether illogical and unscriptural.</P><P>When I shared this, they had no ground to teach concerning the so-called autonomy of a local church as put forth by G.H. Lang in his book The Churches of God. The church is not an organization that can practice autonomy. Even the United States, a nation of organization, cannot have absolute autonomy. In this country, the states do not have an autonomous defense, diplomacy, or postal system. The postal system, the diplomacy, and the defense of the country are national matters. Even in a nation like the United States, absolute autonomy cannot be practiced. The ones in this recent rebellion taught this because they wanted me to stay away from the churches. Their teaching issued in division.</P><P>Later, one of them said that there was not only one apostle but also a number of apostles. He said that he could present a list of the brothers among us who were apostles. Another brother asked him for this list. All of the ones on this list had been my students. After this I went to Taiwan and gave a message on the different kinds of apostles (see chapter two of A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need&#151;pp. 21-29). Because of what I presented, they changed and said that there were only twelve apostles&#151;eleven plus Paul. They said that the one selected in Acts 1, Matthias, was a wrong one. This was the old teaching of the Brethren. We knew this and rejected it many years ago. Brother Nee rejected this wrong teaching in The Normal Christian Church Life (see chapter one&#151;pp. 20-38). When they got to know this, they eventually said that there were no apostles. I said in the past that all the saints could function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. This shows that the ones involved in this recent rebellion do not care for the truth. They do not care for the oneness, for the Body of Christ. We should not do anything without taking care of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit</H2><P>To keep the oneness of the Body is actually to keep the oneness of the Spirit because the Spirit is the reality and the essence of the Body. Paul says in Ephesians 4:3 that we should keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. Christ has abolished on the cross all the differences due to ordinances. In so doing, He has made peace for His Body. This peace should bind all believers together, thus becoming the uniting bond. There should never be any kind of fighting within the church. We need to keep the oneness by remaining in the uniting bond of peace.</P><P>Ephesians 4:2 says that we need to keep the oneness with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love. Lowliness is to remain in a low estate, and meekness is not to fight for oneself. We should have these two virtues in dealing with ourselves. Longsuffering is to endure mistreatment. We should have this virtue in dealing with others. By these virtues we bear one another. You have to bear me, and I have to bear you. This is what it means to walk worthily of the Lord's calling (Eph. 4:1b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Division Annulling the Body and the Recovery</H2><P>Any division annuls the Body. If the Body is annulled, the oneness is killed. Then the recovery is gone. What is the Lord's recovery? The Lord's recovery is the recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAINTAINING A GOOD ORDER IN THE BODY</H2><P>In addition to keeping the oneness of the Body, we need to maintain a good order in the Body. The church is the highest entity in the universe with the top standard. Thus, we need to have a beautiful, pleasant order among us. If there is a problem among us, we have to take care of it in a biblical way. When a problem arose concerning circumcision, Paul and the brothers with him took care of it in the proper way. Acts 15 speaks of their going to see the brothers in Jerusalem. They came together in a proper way to give testimonies and to seek the Lord's leading. Eventually, the decision was made through Peter by James. Through Peter's testimony and by James's word, a conclusion was reached. They said that this conclusion seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to them (v. 28). This shows that the conclusion reached was by them and by the Spirit. This is the right way to solve a problem in the churches. We need to come together properly, pray, study the Word, and make a decision. By taking care of Christ and by taking care of His Body, we will avoid division, keep the oneness, and maintain a good order in the Body. I feel I must say this because another turmoil may suddenly rise up among us. We should not repeat anything of the past. Let us come together with an open spirit to pray together, get into the Word, and check our situation with the Word in fellowship. Then we can get a divine answer. This is the right way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Subject to One Another<br>in the Fear of Christ</H2><P>To keep a pleasant, good, and beautiful order in the recovery, we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ (Eph. 5:21). Not only should the younger ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the younger ones (1 Pet. 5:5). The elders should not be a special class in the church. Peter charges them not to lord it over the church (v. 3). On the other hand, the saints should respect the elders. The younger ones should respect the older ones, and the older ones should also respect the younger ones. The wives should respect the husbands, and the husbands should also respect the wives. Our subjection with respect is a mutual thing.</P><P>Not being subject to one another offends Christ as the Head. Actually, not being subject to one another is rebellion against the Head. This means that we have no fear of Christ in His headship. Paul tells us that we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ, who is the Head. Only the Head is superior. Only the Head should be unique and different from the Body. None of the members, even the apostle Paul, is in a special or super class.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Subject to One Another<br>Being the Way to Keep the One Accord</H2><P>Being subject to one another is the way to keep the one accord (Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom. 15:6). Even if your way is better, you should still take the other brother's way. Otherwise, there will be no one accord. If you are going to a place which has previously been under the work of some other co-workers, you should find out what has been taught by them. Then you should go along with them. If you do not care for what they have taught or done in the past and teach according to your preference, you will make trouble. We should always try to maintain a good, beautiful, nice, and pleasant order among us.</P><P>In February 1986 when I spoke concerning the one accord, I said that if some did not choose to take the God-ordained way, they should not criticize or oppose it. Otherwise, they would cause division. Thank the Lord that the church in Taipei has been fully turned to the God-ordained way. This turn was made after seven years of labor and ministry. When I returned to Taipei in 1984, we did not change the way to have the church meetings until more than three years later. Then we realized that the time was right to change from the way of one man speaking and the rest listening. We began to have a prophesying meeting, in which every attendant has equal opportunity to speak for the Lord. Thank the Lord that the majority of the saints in Taipei accepted this God-ordained way.</P><P>No one can deny that having a good speaker speak every Lord's Day helps people to a certain extent, but the annulling and killing of the saints' function is hidden in this practice. If someone takes the way of one man speaking and the rest listening for more than ten years, the ones under his speaking, who received much help, will be annulled in their function and their capacity of speaking for the Lord. Now that we are practicing the God-ordained way, many new ones among us are being raised up in a proper way to be functioning members of the Body of Christ.</P><P>For conferences or trainings, it is all right to have the ministry of the word. But for a brother to speak and the rest listen every Lord's Day in the church meetings annuls the functioning of the saints. Furthermore, everyone enjoys hearing the new ones speak. We like to hear them say something about Christ in their fresh way. If only a few brothers speak all the time, the riches in all the members of the Body of Christ cannot be released. In the God-ordained way, all the riches of Christ come out through His members. Then the church meetings are like a love feast with many different portions of food.</P><P>We need to drop the system of one man speaking and the rest listening and take the God-ordained way of having the church meetings in mutuality. The age has changed, and the tide of the Lord's move is here among us. If some try to maintain the old way, they will cause trouble, and eventually, they will be sifted. All the churches are endeavoring to fully enter into the God-ordained way. We do not want to see anyone go back to the old way. This will create trouble. I hope that we can all have a real turn to the new way, the God-ordained way. This is the tide of the Lord's move today, and we have no choice except to follow Him according to His way.</P><P>After passing through many experiences throughout the years, I feel that today is the most golden time. The entire world, especially eastern Europe and Russia, is open to the truths which have been released in the Lord's recovery. We need to learn the lessons from our past history so that we do not repeat the negative things. We have seen from the training on Zechariah that when the Lord comes back, the remnant of Israel will have learned the lessons. They will be empty and ready to take Christ as everything. We should learn to take care of Christ, His Body, and the truth. If we take care of these three things properly, there will be no problems. We should not let anything frustrate us from these three things. We should not take in anything or care for anything but Christ, His Body&#151;the church, and the truth.</P><P>As we take the Lord's new way to build up the church, we will be greatly blessed. We will enjoy the Lord as our rain much more than we did in the past (Zech. 10:1; Hosea 6:3). I hope that we will rise up to drop everything other than Christ and to carry Christ as our ark, to carry the Body of Christ as our tabernacle, and to follow the truth as our pillar of fire in the night and our pillar of cloud in the day. The past turmoils should be warnings and lessons to us. We do not want to repeat these things or be influenced by them. We have Christ, we have the church, and we have the truth. Let us go on in this way.</P><P>We need to maintain a good order in the Body by being subject to one another. Then we will keep the one accord without criticizing, without despising, and without opposing. We should respect one another, help one another, perfect one another in life, and complete one another in work. We should never despise or criticize others. Instead, we should always receive the help from others and return help to them. We want to be perfected and to perfect others. We should not think that our work is complete or consummate. We should want to be completed and helped by others. Then we can help others to complete their work. If we take this way, we will be greatly blessed by the Lord's dear, sweet presence. Then at His coming back we will be rewarded, and we will be His bride to match Him and to fight the war against Antichrist.</P><P>After the recent training on Daniel and Zechariah, the view in the Bible, the divine revelation, is so clear to us. Nothing counts and everything is vanity except God's economy with Christ as the center, the hub, and as the circumference, the rim, making us His members to constitute His Body and preparing us to be His bride so that we can return with Him to defeat Antichrist and his followers to bring in the kingdom of God as the great mountain which will fill the whole earth. This is the ultimate end of the divine revelation in the Bible. Since we have seen this, we should spontaneously forget everything in the past. We should go on with our Christ, who is God's centrality and universality, so that we can fulfill His heart's desire.</P></body></html>
