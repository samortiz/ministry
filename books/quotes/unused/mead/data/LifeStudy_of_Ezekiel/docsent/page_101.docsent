   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO BOILING PLACES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the end, toward the rear, there are the boiling places, two places for the priests to boil their offerings and to bake the meal offerings 46:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are the priestly kitchens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kitchens for the people are at the four corners of the outer court, but the kitchens for the priests are these two places within the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE LAND SURROUNDING THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the measuring of the temple was completed, Ezekiel was brought outside the compound of the temple, where the man measured the land outside the wall 42:15-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In each direction the measurement of the land was not five hundred cubits but five hundred reeds vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One reed equals six cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the land outside the wall is three thousand cubits square, making a total of nine million square cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, only an area in the center five hundred cubits square was used, leaving a wide, spacious land surrounding the temple compound.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Strong Impression of Separation</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The design of the temple gives a strong impression of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The wall around the spacious piece of land separated what was holy from what was common.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Altogether, there were at least four walls: the wall around the entire lot, the wall around the outer court, the wall around the inner court, and the wall around the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These walls enclosed the temple, separating the holy from the common.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This reveals that when a person enters the temple, he has passed a fourfold separation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What a great margin of separation there is!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On every side of the temple compound, there is a spacious suburb of one thousand two hundred fifty cubits reaching to the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates the spaciousness of the separation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An Impression of Progression</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The design of the temple also gives an impression of progression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The further we advance inward, the higher we become.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are in the temple, we are fifteen cubits higher than ground level.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Also, the higher we become, the broader and wider we become.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Inward, higher, broader, wider this is progression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This experience of the holy building of God is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>An Impression of Balance</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, in the appearance of the temple there is a clear impression of balance, of symmetry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this design nothing is unbalanced or crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything is fully balanced, square, and upright.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nothing is crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A Picture of the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a picture of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church life is a life of absolute separation, a life of progression, and a life of balance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church life is upright, square, and straight.</S>
