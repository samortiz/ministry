<li>Gleanings in the vast field of God&rsquo;s grace:
	<ol class="decimal" start="20">
	<li>The grace that was to come unto the believers, which was prophesied by the prophets, who sought and searched diligently concerning the salvation of the believers&rsquo; souls&mdash;1 Pet. 1:10.</li>
	<li>The grace on which the believers set their hope perfectly and which will be brought to the believers at the revelation of Jesus Christ&mdash;1:13.</li>
	<li>The grace with God which is the believers&rsquo; bearing sorrows by suffering unrighteously and the believers&rsquo; enduring while doing good and suffering&mdash;2:19-20.</li>
	<li>The grace which God gives to the humble while He resists the proud&mdash;5:5.</li>
	<li>The grace in which, together with the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the believers should grow unto His glory both now and unto the day of eternity&mdash;2 Pet. 3:18.</li>
	<li>This is the concluding word of the apostle Peter&rsquo;s writings, indicating that whatever he has written is of, in, by, and through the grace of God.</li>
	<li>The grace which we the believers have received in the New Testament is rich unto its fullness, which is the expression of the overflowing riches which we have received in Christ through the Spirit for the accomplishment of God the Father&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is His eternal economy&mdash;John 1:16.</li>
	<li>The grace given to the local churches in the dark age of the church&rsquo;s degradation is for the believers who seek to answer the Lord&rsquo;s calling to be His overcomers over the self (Matt. 16:24), the devil (Heb. 2:14), sin (Rom. 5:21a), the cosmos of Satan (John 12:31), satanic Judaism (Rev. 3:9), demonic Catholicism (Rev. 2:20, 24), and Christless Protestantism (Rev. 3:1b, 20) for the closing of all the ages and for the bringing in of the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 1:4. This indicates that grace reigns unto eternal life (Rom. 5:21b).</li>
	<li>The grace of the Lord Jesus dispensed to His believers throughout the New Testament age consummates in the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s good pleasure in joining and mingling Himself with man for His glorious enlargement and eternal expression&mdash;Rev. 22:21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>A concluding word:</li>
	<li>The New Testament is a history of the grace of God as the incarnation of the Triune God in His Trinity processed and consummated.</li>
	</ol></li>

<p>In this message we want to see the gleanings of grace from Peter&rsquo;s writings and John&rsquo;s writings. The New Testament was written mainly by three apostles. I do not say <em>only</em> but <em>mainly</em> by three apostles: John, Paul, and Peter. According to the New Testament record, the earlier speakers were Peter and John. The later speaker was Paul. In Acts there are these three main speakers. Apollos and Barnabas also taught, but there is no record of their messages.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles are the center and the frame of grace, but we need Peter and John to complete the truth concerning grace. In Paul&rsquo;s writings there are the center and the frame but not the beginning and the ending of grace. The beginning and ending of grace are covered by John. Peter&rsquo;s writings cover a number of points which were not covered by Paul, and these are also very important.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_082.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_084.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Epistle to the Romans &nbsp; pg 83</div><br></body></html>
